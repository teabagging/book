I've always liked his writing style - flows freely, easily understood without being simplistic, and tells it like it is.Billy Graham does not mince words - unlike some preachers, he readily acknowledges the evil and sin in this world. Thankfully, he does not stop there and takes one step further and presents the solution - Jesus Christ!Among the topics covered include:1. Reality of a world in pain.2. God's amazing love for us as shown through Jesus Christ.3. Why Jesus had to suffer for us.4. The cost of discipleship.5. Why we sometimes have to suffer.6. What to do when you hurt.7. How we can hurt those who are hurting (remember, God wants to use your pain to minister to others!)A great read.

Put these books in the right line up.WHISPER MY LOVE by Gayle Wilson, is #2 of the \\"Home To Texas\\" series.This is the story of Rio Delgado, the illigimate son of Drew McCullar [the old goat]and half-brother to Mac and Chase McCullar.He spent 5 years of his life in prison because he wanted Chase to warn Mac about an attempt on Mac's life.Getting out of prison and with nowhere to go Rio unconciously heads for Mac's ranch. Chase was fit to be tied that Rio was allowed out on parole.He ends up meeting Anne Richardson, sister to the man that is courting Jenny McCullar, Mac's wife. Rio is looking for his black stallion [loved this part of the story - a bit of a mystery].Anne is staying at the McCullar ranch while Jenny goes to the big city with Trent Richardson, the Texas state senator, along with her shepard, Rommell.What with a baby being born and Doc Horn's murder, Rio is in deep trouble. Yet because of Doc's faith in Rio, Anne learns to also trust him.Someone gets the people worked up against Rio and tries to get him killed, Rio is in bad shape.Finally a few comments from Anne starts Chase thinking that he may have been wrong about Rio's involvement in the murders [smart gal].Jenny takes Rio in to give him a chance to heal and slowly gains faith in him too.You don't look on this story so much as a mystery as just getting involved with people that have problems.

The characters have both been deeply wounded in the past, and only through their love can they find healing. Of course, first they have to deal with angry mobs and family strife. Rio is a great hero, and though Anne's trauma isn't dealt with nearly as much as Rio's, she has a great scene where she faces down the sheriff that made me want to cheer. They're both people you can really root for, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I got a little misty-eyed toward the end. By far, the best of Wilson's &quot;Home to Texas&quot; trilogy.

He was hit in the head by a pitch and has never been able to recover enough nerve to stand in there when the pitches come close. By playing in obscure locations and never staying long in one place, he is able to do well before the opposition can learn his weakness.While on a bus journey between jobs, he happens to see Ad Preston, a high school senior on the mound. Frank immediately recognizes his talent and travels to see the boy. He speaks with him and his family and has a power of attorney agreement drawn up that pays him nothing. Ad, his mother and his sister Ivy trust Frank and under his guidance, Ad is signed to a major league contract with a significant bonus. However, Ad is still a small-town boy, so Frank goes with him and acts as his personal catcher.The players recognize Frank and opposing the pitchers begin to throw near him, causing him to bail out. When Frank decides to give up, Ad is devastated and can no longer pitch effectively. Finally, when Ad is down to his last chance, Frank is able to conquer his fear and stands in to get the hit that wins a crucial ballgame.We all have fears, some more significant than others and some that are very difficult to overcome. Many times, we are able to conquer our fears when someone we care about needs assistance. That is what happens in this excellent story about baseball, a young man that needs a mentor and a man who can do that if he can only conquer his greatest fear."},{"Title":"Study Guide and Solutions Manual to Accompany Fundamentals of Behavioral Statistics","review":"A unique introductory book in statistics.

Just as there is a genre of science fiction known as \\"hard\\" sci-fi, as typified by the works of Hal Clement and Larry Niven, this novel impresses me as a \\"hard\\" fantasy novel. Not only do authors deCamp and Pratt usher us into Fairyland, and show us the court of Oberon and Titania, but we are also shown all manner of elves, sprites, nymphs, fairies, ogres, kobolds and the like; even a leprechaun and a unicorn are thrown into the mix.This journey into the fantastic begins when Fred Barber--an American vice-consul in Spain who has been injured during World War II and who is convalescing on the Yorkshire moors--impulsively drinks the milk that his hostess has superstitiously left for the fairies on St. John's Eve. He is kidnapped by a fairy named Sneckett and brought to Oberon's palace, where he is given the task of going to the Kobold Hills and preventing the kobolds from making metallic swords (a substance that no fairy can touch). Thus, Barber begins his picaresque wanderings, and the reader is propelled into a very strange world indeed. Fairyland has been going through a series of so-called \\"shapings\\"; even the normally bizarre physical laws of the realm don't apply anymore. In his travels, Barber encounters a talking whirlwind, an apple-tree sprite, a monster from a plum tree, and two-headed eagles. He resides for a while with a marooned, 19th century farmer from New England, and is transformed into a frog and, later, a batlike creature, all leading to his ultimate transformation. The reader will never be able to guess where the story is going next; it's one darn thing after another for poor Fred Barber, as he tries to find his way back home.Perhaps I have not adequately suggested, in this capsule description, what a very strange book \\"Land of Unreason\\" is. At times I was reminded of Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"; at others, of David Lindsay's weird-in-the-extreme \\"A Voyage to Arcturus.\\" All feature crazy worlds where the physical laws of our reality are in abeyance; all feature strange characters and even stranger events. \\"Land of Unreason\\" even pays homage to Carroll's work, in making Titania's footmen liveried frogs. This is one very bizarre book indeed.I should also point out to prospective readers of \\"Land of Unreason\\" that both deCamp and Pratt were history buffs, and that perhaps the most impressive single aspect of this novel is the seemingly authentic medieval manner in which the characters converse. The authors have obviously done their homework, to say the least. Readers of this book will run into many obscure Scottish words and archaic language, as well as loads of unusual English. This reader is a professional copy editor, and even I had to resort to an UNabridged dictionary repeatedly to look up words such as \\"nympholept,\\" \\"strappado,\\" \\"rounce,\\" \\"jobbernowl,\\" \\"equerry,\\" \\"yataghan,\\" \\"lambrequin,\\" \\"armet,\\" \\"thill,\\" \\"armigerous,\\" \\"anlace,\\" \\"cousin-german,\\" \\"alate,\\" \\"oriflamme,\\" \\"crapulous,\\" \\"catenary,\\" \\"pule,\\" \\"thrip,\\" \\"gramercy,\\" \\"widdershins,\\" \\"adossed,\\" \\"barry-wavy,\\" \\"stirk,\\" \\"wight,\\" \\"springald,\\" \\"bedad\\" and \\"metic,\\" among others. The book is a challenge in this respect, but, as always, a little research on the part of the reader will be repaid with a deeper appreciation. On the down side, \\"Land of Unreason\\" contains many plot points that lead nowhere, and the denouement--for me, anyway--is something of a letdown. This reader was thoroughly entertained while reading the book, but was ultimately left with the feeling that he'd read a piece of well-crafted piffle. I should perhaps also mention that this novel has been included in James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock's overview volume \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" I'm not sure that it deserves inclusion, but it certainly does make for one strange ride."},{"Title":"Land of unreason","review":"Fred Barber is an American diplomat posted to the U.S. embassy in Spain at the beginning of World War 2. Although the U.S. is still a neutral country Barber is wounded in an explosion and sent to the British countryside to recuperate. From his temporary billet in Yorkshire, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Gurton, Barber can hear the German bombs shattering the near-by city of Leeds. At nighttime the sky glows red in the distance where the city burns. Unable to relax or sleep easily Barber uses sleeping pills to nurse himself into a calmer state. Then on St John's Eve Barber finds himself in the house alone, except for the Gurton's baby who sleeps in his room peacefully. Determined not to resort to pills again Barber reaches instead for the scotch bottle. Wandering around the house Barber comes upon a saucer of milk, which Mrs. Gurton has left on the front doorstep. Intrigued Barber remembers that he has read inThe Golden Boughthat superstitious people believe that on certain nights of the year a tribute of milk should be left out for the fairies. Not to do so will result in the child of the household being stolen away and a changeling left in its place. In a slightly tipsy state Barber is amused by his find. He decides to drink the milk and leave his scotch in its place. The milk has a soporific effect and Barber happily goes to bed. In the middle of the night Barber thinks he dreams of a strange creature, with a huge smile, entering his room. Later in the night Barber awakes and finds himself out of doors in a very strange land surrounded by a crowd of very strange beings. Much to his surprise Barber finds that he has been transported to Fairyland, to the court of King Oberon and Queen Titania. Just how did he get here, Barber wonders, and how is he going to get back to Yorkshire?The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung taught that we should play more attention to dreams, myths, folktales and stories of the extraordinary. These fantastic narrations are often dismissed as 'mere fancy', of no value except to entertain children and the weak-minded. But according to Jung the fantastic appeals to the unconscious. It provides an outlet for the less logical, more intuitive, side of ourselves. The unconscious is often neglected and suppressed in our ultra-logical, materialist, conscious world. If ignored for too long our unconscious will break out in rebellion, resulting in psychological disturbance. So if you find the stress of modern life too much De Camp and Pratt's book may be just what the doctor ordered. The authors have drawn heavily on folklore to create a strange, dream-like world that is entertaining, intriguing and sure to make you smile. The book is called &lt;The Land of Unreason> and this is indeed a place where worker-day logic does not hold. The unconscious can find plenty of events here that don't obey conscious reason, but none-the-less have an intuitive rightness, a hidden order of their own. This is certainly not a book for children. The hero is an adult who has a cynical, tempestuous girlfriend back in Spain. King Oberon dallies with a beautiful, winged sprite, his lover, who he hides from his wife. The pleasures and pains of adult life are clearly depicted. This is a book to delight the adult unconscious mind.The plot of the novel moves along very nicely and is never dull. We meet a great array of characters most of who are disconcerting in their unreasonableness. As Barber travels through Fairyland he looses some of his conscious up-tightness and enters into the spirit of the intuitive unconscious. This is certainly not a book of Nobel Prize winning themes, inspiring symbolism or astounding structure, but it is very successful in what it sets out to do.Of course most books have their source in earlier works and this tale is clearly inspired in part by Lewis Carroll'sAlice In Wonderland(1865) andThrough the Looking-Glass(1872) and Charles Kingsley'sThe Water-Babies (a Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby)(1863).

These fantastic narrations are often dismissed as 'mere fancy', of no value except to entertain children and the weak-minded. But according to Jung the fantastic appeals to the unconscious. It provides an outlet for the less logical, more intuitive, side of ourselves. The unconscious is often neglected and suppressed in our ultra-logical, materialist, conscious world. If ignored for too long our unconscious will break out in rebellion, resulting in psychological disturbance. So if you find the stress of modern life too much De Camp and Pratt's book may be just what the doctor ordered. The authors have drawn heavily on folklore to create a strange, dream-like world that is entertaining, intriguing and sure to make you smile. The book is called &lt;The Land of Unreason> and this is indeed a place where worker-day logic does not hold. The unconscious can find plenty of events here that don't obey conscious reason, but none-the-less have an intuitive rightness, a hidden order of their own. This is certainly not a book for children. The hero is an adult who has a cynical, tempestuous girlfriend back in Spain. King Oberon dallies with a beautiful, winged sprite, his lover, who he hides from his wife. The pleasures and pains of adult life are clearly depicted. This is a book to delight the adult unconscious mind.The plot of the novel moves along very nicely and is never dull. We meet a great array of characters most of who are disconcerting in their unreasonableness. As Barber travels through Fairyland he looses some of his conscious up-tightness and enters into the spirit of the intuitive unconscious. This is certainly not a book of Nobel Prize winning themes, inspiring symbolism or astounding structure, but it is very successful in what it sets out to do.Of course most books have their source in earlier works and this tale is clearly inspired in part by Lewis Carroll'sAlice In Wonderland(1865) andThrough the Looking-Glass(1872) and Charles Kingsley'sThe Water-Babies (a Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby)(1863). De Camp and Pratt clearly declare their indebtedness to these earlier books in the text of their own work."},{"Title":"Land of unreason","review":"I have always loved the work of L.

It blends corn-ball platitudes and insightful passages effortlessly in both poem and prose."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero","review":"Ludwig Moyzisch tells his true story almost like a novel for reality here surpasses fiction. From October 28, 1943 until April 1944, Nazi Germany did get from the spy \\"Cicero\\" an inside view of the series of Allied conferences. These conference were sealing Nazi Germany's fate and the one of its leaders at Moscow (Cordell Hull, Anthony Eden, Molotov), in Cairo (F. D. Roosevelt, W. Churchill, Chiang kai-Shek), and in Tehran (F. D. Roosevelt, W. Churchill, Stalin). They were also sealing the fate of millions of human beings trying to prevent them of sliding in the communist iron fist which had already started enslaving and killing more innocent people than the nazis themselves ever would.Cicero was personally handled by the author of the book, an attache at the German Embassy in Ankara (Turkey), who was paying the photos rolls (of documents from the British Ambassador's safe) for enormous sums.. in counterfeit Sterling Pounds. Contrary to the author's opinion, Cicero's photostats were taken very seriously in Berlin as, in December 1943, Hitler entered a conference with some of them stating that he knew for sure that the Allies would land in France by the end of the spring. He even knew the codename Overlord. Fortunately he didn't know the details.Moyzisch is trying to hide that he was not a diplomatic public servant but an employee of Walter Schellenberg the young star of the Amt VI of the nazi RSHA (head office of the Gestapo: its Amt IV) heading German political espionage and personally advising Himmler, the architect of the genocide of Jewish people. The facts however are otherwise delivered in a very lively manner, making a thriller of the book. Actually the story is so fascinating that, in 1952, Mankiewicz shot it in a film called \\"5 fingers\\", starring James Mason and Danielle Darrieux. It was a huge success and received several awards.Historians who tend to explain everything by the use of Ultra and Magic (the first deciphering computers) should realize that these fantastic tools, which actually helped win the war, didn't report the Allies anything about this fantastic spy case eventhough, for months, the Nazis exchanged cables after cables on the subject. For precious that these tools demonstrated to be, they didn't win the war: men sacrificing their lives did. Technology was a precious tool, but only a tool.It should also teach humility to all the historic spy-story writers, who tend to be conceited former officers of Allied secret services: the ennemy was not as stupid as they present it (or the war would not have costed so many lives) and our MI5, MI6 and COI/OSS had its share of naive high-ranking idiots, whose stupidity costed many precious lives as well.The book is short enough to remain pleasant all along, and is fascinating even for the ones who are not prone to study World War II history. For historians it is just a basic must."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero","review":"Good, but the semi-ficionalized movie from back in the 50's is better. It fleshes out the story nicely.

Such an approach is understandable, given that the development of the state is one of the major events of 16th century England. The key figure in this, as with so much else in Tudor history, is Henry VIII, whose innovations would be felt for the remainder of the century.Written with clarity and wit, Guy's book is the best single-volume history of the Tudor era.

At 119 pages of text, there is simply not much detail here for those who already own some investment property. I can't say I got one new idea from the book, and that's unusual.Yes, I do agree that 2+ -unit multi-family properties are your best investment, outperforming the stock market by a factor of 3x and with low risk. However, I do not agree with the author's premise that your best bet is to pay off all the mortgages on your properties within 10 years and then live off the cash flow. This is NOT a strategy most knowledgeable investors would follow. Why? Because the money you are using to make additional principal payments on your existing properties could instead be used to buy more buildings, or improve the ones you own, resulting in significantly higher after-tax gains in the long term.In reality, for the highest returns, your best bet is to leverage yourself to the max: Never put down more than 15% on a property, and try to put down the least amount you can and still get the property to \\"cash flow.\\" (Just make sure you keep a cash reserve in the bank equal to at least 3 months of expenses.) If you do have excess cash flow, spend it on those building improvements that will allow you to directly raise rents as a result. After 5 years, either re-finance the property to pull your equity out and invest that in a new property (and repeat every 5 years), or \\"flip\\" this property into a larger property and do this repeatedly every 5 years.Recommended reading instead of this book:1.) \\"The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing\\" by Martin Stone and Spencer Strauss.

I think this was for a couple of reasons. Davies denies the &quot;Teacher&quot; model as a primary explanation for who Jesus was and he posits that some of the Jesus sayings in the Gospel of John may stem from early sources and possibly Jesus himself. When I first read this book that latter contention rankled me. After all New Testament scholarship usually assumes all low christology to be early and high christology to be late. This works when we consider Mark the earliest gospel because Mark's Jesus is more human there than other gospel presentations of him. There is much good evidence that Mark is earlier than Matthew or Luke and that parts of John are late. The rub here is that Paul wrote before any of this and his christology is very high. It could be that parts of John come from a source or tradition that is early. Davies doesn't try to defend that here because that would be a book in itself and there is just not enough evidence, so far at least, to link pericopes from John to an earlier independent source or tradition. Davies view of the Historical Jesus as a spirit possessed healer brings to mind studies of primitive people and their various trance states. These trance like altered states of consciousness have been found in so many different primitive cultures even in modern times. Jesus's followers believed he had the spirit of god in him and later after his death they sought to have Jesus's spirit come into them and encouraged others to let Jesus's spirit enter them and dwell inside them. Historical Jesus books come and go and many,(most), are forgotten in a few years. I think perhaps this monograph by Davies just might be regarded as a classic some day."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"Given that alternate states of consciousness are associated with religions--whether examined cross-culturally or historically--it is somewhat surprising that the Jesus literature has ignored this fact. Until the publication of Davies's book, that is. Why this gaping hole in the literature? Either Jesus scholars have not read widely in the religion literature, or have themselves never experienced alternate states of consciousness--or both. I suspect that the second factor is the more important one--and reflects the fact that most Jesus scholars have come from a socio-economic class that precludes their having had much, if any, contact with contemporary pentecostalists.I read Davies's book several years ago (shortly after it was published), and the book sticks in my mind because I can't think of another book about Jesus that displays more creativity than Davies's book (not surprising given that creativity is not particularly welcomed in academia, &quot;normal&quot; research being what's prized, as Thomas S. Kuhn has argued). Granted that a creative book is not THEREBY a good book; but Davies's book IS a good book--and for two reasons.First, it makes a very plausible argument for a facet of Jesus's ministry that has been all but ignored by Jesus scholars. My main complaint is that Davies goes too far in arguing that he is presenting an ALTERNATE view of Jesus. I think, rather, that he should have stated that he was presenting a COMPLEMENTARY view--and then indicated how his particular puzzle piece fits into the larger picture of Jesus, as presented by critical scholars.Second, one of the problems of the dominant scholarly view of Jesus (that he was an apocalypic) is that it renders Jesus virtually irrelevant for the modern. For why should one today be interested in an individual who, 2000 years ago, (1) made a false prediction (i.e., that God's arrival was imminent), (2) offered an ethic that was premised on the assumption that God's arrival was imminent, and (3) whose ministry was a &quot;bust&quot; (given, e.g., that the &quot;orthodox&quot; Christianity that emerged to dominance had--and has--virtually no relationship with his ministry)? Insofar as Jesus attained alternate states of consciousness, and we can do the same today (also through &quot;natural&quot; means), we can emulate some aspects of Jesus's ministry. (Davies does not state this, but such a conclusion is implicit in his discussion.) Thus, Davies's thesis helps us arrive at a picture of Jesus that makes Jesus relevant for us moderns. Which picture is the only one that is of ultimate interest anyway."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"Davies provides some answers to questions that have eluded the first two thousand years of Christianity. While Jesus spoke more about spirit and the Kingdom of God than anything else, traditional Christianity hardly addresses them. We have little chance of understanding Jesus without looking at these phenomena. I do tend to differ with Davies when he states that Jesus was not a teacher. I see no reason why he couldn't teach both verbally and experientially. I would recommend this book to any serious student of the real Jesus, and I am disappointed it is not more widely available. The Parables of Jesus by Richard Q. Ford is a good companion to this book. Ford, like Davies, makes the reader look at the parables in whole new ways."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"With rare exceptions (the late John A.T. Robinson comes to mind), the Christian gospel of John is usually assigned a comparatively late date and its understanding of Jesus regarded as a pretty well-developed &quot;high&quot; christology. It is therefore usual, at least among theologically liberal scholars, to dismiss it as almost entirely unhistorical. (Interestingly, this dismissal is usually performed by Christians, of whom I am not one.)Stevan Davies, himself a secularist New Testament scholar, here makes an interesting argument that such dismissal may be unnecessary. His claim is that Jesus sometimes underwent spirit-possession, speaking and healing while in a &quot;trance state&quot; known as the &quot;kingdom of God.&quot;This view has a number of advantages. First, it allows us to recognize John as a possibly historical source of at least some of Jesus's spirit-entranced speeches. Second, it deals neatly with a problem that faces those who attribute the Johannine speeches to early Christians &quot;speaking in the spirit&quot;: why would anyone think they sounded like Jesus if Jesus himself never talked that way? Third, it links Jesus's speech closely to his healings and exorcisms, and therefore resists the tendency to reduce Jesus to a merely &quot;ethical teacher.&quot; And fourth, it offers us at least the beginning of a way to assimilate even the Johannine Jesus to the Judaism of his time -- not, indeed, as an academic-Marxist &quot;empowerer of the oppressed,&quot; but as a charismatic holy man announcing (perhaps mistakenly) the eschatological reign of God.Davies may overstep a bit in arguing that even Jesus's parables were therapeutic in nature. Nevertheless there is a foundation even for this claim, at least if we allow that Jesus's parables were not merely tales to be listened to passively but little &quot;story-bombs&quot; intended to bring about spiritual transformations and paradigm shifts.I do not think Davies provides a full picture either of Jesus or of the &quot;kingdom&quot; he announced; nor does Davies claim to do so (in fact he expressly acknowledges that he has _not_ done so). Nevertheless, though there are parts of the New Testament record that resist assimilation to Davies's account, he has provided a new window into the gospel of John that may prove helpful in the task of placing Jesus properly into his own time and place -- i.e., as the faithful Jew that he was, and not as the &quot;liberation theologian&quot; some modern readers might like him to be."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"'Jesus of history as a spirit-possessed healer whose healing was effected by induction of spirit possession analogous to the psychotherapeutic techniques of Milton Erickson'The are only a handful of books dealing with evidence of the practice of hypnosis in the Ancient World.

What is more amazing is that he does it all without resorting to mystical mumbo-jumbo and spiritual claptrap. He brings these phenomena down to the human level where we can appreciate them for what they are: part of the human experience. Even more amazing is that the book is readable.Whether you are a wide-eyed religious fanatic needing a bit of grounding in the real world or a hard-core skeptic needing to understand that trances and \\"possessions\\" are real phenomena rooted in human psychology and brain chemistry this book will open your eyes to a very different view of the human world around you."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"In titling his book Jesus the Healer, Stevan Davies means to swap out one tenacious yet, he argues, inadequately examined metaphor for another more revealing and less presumptive one. The last century's quest for the \\"historical Jesus\\" has most often been conducted under a single ruling rubric--that of \\"Jesus as teacher.\\" The result, the author informs us, has been to call forth a specific set of sometimes erroneous interpretations of Jesus' words, deeds and motives that have since firmly planted themselves in the popular imagination as a truth about the person of Jesus. Davies makes the provocative point early and often that if Jesus had had a coherent message, a central teaching, \\"...and neither we nor his known near contemporaries know for sure what it was, he ought not to be thought, first and foremost, to have been a great and challenging teacher.\\" (13)Yet a ruling metaphor is necessary; utilized precisely because we have, after two millenia of arguments, no single idea of what Jesus' message was. Davies' approach in making a switch is to build from the foundation of what scholars agree is historical bedrock about the person of Jesus--that he was regarded during his life by some as a prophet, and by some as an exorcist and healer. (And that it's likely that Jesus himself believed he was a prophet.) (45)In confronting the question, How did he heal? the author's working assumption is that cultural attitudes, practices and the actual psycho-physical manifestations associated with healing, exorcism and prophecy are inexorably related, even mutually constitutive, within a historical context. Davies' approach to conveying how this is so is guided by a jointly anthropological and psychological examination of spirit and demon possession. Importantly, he looks at how possession would have been perceived in Jesus' time, as well as how it is construed today. \\"Anthropology can provide explanations for the social relationships among persons who experienced [states of possession]. Psychology can help us understand those states apart from the Christian language by which they are described in our texts.\\" (205)The efficacy of the book hinges on the fact that Davies walks with one foot in each of the camps. That is, the scholarship is made credible with the mostly-effective balancing of contemporary and ancient, psychological and historical/anthropological perspectives. The secular reader will be comfortable knowing that his arguments are not based around investigation of Jesus' nature, but rather they stick to what we can know about who Jesus thought he was, who his contemporaries thought he was, and how--and, to a lesser extent, why--common consensus as to what a prophet is and does has been reified by traditional mythemes of Jesus' life.The next question he asks--one which would be useful to aim at other studies ofbiblical prophets who experienced possession--is this: if we can say that Jesus was, and/or that people thought he was, at times, possessed, how was it determined what sort of entity or force possessed him? Davies supplies copious quotes from the New Testament to demonstrate that a \\"demon paradigm\\" was common during that time period, and a \\"prophet paradigm\\" was much more rare. So why did Jesus' cronies conclude that the \\"Spirit of God\\" rather than a demon was speaking through him? Putting on his self- statedly ill-fitting exegete hat, Davies supplies us with one specific reason why we should wonder this: the Gospel stories that include Jesus being \\"driven\\" into the desert by the Spirit. \\"The Greek word Mark uses [for this] has connotations of being violently driven against one's will.\\" (63) Davies opens up a tantalizing area of inquiry here, but doesn't fully flesh out the line of thought.One of his more satisfyingly developed arguments has to do with the significance of Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist. He again engages what he terms the \\"logic of possession\\" as he devotes a meaty chapter to his intriguing psychotherapy-informed theory of the significance of Jesus' \\"reception of the Spirit\\" at his baptism (an episode that Davies holds is just as historically certain as the fact of the crucifixion). In brief, the book explains that the manner in which John the Baptist conducted baptisms established a patterned response for people who were present. Participants were first subjected to self-denigration, which then called them to repentance and finally led to a perceived self-transformation/revelation. That Jesus' first spontaneous possession experience occurred in this setting among a group of onlookers primed for transformation was a fortuitous and circumstantial beginning to his career, says Davies. Moreover, citing studies of those who speak in tongues as evidence of an analogous patterned cultural phenomenon, he says that a person can expect the feeling of revelation to be accompanied by a sense of \\"mastery\\" and delusion of ego omnipotence. He needn't spell out his diagnosis of Jesus. The implications couldn't be more clear. Davies' credibility wanes a bit here, as he could stand to acknowledge the leap made in the correlation of glossolalia as studied in the modern/contemporary era to possession trance as manifested in early Christianity. Furthermore, since he is using Western psychological theory, he could as well have cited yet another not-uncommon psycho-spiritual outcome of spiritual revelation, which is that of the ego dissolution, rather than inflation.This last point underscores one of a few strings the book leaves dangling. Davies deserves credit for consolidating a plethora of evidential pieces into a convincing case for this important historical reframe, and for bringing to a subject so inherently and acutely polemical an almost contagious enthusiasm such that only the most intransigent reader wouldn't concede that his findings are not at least interesting. But some of his evidence needs closer examination. For example, in his sometimes hasty culling of evidence from studies of possession within cultures far and wide, he glosses over such niggling points as the necessary comparison of demographics. In another section, in effort to delineate the specific types of healing and exorcisms that he is dealing with, Davies identifies the ailments of Jesus' \\"clients\\" (to use his term) rather sweepingly as somaticization and conversion disorders. He refers to some of these disorders as \\"dissociative\\" even though symptoms such as fever, excessive menstrual bleeding, deafness and blindness would not qualify as such by many standards. (72) Also, much hangs on his arguments that the majority of demon-possessed individuals who Jesus exorcised came from \\"intolerable circumstances of social subordination within their family groups\\" and also that it was likely that many of these were women (85); and further, that many of them came to be his followers. (108) But while he gives a footnote's nod to Joanna Dewey's (author of \\"Jesus' Healings of Women\\") questioning of the degree to which this is a characteristic of a male perspective of women as, by and large, more demon-possessed than men (85), he never seriously engages the question of how he or anyone could safely know that \\"bad families\\" were responsible for so many of Jesus' clients cum followers. Overall, he is comfortable naturalizing possession-trance into a psychic safety valve.Despite his upfront disclaimer as to his lack of exegetical background, Davies nevertheless verges into theological territory in some sections of the book, though giving way for the most part to psychosocial explanations in the end. One example is his treatment of the perennially confusing passages from Luke 12:51-53 and 14:26-7, Mark 3:32-25, et al., that invoke a Jesus advocating familial hatred. Jesus' uncharacteristic vitriol is accounted for within Davies' theory that the sayings attributed to Jesus were situationally aimed. That is, if we interpret them as meant for specific individuals--his clients who were maligned by bad families--Jesus is then seen as having acted as both their social worker in giving them permission to leave the situations of abuse to join a surrogate family with God as the father, and as a surprisingly skilled therapist. Davies insinuates that Jesus was using a tactic called \\"paradoxical therapy\\" by which the affirmation of the cause of the affliction by the therapist to the client gives control back to the client. This not only accounts for those harsh anti-filial statements attributed to Jesus, but further, attributes to them a healing effect. (143) If we buy that Jesus could have been that prescient, perhaps a honing of the ruling metaphor to \\"Jesus as savant psychotherapist\\" is in order!The book is nothing if not ambitious. As if it were not enough to historically contextualize and systematically re-construe Jesus as medium-healer, Davies also manages to tackle in 210 pages a handful of other pivotal Gospel topics. To give one example, in analyzing the prevailing meanings of the \\"Kingdom of God\\" he presents two major interpretations, again considered in contexts both ancient (using Johannine and Pauline literatures) and modern. Seen as metaphor for both a future time, and as experiential reality in the here and now, they are juxtaposed as realist and idealist. Davies further argues that Jesus had in mind a fusion of the two--a Kingdom within as well as a future \\"objective geopolitical event\\" (205-6)--and that this holistic version was bifurcated after his death. The former became a theory or a belief, rather than an experience available to all in the present, with, as we know, enormous ramifications for all subsequent history. This is one of the book's more satisfying pieces of intellectual history, a point where the reader finds substantial payoff for having made the journey. That it comes in the final 3 pages of the book's conclusion suggests that Davies had more story to tell.Overall, Davies manages to produce a compelling read for a wide range of readers and audiences. Those interested in the phenomenon of possession will find scores of intriguing cross-cultural studies cited here. Davies makes active use of the work of anthropologists Felicitas Goodman and Erika Bourguignon. (One cited study purports to define which types of societies are most prone to give rise to possession-trance. Though, the societal attributes--sedentary agricultural societies with populations greater than 100,000, hierarchical social stratification and political integration (40)-- are so generalized that making a positive correlation to 1st century Palestine has to be seen as a bit stretchy.) For a newcomer to the topic of the historical Jesus as pursued in religious studies, the book introduces several heavyweights in the field such as Richard Horsely, Paul Hollenboch and John Dominic Crossan, whose concurring psycho-Marxist reading of exorcism Davies flatly refutes. He allies himself chiefly with the scholarship of J.P. Sanders with whom he is a tad blithe in simply agreeing. Unfortunately, the text is not indexed, making it not user-friendly for referencing. Those who read it for what it does provide in abundance, however will certainly be enriched."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"There is much to be commended in any book which focuses on the historical Jesus as a healer. The two most secure pieces of Gospel evidence are that (1) Jesus proclaimed and taught about the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; and (2) he was a successful exorcist-healer. Deny either of those, and you may as well trash the Gospels. Davies recognizes this quite clearly and has attempted to come to terms with it. Unfortunately, he misassimilates a lot of fine knowledge.Davies uses contemporary psychology to account for the successful nature of Jesus' healings and exorcisms: Blindness, deafness, loss of speech, and paralysis were &quot;conversion disorders&quot; occurring as interiorizations of guilt and despair, and, likewise, demon-possessions were &quot;multiple personality disorders&quot; occurring as coping mechanisms for abusive family relationships. He then argues that the function of Jesus' parables was to heal such disorders (!). He sees the Kingdom of God as a therapeutical state of religious trance, effected by the parables. A wild and far-fetched claim like this calls to mind some of the liberal questers of the nineteenth century. To be sure, Jesus spoke in parables, and he healed people, but one had little to do with the other. There is also a problem with Davies' misuse of modern Western psychology, applying it to the ancient Middle-East. Abusive family relationships would not have caused many multiple personality disorders in antiquity, where all people -- men, women, and children alike -- were conditioned to defend their honor constantly and forcefully against abuse and attacks. Ancient Jews were not &quot;psychologically damaged&quot; by the same kinds of things we are today. There is nothing wrong with using psychology to explain demon-possession, but Davies doesn't have the correct psychological model.On the whole, Davies has pushed a lot of Gospel data through a single (and not entirely correct) interpretive sieve. Jesus was indeed a dynamic and successful exorcist-healer. But he was also a teacher. He told parables to empower people living under oppression, not heal them of illnesses. None of his teachings in any way diminish his role as a healer."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer: Possession, Trance, and the Origins of Christianity","review":"Stevan Davies is just another conspiracy theorist and his work concerning the gospel of Thomas has already been debunked. Apparently, with this book, he believes that all of the people whom Jesus healed were merely suffering from psychological disorders. This means of course that a cripple, a leper, and even a man who was born blind were healed due to the placebo effect. Oh, and let's not forget that Jairus' daughter must have REALLY wanted to come back to life again. How convenient..Further, he believes that Jesus was \\"possessed\\" by God and came to notify others as to how they could become \\"possessed by God\\", which is not what you originally stated. You originally said that ALL men ARE Gods and that he came to make them aware of this by means of this \\"Christ Consciousness\\" crap. So if we already are Gods, why then do we need to be taught how to become possessed by God? What's more, Historians don't appear to agree with anything the man has to say as far as his translations go. He is about as credible as Sitchin."},{"Title":"The occult significance of blood","review":"This is an obscure contribution by Steiner on a most valuable and profound subject. All Steiner fans will be over the moon with joy at the content.That said, this is the most poorly published book I have ever held in my hands.

Nicely done Ms. Finch! And thank you for such a lovely novel."},{"Title":"This Side of Reality: Modern Czech Short Stories (Modern Short Stories)","review":"The best story in this anthology by far is by the youngest author, \\"A Trip to the Raliway Station,\\" by Jachym Topol. I recommend his novel \\"City Sister Silver.\\" In Joycean, demotic, slangy, and debased registers, he manages in his story excerpted here to capture post-1989 Prague while avoiding the imitative Kafkaesque allegory that clogs so much of his earlier, pre-Glasnost compatriots' stories in this volume. Klima's \\"Tuesday Morning: A Sentimental Tale\\" from his superb \\"My Merry Mornings\\" collection and Skvorecky's droll \\"The Well-Screened Lizette\\" both highlight the intricacies of love and sexual politics in the Communist era. Ladislav Fuks' \\"Kchony Sees the World\\" and Arnost Lustig's \\"The River Where the Milky Way Flows\\" strive to examine the Shoah from an adolescent's oblique viewpoint; Ewald Muller's brief nightmare \\"Swallowed by Earth\\" in turn conveys the mood of partisans and refugees during the war forcefully. Ota Pavel's \\"Cafe Slavia\\" excerpt and Berkova's \\"Lousehead\\" excerpt manage less successfully but still ambitiously to capture some of the manic air of Stalinism and hero worship.The other selections make me wonder if editors feel compelled to include all of their long-neglected authorial friends in these anthologies. When so many writers have admittedly suffered under totalitarianism and have been limited to samizdat clandestine exposure for decades, it sounds mean to begrudge them a wider audience. And many may not have had the luxury of being enriched by what Western readers could for forty years of the post-WW2 years. I don't mean to patronize, but the rest of the volume does not stand up to the selections I've noted. Topol's novel that followed this anthology, however, confirms him as the first major post-1989 figure in Czech fiction, and I hope that others will follow his formidable but dazzling path soon."},{"Title":"Blind Reason","review":"Blind Reason (BR) is a great read; no doubt about it. But, I think the author is holding out on us. This is supposedly a first novel! One of the great difficulties of any medium is the control of large forms; that rarely comes easily. The magnificent poet is not necessarily a great novelist. A great novel, though it be written with poetic prose, is not necessarily written by a great poet: BR is just what it needs to be. If, indeed, BR is a first novel, the talent for novels springs as Aphrodite, full grown from the mind of Zeus.The sense of time in architecture is wonderful; when something happens is as important as what happens. All things have there just temporal proportion: nothing is too early, and nothing is too late. This sens eof timeing maybe be the most illusive of all artistic parameters.The particular level of realism is one that could only be acheived now. We live in very scary times, and I don't mean alleged Islamic terrorists. I mean the US government, which has become a clear and present danger to all life on this planet; that, and the corporate structures to which it is completely beholden. Any intelligent reader should be able to see that within this enraging story there is as much truth as poetry. That said, the novel wears its cerebral mantle lightly. In fact, it wears all its mantles lightly, and that is exactly one of its greatest charms. Structure that calls attention to itself is defficient in art, and BR does none of that.I certainly did not skim through this book, but read rather deliberately and slowly, simply because I liked the language and details. Some uses of language invite racing through, because the words don't really matter; other uses invite lapping up the the words and savoring them. Blind Reason invites the latter.There is a reduction of material to the essential, so that at no point where some development is needed is there a feeling of inessentialness, i.e., all words count. The additions to the basic English prose of German, Italian and French is fun itself. Griffon doesn't talk down to readers, nor does she talk up. It's that kind of intricate balance that pervades the novel, multiply. Along with the balances are always the tensions: simply put, you awalys want to know what happens next - and speaking of that, somehow, the author speaks, in a not quite omniscient narrator's mask, sympathetically of all characters - even the arch villain. The character of Moriarty in A.C. Doyle comes to mind. There is a decided respect for the power of evil, as in reality there should be. There may be a message here, but first, BR is a novel; the rest is for you to figure out.I simply get get over the \\"first novel\\" bit, since Blind Reason deftly avoids all the pitfalls of going to large structures before being ready. In one way or another, the author was clearly ready, down to no overworked words, and a nice variation in sentence length. She hasn't fallen victim to a given style, but rather creates a lean one, devoid of self indulgence, in her own voice.Overall, the structural things that I like most are the senses of timing, balance, and balance of tensions. On the entertainment level, it's a wonderful romp and great fun; under that is an expose' of several of the great sicknesses of what for some reason is often referred to as post modern civilization. What's next? \\"post post modern\\"?Personally, as a kind of icing on the cake, I happen to like the detailed attention to food. I was waiting for *the* great recipe for Fettucini Alfredo - fortunately, I already know it :-) Anybody who uses a chiffonade d'herbes with lamb, and actually knows what it means! - get *my* vote. :-) Blind Reason is a well constructed novel, with many kinds of interests, poetry and truth. It is entertaining, thoughtful and informative; Griffon clearly did her homework on pharmaceuticals. Brava! Encore!"},{"Title":"Blind Reason","review":"Nobody prepared me for what I would find between the covers of this fantastic book. I had just finished reading King ofTorts when somone suggested Blind Reason, which made Grisham's tale of pharmaceutical corruption look like a comic book. Griffon's attention to detail is astounding; her research into the Third Reich, the Cia and the pharmaceutical industry is meticulous. The plot is fast-paced and the dialogue, on a host of subjects, is brilliant, but I was left with the haunting question of how much of what Griffon wrote is fact or fiction. The lines are definitely blurred. This is a great weekend read. Now, how can I get a date with the heroine, MayaWarwick?"},{"Title":"Blind Reason","review":"The Bonfire of the SSRIs or Big Pharma Under FireTwo contemporary authors have addressed the issues of the wealth and power Big Pharma wields in novel-length fiction - grandmaster John LeCarre in THE CONSTANT GARDENER and Patricia Griffon in BLIND REASON. I've read both. LeCarre is, as ever, admirable, but he himself commented, concerning TCG, that his novel is \\"tame as a holiday postcard\\". After comparison to Griffon's BLIND REASON, I absolutely agree. Reading BLIND REASON is like a series of fascinating and sometimes terrifying rides in a top-of-the-line amusement park. Sometimes it feels like a survival training course. When you disembark, both shaken and stirred, you will recognize the real-world players that the characters in BLIND REASON resemble. The masks are off.... Griffon's scope and international intrigue are wider than LeCarre's, and her characters and events arrive and explode with the speed of fireworks. LeCarre has steered clear of the dangers of talking back to Prozac by centering his issues around a fictitious TB drug tested on an unsuspecting African tribe and the diplomatic service - sets and settings both rather difficult for the contemporary reader to identify with. There may be very good reasons for this: as he recorded, a real activist in Nairobi ended up with a bullet wound in his head, and this sort of accident \\"can happen again\\". The more courageous writer, Griffon, has personal knowledge of and has researched the Prozac family of drugs and their cousins, and has presented a possible future and it is nasty. The Nazis, resurrected with hidden fortunes from WWII, have a plan for us - and in their hands, and on everyone's lips, will be drugs.... BLIND REASON is one of the few books I have read that I will return to all my life. My copy will need to be replaced in a few months. I am guilty of book-bashing and reference-writing and article-stuffing again - it's the darndest book I've ever read. Why? Griffon's purpose in writing the book - to expose the dangers of Pharma/political connections and corruption - fills in the stories between the lines in today's news reports. Why did the US government vote through a bill that protects *both* Homeland and Eli Lilly from prosecution re Thiomersol (vaccines linked to autism cases)? Because of Patricia Griffon's politically astute BLIND REASON, I think I know the *reason*. I might keep THE CONSTANT GARDENER in my guest bedroom - as a soporific - but poring over BLIND REASON has kept me awake many nights. Want a gentle mare or a sleeping pill, the predictable clockwork themes of Bach? Try LeCarre. For the ride of your life, get Griffon. BLIND REASON rocks - and may rock your world. This is Griffon's first turn as a suspense writer. I believe she will outshine Antonia Fraser, Patricia Cornwell and LeCarre (once again) in her next book, BLIND CHANCE.

This book is classified as 'fiction' but contains complete truth with regard to psychotropic drugs. I would recommend Blind Reason to anyone who loves an intriguing plot."},{"Title":"Blind Reason","review":"Blind Reason is the first novel published by Paxil withdrawal suit plaintiff Patricia Griffon. The novel was written during a period of time in the late '90s when the author says she was going through a difficult withdrawal from taking the popular anti-anxiety/depressant drug Paxil. Blind Reason imagines a diabolical plot to reestablish the Third Reich as a political force in the Western world using a German-based pharmaceutical company's marketing of a new Prozac-like \\"mood brightner\\" Euphorin. Euphorin is to Blind Reason what Soma is to Brave New World, a drug used to help the masses forget their cares, and any notions of a living in a democratic and free society as well.Blind Reason's heroine is Maya Warwick, a reclusive investigative journalist and writer who lives in a mountain community west of Denver and suspects there is more to the marketing campaign behind Euphorin than helping heal the emotional suffering of the masses. Maya has broken other stories about the marketing of psychiatric drugs before and her motives for her journalism are more than just informing the public. Her motives are personal. Both her parents had been the victims of a murder-suicide while one of them was under the influence of a older psychiatric drug implicated in dozens of other grisly acts of violence. Meanwhile, a close friend has recently committed suicide while taking Euphorin. Like countless thousands of other family and friends of people who committed destructive acts of violence while under the influence of psychiatric drugs, Maya simply wants to know what role the drugs might be playing the grisly murder-suicides that are likely to dominate the evening news these days.Blind Reason works best when it sticks to the story behind the diabolical conspiracy to foment a neo-Nazi uprising in Colorado and beyond. The intrigue behind the German-based pharmaceutical giant VB Pharmaceuticals and its American-based subsidiary FetcherBurkeWinslow is what held my attention the most. Maya finds herself recruited, basically against her will, into an CIA mission to uncover the links between VB-FBW and the burgeoning neo-Nazi movement in the U.S. This is interesting material that is fun to read. Furthermore, the author inserts mention of the influence the resistance to the aggressive marketing of psychiatric drug has had on her research into her writing here. In this sense, Blind Reason is more than just another spy novel, but a literature of this resistance to the conventional wisdom of the Prozac-era, which holds that everybody has lived happily ever after since the introduction of Prozac to the market in December 1987.Far too many words are devoted to a love triangle involving one of Maya's neighbors and an agent she meets before flying off to Germany. Both of Maya's love interests here are the kind of middle-aged male characters who make my eyes roll over. First, there's Blubbering Andrew, Maya's next door neighbor, and Handsome Agent Harry, the agent who trains our heroine in a crash course of German and waltzing. Does Maya throw herself into the arms of our dashing agent before she flies off to Germany? Does our dashing Agent Harry mindlessly abandon his job and run off to Europe to track down his new found love Maya? Does Andrew blubber over the phone about how he's missed out on his last chance to find love with Maya over the phone? Is Maya's decision on who she will ultimately take for a lover in the end conveniently provided for her by way of being seated next to her future amour on her plane ride back to Colorado? Does the sky have stars on a clear night?After over 550 pages, Blind Reason pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line. In the end the reader is subjected to a confessional group therapy session we've all seen over and over again on Oprah and all the other talk shows. No wait. Harry tells Maya, \\"Being with you is as close as I've come in years to feeling any human connection, or emotion. I thought that part of me was dead forever, especially after Annabella died. Thanks to you, I see now that I could feel those things again, and that's the most hope I've had in years.\\" I hadn't heard that before.Blind Reason is a worthy first effort for Griffon. It is a work of fiction that could have only been concocted in the mind of a person under the influence of a potent and aggressively marketed pharmacueutical drug. I found that it dragged on a little too long and the little love triangle our heroine finds herself in is little too much Harlequinn romance for me.Rick's Scientfically certain rating: 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.-Rick Giombetti, Seattle ..."},{"Title":"Service Quality - The Enlightened Approach","review":"My colleague Seamus has done a service by writing this book, to the service industry, and to many customers out there.

A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century.

This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford.

Compared to the miniseries, as expected, the book expands into more details and can be savored in many more levels.Sometimes escapism may require an action page-turner. Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced.

More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it.

In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A very quick review.

More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then. I'd say I enjoyed the last 25% the most--found it comparatively un-put-down-able!--but only because I'd abandoned all hope by then.My book club was going to read this one, but I frantically steered them away when I was 60% in. We're doing NORTH AND SOUTH instead"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is a marvelous,stupendous,elegent,splendid,perfect,funny. a very good book but just a little hard to understand.like Charles Dickens a wirlwind of words that make a puzzle piece. you need all the pieces to make a puzzle. understand what you are reading and it makes a perfect picture. dont understand and the picture is fuzzy,unclear,and confusing."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"You know a book is a tough sell when the jacket copy says, \\"the novel remains a favorite with students and aficionados of nineteenth-century literature.

Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte. Even though this is a book putatively about small town genteel widows and matrons, the timely references to characters being enthralled by Dickens Pickwick Papers (one of the few men in the novel is hit by a train because he is standing on the platform, so enthralled by the latest installment of Pickwick that he is slow too alert a child stuck on the tracks.)Elizabeth Gaskell in fact chose to be known as \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\" to the point that contemporary editions of Cranford read \\"by Mrs. Gaskell.\\" Although Cranford is not exactly what you call \\"action intense,\\" it is well observed, and at 130 pages you can read through it in a couple hours. Gaskell's country matrons don't sparkle with the life of those of Stendahl's the Red and the Black, but she does an equal job of portraying a specific time and place (the 1830s) from a vantage point twenty years in the the future (published 1852.)In the end Gaskell's genteel spinsters come together to save the day in the manner of a book like \\"the Little Women,\\" it's a bit TOO pat of an ending but hey it's just a minor classic, nowhatimean?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A lovely book about a lovely village of lovely people. The inspiration for BBC/Masterpiece Classic's Cranford and Return to Cranford. I read this book in only a few nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The glossary/notes regarding material culture (clothing, terminology, expressions) are not always correct (based on my own research and experience as an historic interpreter), but most of the information was new to me and referred to books and events of which I was unaware. I'm glad I watched the tv series first, including \\"The Making of Cranford,\\" before reading the book; it made clear how and why the series was created as it was. That being said, the book is charming and should be read by all high school students, especially female students, to understand that they are not so very different after all."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"For those expecting the book and PBS Mini-series of the same name to mirror each other, your expectations will probably fall short. Although the book is very well written, it is definitely not light reading, and requires a great degree of concentration to understand the ins and outs of the plot - the characters are intertwined, but it is sometimes hard to remember how they relate to one another.Overall, this book is a good, classical tale, but not recommended for bedtime reading!

I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people. This book is essentially a comedy of manners. The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money. The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies. There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations. It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us. Come and meet the wonderful ladies of Cranford."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book wraps you 'round and carries you into into the humble, hilarious and understated society of the women who inhabit the small town of Cranford; it is a treasure that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's 1853 novel \\"Cranford\\" is a subtle and often sly portrait of life in a fictional mid-19th century rural English village. At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory.

I felt this had a little of everything. I'd suggest a read if you want to be ready for watching any TV adaptation."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford the book isn't the same as Cranford the BBC series--after all, the BBC series was based on three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, not just this one--but for me the book fills in details and answers questions I wished the TV show had time to go into. Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter.

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans.

Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored.

The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time. These are the 3 character-filled and -driven collections that the PBS Cranford series and Return to Cranford series were adapted from, so I recommend Gaskell's set here for any and all who've enjoyed the film versions.And this particular offering from Amazon is priced so frugally even Cranford's own Miss Deborah would approve. So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...do try the book. I had to read this at school at 14 (so often enough to put anyone off anything) but it has remained an absolute favourite which hardly anyone else seemed to have read until recently. It is a little gem. The episode where the narrator goes through a bundle of old letters is especially poignant and has remained with me ever since that first reading. You will know what I mean - but you'll need something to wipe away a tear!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It is fun to read the book from which the TV miniseries was taken. Seeing the people in print gives more to their on screen characterizations. I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time.

Far more worthy are Mary Barton, North and South or her others, I can't comment on Ruth as I haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Such a very pleasant read and gives a nice view into the lives of spinster/widow women of the 1850's in England. This particular Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This story is wonderful if you love to read about people, their quirks, their daily life. The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down. So far my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell book is North and South."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" like the village to which it refers (only 30 miles by train from the larger town of Drumble in which narrator Mary Smith and her father now live) offers multum in parvo as Rector Jenkyns might have said: much in little.Woven together in chapters that build quietly but skillfully on each other are the stories of Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matilda Jenkyns, their friends Miss Pole, Mrs FitzAdams, Mrs Forrester, Captain Brown and his daughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie, Lady Glenmire, the Honorable Mrs Jamieson, Signoir Brunoni and his wife, the requited and unrequited lovers, the servants Martha and Mr Mullinare and others sketched swiftly but memorable such as Mr ffoulkes who was so very choice and Mrs ffarington whom he married \\"...and all because of the ff's in her name\\" though being very genteel, pretty,and wealthy were no hinderance.Connected aned interdependent they are: had Signoir Brunoni not performed in Cranford, had he and his family not been sheltered during his illness by a kind innkeeper and his wife, had the ladies of Cranford not discovered his plight and come to the rescue, then Mary Smith would not have heard the story of the wife's journey through India to protect their daughter Pearl, of the kindness of a plantation owner,a Mr. Jenkyns....and she would not have written to him thinking he might be the Miss Jenkyn's long-lost brother, Peter, and more yet would not have ensued.We care about the little town whose portrait is drawn in \\"Cranford,\\" drawn in the watercolors of Beatrix Potter and with the same precision of observation. The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing.

The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment.

For scarcely more than twice the price, you may purchase the much-longer anthology. I'm kicking myself."},{"Title":"The Art of Reading Poetry","review":"Harold Bloom has an enormous love and an immense knowledge of poetry. His interpretative works show not only his tremendous knowledge but his great creative power in thought. This present small volume which is the introduction to a volume published last year the anthology 'The Best Poems of the English Language' I found a bit disappointing. Bloom opens by talking about poetry as figurative language, and then following Kenneth Burke in talking of the tropes which make up figurative language, irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. And with this he sets the tone for an essay which is more an eclectic mishmash than it is an insightful look into the heart of reading poetry.He goes on to talk about the importance of allusion in poetry, once again working with his most famous thesis of new poets rivalry with, and their need to overcome their predecessors. He talks about the poetry of thought in Shakespeare, and gives nine poetic passages which illustrate the quality of ' poetic voice'. Toward the end of the volume he makes the general statement that poetry is essentially about expanding the consciousness.I did not find all of this particularly useful in helping me understand how to better read poetry. It seems to me that if Bloom had been true to the title of the work he should have done in this small volume a lot more close reading. And he should have done this about poems which are relatively ' easy' and ' well- known'. And he should too have said something about certain practical steps( for example the importance of memorizing poetry in order to truly make it one's own. The experience of 'knowing and reciting poetry' enhances the art of reading as Bloom himself the memorizer of volumes of poetry well knows).It seems to me too that in this volume Bloom technically straitjackets ' poetry'. Consider for instance the difference between reading the poetry of the Psalms, and reading the poetry of Shakespeare. Consider the difference between reading the poetry of Wordsworth and reading the poetry of Emily Dickinson. There are not simply enormous differences in the content, message, meaning of the poetry but enormous differences in the means of expression and their intent. To read a poet is to somehow feel inside another world. Reading poetry requires above all a kind of emotional empathy that Bloom does not talk about at all. Poetry is after all the deepest way we have of expressing feelings with words. Bloom somehow in this particular work is not interested in that dimension.I also think that Bloom erred in not thinking at all about the way 'poetry ' is ' food for the soul'. I have just been reading Akhmatova and considering the way she was a ' voice for the suffering Russian people' a source of consolation and hope to so many . Poetry I want to say gives a kind of sustenance to mind, heart, and soul. And it is a gift many readers do not know how to appreciate and enjoy, even intelligent readers.I do not believe that this particular work will help those readers very much.And this again when I have enormous respect for Harold Bloom one of the great readers of poetry in our time."},{"Title":"The Art of Reading Poetry","review":"While Harold Bloom might be able to artfully expatiate upon the tragic flaws of various and sundry Shakespeare heroes, he commits one of his own here: he hasn't the faintest idea of his audience. Too sophisticated for a tyro and a mere introduction for anyone that attended sophomore English, Bloom commits the ultimate act of literary hamartia - which, staying true to the Aristotelian spirit of tragedy, he doesn't realize.Bloom begins by noting that poetry is essentially figurative speech, going on to further note (smartly) that prosaic speech is figuration, too, but figuration whose immediacy as such as been lost. For a large portion of the volume, he reads several poems through the lens of Kenneth Burke's understanding of the four figurative tropes: irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. Do you already know what these words mean? Assuming that you do (I'm guessing that most people who don't wouldn't know who Harold Bloom is), the vast majority of this book will be nothing new.Bloom does manage to make some interesting points about the roles of allusion and intertextuality in poetry, giving examples of how some poems consciously mimic others stylistically (the scorn he heaps upon the \\"self-pitying and metrically maladroit\\" Poe is hilarious). He ends the book with the consideration that poetry is basically an exercise in which we encounter, in the words of Owen Barfield, \\"in contact with a different kind of consciousness from our own,\\" which Bloom construes as a sort of cognitive \\"strangeness.\\" This definition, while perhaps already glaringly obvious to the serious reader of poetry, has always rung true with me.The strangeness of this book, however, is of quite another sort. We are offered interpretation after interpretation, without being offered even the rudimentary mechanics of how to \\"read a poem\\" suggested in the title, if such a mechanics are even available. Maybe his emphasis was on the \\"art\\" instead of the \\"reading poetry.\\""},{"Title":"The Art of Reading Poetry","review":"Harold Bloom's love for the genius of the English language is a constant source of inspiration to me.

She was ignorant of racial problems. She thought that outright racism never occurred in her community. That perception was changed when she made friends with an African-American doctor who was trying to buy a house. She then discovered the substantial vein of racism running through her community, in her friends and neighbors. She was ostracized and shunned for trying to help out this black family. She then continually got more and more involved in fighting for civil rights for black people. This is her story. An excellent introduction to race relations for Midwestern/ rural whites like me who saw few black people when we were growing up. Also the book gives a glimpse into racial attitudes of middle-class whites in the Midwest in the 1950s and 60s."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"I worked in the library in college and happened on this book in the stacks. I had started a group to end white racism but never found another resouce to help me with this process.

Not only in the midwest, but after encountering more&quot;subtle&quot; racism when she moved East to Philadephia. I loved this book. Still give it away. Admire her courage and her journey and her willingness not only to change but to do something to change the injustcie she learned about around her."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"I read this book for a Diversity in the Workplace class I took at college. I can never tell you how much it opened my eyes. Being married to a black man and having bi-racial children didn't teach me as much as this book did. If you have the time and the inclination, please read this book. The only draw back is the price. Using it for a textbook has given the sellers a license to charge as much as they can on it. And it is a shame because more people should read this but they can't afford to buy it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"I first read this book in 1971, and it changed my life. I grew up in an all-white, small community in NE Arkansas in the '50s and '60s. The only black people I had ever seen were the guy who shined shoes at a local shop and a chauffer from Memphis who often drove one of my uncles. Other than The Bible, this book had more impact on my life than any other I've read in my 65 years. I urge you to read it if you want to better understand the different people of the world. It will cause you to come to grips with things about yourself you might rather leave alone. For your sake, and for others, read this book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"Sometimes, the only way to understand the root of today's most pressing issues is to reflect on those of the past.

Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"I found an early copy of this book on my parents bookshelf and wondered what it was about. I am glad I read it. It's not a happy subject, but I appreciated that the author was able to summarize her evolving perspective of racism in America rather than just lecture us on the results of it. The horrific details of riots were depressing but perhaps it was easier because the worst parts were riots that occurred before I was born. Surely things are better now, right? Reading this has led me to question just how much better we are. Generalities aren't enough, I'd like to know these answers more specifically. Hopefully things ARE a little better.What I liked best was how she was able to converse with so many diverse viewpoints and describe what she learned. One was a union bulldozer operator who sounded overtly racist but after a deeper discussion, he was really just afraid he'd lose his job. A second was the perspectives of teachers who unconsciously showed preference to white students. Racism as portrayed in The Help is obvious, but the most insidious racism is from people who don't know their perspectives are skewed. Racism isn't just overt actions, it's also in the subtle ways people react to events using assumptions we don't know we have. The book wrote about events happening ~50 years ago, and since census data projections predict that Whites will soon lose the majority, I wonder what the next 50 years will be like."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"Stalvey's The Education of a WASP is by no means an easy read. It is captivating, surely, the type of book that is difficult to put down. Yet her story is also a wrenching account of witnessing egregious injustice and learning that she has no recourse. This autobiography, set in 1960s Omaha and Philadelphia, chronicles Stalvey's awakening to the reality of American racism. Her middle class, protestant, white experience and belief system are challenged as she very intentionally examines the black experience of 1960s America.Woven throughout this valuable examination of an historical period is an exploration of marriage, child rearing and friendship. Stalvey responds gracefully time and time again through lost friendships, a ruined career, and fear for the safety of her family. Throughout her education, perhaps her greatest asset is her willingness to listen, to hear what people have to say, even when her reflex is to cover her ears. This ability to listen enables Stalvey to chronicle many different lives and provides both profound perspective and richness in her narrative."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"This is the best book about race I have ever read written by a white person. Stalvey's memoir of her personal relationships with black people during the 1960's when our country was finally beginning to come to terms with its deep-seated racism is both inspiring and enlightening. Not only does she discuss race, she delves into other kinds of prejudice and how important it is for each of us to examine where our prejudices come from if we are ever to move beyond them. I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't think we have a race problem in this country, for even though decades have passed since its initial publication, we still have a long way to go to resolve the schism racism has cut into our national psyche."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"I purchased this book for my teenage daughter to add to her homeschooling summer reads. I had read the book for a Diversity class in college and personally think it is a book that should be read by everyone. She is very interested in equality, diversity and acceptance, so I know this book will be a page-turner as well as an eye-opener for her. Knowing that it is a \\"true story\\" just adds to the amazing read that this book is. If you have any wonders or interests in segregation, equal treatment for all humans, or just want an intersting character study to read, this book is exactly what you're looking for!!"},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"Maybe it's because I grew up in Mount Airy (the setting for most of the book) and I take pride in being the product of such a unique place, but I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Interestingly, I saw a news recap of the protest march for the Jena 6 tonight, where well-tanned white anchorman interviewed the highschool football coach, who had no idea that there were ratial tensions in his town - \\"there's no rule that says they can't go to our church, they just don't want to\\" - RIGHT... This book touches on the ingrained bigotry of white suburbia in the 50's (not that it's come so far) and the tenssions in more-urban Philadelphia surrounding the process of \\"white flight,\\" which was occuring in urban communities nation-wide. It's notable however that this story probably would never have been written if the author had moved even a few miles away to west Philadelphia where the racial make-up of the neighborhoods were almost completely turned over (and where another turnover has been ongoing for a decade or so). It is a testament, not only to the author but many of her neighbors who chose to stay that Mount Airy is considered one of the first successfully integrated communities in America, having been noted for this in Oprah's magazine (bette late than never) and US News & Word Report. Anyone interested in learning about mid-century \\"white flight\\" and the undercurrent oooof racism in America in general will find this book and the community described to be a welcome stand-out."},{"Title":"The Education of a Wasp","review":"This book deserves ten stars! I am at a loss to adequately praise it. One of the most intelligent and insightful tomes on racism. First published in 1970 it is even more relevant today.Who can deny that the failures of the past are still haunting us today? Stalvey's work in 1970 gives great insight into the frustration and unrest of the 60's and forty years later the continuing problems can be seen as a result of society's failure to properly address them.I was reared with racial prejudices and still deal with them daily. I wish I had read this book in high school or college in the 70's. I could have progressed so much more in my understanding than I have.An excellent companion to this book is James Loewen's Sundown Towns.

Derossa's work (highly recommended), this deeper than usual western drama is very pleasing. Discussing it and the movie made from it - with western veteran Joel Macrea and Veronica Lake - is an interchangeable exercise. The movie, with the exception of three minor changes, was word for word what Short wrote.Lake's character is a scheming rancher who attempts to twist Macrea's wandering saddlebum around her finger to gain control of more land. In an era when most female characters eventually swoon into a man's arms and give up their evil ways, Lake's character (I forget the character names) gets darker. Even after she is the cause of a man's violent death. She is affected by this, she's even shocked a little by what she has done, but she does not sway from her goal.This is a strong female character operating in a hard man's world. The problem is, she has learned how to be hard but not honest. She lies and cheats to get what she wants, and eventually this does her in (that's not a spoiler by the way - the good guys still have to win, after all!)The story is taught and the motivations honest.

The novel is a subtle study in human character and Short expertly details each of the novel's characters with a deep understanding of the human psyche that makes an ordinary range war tale more interesting than it should be. The common threads of human behavior are on display, the noble and the ignoble, as the story unfolds towards its inevitable denouement. The honesty and dedication of a cowhand in standing up to a murderous bully and his thugs is the theme here but the rich characterizations of the players herein make this fine work one of the best westerns ever written."},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"A lot of reviewers put this book down for being an uneducated look at life in Russia. They so missed the point. That's this book's charm, and what makes it such an interesting read. The average American knows little about Russia's history, language, or culture, and neither does Rick Furmanek. As an American who's never been out of the western United States (with the exception of Nogales, Mexico, years after I read this book) I read on with wonder as the writer relayed his experiences of the year he spent working in Moscow. The things that came as a culture shock to him, the challenges he faced, and the way him and his family dealt with them are probably not much different than how myself or my family would if we were put in such an unfamiliar envrionment. If you're looking to learn about the culture and history of Russia from an expert, this is not the book you're looking for. However, if you think you could get into the real life adventure of a stranger in a strange land, you won't find better than &quot;Stranded In Moscow&quot;. I couldn't put this down until I made it to the end!-- Dan Dan Leimone"},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"Stranded In Moscow: I knew the author when he was an undergraduate at Midwest Christian College in Oklahoma City, so it was of no surprise to me when I found out he had authored a book. Rick was a sincere student who seemed directed to make a difference in his choice of careers.&amp;&amp; How many of us haven't thought of going abroad where the economies are emerging and simple to make a million or simply be a missionary? Well, if you have thought of it, you need to read Rick Furmanek's Stranded In Moscow. The book is an easy read and tells the story of his family's turmoils in Moscow after Rick took a job with his brother-in-law's company. As a father of 5, the most important decision I felt I had to make when my children were young, was to find a somewhat permanent home for 10 to 15 years, and spend as much time as I could, giving my children the best start in life that I could. Rick and Robin made a decision to move their young family to Moscow without any prearrangement for housing, transportation, and victuals. How tough would that be? Well, here is why Furmanek's book is a need-read!&amp;&amp; We have had several foreign exchange students from Russia come home with our children. They all seemed so excited, and one student from East Germany was our daughter's best friend for the year that she was here. Her friend, Sondra, had the opportunity to experience candied apples, foot-long hot-dogs, and Braughm's ice cream, while she was with us. She often talked about the flat where she and her family lived. I often wondered what she meant as a flat, and how it would compare to our housing here. Well, ... after reading \\u0011Stranded In Moscow, I gained a much better understanding of not only what a flat is, but also, why Sondra was always so excited with every new adventure we showered on her.&amp;&amp; Finding reliable transportation, other than the trains, was a pain. Not having myriad choices for food was another headache. Things that we take for granted, quickly were abandoned when the Furmanek's moved to Moscow. And what about living in a foriegn land amongst a people who do not even share your holidays. Now, it is easy for us to sacrifice, but how hard is it to make a move, when you know that your children are simply not going to have the medical opportunities we take for granted. Reading Stranded gives you a first hand look at just what a move like that would entail.&amp;&amp; Finally, one of the bits of information that I gained from the read, was the fact that we should be questioning all the dramatic Christian changes so often by evangelists coming back from Russia. Rick's book allows the reader to deduce that such big numbers may be inflated and, at the minimum, unrealiable. Numbers may indicate interest, only, in hearing American's talk.&amp;&amp; I enjoyed the book. I did wish that the author had put a disclaimer or note in the front of the book, one time, about Trademarks, rather than putting a TM every time a Copywrited or Tademarked name was mentioned. Other than that, I feel the book is a must-read for anyone thinking about going into business or going as a missionary to Russia, or to anyone, like me, who simply wonders what it might be like living today in Moscow, a, most assuredly, Third World country, by our standards. === Dale Hill"},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"What Rick Furmanek has done with this manuscript is simply majestic. You are there in the Russian flat, you are driving along with Andrei, smelling, hearing, feeling. Rick has a gift for making you an observer through this part of his life and times in Russia, not just a reader of yet another book. This is a wonderful journey into a land hidden in mystery and media cover-up's. This story (I am reluctant to call this just a &quot;book&quot;), not only shows you the human condition most prevalent in daily life, but the dangers of life in this turbulent country as it evolves from the long embedded communist ideals to the beginnings of democracy.

Rick's style and flair for descriptive writing will keep you enthralled for hours, and I am eagerly awaiting his second book."},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"When I first flipped through the book I thought I would read one short chapter a night before bed. Instead I would read 6 or 7 and go to work the next day bleary eyed.

Unfortunately, I came away extreemely disappointed. I have been in and out of Moscow over 50 times on all different kinds of business deals involving all kinds of people throughout all of the 90's. I feel therefore, fairly qualified to say that Mr. Furmanek is an amatuer of the least qualified regarding Moscow people or anything about life at all in Moscow. Sure, his old school mates may have a few positive things to say, but I will bet that even they, after being in Moscow for less than 3 days, will know as much as Mr. Furmanek. One of his prized photos are taken from a tour bus for crying out loud! In short: Bad book, amatuer and inaccurate feeling of Moscow, simple writing... hot topic. If hot topics get you published these days, I think I will write about water on Mars, folks!"},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"This book is easy reading, but at the same time is interesting, funny, sad, and inspiring. Thoroughly enjoyable. You won't want to put it down until you've finished it."},{"Title":"Stranded in Moscow","review":"Have you ever wondered what it is like to live in Russia? I have. I imagined people going to the market, standing in lines around the block for hours on end, and when they finally get to the front of the line, the store shelves are barren. Now you can learn about Russian life from an American who has been there. Rick Furmanek, author of Stranded in Moscow, lived in Russia with his family for a year. During this time, they learned to live in this different country and made some friends. In one adventure, they managed to teach some Russian children how to play baseball despite the language barrier. In another example of Russian life, Rick's secretary fell ill, and an ambulance crew came to her home and pumped her stomach. Rick told her she needed a hospital, but she said no, she was fine; this sort of thing happened all the time. Rick's writing style is easy to read and compelling. I know it's been said before, but Stranded in Moscow is a real page-turner. I found the details of Russian living fascinating. People carry cans of gasoline in the trunks of their cars, because they can't get fuel with the regularity we take for granted. A piece of advice: do not rent a flat (apartment) in a building over ten stories tall; they are deathtraps in the event of fire. For Easter, Russians give each other a cake called a kulich. Although most people buy them in stores, one friend went through the time-consuming and expensive process of making one from scratch before presenting it to Rick and family. This cake must be blessed by a priest. The friend was an elderly woman of modest means, and the Furmaneks were touched by this token of friendship. Oh, what about the markets? Actually, getting food in Russia is not that difficult. You can get plenty of potatoes, for example. But if you want the variety of food necessary for a proper, healthy diet, you've got a lot of work to do. Rick's wife Robin hunted down the food, and it was a full-time job. First, she would watch their black-and-white, Russian-made TV to find the exchange rate of dollars to rubles. The value of the ruble fluctuated constantly, and Robin waited for the best time to visit the exchange commissaries. She found interesting things in Russian markets, including excellent bell peppers. A babushka sold the family some of the best chicken it has ever tasted. Rick and family introduced Russian friends to Mexican food. The Russians were surprised to learn that Americans have different things for dinner each night. Along with the insights into Russian life, Stranded in Moscow also has some lessons for the readers. This excerpt from the book is an excellent example: &quot;Living in Russia heightened my senses to my surroundings, both physically and spiritually. The very things the Russians have come to endure and detest as a way of life-the long lines, the scarcity of food, the astronomical inflation rate, the unaffordable real estate, the expensive fuel, and the eking of life-taught me to choose my wars very carefully. There are some things just not worth fighting for. The elderly person, refusing to exercise his option to turn right on red, the driver, advancing like a snail down the highway in the left lane, the shopper, unloading twelve items in a ten-item or less checkout stand, and the housewife, choosing to use all the options at the ATM machine all have their place in this big, wide world. They have just as much right to be here as anyone else. Russia taught me to accept these events as part of life, and to move on. There are more important things to expend my efforts on while I'm left on this planet. If my attitude ever begins to show signs of my old ways, perhaps I'll move back to Moscow and learn for a year again, a sentence for unrealistic expectations and rude impatience that many Americans should be required to serve.

Rambunctious and witty, vastly imaginative, racingly-paced, and always downright funny, Stolen from Gypsies is a book for anyone who loves a great yarn spun with great skill. The author is drunk like a lord on the rich, mad joy of the English language itself, but not only can he hold his liquor, he turns the wildness of our words, old and new, into pure, narrative gold. This book is no spare, dry, modern comment on our brief, contemporary moment; it's a hot-blooded, hip-wading, sly-winking romp through the rich, roiling tradition of hundreds of years of broadly comic tale-telling. Full of exaggerated characters with outrageous names who do, say, and think extraordinary things, and written with appreciable literary and historical wisdom and wit, this story is firmly rooted in what everyone will recognize and appreciate as the ancient tradition of classically good storytelling.Have you been yearning for an irrepresibly laugh-out-loud tale which steeps you in history and adventure, cozies you near and dear to absurd characters, bashes you good-naturedly about the head with old English slang, and goads you into turning the pages in equal measure of curiosity, surprise, and happy contentment of perhaps the most familiar, well-loved experience language can give us--the pleasure of a great story wondrously unfolding? Then you'll love this book; it's a true pleasure.Post-note for all you hybridization fans: think Anthony Burgess's &quot;Nothing Like the Sun&quot; (a brilliant masterpiece) crossed with something more outright comic--the Monty Python movie epics will have to do for now. Maybe another reader will come up with the perfect title here..."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"A wonderfully crafted adult fairy tale liberally sprinkled with chuckles and laughs. Set in an historically believable Italian city and tastefully spiced with inoffensive bawdy language.

I recommend it if you enjoy an engaging historical backdrop, a phrase well-turned, and a tale that's just plain funny. This is a whimsical stroll through a land of wise fools, false magicians, cursed princes and lovesick, humpbacked poets, where everyone from Napoleon to the local camel vendor receives a cheerful, witty drubbing. Pay special attention to the glossary, replete with tidbits both historical and hysterical."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"Stolen from Gypsies is one of those rare books that is really laugh out loud funny but also extremely well-written. It is truly delightful how Smith bombards us with low brow humor (e.g. enemas) but manages to do so in a thoroughly intelligent way. His wit shines in this novel. I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys reading great literature but is in need of a good laugh."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"Noble Smith's, Stolen From Gypsies, reads like a Shakespearean comedy, but it's got a twist. All the Playwright's elements and plot devices are present from female characters disguised as male characters to long lost twins finding each other at last to letters accidentally crossed. Even the ending is typically theatrical with all the characters joining together on the stage as the author brings together the missing threads of the story.But the ancient Playwright would probably bounce his ancient coffin right out of the ground with laughter could he read this piece of finely crafted wit. For though the structure of the story reads like a play, such Elizabethan bawdiness and humor as is found in Gypies has not been heard since Black Adder and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Smith doesn't skip a page without leaving one shocked with mirth over his Elizabethan &quot;codpiece&quot; humor or rolling with laughter over his descriptions of life in Carthusalem or the bawdy antics of his characters. A young man stolen from gypsies as a baby, a flatulent homunculus, and a she-devil out to get the protagonist's soul are just some of the characters which bound across and through this brilliantly fashioned plot.But one must not neglect to mention the narrator -- an infirm man whose frequent &quot;beet-juice enemas&quot;, doctor's visits and stool sample checks have left him with little joy in life. And it is he who is documenting the tale originally told to him by the gypsy. He reads the story to his lackey -- a crude but delightful little man whose own story of the &quot;clock-sniffer&quot; leaves the reader prostrate with laughter. Together they take us through the comical scenes of the gypsy's tale, made even more hilarious by their constant witty banter. And finally, after the story is told, our narrator -- like his own protagonist -- discovers life anew and overcomes his own infirmities.In short, if you love the antics of Monty Python, the wit of Black Adder or the well crafted plots of the Shakespearean comedies -- or if you just love a good bawdy story with Elizabethan flare (and I dare say smell!) -- then you'll be delighted with this highly intelligent, hilariously bawdy, well told tale."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"Fiction isn't my bag normally, but Noble Smith has woven a tale of such magnitude that all who touch it shall be transfixed. I couldn't put it down and neither will you. Comparisons with Monty Python are much too easy. The only thing to say is that if you like Python, you'll like Smith. That's where it ends. The originality shines in the same light as &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; in that the reader is left dumbfounded at the source of its creation. This is a work of wonder, folks. Buy yourself this treat and thank your lucky stars for works like this that make us all believe in fiction again!"},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"Noble Smith - where are you? And why aren't you writing more???Anyone who reads Stolen From Gypsies will understand its nearly universal 5-star rating. You don't have to be a Shakespeare connoisseur or Anglophile to enjoy this hilarious verbal romp through a magical gypsy tale - although it helps! Never fear, there's a glossary in the back for those unfamiliar with terms like \\"fartleberry\\" and \\"shirt-lifter.\\" Noble's mastery of verbal repartee translates full-strength onto the page: when you hit one of the many hilarious verbal volleys, read them aloud and you'll be holding your sides with laughter.If you're looking for a baudy, somewhat raunchy, rollicking romp, do yourself a favor and pick up Stolen From Gypsies.

At the end of the story, a gypsy moth signals the protagonist, Godfrey, as to how to elude the machinations of the devil, to whom he has unwittingly sold his soul. Stolen from Gypsies is a joyous romp from start to finish, a sort of fractured fairy tale for adults, with all the traditional elements. Poor boy loves rich girl, she doesn't know he's alive, he becomes transformed after a magical encounter, the magician is not who he seems, and neither is the aptly named Dim Avenger, a soft hearted Robin Hood clone. The evil uncle, the clever servant, the Shakespearean identity confusion, the sea battle. It's all here, all wrapped up in a hilarious, farcical tale within a tale. As Godfrey learns and grows, so does Ambrosio. Thoroughly enjoyable, lighthearted, endlessly witty entertainment, sharp as the sword of the podesta's pasty and villanous son."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"Noble Smith's Stolen from Gypsies is a delight from start to finish. Smith is a storyteller extraordinaire and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a break from reality, but doesn't want to leave his brain behind in the process.

Do not read while your partner is sleeping- laughing out loud with abandon is the only way to read it- otherwise, constipated mirth may result in the need for one of the story's famed beet enemas."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"A completely first-rate novel, sublime in richly historical hysterical characterizations. In his first novel, Noble Smith fashions a completely original story-within-a-story. The subject, a smart and thumping love story which leaves you both wildly entertained, expanded in your vocabulary, and just a little more informed about the wild turns of history which by only the smallest chance may have turned out quite different for all of us.Smith's 'Gypsy' character breathes hope into our sometimes gray hearts that we all have, deep inside of us, an erudite, bold gypsy inner-being longing to break free from the humps which define us to sing our passions to the world. The story is told smartly through a decrepit writer-in-exile's re-telling of this fantastic story to his servant. With joy we watch the transformation both he and his main character makes throughout the book, tying up spectacularly in the end.Stolen By Gypsies is a read which will keep you on the edge of your seat, as empassioned as the Gypsy character who is striving to become his complete self. Highly recommended reading. Waiting anxiously for his next novel."},{"Title":"Stolen from Gypsies","review":"I cachinnated (see the glossary) until I cried.

Noble Smith has created a rich and detailed fantasy world for his &quot;book within a book&quot; while loading the &quot;real&quot; world of the narrator with juicy historical tidbits. Part of the fun of the book for me was translating the invented words with the helpful glossary in the back of the book. I laughed out loud at many points during the day it took me to devour this charming book. The humor is lavished over every word, but the book is not a hollow series of comic &quot;interlewds&quot; (to quote one of the characters); the central messages of looking beyond surface impressions, of faith in one's self, and of relishing the beautiful in the absurd are timeless and important. Who doesn't need to be reminded of these things from time to time? Calling it a comic fairy tale for adults is about as close as I can come to categorizing Stolen From Gypsies; it defies categorization while remaining totally accessible.

It begins describing the philosophes of the ancien regime, and ends with the Communist Manifesto. In between, it builds the bridge between the two.Breunig descibes each of the major European powers (England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and of course France), how their status quo was disrupted by the French Revolution and Napoleon, then how their reactionary governments tried, ultimately in vain, to stem the tide of revolution that swept Europe in the 1820's through 1850. One fascinating passage describes how the post-Napoleonic European leaders, desperately sick of war, struck a careful balance of power among themselves to ensure a steady, yet fragile, peace. Yet while maintaining this, the sovereigns (or most of them) ruthlessly crushed their internal conflicts, sometimes willingly accepting help from neighbors and formal rivals.This book is especially interesting to Americans looking to understand the relationships between European countries and the roots of modern Europe."},{"Title":"The age of revolution and reaction, 1789-1850 (The Norton history of modern Europe)","review":"Charles Breunig does a masterful job of painting a picture of a growing, developing Europe, in what many believe was the most remarkable period in European history.Breunig's scholarship and narrative style notwithstanding, the illustrations are excellent in providing a stimulating historical perspective.One expects that the French Revolution would be the centerpoint, but excellent pre-revolution observations and post-revolution results are treated as well. Breunig shows how the Industrial Revolution, in resource rich England, was the begining and the various European Revolutions were the results. The section on Russia and its gradual revolution is excellent on several fronts, not the least of which as a partial explanation for the second revolution in the early 20th century.&quot;Revolutionary Europe&quot; is an excellent reading experience for anyone from someone looking to be introduced to this exciting period to graduate student. Breunig's dry wit make this an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"The age of revolution and reaction, 1789-1850 (The Norton history of modern Europe)","review":"Everyone knows that the French Revolution began in 1789, but when did it end? In 1799, when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul of the Republic? Or perhaps in 1815, with the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty over France? One might even look ahead to 1848 and the deposition of France's last king, Louis Philippe. Even so, the aftershocks and consequences of the period 1789-1799 would take many decades to play out through the European continent and indeed the world. Asked what he thought had been the Revolution's influence upon world history, Mao's foreign minister Chou En Lai famously replied, \\"It is too soon to say.\\"_The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789-1850_, the late Lawrence University professor Charles Breunig's lucid treatment of the French Revolution and its European aftermath down to the social and political convulsions of 1848, explores the fall of the French monarchy and the republican experiments that followed, both as a series of events in their own right and as prologue to the European nineteenth century. The French Revolution and the reactions against it played out against the background of a wider transformation already well underway by 1789: the Industrial Revolution. As Breunig shows, the material changes in life wrought by industrialization had direct social consequences for Europe. As some reaped economic benefits and others found their means of employment and experience of life irrevocably changed, older structures of power became increasingly less tenable. The revolutionists of 1848 took their cue from the ideals of 1789, but those ideals were filtered through the concerns of the Industrial Revolution.The year 1789 is often considered the French Revolution's most 'revolutionary' year. But the French Revolution is perhaps best considered as a series of revolutionary moments which unfolded over a ten year period. The crisis of the French monarchy in 1789 was in essence a crisis of the royal treasury: the crown had borrowed beyond its means to finance foreign wars, especially the Seven Years War of 1756-1763 and the American Revolutionary War of 1776-1783, and lacked the means to compel the wealthiest members of French society, the aristocratic nobility, to pay their share of taxes. Simply put, the crown was bankrupt, and the price of greater taxation was to cede some measure of power to the aristocracy. Accordingly, in 1788 Louis XVI called the Estates-General, a representative body which had last met in 1614, to convene at Versailles in the spring of 1789. Once assembled, the nobles found the formerly quiescent Third Estate, representing all of non-noble, non-clerical France, unwilling to have its interests ignored. The merchants, lawyers, doctors and professional men of the Third Estate - the newly risen middle class of the eighteenth century - stunned crown, nobility and clergy by declaring itself the true representative of the French nation, in fact a National Assembly, and sat down to write a new constitution for France.In August 1789 the Constituent Assembly, as it now called itself, produced the remarkable document known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. It asserted the concept of natural rights enjoyed by all citizens regardless of birth or social station. The purpose of the state was the protection of those natural rights: \\"liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.\\" The Constitution of 1791 would not perfectly embody the ideals of the Declaration: it established property qualifications for voting, and preserved the institution of the monarchy. In fact the early years of the Revolution reflected an \\"essentially moderate\\" approach to reform. Nonetheless, the Declaration's core principles - natural rights, personal liberties, popular sovereignty and equality before the law - would stand to inspire many future generations of reformers, radicals and revolutionists. As Breunig writes, the Declaration was \\"a remarkable distillation of those ideals of the eighteenth century Enlightenment which became, during the first half of the nineteenth century, the gospel of European liberals.\\" \\"In a sense\\", he writes, the Declaration \\"links the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\\"How did France pass in two short years from an \\"essentially moderate\\" constitutional monarchy to the notorious and bloody reign of Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety (1793-1794)? The years 1791-1793 saw increasing radicalism among members of the Legislative Assembly and rising discontent among conservatives and royal partisans. In 1789 the Assembly addressed the fiscal crisis through nationalization of lands and property of the Catholic Church in France. The following year, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy opened a schism between those who accepted and those who rejected the required oath to the civil authority. King Louis XVI could not reconcile himself to the new regime and attempted to flee the country with his wife Marie Antoinette in June 1791; according to Breunig the so-called \\"flight to Varennes\\" was \\"the episode which probably sealed the fate of the monarchy.\\" Louis was not trusted after this. The radical Assembly faction known as the Girondins egged their colleagues on to a declaration of war against Austria in April 1792; within a year France was at war with no fewer than seven foreign powers including Austria, Prussia, Great Britain and Spain. By 1793 a Catholic-royalist rebellion centered on the northwestern Vendee region also threatened the government at Paris. The king, found to be plotting with Austria for the defeat of French armies and the suppression of the Revolution, was deposed in September 1792 and publicly executed in January 1793.For all their crusading zeal, the Girondins had opposed the king's execution. The votes in favor of execution in France's new National Convention legislature had come from Danton's extreme-left Mountain faction. With France fighting a major war and an internal rebellion, the Mountain resorted to the desperate tactics they believed necessary to safeguard the Republic. Girondists were placed under house arrest and emergency powers vested in the Committee of Public Safety under the enigmatic Maximilien Robespierre. During his \\"Reign of Terror\\" (July 1793 - July 1794) some 20,000 supposed enemies of the Republic were condemned and executed. Breunig takes care to note that only some 15% of the Terrorist regime's victims were aristocracy or clergy; the remainder were citizens who opposed (or were suspected to oppose) Robespierre's designs to realize his Republic of Virtue. Indeed Breunig notes the supra-political aspects of the Robespierrist regime and \\"the heart of the Terror - its semireligious, messianic character.\\" This can be seen in the attempt to replace traditional religion with the Cult of the Supreme Being. Our own day has seen multiple re-evaluations of Robespierre variously as \\"bloodthirsty tyrant\\" and \\"the incorruptible\\"; recent analyses have noted some of the positive developments of the Committee of Public Safety's tenure including successful economic measures and stabilization of a precarious military situation.By spring of 1794 opposition to the Terrorist regime had mounted from Dantonists, supported by those for whom the Republic had grown too virtuous, and also from radicals led by the fire-breathing Jacques Hebert. Robespierre succeeded in having first Hebert and then Danton guillotined. June and July 1794 saw the bloodiest days of the Terror with 1,300 executed in Paris. It was the last straw: on 9 Thermidor (July 27), 1794 Robespierre's fellow Convention delegates, fearing for their own safety, rebelled against him. Robespierre was arrested and the next day himself led to the guillotine.Robespierre's fall ended the Terror and opened the way to political stability for France under the Directory (1795-1799). It also opened a path of advancement for the young Corsican artillerist Napoleon Bonaparte, who first made a name for himself as a soldier of the Terrorist regime at the siege of Toulon in 1793 and then made himself the indispensable defender of the Directory with his \\"whiff of grapeshot\\" in 1795. From this point began his meteoric rise from mere soldier of the Republic to master of a new French Empire. Made commander of the French Interior Army, he broke the military deadlock in northern Italy, smashed the Republic of Venice and imposed harsh terms on Austria in the 1797 Peace of Campoformio. In 1798 he crossed with a large force to Egypt, there to crush the Mamelukes at the Battle of the Pyramids, campaign into Palestine and dream of the conquest of India. But while the Egyptian campaign burnished the myth of Bonaparte, it proved a strategic dead end. Nelson's victory at Aboukir left the French force marooned in Egypt; with political turmoil building at home and a new coalition forming against France (the Second: Britain, Austria, Russia), the conqueror's proper place was on the continent. Leaving his forces in Egypt he crossed back to France in 1799 and seized power as First Consul. By 1802 he had defeated Austria in Italy a second time, settled with Britain in the Peace of Amiens, and had himself named Consul for Life. In December 1804 he crowned himself Emperor.Napoleon's career embodied many of the leading trends of his age: as exemplar of the self-made man, the creative genius and even the Romantic hero, he was at once a product of the Enlightenment and \\"a son of the Romantic era.\\" Beyond his undoubted military genius, Napoleon undertook a series of remarkable reforms both in France and in conquered territories. In the spheres of taxation, central banking, education, bureaucratic reform and not least the law, Napoleon introduced a rationalism born of the Enlightenment but also a centralization of power which ran counter to Revolutionary ideals. For all the progressivism of the 1804 Civil Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure reversed the Revolutionary presumption of innocence, and the Empire under Napoleon prefigured the surveillance states of the twentieth century. The sum of Napoleonic reforms came to a reversal of the principle of popular sovereignty affirmed by the Declaration of the Rights of Man. While the Empire preserved the trappings of the Republic, it hollowed out that Republic in substance: \\"Napoleonic parliamentary institutions were from the beginning little more than window dressing for what was essentially a dictatorship.\\"Hostilities with Britain had resumed in 1803. Russia and Austria soon joined in and the War of the Third Coalition was on. The year 1805 was the decisive one: in October Nelson destroyed a French fleet off southwest Spain at Trafalgar; Nelson died in action but the French defeat \\"ended definitively all French hopes of challenging Britain's mastery of the seas.\\" Napoleon abandoned plans to invade Britain and turned his attention to the continent. In December he invaded central Europe, outmaneuvered an Austrian force at Ulm and inflicted a decisive defeat on a Russian-Austrian army at Austerlitz. Russia was knocked out of the war; Austria sued for peace. The humiliating Treaty of Pressburg ended Austrian influence in north Italy for ten years and in western Germany for all time. Napoleon could now organize the small German states into the French-directed Confederation of the Rhine, provoking a rash Prussian declaration of war in 1806. Moving impulsively to attack France ahead of his Russian ally, Kaiser Frederick William III suffered a double defeat at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt. Napoleon pushed east to meet the advancing Russians, fighting Alexander I to a draw at Eylau in January 1807 and defeating him at Friedland in June.The War of the Third Coalition drew Napoleon to the apogee of his power in Europe. Under the July 1807 Treaties of Tilsit, all Prussian territory west of the Elbe would be ceded to France. Beyond territorial concessions, Tilsit drew Germany and Russia into the so-called Continental System, which closed off European continental seaports from trade with Britain. Napoleon's attempt to coerce a seapower without a navy of his own was doomed to early failure. Britain countered with a blockade of French ports and an efficient smuggling regime, aided by poor enforcement and corruption on the continent. Napoleon added Austria to the scheme after a short war in 1809, but by the end of 1810 the Continental System was a dead letter. The victories of 1805-1807, however, permitted Napoleon the latitude to reorganize Europe as a new French Grand Empire. The Confederation of the Rhine at once established French hegemony in Germany and laid crucial groundwork for Germany's future through rationalization of the fragmented state system. In Italy, temporary exclusion of Austrian influence raised the possibility of an independent course to a nascent Italian nationalist movement. Generally, however, Napoleon's actions in conquered territories \\"suggest no profound understanding of national differences or sympathy with nationalist goals.\\" The greatest spur to nationalism in the Napoleonic era, as reflected in the writings of Johann Gottlieb Fichte among others, was resistance to Napoleonic rule. \\"In the final analysis,\\" concludes Breunig, \\"Napoleon came to be viewed more as a conqueror than as a liberator.\\"Despite a simmering guerilla conflict in Spain, the years 1810-1812 generally were ones of peace for Europe. By 1812 however the balance of power between France and her only viable continental challenger, Russia, had grown precarious. Relations had soured after Russia's withdrawal from the Continental System in 1810. Now Napoleon and Alexander eyed each other warily across Poland where each distrusted the other's intentions. In what he viewed as a pre-emptive move Napoleon launched in June 1812 an invasion of Russia with a force 600,000 strong, \\"probably the largest military force that had ever been brought together.\\" Despite sharp battles at Smolensk and Borodino, the Grand Army entered a deserted Moscow in September having failed to destroy Alexander's forces in the field. Facing a starvation winter in a land denuded of resources, Napoleon began his retreat in October. By the time he reached East Prussia in December barely 100,000 of the original force remained. Falling back to France to raise a new army, he was finally confronted with an effective coalition of all the powers. In March 1814 Russian troops marched into Paris.Napoleon's comeback from exile on Elba and desperate bid to reclaim the leadership of France, ending with the famous defeat at Waterloo on June 15, 1815 unfolded against the backdrop of a less noisy but crucial series of conferences and negotiations known as the Congress of Vienna. From September 1814 to June 1815 representatives of the victorious Great Powers assembled in the Austrian capital \\"to dispose of all the lands that had been conquered by the French armies over two decades.\\" Never a true congress, as the participants never met in plenary session, the conferees devised a set of treaties and alliances which would result in almost 40 years of peace among the Great Powers of Europe. Of its three guiding principles - legitimacy, compensation, and balance of power - the Congress applied the first two unevenly but hewed strictly to the third. In a key sense, by the time of Waterloo Napoleon was already an anachronism. Even as he fought the battles of the Hundred Days, a consensus had already been reached among the allies: a sustainable balance of power must be established on the continent of Europe. Henceforth there could be no more Napoleons.The foremost issue which confronted the luminaries of the Vienna Congress was the disposition of France. The Bourbon monarchy would be restored in the person of Louis XVIII. Initially inclined to treat France leniently to avoid planting the seeds of future conflict, the Congress imposed harsher terms upon the defeated power after the Hundred Days. France would pay a substantial indemnity and an occupation force of British, Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops would remain. An array of buffer states was established on France's eastern frontiers, including the Dutch Belgian provinces (today's Belgium), Prussian annexations west of the Rhine and a reconstituted Switzerland. Furthermore, France would return the art treasures looted by Napoleon's forces.Beyond France and her borderlands, the Vienna Congress powers sought variously to enlarge their spheres of influence or temper the appetites of their allies on the continent. Britain, with no territorial aspirations in Europe, adopted the role of moderator with respect to Prussian, Russian and to a lesser extent Austrian territorial aspirations. Tensions between Britain and the eastern powers came to a head over the question of Poland. Tsar Alexander proposed the handover of the entirety of Polish territory as a Russian protectorate; in compensation for his piece of Poland, the Kaiser Frederick William III demanded the whole of Saxony. The wily Talleyrand though the representative of the defeated power managed to insert himself into the proceedings, and engineered a \\"secret\\" alliance of Britain, Austria and France against Russia and Prussia. The threat of war persuaded the Tsar to moderate his demands: Prussia gained only one-fifth of Saxony and Alexander received only a rump Poland on which to conduct his constitutionalist experiments though in fact he ruled the Polish protectorate just as autocratically as he did the Russians.The final coalition against Napoleon had seized the moment of unity to forge the Quadruple Alliance first to defeat France and then to enforce the peace. However differences of opinion quickly arose over the proper role of the alliance in the new Europe. For the eastern powers, and especially Tsar Alexander, the Quadruple Alliance was the gateway to a pact among autocrats which would ensure the security of existing regimes against any resurgence of revolutionary or even liberal reformist ideals. To this end he concocted the Holy Alliance to which he persuaded the Prussian and Austrian monarchs to adhere. The Holy Alliance, which would be based on Christian principles of justice, charity and peace, would form the basis of bloody military suppression of liberal revolutions in Naples and Spain in the 1820s. For Britain's foremost diplomat of the era, Lord Castlereagh, the Holy Alliance was not only \\"a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense\\", but it also ran counter to the spirit of the Quadruple Alliance and offended British sensibilities against intervention in other nations' internal affairs.The paradox of British policy in the period after 1815 was the contrast between opposition to counter-revolutionary action on the continent, as in the Neapolitan and Spanish revolts of the 1820s and the 1830 Belgian revolt against Dutch rule - and even active support of revolutionary movements, as in Greece in the late 1820s - and strict reactionary policies at home. The governments of Liverpool and Wellington - the former \\"one of the most reactionary in modern British history\\" - saw harsh repression of political liberalism and nascent labor movements. However even as the landed aristocracy moved to protect its interests at the expense of commoners as in the Corn Law of 1815 and brutally suppressed 'illegal' labor gatherings in unpleasant incidents such as the 1819 \\"battle of Peterloo\\", the great impersonal social and economic forces of the Industrial Revolution conspired to undermine the old order. A rising class of bourgeoisie made prosperous by the new industrial economy demanded representation of its interests, while accelerating capitalist transformation yielded a gathering swell of urbanized industrial workers. By 1830, the tide had begun to turn in favor of the liberal reforms and laissez-faire free trade policies that would define British policy and frame her globe-spanning imperial dominance through the remainder of the nineteenth century.By 1848, the Europe created at the Congress of Vienna had reached a state of deep ossification. Extreme reaction had set in following the upheavals of the late 1820s and early 1830s, particularly in the eastern states of Russia, Austria and Prussia. The autocrats of central Europe could not quell the principles of legal equality and liberal constitutionalism which remained as the ideological legacy of the French Revolution. Social changes wrought by industrialization had worked to render much of the old order irrelevant to the circumstances of modern European life. And the complex atmosphere of emotionalism, individualism and rejection of capitalist materialism we call the Romantic movement served to accelerate a widespread sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo. The revolutionists of 1848 drew their senses of grievance from a wide spectrum and cannot be easily grouped or categorized. Their challenge to the monarchs of Europe met with various results, but generally with failure. In France, the king was forced to abdicate and a true republic succeeded to power, only to be usurped by Louis Napoleon. In Austria, the initially triumphant bourgeoisie paid the price for dithering and were crushed by Russian and Austrian troops. In Germany, the Kaiser's waiting game paid off as the Frankfurt Parliament succumbed to indecision and lack of a popular mandate. It offered the Kaiser the crown of a united Germany which he famously refused to \\"pick up out of the gutter.\\" The cause of parliamentarianism and of national unification had for the time being failed in Germany.By 1850 \\"the defeat of liberalism was nearly total.\\" Furthermore 1848 marked a sea-change in class relations: the bourgeoisie and the working class had initially collaborated to challenge the aristocratic powers, but under threat of force the middle classes had backed away leaving the workers exposed to retaliation and defeat. The victory of reactionary forces marked \\"the destruction of working-class hopes and illusions.\\" It was not by coincidence that Karl Marx published his Communist Manifesto in 1848. The lessons of 1848 fostered the creation of class consciousness among the urban working class: there would be no more collaboration with the bourgeoisie.Just as significantly, the year 1848 marked a shift in mood and perspective throughout the continent of Europe which Breunig characterizes as the death of Romanticism and the advent of realism. The disillusionments of 1848-1849 produced a \\"new tough-mindedness\\" that characterized succeeding generations. Contemplating the failure of their reform movements in the face of superior arms, Europeans concluded that \\"abstract ideals and principles were less important in securing their goals than were power and force.\\" Breunig's summation of the lessons of 1848 could serve as a key to his own sobering perspective on, not just the events of 1848, but the entire period 1789-1848, and perhaps to the general sweep of history: \\"... the abortive uprisings of that year seemed to prove that ideals were not enough, that in the last analysis physical force, material resources, and power were what counted in human relations.\\"The narrative, then, ends on a bit of a sour note. But the defeat of the 1848 revolutionists and the end of Romanticism did not mean the death of reform. The ideals of 1789 are now of course common currency in much of the western world, and resonate in the aspirations of countless millions across the globe, whatever their status in terms of gold, guns or material resources. For confirmation of the power of ideas and ideals in human events we have only to look to recent events in Tunisia, in Egypt and even in Chou En Lai's own China. What have been the consequences of the French Revolution for world history? It is, perhaps, too soon to say."},{"Title":"The age of revolution and reaction, 1789-1850 (The Norton history of modern Europe)","review":"What a significant little book; so packed with readable information and such a quick study of one of the most important eras of Western Civilization. This is the type of work which I call a \\"seed book.\\" It is a brief overview, done in a very scholarly manner, of the period 1789 through 1850, 61 years that changed the face of the world and how we perceive that world. Now before we go any further, do be aware that this is NOT a complete and comprehensive history and analyses of that period, it is a \\"survey\\" of that period. This work gives you the facts in chronological order, a very good idea of the impact each event had on the future of Europe, ergo, the world, and surprisingly, a very nice background to these events. You really could not ask for more of a book with only 304 pages, even if the print is rather small...which indeed it is. No, this work give the reader a pretty good idea of what went on and why and if the reader is interested or has more curiosity than an inanimate object, then this \\"seed book\\" should prod any reader into further reading and research. Lets face it, this is a fascinating period, a period which even to this day the events of those years are felt.Of course the center piece of this book is the French Revolution, Nepoleonic period and post-Nepoleonic era in Europe, process and outcome, but it also addresses the issues of the Industrial revolution in England and the situations I Russia, Austria, Prussia, Italy, England, and other European States. As another reviewer has so well implied, this work begins with the philosophies of the old, old regimes and ends with the Communist Manifesto.This is a well written work. I like to compare it to Will Durant's work addressing the same time period, but with Breunig's work we do not have the prosy style nor do we have Durant's political agenda slipped in here and there. This is not to imply that this is a boring academic work though. This is an extremely readable work; granted, probably not to every ones taste, but for those interested in history, then it is excellent. This is one book in a series of six works of the Norton history of Modern Europe. The second edition, the one I am reviewing here was published in 1977 and I must say it has aged well.Now please do not expect to read this work and become an expert on Revolutionary Europe. That simply is not going to happen. After all, there are literally hundreds of very large volumes addressing this subject; many to most in great detail. No, this is a survey book and should be read as such. Hopefully it will encourage the reader to continue this fascinating study. After all, history is us and as someone once said; to be ignorant of it will cause us to endlessly make the same errors over and over again.I highly recommend this one and if you feel you do not want to add it to your personal library, then it is certainly worth checking out from your local library and certainly worth giving it a read. This happens to be one of the books I carried in my swag bag and read at odd times while setting in parking lots, waiting for lights to change or at halftimes during ball games. This is certainly one of those books that offer dividends much greater than the amount of effort it takes to read.Recommend this one highly.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The age of revolution and reaction, 1789-1850 (The Norton history of modern Europe)","review":"This is an excellent, brief account of a critical period in European history.

Potted within its pages (382, excluding the index and bibliography), you will find fascinating references to just about everything of significance concerning the formation of the 'Gozan' or 'Five Mountain System' - its precedents in Sung China, its patrons and supporters in Japan, the temple builders, key figures, secular and religious, all the regulations, and all the myriad processes involved in the maintenance of these inter-linked temple complexes.Even at their best, studies like this can be tedious, in places, but this well informed account is never dry. It explores macrocosmic factors, and surveys microcosmic details. Collcutt conveys an almost organic picture of the entire complex of processes - social, technical,human and spiritual - which brought the 'Gozan' system into being and made it a living entity. While all of this was ultimately directed to one end - the spiritual life nurtured in the Sodo or monks hall, Collcutt's study makes us keenly aware of the managerial and administrative skills required to run such large complexes. Rather like their equivalent in medieval or late medieval Europe, these monastic institutions virtually became thriving 'businesses'- running large landed estates, even employing hired labour. Beating the Medici family to the game by several centuries, the Chinese Buddhists were the first people to print paper money - and lend it at interest. As with the European monastic institutions, corruption and worldliness sometimes took over. Similar traits sometimes characterised life in the Japanese temples. Collcutt's study can be statistical in places, but this is always tempered by the human interest - the notable figures and events which have shaped life in these temples. It details the virtues, vices and the vicissitudes, which have left their mark upon the Gozan system."},{"Title":"Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"Most readers who come to this text are, no doubt, overly familiar with the more playful spiritual intensity of Japanese Zen, whether it be through the writings of stoic mountain hermits (say, Dogen); the peripatetic musings of hip flask, sake swilling outcasts (say, Santoka Taneda or Ryokan); the no nonesense monastic types (say, Hakuin); the earthy, gritty advice for living in the modern world (say, DT Suzuki); or even the American literati influences (say, Gary Snyder).Far fewer readers, however, will be familiar with the logistical organization of Zen temples in Japan. As esteemed Japan expert Edwin O. reischauer writes in the brief preface, \\"It is ironic that Zen philosophy, which is commonly charaterized as being beyond words, has inspired millions of words in English print, whereas Zen instituions, though vastly important in many aspects of medieval Japanese civilization and in no way beyond description, has drawn so few.\\"Indeed.Yet, does a book about the logistical organization of Rinzai's Gozan (\\"Five Mountain\\") temples sound boring?Perhaps. But let me tell you: this text is anything but boring! Author Martin Collcut takes a seemingly mundane subject and delivers a delightfully informative product that will not disappoint even the most discerning reader. Moreover, he neatly ties the development of the temple system into the existing socio-political milieu of Medieval Japan.Quite frankly, this is a dream book for a Japanese history \\"otaku\\" (lit: \\"buff,\\" or worse, \\"nerd\\" or \\"geek\\") like myself: clear and detailed but highly readable, unlike so many other academic texts.Lastly, I do not think you need to have too much knowledge of Japanese history or even Buddhism for that matter, as Collcutt does a great job of keeping the reader informed and up to date. Roughly speaking, there are three main branches of Zen in Japan: Rinzai (founded by Eisai), Soto (Dogen), and the lesser known Obaku (imported by Chinese monks in the Tokugawa Era). This book, of course, focuses on how the first, Rinzai Zen, which mirrored the organization of its \\"five mountain temples\\" on the Chinese model (and literally had main temples on five mountain sites).Though this book is full of details, it exceedingly engrossing at every turn.

Written very well, with many footnotes giving all his sources and also keeping the Hebrew, Greek and Latin in tact were properly needed.Anyone who may have trouble with the few Hebrew and Greek words but really want to understand this in 'History of the Christian Church' might want to get a decent Bible Expository Dictionary, unless you are intrested enough in adding a few Lexicon TLOT/TLNT Hendrickson, TDOT/TDNT Kittel, NIDOTT and Exegesis/NIDNTT Zondervan, which can get very costly, but worth it if you are that intrested in furthering your studies. But if cost is a factor, definatly get a Bible Expository Dictionary which range usually between $15 to $30, unlike the latter which can go as high as over $800 to $1000.Here are a few I found at amazon which I have myself if anyone is that intrested in the Hebrew and Greek.Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words: With Topical IndexStrongs numricalExpository Dictionary of Bible Words: Word Studies for Key English Bible Words Based on the Hebrew And Greek TextsStrongs numricalMounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament WordsGK numrical with Strongs numricalTheological Lexicon Set (6 VOLUMES)Strongs numricalAmong Philip Schaffs other great works such as 'Creeds Of Christendom' and the monsterous volume work 'The Early Church Fathers' for example are...Creeds of ChristendomThe Early Church Fatherswhich help fill in the blanks and give more, fuller details to alot of places that were lightly touched on in 'History of the Christian Church'. So if you really enjoy this work I highly recommend the other works as well.Alittle back ground, Philip Schaff (1819-1893) was a German Reformed church historian, born in Switzerland. He was educated at Tubingen, Halle, and Berlin, and later took a position as Professor of Church History at Union Theological Seminary, New York.Schaff bases his work on the premise that church history in order to be valid and valuable must deal with three factors:1. God through Christ,2. man as a responsible moral creature, and3. satan as a real being employing the anti-Christ as his agent at the end of time.For anyone intrested in this study but finds this a bit dry to read, might be intrested in the A&E; 2 DVD documentry: Christianity the first 2000 Years. Although the DVD is not nearly as thourough as this work by Philip Schaff, it will help give you some visuals to make reading much more in depth and thought-provoking.Sold here at amazonChristianity-The First Two Thousand YearsStill intrested in this fine work of historical knowledge on Christianity, the chapter contents are as follow to give you something to look forward in your studies...[*] Volume IGENERAL INTRODUCTIONAddendaFIRST PERIODAPOSTLIC CHRISTIANITYA.D. 1-100.CHAPTER I.

Both times, the core textbook was Williston Walker - comprehensive, but dry-as-dust. My college professor told us that if you really want to dig deep, read Philip Schaff's \\"History of the Christian Church.\\" I did - it took me several years, off and on, but I read all eight volumes.The volumes were published (and revised several times) between 1858 and 1893, except for volumes 5 & 6, The Middle Ages, written by Philip's son David Schaff and published in 1907 & 1910 (after Philip's death in 1893). David Schaff's work is every bit as thorough, but the writing is not up to his father's high standards. The series ends with Beza and the close of the Swiss Reformation.The scholarship is quite dated, especially Vol. 1, \\"Apostolic Christianity,\\" which is essentially a late-nineteenth century introduction to the New Testament. That said, though, the virtues of the work far outweigh its shortcomings.Schaff writes beautifully, and from a broad-minded, nineteenth century evangelical protestant position. All his prejudices are right out in front where we can see them. He extols the many virtues of the various branches of the Christian Church, and he unabashedly condemns its abuses. Yes, Protestants get the better treatment; but when they acted shamefully, Schaff says so and calls them to account (see his chapter on Calvin and Servetus). I disagree with him in places - he has little regard for any form of mysticism (a symptom, no doubt, of his milieu of high modernist rationalism).I love this work for two reasons: first, it's all here - every writer, every renegade, every little sect, every doctrinal controversy - Schaff doesn't miss a thing. And second, Schaff writes beautiful prose. This is history written with heart and soul.If you want a comprehensive, devotional reading of church history (and are willing to invest the time), I can't imagine a better guide than Philip Schaff.p.s. Free scanned versions of this set are available from several sources: one is Google Books; another is an excellent freeware program called Bible Explorer."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"This 8 volume set by Philip Schaff is a masterpiece. Scholarship in the 19th century far surpassed what passes for most academic writing today. Well the above review gives the index. A casual perusal will give you a hint of the riches in these books. I doubt anyone would read them through cover to cover, but I use them for reference. Want to find out more about how the orthodox understanding of the trinity came about? It's here. Want to find out how the church got so involved in government and politics? It's here. Want to read about how the papal system developed? It's here. As things come up in discusions, it's ok not to know once. But the next time around, you should of come here already to find out a least an overview of the matter. It's a great tool.Though the content is available online, I highly recommend the print version, as it is a lot of reading material and looks nice on the shelf. Like you know what you're talking about."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Schaff's series is simply phenomenal. Why? Highly detailed work with a marvelous synthesization of human history and God's providence. Most Christian historians forget that history isn't about spitting out facts. History belong's to God and Schaff's great insight combines these important aspects to create a work that hides from nothing and reveals everything. His narrative is almost poetical at times. Schaff writes in a way that truly is beautiful. At times I wanted to read to my wife certain portions because it was so exquisite. It actually makes me disappointed in modern historical narrative.All in all, Schaff is fair in not supressing truth but being blatantly honest of the Church's history. Reading this series can be nothing short of having a powerfully captivating, realistically depicting, lovingly woven history of the Church. This series is a great aide to me in understanding why I am where I am at today, and where I can change to be faithful to the Word of God and His will for the Church."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Yes, it is written in 19th century, and not by Bart Ehrman, or one of the fellas of \\"Jesus Seminar\\"But if you really need a grasp of centuries of Church History you cannot go without this one.I have two sets: one in English (one pictured), and one in Russion (one I currently read). You see, this is a solid work. Not surprising it was translated by Russian brothers and sisters ;) Solid works deserve to be translated and respected.Sure, it may not be perfect. But it should not be ignored.I really and sincerely would love to have a similar compilation by contemporary scholar(s), but I don't think such work exists. I hope Baker, IVP, or some other Christian organization would consider producing church history set similar to Bible Commentary sets. That is, compiled by multiple scholars with respective knowledge in their field, for each period. Similar to \\"baker exegetical commentary on the new testament\\" or similar. There are several good commentary sets, but not many Church History sets.Whatever the case, reading all volumes in this set will absolutely certainly increase your knowledge of the subject, and it is written with Christian attitude too.Again, not some Ehrman-Bauer boloney.Schaff breaks Church History into 9 periods. Three in early history, three in middle ages, and three in modern history. And so far, from reading it, in my personal opinion Schaff did a great job, sonsidering the scope and caliber of the work.Actually very well written set! Please buy and read."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"It is excellent for students of a Bible College in MDiv ot Theology.

This covers from the Apostles to the European Reformation and just after. I love it for referencing Calvin, Luther, Augustinianism, Arminianism, Pelagianism, etc. I am especially thankful for its notes on Moderate Augustinianism! Arminianism was not the first response against late Augustinianism, This set has much to say about the progression of and acceptance doctrines in the church over time. I highly recommend it for historical referencing. This also shows that current five point Calvinism was not what the Apostles had in mind, as the foundation for it began several hundred years later in the late third century at least(see volume three)."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Want to know Church History this is the best resource for that. I am currently enjoying this set. Wow is all I can say"},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Let me begin by stating that I've read only the first volume of this set from cover to cover, having just sampled the others. My review is therefore a bit limited in its scope, particularly since the last volumes were written not by Philip Schaff but by his son, who may have imposed his own style and tone.Overall I liked the first volume, but as a history of the church it has too many weaknesses to earn a high rating. First of all, Schaff was too much of a Christian to write dispassionately. The book often lapses into what is closer to apologetics than to history, and at times you can almost see him holding his nose when he has to write about (ugh!) pagans. Even more objectionable in my opinion is the presence of numerous passages such as the following:&quot;As religion is the deepest and holiest concern of man, the entrance of the Christian religion into history is the most momentous of all events. [...] Jesus Christ, the God-Man, the prophet, priest, and king of mankind, is, in fact, the centre and turning-point not only of chronology, but of all history, and the key to all its mysteries. Around him, as the sun of the moral universe, revolve at their several distances, all nations and all important events, in the religious life of the world; and all must, directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, contribute to glorify his name and advance his cause.&quot; (pp. 56-57)This is a panegyric on the Christian religion, not history. And yet Schaff tells us that &quot;The historian must first lay aside all prejudice and party zeal ...&quot; (p. 25)Another drawback of this work is its age: it dates from about 1900. Age is not an issue in some forms of writing, but it is felt in this case. For example, Schaff tries to refute a date of 170 AD for the composition of John's Gospel, as was maintained by the Tubingen school in Germany. Decades after Schaff died, it was noticed that a papyrus fragment dating from the first half of the second century in fact contains a few partial verses of John, proving that the 170 AD date is untenable (see Bruce Metzger, &quot;The Text of the New Testament&quot;). Thus, although events proved Schaff correct in his judgment, someone reading only this book would be unaware of the most persuasive piece of evidence. Also, the bibliographic references, which Schaff clearly labored so hard on, are of course over a century old.In summary, this work shows its age and is often tendentious. However, the reader can find in these volumes a treatment of almost every main personage and significant event in the history of the Christian church."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"First, let me admit that I have read onlyportions of Schaff's work, so the 4 starsare just a guess and s/b ignored. While Ihesitate to write a review of anything I'venot read, once again I'll make an exception.The reason is that I have read the firstfour volumes of Warren Carroll's \\"History ofChristendom\\" and especially recommend volume4, \\"The Cleaving of Christendom\\" for balance.If one sticks to non-Catholic authors, oneis in danger of reading only half of history.Also good for balance is Thomas Woods' \\"Howthe Catholic Church BUILT Western Civilization\\"(emphasis in original). Woods' book isdelightful because it is mere history andmakes no theological statements. However muchis does not threaten anyone's theology, itis quite upsetting to most people's view ofthe historical role of Catholics."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"In comparison to older versions of the book, the latest publishing of the book is missing half a phrase.

Where's the humor, the cuteness, the life lessons hidden in amazingness? This book is basically saying one has no need for friends. That's a horrible message to send to anyone, kid or adult. Self dependence? What a load of *rubbish*!

I gave it one star simply because Zero wasn't an option.The book directly tells people to change their appearance so that they can conform to the rest of society. The \\"missing piece\\" gets up and rolls, and in so doing he \\"rounds off rough edges\\". From an allegorical perspective, perhaps that's not so bad. But this is cast in a literal context, of getting up and doing physical damage to one's self so that one may conform to the expectations of physical appearance with the peer group. Ewww.This book is \\"yucky\\" on another level as well. It's fairly well established that \\"The Big O\\" is slang for the female orgasm. As a writer for Playboy, Silverstein would absolutely have to be aware of this slang terminology. So again, there's a subliminal message that a girl must conform in order to be sexually attractive to others.This is where anorexia and bulimia take their toll on adolescent girls, who are trying to visually fit in with what TV and Barbie teach them to look like. The subliminal message of this book is \\"Conform, or Die Trying (and we don't care which)\\".Thanks but no thanks. I'll stick with \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" as a much better way of sending the same message."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who is in search of the perfect mate, thinking they will fill that empty void inside of them. It is also wonderful for children. This book teaches self worth in a simplistic and lively manner. It reminds you that everything you are in search of is truly inside of you."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Shel's this story about in-search-of-relationship is entertaining and enlightening.For a while, I had tried hard to be a Big O. It is an appealing notion, isn't it? When you are complete by your own and don't look for suppliment from your relationship, you are contented - by definition true of being completeness - and will not be disappointed by the unfulfilled expectation on the better half.If you can get the moral of the story, you can even get rid of the cruse of the myth of romantic love - there is an designated person in the world who perfectly tailored (by God?) for you. Thus, you can escape from all those illusion of falling IN love and suffering of falling OUT of love.I had had peace of mind for quite a while. But then, I felt stunted, not only because it was difficult to find another Big O (we all are missing pieces in nature, let's confess it), but also because I could no longer benefit from the relationship.Then, one day, I get another insight (owing to Grace?): the fact that 2 missing pieces will not perfectly match with each other is a given issue for all of us; it is through our efforts to work on it and through the process that we can make ourselves bigger and more complete.Given saying all these, I still appreciate very much for Shel's inspiration and highly recommend you to read the story."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Not only are the flow and details of this book amazing, but also the spirit and the hope that the story brings, my mother found this book in a box of things for hurricane katrina victims.

I think the subtleties of the different personalities might be over the head of children, but most adults will see just how spot on he is.I really really can't celebrate this book enough."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"This classic book was really written for children, but it has a powerful message for people of all ages!The drawings are simple but effective, and the story is one that we all can relate to. The Missing Piece starts out alone and is looking for someone or something to complete it. By the end of the story, The Missing Piece realizes he doesn't need anyone to complete him. He is already complete.This is a very quick read that can help build the confidence of a young child, and can help adults regain the confidence they may have lost somewhere along the way!"},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"This was a gift to me after a divorce. The content is simple yet profound and I love to share it with my children in hopes that they too will know that relationships are at their healthiest when people are whole and complete, rather than half of a whole like a friendship necklace (to the chagrin of tweeners everywhere!) ;) I now share this with others who are going through relationship troubles or struggle with their self-worth."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"A person who was one of the most influential in my life gave this to me as a gift.

It was well recieved."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"The Missing Piece is one of the greatest stories I've ever read, it just floored me the first time I read it and my entire family has fallen in love with Shel Silverstein.The Missing Piece Meets the Big O follows perfectly in those footsteps...where I could relate 100% with the Missing Piece, I think the Big O is slightly more feminine in nature, but both fable the woes of searching for meaning in our lives and what happens to us when we find it.As a sidenote...there definitely seems to be some sexual connotation with the Big O, and while I find the stories completely safe for my 5 year old, I think they offer a lot of great underlying tones for adults as well."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Hopefully if you have read this you have also read The Missing Piece.

A fellow co-worker was passing it around because he had received it as a gift and I really connected with it. The message is simple and the book isn't too preachy with it."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Whether simply a children's book or an adult self-help book, this one is a gem! Adorable simplistic line drawings that make you wonder how an artist is able to create such an expressive characters out of basic circle shapes. Matched with a story that can be taken lightly or taken to heart.Really, this is the journey of a character becoming a \\"whole\\" person...independantly being able to \\"roll\\" by itself. It also hints that to be happy in a relationship you must be your own independantly happy person...you can't rely on others to complete your deficiencies.Anyone who is a \\"relationship leapfrog\\" needs to read this book. It may even make you cry-and probably will make you laugh-at the similarities with your own experiences. It is also appropriate for children...it is never to early to introduce someone to lifelong happiness, independance, and stability.Rolling along..."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"This book is a great book for kids from one to ninety-two! I read this book with my friend's children in mind and I found that this book has an important message about recognizing who your true friends are and finding that one true best friend who &quot;fits&quot; your personality and lifestyle. I recommend children of all ages and children at heart to check this book out. As always, Shel Silverstein has a very innocent, colorful and fun way of looking at life and this book reflects it. It's a breath of fresh air. For a better understanding of this book however, I would check out Shel Silversein's &quot;The Missing Piece&quot; before reading this one -it's also a very cute book."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Three days after ending a relationship where I was constantly trying to be someone or something else in order to please my partner, I took a vacation that changed my life. On the first night of that vacation, while I was out with friends and family and the last thing I was looking for was another boyfriend, I met the most amazing person to enter my life so far. The next day, I found this book and decided to live my life like the big O. The man and I keep the book on our coffee table, and when we aren't rolling through the streets of the city, side by side, we go home to that wonderful story. Shel Silverstein has amazing insight. Every human should read this book."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"My girlfriend just gave me this book for Valentine's Day yesterday and I think it is one of the most beautiful books I have read. We had talked once about how we were looking for the piece that would fit with us, like that Lego piece that would finish the construction perfectly. It made her think of this book, which she had read when she was younger. The story is so sweet, but also very meaningful, because the Missing Piece learns to be complete all by itself and not have to fit itself into some other whole that isn't quite perfect. And I like to think that the Piece and the Big O live happily ever after. It is a great lesson for everyone."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"I bought this book along with &quot;The Missing Piece&quot; almost 10 years ago, when I was in college. My friend introduced me to those books, and I had to get my own copies. In fact, a good number of people among my circle of friends got their own copies as well.I think those two books are the only &quot;children's books&quot; I have in my possession, but they are among the most touching and most memorable of all the books I own and read. And even though they're labeled as children's books (and they sure look that way too), I feel they're a better fit (haha, no pun intended) for grown-ups.If you plan on getting this book (as you well should), then definitely get &quot;The Missing Piece&quot; as well. I don't think the story and the message of The Missing Piece fable is complete with just one book. You gotta get both books to fully appreciate it.Highest utmost recommendations. God, I love this book."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"Of all Of Shel Silverstein's works, Missing Peice Meets the Big O, is , by far, the book that must be a part of every person's library. And before serious relationships alter your life. It sums up the entire concept."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"I love this book to give as a graduation or coming of age gift. I especially love to to give this book to girls. The message of finding out who you are and not needing someone to make you complete shines through in Shel Silverstein style."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"This is one of those great &quot;meaning of life&quot; books that simply shows how relationships we have with any other human beings can be good only after we first accept ourselves. Coming from an abusive childhood I found it a wonderful book to help show me why I needed to learn to rely on myself FIRST and only then could I have deeper friendships and relationships. It is one of those books I will keep forever on my bookshelves as the concept is so critical yet it's done so simply that even children could understand the message."},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"this book really says nothing new (for how can the key to happiness ever be &quot;new&quot;?) but it expresses its truth in such a lovely and simple way that its brilliance just might leave you feeling blinded for a moment &amp; never let you go back to seeing things the same way as before.this is by far one of my favorite gifts to give ~ i consider it a must have for everyone: child, child at heart, or childless. and the sooner one begins to absorb such stories of strength the more likely they are to let their own little light shine!"},{"Title":"The Missing Piece Meets the Big O","review":"I was given this book as a 23th Birthday present by a man who is more than just a friend. He is the most gentle,kind and loving person I have ever met.We were having a great time together. Even though it was too short , it was so sweet. I like this book not only does it entertain but it educate us too to see how things are.This book means a lot to me as a reminder of the time we had. I am sure that I will never forget the meaning of the book as well as the person who gave me this book."},{"Title":"Basic Computers for Beginners","review":"Helpful, ...but not as simplistic as my \\"newbie\\" to computers senior parents needed. Still, if one has the most basic pc abilities already down pat, this book could be of some help."},{"Title":"21st Century Manzanar","review":"I was not predisposed to like this book. My mother is Nisei and spent the war in the camps (and like the author, I had two uncles already serving in the U.S. Army when Pearl Harbor was attacked), but I'm ambivalent about dwelling on the experience, I don't think a similar internment will happen in this country again, and going in, the plot of this book seemed to offer a strong whiff of unseemly paranoia.But it turns out, given the outrageous premise of fierce economic war between Japan and the U.S., resulting in the revival of Executive Order 9066, and a couple of unbelievable plot turns, that _21st Century Manzanar_ is a surprisingly engaging book. The plot and style shift easily between lyrical reminiscence, action thriller, character studies, and even the somewhat surreal (both drug- and faith-induced).When the story opens, David Takeda, a Sansei (third generation Japanese-American) in his late 40s from the Venice Beach area, has been reduced to earning his living by delivering eulogies for deceased relations and friends -- their numbers cut down by disease and racist violence. His brother Johnny is beaten to death before they get to Manzanar, in the desert of eastern California, but sister Kate and her children make it to camp. The bulk of the book recreates camp life and the characters' hopes for escape.Though there is naturally much Japanese-American content (even a 6-page glossary of Japanese and slang terms in the back), this is a highly multicultural novel. David's best friends are a black man and a Hispanic lesbian; also, Miyake significantly plays up the similarities in physiognomy, behavior, and values between Japanese and Southwest Native Americans. In camp one gets to know an alleged half Chinese, half Korean character -- a gay man named Bradley Kuwata, who serves as both a clown and an eventual saviour.The villains of the story -- particularly a Nurse Ratched-like camp director and a recurring soldier-guard figure -- are a little too unidimensional and caricatured (but this IS a satire), however the \\"good guys\\" are complex, ambivalent, and given to fatal changes of mind ... and their body count jarringly high.Even more surprising, Miyake mixes a fair amount of the lyrical with the profane. This book is not only a love letter to Japanese-Americans (the author reportedly included much of his own family's biographical details in the background of his hero), but also to Los Angeles. There's a strong sense of place in the opening chapters, and Miyake names names and recreates businesses that actually existed and he remembers fondly.Obviously, anyone with a Japanese background will easily slip into the milieu of this story, but I think even gaijin may find it worthwhile, for its grittiness, detail, and odd shifts of style and perspective."},{"Title":"21st Century Manzanar","review":"From Chapter One there is a natural flow to the writing. I came to care about the characters and wondered how I would face these same circumstances if they came to pass. This book opened a world to me that I knew very little about. Perry Miyake's book entertained and educated. He made the reader question and explore their world and at the same time, he kept the reader wondering what the next paragraph would bring."},{"Title":"21st Century Manzanar","review":"This is a wonderful book on lots of levels. The description of growing up in Venice is what I enjoyed the most, the food, the people, the geography, the little tid bits about the language. Venice, and I mean the Venice that the author describes, as opposed to Venice Beach, is a community of many different people -- Japanese Americans, Latinos, African Americans, Whites, and his attempt to capture a sense of that world is honest. The story, about a return to Manzanar due to fall out from economic competition with Japan, is a clever way to relate the point of view of a Sansei, one who never experienced the camps, but who (like any thinking Sansei) has imagined what life was like there, who also must have sensed, if not heard from his parents, the pain, confusion, and general oppression they experienced. Those interested in learning about such a perspective will enjoy and appreciate this book. One only hopes this is the first of many attempts by this author."},{"Title":"21st Century Manzanar","review":"From Chapter One there is a natural flow to the writing.

I had heard about the author, but didn't know what to expect. From page 1, I was thoroughly engrossed in the story of a family whose lives were turned upside down by an economic was with the Japananes and its byproduct: the reissuance of an exective order banishing all Japanese to inernment camps--Manzanar, in California.

It's smart and spare and left me wishing for more--despite a very satisfying ending that I won't give away."},{"Title":"Teleplay;: An introduction to television writing","review":"This is probably the best short book on Television script writing. Trapnell was the chief scriptwriter for a variety of golden age TV including Maverick and Yancy Derringer.

I have now purchased an extra copy for my son. Even though it already is about a century old, much of the information contained in it is still extremely valuable today for campers and hikers. My friends call it 'the log cabin bible'."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"This book is a classic, especially in the sense it is somewhat old fashioned in its basic approaches when compared with newer books. For example it examines statistics and entropy from the ergodic as opposed to the ensemble approach. Information Theory and role of symmetry and symmetry breaking is not treated in detail. However I can't hold these omissions against the book since these developments happend mostly in the late 70s.What Landau does here, and which in explicably very few Statistical Mechanics books do nowadays, is the full Gibbs Formalism. Not only is the Gibbs Formalism more compatible with Quantum Mechanics, it can also fits in beautifully with Ensemble Statistics and Inofrmation Theory. More over, it is at once clear Maxwell and Boltzmann statistics are only special cases of the Gibbs formalism, and can be easily shown in a few lines.What Landau does, is to gave an elegant and cohesive view the trully fundamental features of Statistical Mechanics. Chapters 1-6 of this book alone displays a deeper level of understanding than whole books that have been written. If you are interested in Statistical Mechanics at all, this must be a centerpiece of your library."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"This is the first volume of the Statistical Physics of Landau, Lifshitz. It's, of course, an extraordinary book, coming from these authors. The book starts with a chapter which defines entropy and derives its main properties. Then comes a masterly chapter on Thermodynamics where the criterion for equillibrium is that the entropy be maximum. The things they derive from that! Now and then I like to reread this chapter just for fun! After that statistical mechanics of equillibrium is constructed along the lines of Gibbs, starting from the microcanonical distribution, wherefrom the others are derived. Applications then start. Thermodynamical equillibrium in General Relativity is treated, as is gravitational collapse of stars. Chemical equillibrium is wonderfully done, being applied also for relativistic reactions among elementary particles, as neutrinos. There is no other book even close to this, as physics is concerned."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"This is the Volume 5 of the famous Course of Theoretical Physics by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz. All serious students of theoretical physics must possess the ten volumes of this excellent Course, which cover in detail and rigour practically all the branches of theoretical physics. The Volume 5 treats the subject of classical and quantum statistics. It contains an unusual approach of these subjects, based on the general Gibbs method, avoiding the introduction of ergodic hypotheses and, in the case of the ideal gas, of &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities, which are difficult to justify and serves only to obscure the exposition. The book is complete and contains chapters not usually found in other similar books, such as the chapter on second-order phase transitions. The clarity of exposition and rigour is notorious in this book. A magnific book!"},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"This book covers a lot of material in a fairly straightforward order - but it's very dense and not a lot of helpful examples. Good for reference, but Pathria is probably better if you're going through grad level stat mech for the first time."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"This textbook is hardly to be surpassed by any other treatment of the subject. Originally written in 1937-1939, the treatment provides a bridge between the classics (Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs) and the then new world of quantum mechanics.What really impresses me is its modernity in approaching the subject from the full quantum point of view, using quantum statistics and density matrices from the outset. This is unifying and economic at the same time. Moreover, time and again I have found that many \\"modern\\" concerns in equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, like, for instance, the issue about the equilibration of quantum many-particle systems, echoes opinions and insights already stated in this textbook. Everytime I pick my copy to take a glance I realize how puny such acclaimed books like L. Reichl's or the new M. Kardar's ones are (despite their many merits).There may be more gentle introductions to statistical mechanics out there (choose one), but this book makes an ideal 2nd. reading. This is the book that, together with S.-K. Ma's and K. Huang's books on the same subject, will make you a pro."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"no words can describe the richness and clarity of this book.the description of Maxwell's distribution, Gibbs formalism,etc...all with marvelous clarity and rigour. Everyone who wants to learn statistical Mechanics (under and graduates) MUST read this book."},{"Title":"Statistical Physics","review":"Dont listen to people who tell you this is a classic text. Yes this is classic because everyone says so but no one has really learnt anything new from it.If your intention is to understand thermodynamics and stat mechanics, this is the wrong book. If you are already a master of the subject, then Landau will converse with you. Otherwise he talks to himself!In other words this is bed time reading for the expert (everything in it is right), but is completely useless as learning material.Of course if you are like everyone who thinks this is a \\"must have\\" (and cannot read) for every physicist, just buy it and put it in the shelf.

Within moments he is dragged to the Parisian police headquarters where a beautiful redhead he never met before kisses him in greeting as her \\"fiance\\". Soon he is neck-deep in engaging intrigue with murderous, \\"I love being evil\\" communists, the arch-typical beautiful-woman-he-isn't-sure-he-can-trust-but-must, the crusty Colonel whose training inspires every setback, the high level politician-traitor, and other familiar types. An excellent writer, Parker phones in some of the characterization, sure, but the action is non-stop and intelligent. His vast experiance living in Europe informs every page - the city and era come alive.This author, an differant Robert Parker than the Boston writer of the Spenser private eye books, was AP's bureau chief for Western Europe in the 1930s, then shifted to AP bureau chief for Eastern Europe in 1939 - just as WWII basically broke out on his beat. During the war he worked for America's OSS, precursor of the CIA. He wrote a fascinating, very readable and entertaining memoir in 1944, \\"Headquarters Budapest\\", chronicling his first person witnessing of the war breaking out. He makes clear a very confusing time. Out of print, this is a lost classic of a globe-trotting foreign correspondant when that job held the highest romance in people's imaginations.SEE: (Mass Market Paperback))]]HEADQUARTERS BUDAPEST.Headquarters BudapestIn 1959 he wrote the excellent action novel \\"Passport to Peril\\" about a foriegn coorespondant sneaking into communist Hungary of a forged passport to chase a story.

His story forgotten, he jumps from the train with the man's beautiful secretary and goes through a whirlwind adventure. The better book of his two novels, his excellent writing makes exotic Hungary a welcome character. Except for the evil, repitilian Nazi villian, characterization matches plotting in excellence.

His theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are known as \\"genetic epistemology\\".He states in the Introduction to this book, \\"The study of sensorimotor or practical intelligence in the first two years of development has taught us how the child, at first directly assimilating the external environment to his own activity, later, in order to extend this assimulation, forms an increasing number of schemata which are both more mobile and better able to intercoordinate... We must now study the second aspect of the evolution of sensorimotor intelligence ... it is the subject's own interpretation of things which we must now try to analyze.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"Space at this stage is always imbued with a sort of solipsism or at least egocentrism, but an egocentrism unaware of itself.\\"\\"Finally ... the child henceforth conceives of his own body as being inserted in the external causal series, that is, as subject to the action of things as well as a source of actions which operate upon them.\\"\\"For the first time the subject can really place himself as an element, at once both cause and effect, in the context of a universe which transcends him everywhere.\\"\\"'Faster' in this case simply means 'more easily,' 'with less effort,' etc., but the child does not take into account the relation between time and the space covered.

Of all the chess books I have seen geared purely toward the beginner, I found this to be the clearest, best organized, and, just as the subtitle claims, it is \\"A Picture Guide to The Royal Game.\\"Lots of pictures help explain the moves and motions of a piece in the context of a larger strategy. Chernev and Harkness used photos of the board as well as standard board drawings. They require modernized, as the photos are a bit blurry, and the drawings have an old newspaper keyline look. The copy is succinct, but not dry. As a reader, I found it less clinical than many of the chess books with dozens of lines per opening.This is a long way from anything Lasker or Fischer wrote, but the audience intended here is looking to play the game effectively, unworried about becoming a grandmaster. At least, not yet.The content list breaks things down to subsections like \\"How the King Moves and Captures,\\" and \\"How the Pawn Captures 'en passant.''\\" They provide a special section cautioning the new player of common mistakes, like \\"Premature Attacks,\\" and \\"Pawn Grabbing with the Queen.\\" This is invaluable because young players routinely shoot for point control over game control.I fully recommend \\"An Invitation to Chess\\" by Irving Chernev and Kenneth Harkness. Use this to teach your children, or use it to study up when they start to beat you.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"An Invitation to Chess: a Picture Guide to the Royal Game","review":"Though this book is getting a bit old, a better beginners book has yet to be written.

Basically, a snippet of plot description from &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is used as a lead-in to each chapter, which then heads into dry sociological analysis.Why is it I have the suspicion that this book originally lacked any mention of the Sopranos, but then received the snippets, the title, and the heavy promotion to get some portion of the Soprano fan market? I guess it worked, I bought it without taking too much of a look at it.It isn't even very good sociology. It makes all sorts of claims and statements without citing statistics or having footnotes.Not really worth it. Browse it in the bookstore and decide for yourself, but there really isn't much here."},{"Title":"Tony Soprano's America","review":"This is an awful book. It purports to be some kind of sociological analysis of the cultural forces shaping the Sopranos.It is, instead, a slanted political diatribe, essentially blaming all our ills on a loss of collective social sensibility and retreat from political liberalism.That's rank B.S. I consider myself a liberal (believe it or not) but do not blame the forces of social disintegration solely on a recent shift in our political winds.I don't know that I even agree with one of the author's key assumptions: that we care less about one another now. Some communities and neighborhoods are more tightly knit together than ever before. We move steadily toward a more orderly, efficient and respectful society, despite our mistaken retreat from social liberalism."},{"Title":"Tony Soprano's America","review":"If David Simon's personal values and political orientation are crucial to your life, don't miss this book by any means. If you aren't aware of what his personal values and politics are, just watch the editorial columns of your local newspaper for 3 or 4 days, focusing on the writers of whom you've never heard or cared. If you don't want to spend even that much time, I'll mention that Simon appears fascinated by redistributionist cant and utopian (read as impractical and impossible) social democracy. He doesn't care much for any of the national administrations in recent years, including that of the Clintons and seems to wish we'd have something along the lines of a French or German polity of the last half dozen years. None of that is illegal, although I tend to think that the concepts are foolish and impractical. What did offend me (more than my lost $15 or 20 purchase price) was the shameless appropriation of David Chase's and James Gandolfini's work to sell social and political ideas that are barely relevant to it, if at all. If you don't know or care who David Simon is or what his personal critiques of America are (and he ain't Tocqueville by a long shot) save your money and effort and avoid this dime a dozen rant."},{"Title":"Tony Soprano's America","review":"This book represents a new low in social and political commentary.Disguised as an analysis of the Soprano's success and how that reflects on American Society is a complete farce. The irony is that the author is pushing his Western European Socialist agenda using the guise of one of the more sucessful and profitable American TV shows of the past decade.Would anyone buy this book without the Soprano's hook?It's not even well written. The Soprano's themes don't even fit into the commentary that follows in each chapter. It's amatuerish at best and I've seen better writing in high school news papers."},{"Title":"Tony Soprano's America","review":"The author claims this TV drama portrays contemporary culture. What about 'Father Knows Best', or 'Mayberry RFD', or 'All in the Family'? Weren't they all hit shows in their day? Is 'The Sopranos' a modern dress version of 'I, Claudius'? Would the plots be usable for 'At Home with Cesare Borgia'? Can a work of fiction ever be a measure of society? Perhaps its popularity is due to its dealing with usually unreported facts (like 'The Untouchables'). Or the fantasy of a strong and powerful man who can do as he pleases (think of James Bond or a John Wayne film).I wonder how reliable are its statements? Page 9 claims the murder rate of America is \\"ten times higher than Europe, Canada, and Japan combined\\". But the rate of violent deaths in America is less than in many European countries or Japan, and just above Canada's! Page 11 claims poverty was not a social problem before JFK! That would be news to FDR or Truman. Simon uses his sociological imagination to analyze this show as a case study. This would be a better book if it was based on a real \\"Middletown\\" rather than a fantasy TV drama.Page 14 talks about the pursuit of financial success as if this was strange, but De Tocqueville said the same thing around 1835. Did they have today's problems then? Simon then says America is \\"anti-intellectual\\" because success involves making money, not education! But what about Europe and its history? Is there much difference? Page 16 talks about putting businessmen into government. Was it different under King James II, Louis XIV, or the Caesars? Page 157 says people can \\"keep only $1 in every $2 they earn over $5000\\"; he needs to do better research.Chapter 6 compares crime in America to a department store of many levels, from the bottom to the top. Street gangs, organized crime, white-collar crime, banks and major corporations, the criminal justice system, and, crime in Government Intelligence Agencies. I found this the most interesting section of the book. Are we doomed? Chapter 8 contrasts the realities of everyday life to what we learned in Civics Class. Simon claims a bewildered and disillusioned public react with skepticism and cynicism. And this keeps people from acting to correct their problems.Chapter 9 proposes solutions to the many problems of today's America. Simon correctly states that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without collective action. I think the same history tells us that his solution is worthless (\\"join a local church ... oppose environmental destruction ...\\"). If the problems are caused by the corporate control of politicians since the 1860s, then the solution is to rebuild democracy by eliminating corporate power on the state and national level. Other books have made this point (\\"Wealth and Democracy\\" by Kevin Phillips). You must start with a new political party that is NOT controlled by the \\"two party system\\". It won't be easy. Corporate power, like hell, is not easily conquered."},{"Title":"Tony Soprano's America","review":"One David Simon is a famous author who wrote Homicide and The Corner. He has his own Amazon author page. He's also known for the TV show The Wire. He's awesome.This is apparently a different David Simon, but the amazon Kindle store shows both authors in search results. That is certainly not the fault of the less famous author, but it does lead to some confusion.As far as this book goes, skip it. It barely glances off the Sopranos TV show, noting the same paradox every TV reviewer has mentioned since Season 1: How can Tony be such a loveable character when he is so cruel and violent, selfish and lazy, etc., etc.? The answer isn't that difficult to figure out, and it was even mentioned in the show. Sociopaths can be charming. We get it.After asking that very basic question, Mr Simon spends the rest of the book making the case that America is in moral decline. Evidently he never saw Public Enemy with James Cagney (also featured in The Sopranos.) Evil anti heroes can often be well liked. It's no recent development. My politics are pretty similar to Mr Simon's. It's not that I disagreed with him... it's that nobody needs to pay to be preached at for an entire book. This book does not inform or entertain... it's a whiny diatribe."},{"Title":"Redneck Haiku","review":"Mary K. Witte, Redneck Haiku (Santa Monica Press, 2003)What would Jim Goad do?That was what I kept thinking as I turned the pages in this small tome. Would the author of the celebrated, reviled Redneck Manifesto be deeply offended, or would he be laughing his ass off?Probably both.The worst factor in the writing of American haiku these days, and it affects almost every otherwise-non-poet (and far too many actual poets) who attempts to write haiku, is the slavish devotion to 5-7-5. Pick up a few books on how to write haiku, people. Or a few books of haiku by recognized American masters, or recognized Japanese masters translated by someone worth their skin. 5-7-5 is an upper limit, not an upper AND lower limit. The shorter your haiku, the better. Slavish devotion to 5-7-5 leads to filler. Yes, even in haiku. There's more than one piece here that could have used a few words carved off here and there. (That said, there are some surprisingly excellent pieces as well.)Now, ask yourself the question: will you feel guilty laughing at stereotypes? Sure, it's a redneck writing about rednecks (Witte, according to a recent interview, grew up on a farm outside Tulsa, and swears that some of the events she depicts in this book really happened to family members of hers), but do you feel guilty for laughing about it? Maybe you should. That said, this stuff ranges from the grimly amusing to the down-and-out hysterical. If Jim Goad wants to kick my ass for thinking so, that's his right, and I'd probably let him do it, too. ***"},{"Title":"Redneck Haiku","review":"Follow the condensed adventures of Bubba, Flo, Wanda, Jake, and the feisty Grandma (\\"Last Las Vegas trip / spoiled by Granny's indecent / exposure arrest\\") in this amusing little book.

As the pages turned, I'm afraid that it became a bit of a one-trick pony for me. Redneck humor can be very silly and funny, but it can pall quickly if you're not careful.

The timing was actually fortuitous- I appreciated his experience in the islands after having had my own; his informed mine beyond what I could have gained and Twain is Always a fun read."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's letters from Hawaii","review":"Having just finished reading Twain'sRoughing It, and having received this book as a gift, I decided to read them back to back. This is a compilation of the correspondence Mark Twain was hired to write from Hawaii (then the Sandwich Islands) for the California newspaper the Sacramento Union. These letters were written before he had published his first book, so he was still young and inexperienced as a writer. Yet all the elements of classic Twain are in here--the humour, the keen observation, the ear for vernacular speech. It is informative to notice that he used much of the material from these letters--at times verbatim--to create the last few chapters of \\"Roughing It\\". I would almost recommend reading \\"Roughing It\\" instead of these letters because the writing is more polished and edited for more readability, were it not for the fact that the letters contain some very interesting material that does not appear in \\"Roughing It\\". Specifically, Twain does an excellent job covering the trade and commerce of the Islands, specifically the whaling and sugar industries (I am a sucker for 19th century whaling stories), and delivers an exclusive report on the fate of the clipper ship 'Hornet', a ship that completely burned while on the open sea, stranding 31 men in open boats near the Equator. One boat made it to Hawaii and Twain was able to get a report off to California, the first anyone there had heard of it. This report later bacame the source for his piece \\"Forty-Three Days in an Open Boat\\".I would recommend this book to those interested in early Hawaiian, or even California, history and those who would enjoy some early Mark Twain. The subject matter jumps around a bit, as is the nature of this kind of compilation. The introduction by A. Grove Day is very informative and helpful for placing the readings in context. The reading is not always easy but usually entertaining."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's letters from Hawaii","review":"What is it about the Hawaiian Islands that is so profoundly affecting? Twain was the ultimate skeptic, yet the Islands won him over in a minute. This collection of newspaper columns tells us why, and it is story that remains relevant to Island visitors and lucky residents. Twain was as well travelled as anyone of his day, and had no trouble identifying Hawaii as not just a pleasant place, but a unique place on earth. He hoped to live out his days on the Islands, but never made it back. Modern travellers sometimes wonder about the attractions of the Islands versus other places with warm climates. No one has explained it better than Twain."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's letters from Hawaii","review":"This book is an excellent and quick read.

There are the obligatory humorous stories, but there are also perceptive descriptions of the Hawaian economy that foreshadow \\"Life on the Mississippi,\\" itself a precursor of \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\" Other letters deal with the Hawaiian scenery at the time and its mode of government, in most ways similar to state politics in California.

It appears to be brand new and unread.The young Mark Twain is a character I hadn't met before. He was fresh from the goldfields and San Francisco -- and was fascinated by the beauty and grace of Hawaiian life. He wasn't Politicaly Correct in his view of the Native Peoples, but then - - seeing them as equals was not thinkable in the 1860s.Nevertheless, his descriptions of songs, dances, chants, and especially hula are a valuable view of the authentic artistry. I have always questioned if hula and chants had become distorted during their periods of banishment by the Missionaries. I feared that what I saw at festivals today had been corrupted and \\"interpreted\\" by today's cultural masters.Not to worry. What Twain described seems to be identical to what I see and hear today. The arts may have gone underground, but they were tended and cherished by genius.A culture is termed \\"wealthy\\" if it has enough leisure time to develop a high art. By these terms, the Haida of the Pacific Northwest and the Native Hawaiians were as wealthy as any Aztec. They just didn't have metal to work with, and didn't need it, actually.Twain went to visit Kilauea Volcano, then, as now, in eruption.His enjoyment of social events, both high and low, make his stay in the islands what every traveller dreams of. He was enchanted.Usually I pass on used books; but this one is a keeper.Beverly in Honolulu"},{"Title":"Mark Twain's letters from Hawaii","review":"This is the audiobook edition of a collection of dispatches that Mark Twain wrote, as a newspaper correspondent, to the Sacramento Daily Union in 1866 during his 7-month sojourn in Hawaii. Mark Twain impressionist McAvoy Layne very ably does the reading for the audiobook edition, bringing Mark Twain's written narrative to life.Letters from Hawaii provides a fascinating look at 19th century Hawaii -- the people, royalty, customs, culture, neighborhoods, infrastructure, commerce, government, volcanos, valleys, beaches, sea -- as well as a sprinkling of Mark Twain's inimitable humor. History buffs and Hawaiiana buffs will find Twain's first-hand, boots-on-the-ground observations of 19th century Hawaii uniquely satisfying.I found almost every dispatch riveting. One that comes to mind now as I write this mini review is Mark Twain's account of his visit to the active volcano, Kilauea, on the Big Island, which he viewed both during the daytime and at night. In addition to Twain's powerful visual imagery describing the lava flows, he also interestingly describes the sounds of the volcano. \\"It makes three distinct sounds - a rushing, a hissing, and a coughing or puffing sound; and if you stand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine that you are sweeping down a river on a large low pressure steamer, and that you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers, the puffing from her escape pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her wheels. The smell of sulfur is strong, but not unpleasant to a sinner.\\"Whether you are a Mark Twain buff, history buff, travel story buff, kama'aina or a malihini, chances are you will find this book enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mark Twain's letters from Hawaii","review":"This book is easy and interesting reading.

I read this rendition of Twain's reaction to 1866 Hawaii for a class in Hawaiiana. Being born and raised an &#34;island girl&#34; I was eager to see if he would capture the sensitivity and lifestyle of the Hawaiian people as he had with his &#34;on spot&#34; descriptions of characters in his many other writings. I was not disappointed. You see, living on an island dictates a particular way to live for its citizens having the major land mass 2,500 miles away. Your word is good as gold, your share with each other and do not rape precious resources (fish, seaweed, land), color of your skin means nothing except for the goodness in your heart. Being humble, tolerant, gracious, and respectful is what is needed when you live in the close confines of an island. In1866 Twain with his senitive awareness recognized this and writes beautifully about it.I have sent Mark Twain's Letters from Hawaii to several of my mainland friends and am sure there will be more sent in the future."},{"Title":"Biblia Sacra Latina Ex Biblia Sacra Vulgatae Editionis. Sixti V. et Clementis VIII","review":"'The Vulgate Bible' is the traditional name given to the Bible translated into 'common' or 'vulgar' Latin -- in the aftermath of the breakup of the Roman Empire in the West, connections were lost with the Greek East, and languages began to differentiate in various ways, with Latin becoming the 'lingua franca' of the time. By the seventh century, a Bible put together with translations from Jerome and others became the common bible for the West. This edition follows that translation (the original biblical texts were in Hebrew and Greek), following the ordering of Clement, pope in 1592 (rather late in the day; prior to this, there were different orderings of the Bible, and there is still variation between denominations as to ordering and which books get included).This version includes both the Gallican and Hebrew Psalters side by side (on facing pages), as there is sufficient authority to attest to the validity and integrity of each. Jerome's prologues are included here, placed according to the biblical books' arrangement (not as Clement's printing had it); Clement's more modern division is retained for books that for Jerome were joined -- I and II Samuel, I and II Kings, I and II Chronicles, and Ezra-Nehemiah were each single books for Jerome, but modern chapter/verse/book division has them separate, and for ease of modern scholarship, that is retained here.The text is printed 'per cola et commata', that is, without punctuation and divisions that would not have appeared in the original Hebrew or Greek manuscripts (many people do not realise that the earliest manuscripts lacked punctuation, chapter, verse, and book designations; many even lacked spaces between words, which thankfully has been incorporated here). Capital letters are used for proper names and sacred names/terms.Variants are included, but this is not an exhaustive manual of variations, so only a few primary authorities for variations are cited in general.The text of the Bible, from Genesis to the Revelation, with some apocryphal books, prologues, notes, and even the preface, is all in Latin, the Latin of the Vulgate, which places it several centuries later than 'classical' Latin of Cicero and Catullus, but centuries prior to 'church Latin' proper. There are nearly 2000 pages in two volumes, bound with strong binding and a silk page marker for each sewn into the binding.Meant for scholars, its use is probably not really appropriate for 'church' use -- given its lack of punctuation, it isn't a text from which to read aloud generally. However, it is a very useful text for those who wish to study the development of Bible -- while it is more 'in vogue' to study the earliest, original language editions, it is undoubtedly true that the Bible in Latin has had perhaps the greatest effect on overall Christendom for the longest period of any language for the Bible, probably rivaled only by the current linguistic champion, English.Confitebor tibi Domine in toto corde meonarrabo omnia mirabilia tua!"},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"Michael Pye creates a vivid portrait of a real-life 17th century woman. His fictional depiction of the non-fictional Gretje Reyniers is mindful of Defoe's characterization of Moll Flanders in his novel of the same name. For this alone, The Drowning Room is worth reading. However, if you're not a fan of slow-paced novels, 17th century history, or you're more intrigued with plot development, dialogue and/or other elements of fiction, don't waste your time . . . you wouldn't make it past page 10."},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"An excellent adventure story with a wealth of small details that actually make the historical period come alive, like being transported through time. Literary and sophisticated, worth a reader's time"},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"The author has an interesting voice, and some of the scenes, like the drowning room, are quite striking. Mostly the book is sensory rather than descriptive in that the author creates an emotional state for the reader rather than conveys information. For example, I understood the interior world of the main character, but I had a hard time picturing her surroundings. It's also challenging because the \\"story\\" is not linear or very satisfying in the end. I imagine The Drowning Room would be better in one sitting, rather than over a few months like I read it. Overall, I was disappointed because I hoped to learn more about life in New Amsterdam, but I imagine this would be a refreshing read for the right reader."},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"I actually picked up this book without reading what it was about... big mistake!! It's about out of my usual league but even so, it's not that bad.I'm only on page 60 right now, and it really is a very slow moving book. You have to read a lot into what it is you're reading, rather than just accepting it, otherwise you'll have it thrown out in no time!!I guess some interest in how life would've been like in the 17th century would help you make it through this book. But, having said that, I hadn't a clue about it and I'mstill at it.Basically, it's about this lady Gretje who took off from her mom to start a life of her own. She's a bit exaggerated in all fairness, but that I suppose, just makes it that bit easier to read :)"},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"I just finished The Drowning Room and even though it was only 250 pages, it took determination to actually finish it. I understand that the author came across the main character during his research on a history of New York City and was so facinated by her that he felt compelled to write a fictional account of her story. He should not have bothered. The only thing that I took from the book was some idea of what life in New Amsterdam was like during Dutch rule there."},{"Title":"The Drowning Room","review":"I read this book because it received a good review in the newspaper and I am interested in history. I thought a book about Holland and New Amsterdam would be worth reading. This book, in my opinion was not.

The outstanding [and unusual] table of contents is a self-contained test and easily directs the user to parts of the book that will provide needed help.Another particularly strong area of this little book are the sections on logarithmic and exponential functions. These pages contain a sound mix of graphs, explanations, and sample problems that can clarify gaps for any even semi-serious student.This book will not spoon-feed the unprepared student, the student who never learned the necessary algebra and/or trigonometry that one needs for the calculus. However, it is an excellent resource for the student who has forgotten or never learned some topics. I have used the book as a reference since 1982 and very much appreciate it."},{"Title":"Alg & Trig Refresher/Calc (Series of Books in the Mathematical Sciences)","review":"I never learned certain mathematical prerequisites of calculus in high school. Going to college I found my self struggling in calculus I... until I studied this book. It contains all of the basics for the beginning calculus student (as far as the trigonometry and algebra one needs). I quickly read the text and worked out the problems because I was in desperate need of an understanding of those basic concepts. I was able to do relatively well in calculus I, thanks to studying this book. I highly recommend it to anyone in a similar situation as the one I was in."},{"Title":"Alg & Trig Refresher/Calc (Series of Books in the Mathematical Sciences)","review":"I had taken Calculus in high school, but ten years later found myself having to take it again. I showed up for the first class as a confident 28 year-old, secure in the knowledge that my 'A' in high school would ensure another 'A' as an adult. What I failed to consider is the amount of intermediate Algebra and Trig that had escaped me over the years, so I left the first class feeling overwhelmed, defeated, and immediately dropped the course. Rather than signing up for Pre-Calculus instead, I spent the next two months working through every lesson and practice problem in this book. There aren't any lame cartoons to illustrate concepts, and the lessons aren't drawn out. Rather, each chapter quickly summarizes its lesson, provides a few clear examples, then gives the reader about 20 problems to work through at the end of each lesson. It's a welcome, bare-bones approach right down to the font (Courier). By the time Calculus was offered the next quarter, I was completely prepared. In fact, I got an 'A+' in the course, and this book *definitely* helped put me over the edge."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"Absolutely fabulous! Only the incomparable Rothbard could tell this compelling story in its full richness and detail.Here the hidden history of money and banking in America unfolds as the internecine, behind-the-scenes warfare between elite financial interests such as the House of Morgan and the Rockefellers, the electoral struggle between the Hamiltonian Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans, and the duel-to-the-death Bank War of Nicholas Biddle and Andrew Jackson.Discover the intriguing facts of how post-Civil War ethnoreligious political conflict between postmillennial pietist Protestant Republicans versus liturgical libertarian Democrats translated into deeply-felt attitudes toward inflation, sound money, and the Gold Standard.Explore the arcane and clandestine origins of the powerful Federal Reserve, a secretive institution still clouded in mystery and myth.This magnificent volume of unpublished and previously published writings by the late Murray N. Rothbard deserves to be on the shelf of every careful scholar of political economy, and of everyone who enjoys the discovery of unseasonable and unsettling truths concerning the government elites who attempt to run our lives, debase our money, and squander our children's futures."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"Murray Rothbard delivers an absolute winner of a text written in the same easily readable style of \\"What Has Government Done To Our Money & The Case For a 100% Gold Dollar\\".He has covered this lengthy timeline from the perspective of who the main players were, what their motives were, and what were the results of their actions. So what this book is NOT is a dry empirical statistical history...phew!!!What you do get is a terrific understanding of the power struggle running through the timeline between the Houses of Morgan and Rockefeller, with of course the supporting cast of the Harrimans, Kuhn Loeb, Guggenheims and the Mellons, as it centred on their quest for banking domination, via the struggle between the sound money gold standard protaganists and the monetarist inflationary camp! Rothbard weaves in the political situation throughout so that you are able to develop a rounded picture of the political scene based on the power broking of these financial elite too. Outstanding!!This history of the power struggles and the oscillations between sound money and inflationary monetarism will also take you through the genesis of the new Republic, the origins of the Federal Reserve, the New deal, and the Gold Exchange Standard.It's fascinating stuff, superbly written, with excellent, detailed bottom-of-page footnoting and an extensive index.My guess is this will be remembered as the seminal text on this subject in the decades to come!If you haven't already read \\"What Has Government Done To Our Money & The Case For a 100% Gold Dollar\\", then you will want to as this text will also leave you wanting to further explore sound money and the Gold Standard. If you then really want to get to the heart of Rothbard, then I wholeheartedly recommend you read his awesome treatise \\"Man, Economy and State with Power and Market(Scholars Edition)\\".You most definitely will not regret it!!!"},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"Murray was a free market, gold-backed money economist who makes persuasive arguments for his position. This system would, in a perfect world, be a good means of trade and would probably keep extremes of wealth in check. The logistics of changing to this system seem overwhelming. Nonetheless if one wants to know how the USA's banking system evolved this is a definitive read."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"In this latest release of Murray Rothbard's epic volume detailing the history and economics of the United States; Mises Institute (2005) has again made available his writings that spans the time-frame from Colonial times up to the beginnings of World War II. It is an intriguing documentation of the intermixture of politics and economics that have, and continue to, shaped this Nation's history; and, by extension the state of commerce throughout the World.It must be noted that this 509-page tome is not suggested for a novice reader that does not have any more than a rudimentary knowledge of economics. For those embarking on a study of economic history, Rothbard's early work, \\"What Has the Government Done to Our Money\\" might prove to be a more suitable introductory vehicle. With that disclaimer in mind, those readers with an interest in how politics and economics intertwine this volume is indeed illuminating. And, of course, (as history tells us over and over again) politics, diplomacy, and warfare are almost always, and inevitably, shaped by economics.With alacrity, Rothbard weaves a tale of intrigue and exposes the often overlooked players that sought to impose their opposing economic and political viewpoints. These include those early Americans who espoused a strong Federal government and favored a Central Banking system as to those who favored \\"free banking\\". Also included are the various political opponents who fed the turmoil surrounding bimetallism who, in turn, vigorously debated and fanned the flames of gold versus silver parity rates.Moving on to an America with Imperialistic notions, the Spanish-American War provided an opportunity to impose American economic principles on the previously Spanish occupied countries that America now found in its orb. The new American Colonies were induced into accepting monetary and currency provisions that reflected their new-found ruler's principles. Not content with merely meddling in the affairs of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, the US tried via coercion to force the Sovereign States of Mexico, several Central American countries, and China to hunker down to the American concepts with regard to money (value) and currency exchanges. If coercion and threats failed to bring about compliance, America was not above sending in the Marines.Not surprisingly, Rothbard expends a goodly amount of ink in discussing the often turbulent events that led to the formation of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Also discussed are the post World War I gyrations that destroyed the previous world-wide gold standard and the wholesale introduction of fiat currencies. All of which ultimately led to the Great Depression of the 1930's.As the title suggests, he winds up his volume with a detailed inquisition into the causes and effects that precipitated, and prolonged, that dire episode in history when the world's economies were wrought with economic havoc. [Note: diehard Keynesians might be prompted to knash their teeth; however, if they are not too hidebound they might learn something].The book is profusely documented with detailed footnote references and anecdotal information.Word count: 494--30--"},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"This is among my favorite works by a man who left us a large body of thinking and scholarship.

As many times as I have told my children about \\"how much more that thing costs than when I was a kid\\", I can now replace that saying with \\"how much less my money is worth than when I was a kid.\\" The missing lynchpin in my wide study of American History was here within this book: that moneyed interests has always aligned themselves with government, and the two have conspired to \\"rob\\" the common citizen through monetary inflation and devaluation of the currency. You can pick any period of American history, and overlay the currency / credit / monetary factors over our current time, and not be able to tell the difference. More than any book I have read, this explains the current loss of personal liberty in our country."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"A great look at the economic history of the US with a more intensive focus on the Federal Reserve and the early 20th century.

Rothbard obviously spent a great effort diving into the facts (supported by pages of thoughtful stats, not just numbers)to try to break down the \\"history\\" of financial calamities that scarred our nation. After reading this book you will understand the set ups for three of the most interesting debt explosions of our history. Rothbard investigates the American Revolution and the start of the first national bank, the explosion of debt after the Civil War and also the growth of deficits after FDR's presidential changes to society. In all, this book simply is an amazing and honest look at the way the country has been a puppet to many different characters over the ages and if Rothbard was to see what is happening today, he would roll in his grave."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"This book is the best banking book I have ever read. Tremendous research and insight into the history of banking. This is a must read for economic professors across America. Absolutely first class writing and research."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"This is an excellent overview of monetary history in the United States. Although the late Murray Rothbard was capable of providing very detailed analysis, this volume was written in a style that is very readable, even for beginners. Even so, it provides a wealth of information, and plenty of resources for further study, if desired.Economic historians and others who are already familiar with the subject may want to read one of Rothbard's more detailed studies, such as \\"Conceived in Liberty,\\" \\"America's Great Depression,\\" or \\"The Case Against the Fed.\\" However, this is an excellent introduction, and true to Rothbard's style, it includes innumerable insights that are missed by other historians and economists alike.One of the reasons Rothbard was able to gain insights that other writers missed is that he analyzed historical events using methodology from the \\"Austrian school\\" of economics. In fact, Rothbard did much to develop the Austrian school's methodology, especially in regard to researching economic history. This methodology differs from that of other economic historians in that it attempts to understand the motives of economic actors and policymakers. Joseph T. Salerno provides a thorough description of this methodology in his Introduction, and that is reason enough to buy this edition.Overall, this is an excellent overview of how (and why) our financial system developed, starting with the early Colonial period. Less imposing than some of his other works, it nevertheless makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the American financial system, without which any study of the subject would be incomplete."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"The book fails at its root, due to the bias that pervades the facts that Rothbard presents. While there are interesting historical elements brought to light, it is impossible to escape the strong bias that Rothbard exhibits. This is makes this work a weak scholarly contribution to the topic of money, banking and finance."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"For someone who has wasted a lifetime trying to understand economics, money, credit and banking, this book clarifies a good deal. If you suspect Larry Summers and Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson and Barney Frank and Chris Dodd and others of their ilk talk mostly nonsense, are at best not be trusted and at worst conspirators in a grand scam to preserve the power of their corporate masters, Murry Rothbard would not only agree with you completely but could probably explain in a couple of paragraphs exactly what is going on every time any of them opens his mouth. Unfortunately, Murry is no longer with us. We have to do the best we can with the method he championed for fifty odd years: ignore what they say and consider who stands to benefit from what they are doing and proposing, and how. What I cannot understand after reading this book, is how or why Rothbard ever got himself involved with Richard Nixon? But don't let that stop you from reading the book.Is Rothbard right about the need for a gold standard? There isn't enough gold to support the unrepayable and largely unserviceable public debt balloon our Wall Street masters of the universe and their academic and bureaucratic apologists have been inflating over the past ninety-six years, and doubling over the past twelve months. Only truly heroic inflation can now bail out the State, and it's hard to see how the inflationists can now make the bubble inflate fast enough to prevent a gigantic bust. History suggests that a real collapse may be coming, one in which the bankers will remain standing because their toxic waste has all been absorbed by the friendly taxpayer. Other major players may end up more like GM than GE.Meanwhile, as I await the bust, this book of Murray's is lively reading and food for thought. You really can't ask more from any book."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"Wow! Murray Rothbard unveils the individuals and entities who intentionally sought the devaluation of our currency for private profits through government, which still continues today. Rothbard offers a refreshing analysis of money and banking in the United States that cuts through the political doublespeak and propaganda proliferated by politicians and the lazy media. Rather than merely accept the purported motives of politicians and government officials as fact, Rothbard examines the pecuniary gains made by such individuals, their allies and businesses, and reveals the true motives of inflationists, \\"trust busters,\\" and socialists calling for more and more regulations of economic activities--personal profits through government. Rothbard provides a plethora of content and specifics on the fraudulent and deceptive acts of public officials, but most importantly, you will understand why a true gold standard is vital to the integrity of any government."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"Murray Rothbard has written a great book that expands on the history greatly on his \\"What has Gov't Done to Our Money\\" book. Rothbard is very detailed and has great insight on the policies and their effects. Rothbard approaches the history in the framework of the Austrian perspective. It is not light reading for the novice, yet the language is readable and not dry like a textbook.

You'll rarely find it even on C-SPAN. Rothbard shows how the increase in credit by both Hoover and FDR was the wrong thing to do then, and the wrong thing to do now. Government spending does not bring us out of depressions. Instead it causes them.Because the American people didn't understand the 30's, they can't understand today's economic tragedy either. A stable money supply is the friend of real recovery.

That was a disappointment. There is some history, though the main story seems to be the lead up to the Federal Reserve. Even some of the political background was OK. However, as you get to the turn of the century, Rothbard steers into conspiracy thinking regarding the business actors behind creating the central bank.I am not fan of central banking either. I would rather not have the Federal Reserve. But this book doesn't live up to the title as a history. It reads like a polemic. And it doesn't go much beyond the creation of the Fed."},{"Title":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II","review":"This book is to history what Fox news is to reporting. While Rothbard does not purport to present a \\"fair and balanced\\" historical account, the innocent sounding title masks what is in reality standard libertarian distrust of government and reverence of free market principles. Especially in light of recent events, the policies that Rothbard is indirectly arguing for, complete governmental abstention in the economy, seem immature and dangerous. And on the issue of the gold-standard, a venerable holy grail of the Austrian school, I am still not convinced of its' merits. Why should growth in our money supply be held hostage to output of world mines? How is that better then fiat money? As many economists have recognized, a country's recovery from the great depression coincided with their decision to abandon the gold standard. Does it mean anything that no countries today follow a gold standard? There must have been a reason that the gold standard argument has consistently lost - perhaps it is just bad policy. Notwithstanding all that, this book, as pimped by the other reviews, still has plenty of plusses. But while this book is good, an unequivocal five stars it is not.PS. A much better, and somewhat less partisan version of banking and history of monetary policy, is \\"Monetary Policy in the United States\\" by Timberlake.

What makes his books unique is that he only uses source material, meaning original German documents and photos. He does not rely on others works, hence, he is able to clear up some of the misconceptions and myths that have evolved over the years.This book, like his others, is packed with excellent photos taken from surviving Tiger tanks and archieves. There are many line drawings, both orginal German blueprint and scale drawings showing various components of the vehicle from all angles.This book is an excellent buy for the money. Jentz leaves no stone unturned in documenting how the Tiger evolved, its testing, and production. Prototypes and the various series models are shown. Hull, chasis, suspension, powerplant, turret, armament, sights are all covered in excellent detail.The only disappointment is that it is relatively short. Perhaps I am spoiled by R.P. Hunnicutt type massive tomes. This last is a very small observation.The excellent drawings, photos, use of source material makes it THE Tiger book to own.I highly recommend D.W to Tiger 1."},{"Title":"Germany's Tiger Tanks D.W. to Tiger I: Design, Production & Modifications","review":"Typical of Mr. Jentz's work, the book is derived only from original sources, so he avoids repeating old errors that have percolated from book to book over the last 55 years. Hilary Louis Doyle does his usual superb job on the 1/35th scale drawings which cover all major production variants of the standard gun tank, as well as the prototypes (for a history of the failed Porsche prototype, see the same authors' book now available from Panzer Tracts). This is the first set of published drawings that accurately depicts the asymmetrical shape of the Tiger I turret (it bulges out slightly on the left, so the gun is mounted off-center in the mantlet to bring it back to the centerline of the turret). This is one volume of a three-volume series, the other titles covering the development of the Tiger II and the operations of the Tiger battalions. Jentz's book concentrates on the vehicle's general interior and exterior layout, but doesn't go into the technical depth of Walter Spielberger's books (most readers don't plan to actually rebuild a Tiger transmission anytime soon)."},{"Title":"Germany's Tiger Tanks D.W. to Tiger I: Design, Production & Modifications","review":"This book is very much about the technical aspects of the tank.

This list was painstakingly compiled from original German sources only.The 7 sets of multi-view drawings of complete vehicles (including the underneath views) were prepared by Hilary Doyle from thorough surveys of surviving Tigers, and they correct the numerous small errors in all previous work.

The strongest portion is the section on the Grid and its mechanics. It is so chock full of good information that anyone who plays a PL5/6 and/or cyberpunk-like campaign will find something useful here.

With Episode One just hot off the presses in town, my players really wanted to go bashing droids right and left. This supplement really pulled through in that respect.

Her dialogue is always sharp and fun. In her new book, Calder Promise, she provides a wonderful sequel in a great series of books. This is a real page turner that makes you want to read the whole thing in one sitting. Having read the first four books a few times, getting a new Calder is a real treat. Janet Dailey provides hours of enjoyment, whether reading any of her books for the first time, or re-reading her older titles."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I love Janet Dailey's \\"Calder\\" Series. The stories werevery interesting and intriging to read."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have been disappointed in the last several Dailey books in the Calder series, but I think she's back in the saddle with this one.While her tendency to \\"retire\\" her older characters by killing them off willy nilly might be disconcerting, it is a realistic method of making way for the younger generation.The Calder characters in earlier novels had to be tougher, because there was generally some physical or financial risk in their lives. I think it is a legitimate endeavor to see what a Calder heir is like when she has been raised with wealth and privilege and is able to take success for granted, not struggle to achieve it.There are frequently members of any family who, for one reason or another, don't quite fit in with the rest. So we have Laura, who is more than a little spoiled and who values the culture and sophistication in a world larger than the Triple C ranch. She's young, she's beautiful, she's rich; she's also a little wild and unconventional. She's used to having men pursue her, and she enjoys manipulating them to get what she wants.In many ways, this is a coming of age novel, in which the heroine has to decide who she is and what her values are. Will she embrace her Calder legacy, or will she go her own way? Will she get involved in life, or will she merely be a spectator, using her wealth as a buffer? Will she marry the man she has fallen in love with, or will she marry the wealthy man who will provide her with an opulent but probably shallow lifestyle?If you are a longtime Dailey fan, as I am, you already know the answers to these questions. One of Dailey's strengths as a writer is to take imperfect people, present them with problems, and give them the opportunity to grow while they overcome them. She does this very well in this novel, as well as providing strong new characterizations, snappy dialog, and steamy romance.There's more to be seen with the next generation of Calders, and I for one am looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"The book started out ok and promised to be a smooth read and it was, but I lost my interest in reading it further when it brought me to the part when Laura takes off with Sebastian, whom by the way she meets the same very day, they go for a car ride, after which she gets into a cold fountain naked to get a coin. Notice, that Laura is not a child but a young woman.Laura's character is undeveloped, poor and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book after two chapters."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have read all the Calder series books and didn't even know a new one was out till I happened upon it in a store. I was thrilled. I'll say one thing for this book--it was a fast read and held my attention. I wouldn't call it riveting though, by a long stretch. For one thing not only was the heroine (Laura) spoiled(OK, she owned up to that), but she was not very nice.She slept with one guy, while engaged to another. Also, this habit of Ms. Dailey of killing off a main character or two in the most gruesome fashion possible is getting old and annoying. I don't think one single person since the original couple(Lorna&Benteen) has died a natural or usual death. It's getting redundant. Noone formally notified poor Cat(whom I believe was originally named Catherine, but in the last two installments became a Cathleen)of Logan's death either. It was all about how everyone else was taking it and no scene was described with the news being broken to his widow. It was discussed(telling her), but never played out.I don't know. Let's hope Ms. Dailey goes back and reads her own series as a refresher before undertaking her next Calder entry. I have them all and will keep the set, so I buy each new installment. To someone who hasn't followed along...don't start with this one."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I picked this book up because I was in the library and a little bored, and I had a dim recollection of thinking that Dailey had good characters. As far as 'dim' goes, it was a 5-watt idea.The plot is something like an heiress named Laura is traveling Europe with her father's first wife, Tara and two guys, both \\"sultry,\\" handsome and sexually magnetic, fall in love with her, the night they meet her. What's a girl to do?Why should you never pick this book up? Because Laura's character has no depth--she's not even \\"too perfect\\" she's just too dumb. With her astounding good looks--\\"she knows it\\", her 'charm', her continuous conquests, her stupid jump in the fountain, I literally tossed this book aside in disgust.I'm sorry Dailey. I respect you as an author and am sorry to see you not equalling the potential your earlier books showed. All readers out there, if you're looking for books with good characters and engaging stories.... look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"This was the first Calder book that I have read. I did not even know that there were others. It is a novel that can stand on its own. It was in the 7 day books at the library so, I just grabbed it.First, I do agree with the other reviewers that Laura Calder comes across as shallow and self centered. To be honest if I was beautiful, rich, and manipulative, I am none of these things. SOB!I loved the romance and her description of the passion of Sebastian and Laura. It made me jealous that I could not find a man like Sebastian. However, I am annoyed with Sebastian (being annoyed with ficticious characters not healthy!). He let Laura walk all over him and treat him like dirt. I cannot believe any man in his right mind would tolerate that! I do not care how much a guy is in love that is beyond.Laura's \\"Aunt\\" Tara was very bossy and manipulative. She called Max Rutledge to get Boone to travel to the Triple C. If she loved Laura so much, why didn't she want to see her happy? Or better yet, talk to her first! If everyone dislikes her so much, howcome she is still in the picture at the end? Hmmm... Is this because I missed the other books in the series? Perhaps, but I do not think so.I think the Calders were especially polite to Sebastian considering Laura told them that she did not want him around. Could they be that easy going?What son, referring to Boone, would listen to his father like he does? He is an adult and make his own choices good or bad. If my father ever told me that I had to propose when I knew the person for a short time, I would definitely have something to say about it. After all, it is committment and she is just a prize to his father. Couldn't Laura just say no and be her own women.I do not understand why all of these romance novels have to make women so weak and dependent upon a man. I guess this is why they are romance novels. I gave it 3 stars because the romance part swept me away."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have read all the Calder books up to this one. So far ever book has included one of the main characters or their spouse dying. I really don't like reading books, getting attached to the lead characters and then have them die off. Each book is the same theme. I realize that rich powerful families have enemies but this family just has too many. The character I would like to see killed off is Tara.... how somebody with such heartless manipulations can continue to be included in a family and cause the problems she does is beyond me. I understand being nice to somebody but the trouble that Tara causes from the time she marries Ty, gets divorced from him, he is killed and out of the series and she still is allowed access to the family and the ranch. I don't want to even read this book because it contains Tara. I might skip it and go to the next.It would have been more interesting if the author would have brought the family through the roaring 20's, the depression, WWII and into present time. Its seems we start in the late 1800's and then we aren't really sure of the times the family is living in. Even though we go through several generations we don't seem to go through different eras of the country."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"bought for neighbor wish now I hadn't opened this page blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I will read this book in the series order as soon as I get the chance.

My first read of Jane Dailey (given to me by a friend). I gave it back to my friend half way thru. What a selfish heroine and dull romantic leads. Laura and Tara deserved each other.

This girl is rather annoying, she thinks she says clever things and acts tantalyzing, when she is completely immoral! How is she playing hard to get by stripping naked to retrieve a coin she tossed into the Trevi Fountain!? I will most likely read the next book as it is about Quint Echohawk and the Logan/Cat story was pretty good.

If you just have to read Janet Dailey check it out from a library. There is nothing in this book that is remotely interesting, and the main character is totally unlikeable.

I went to the library and Calder Promise was on the new bookshelf. Being a glutton for punishment and since it was raining I decided to read it. It must be a formula for Janet Dailey! Add new characters, kill off beloved ones. Does she use the same outline for every book? I loved the first three Calder books and Cat's book so I think that's why it so upsets me the way Janet Dailey kills off a Calder in every book. In this book it made no sense at all to me when she killed off Logan Echohawk. It didn't even seem plot driven which is why I say the Calder books have almost become an outline of the book that came before. Laura, Ty and Jessie's daughter, who was the center of this book is torn between two love intrests. I couldn't get involved with Laura or her men because you know once you marry a Calder it's just about certain that either you or your spouse will die from unnatural causes in a future book!"},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I'm not one who enjoys writing scathing reviews, but as someone who has read all eight of Janet Dailey's Calder books, I feel qualified to review this one. Each book in this series seems to get worse and worse! I hope Ms. Dailey checks Amazon to see how her loyal readers feel about her latest books. Maybe then she'll get back on track. From what I can tell, most of the reviewers have read the series from the beginning and feel the same way I do. I loved \\"This Calder Sky\\" so much in '81 when it came out. And the next couple were good, too. But the last story I liked even a little bit was \\"Calder Pride\\". The three since then have been such disappointments. This book tells the story of Laura Calder, Ty's daughter, Chase's granddaughter. It's pretty bad when you can't even work up any liking for the heroine, let alone the men she's supposed to be \\"torn\\" between. Laura is spoiled and shallow. Although she's said to be beautiful, I had a hard time believing that two men would fall in love with her on the night they meet her. It appears maybe Boone isn't really in love with her, but he wants her for a trophy wife to satisfy his father. I did like Sebastian a little, and I actually thought he was too good for Laura. Dailey continues her alarming trend of killing off beloved characters. By the next book, Chase will probably have died, since he's suddenly in his 80's. (Wasn't he about 22 in 1981?) Although I find it annoying, I do understand the rapid aging of the characters. They do it on soap operas, too. It's the only way to keep the stories going. But, considering how the stories are going downhill so fast, maybe Janet Dailey should just quit while she's behind."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"Where's the story line? I don't feel as though the first part of the book had anything to do with the second part. Introduction of characters really. Bury a family member....no tears/emotions.....They are a strong, close family but not heartless. Plot just kinda dwindled down at the end w/strangers really with the hubby abusing wife....who were these people? Ghost town inhibitants. Hope it gets better with the next one."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"There were no real redeeming qualities to this one--no endering characters, no emotional tugs, no interesting plot developments. It was just several hundred pages of the narcistic heroine and the emotionally detached machinations of the people around her. A hundred pages into it I found myself wondering if we would ever get back to Montana where there were at least characters I liked. (We did, eventually, but all those characters were unfortunately marginalized even then.)Because I had already bought it, I followed this up with \\"Lone Calder Star\\" and liked it much better. I wish I had just skipped Laura's story. I have a suggestion: if Ms. Dailey insists on killing off main characters, I vote for Laura and Tara."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I've always been one of the first to buy Janet Dailey books and have read all of the Calder writings. This in NO way compares to her previous Calder stories, in fact I had to actually make myself finish it. No real point of the story unless we zero in on Laura and her inability to choose which one of the available men to sleep with ... and how soon. It will be a LONG time before I buy another Janet Dailey book -- believe she's lost her touch -- it's time to look at other authors."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"Expecting the great Calder saga that came alive in her first three books, it is so disappointing to see the way Janet Dailey is now writing. I bought her first book over 25 years ago when it was released. This Calder edition has another beloved character killed and not even mentioning some of the family. It's hard to get a close feeling to the new characters because we miss the old ones too much!!!"},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"This was my least favorite of the Calder Series. Laura Calder did not come across as an endearing heroine as did Lorna, Maggie, Cat, and even Jessy. Even her twin brother, Trey, is not thrilled with her overall behavior. I would suspect if Janet Dailey writes a story about Trey, his sister's treatment of men will become an issue for him when he tries to fall in love. The first four or five books in the series were very good and loaded with interesting information about the geographical area in Eastern Montana. I am happy to say, Ms. Dailey's last Calder book \\"Lone Calder Star\\" does come back around."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I purchased Janet Dailey's complete 10 volume Calder Series because of my love of western/ranchland fiction. This, the 7th of the series, diverts the reader completely away from the plains of Montana and centers around the hoidy toidy carryings on of aristocratic Europeans. If I had been interested in this type of novel, there are plenty others out there. There was no need to stray so far from the central story-line of this series. I found myself reading entire chapters then realizing I had no idea of what I had read. This installment was a waste of her time as a writer and my time as a reader."},{"Title":"Vortex","review":"Here's a wonderful example of the paperback original, circa 1979 in this case, that's deserving of hardcover publication. Instead, it seems to have vanished nearly as completely as the Golden Fleece itself, the object of this novel's obsessive quest by two very different men.This isn't a bloated, overwritten, preposterous search for lost treasures & mysteries that you might get from the likes of Dan Brown, though. It's a lean, concise, psychologically rich portrait of its protagonist & antagonist, and the almost otherworldly woman who links them. But don't look for overt mysticism or fantasy, even with the premonitory nightmares that plague a driven murderer. The mysteries to be found here are those of the psyche, and culture, and history itself.It's also a portrait of the last days of the 1970s -- not the media 1970s, but the burned-out ends of the 1960s that had survived for a few more decadent years. Narrator Phillip Porter is adrift & doesn't really care:\\"It was a balmy winter night such as you get in the tropics, and I was nicely high, oblivious to significant omens and trivia alike as I pedaled my rusty, wheezy old bicycle through the new part of the island, teeming with ranch homes, redwood fences, 'economy' swimming pools -- all the trappings which gave reassurance of having landed among the right sort of people. But the trouble was, nothing could quite seem to protect this landscape from falling prey to the same nameless, slow-eating southern blight which fed on the souls of its occupants. Environment was having its revenge before my eyes: the oozing, festering wound of suburbia spread like a cancer, but I was feeling too good to mind. I rolled along, smiling at the occasional pedestrian. No one smiled back.\\"But once Phillip meets Kimberly, a young women seeking the spiritual gateway to death, he finds himself bound for Crete, looking for an artifact that might well be the actual Golden Fleece. What he doesn't know is that someone else is searching for it as well, someone willing to kill without hesitation or remorse, someone fleeing most of all from himself ...I won't say any more, except to recommend this forgotten novel to anyone who appreciates a taut, compelling story. If you can find a copy, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Vortex","review":"One of the greatest treasures in history - the Golden Fleece - is discovered. You are sent to a small, sun scorched Greek island to obtain it. On that island of close-knit, suspicious families, you clash with a murderer more cold blooded than you imagine a man could be. And fall in love with the most haunting and mysterious woman you've ever met.Vortex is the story of Phillip Porter, a young man driven by an obsessive love of his own and entangled in the obsessions of two other people: a man twisted by greed and violence who wants the Fleece - at any cost, and a woman yearning to cross the spiritual threshold of death - and who believes the Fleece is her gateway. Phillip can not escape one and does not want to leave the other and must inevitably be drawn toward an ultimate moment of passion and death.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations with a Nez Perce Elder","review":"Horace Axtell speaks in simple and straightforward language about his Nez Perce heritage and cultural teachings, in a manner that is both humble and powerful. One learns of the relevance for life that he has attained only through experience, and sometimes hardship, in his many years and roles. Of particular importance to me was his time spent in Japan shortly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 -- to see the mass destruction from the eyes of a Native American and learn of the compassion that can surface even in the midst of ruin and death was a compellling chapter. But there are lighter moments too, as Axtell speaks of his grandmother and her sense of humor. Unlike other &quot;spiritual guidance&quot; books, this work does not judge, beguile, or confront the reader. It's a friendly and open invitation to learn how the trail of one's life can shape a person's soul. And despite challenges such as racism, ignorance, and family conflicts, dignity and courage can still be earned."},{"Title":"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations with a Nez Perce Elder","review":"I purchased this book because I had the privilege of seeing Horace Axtell on several occasions, and because I am a firm believer in the need to record oral traditions. (I have done so through the Montana Historical Society, obtaining an interview for them with my friend, mentor, and former chair of the Native American Studies Departments at the University of Montana and Montana State University.) As with all oral history, to really \\"learn\\" one must \\"listen,\\" not read, the stories and recollections. Perhaps co-author Margo Aragon, or the Idaho Historical Society, have the recordings and can some day make them available. In the mean time we have the transcript that we can \\"read.\\"Let me be clear, \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" will not appeal to many readers for several reasons. One, the book retains the \\"English as a second language\\" syntax (sentence structure) that Horace Axtell uses. Second, the \\"deep meaning\\" of what is being told can easily be missed and/or lost in the stories repetitiveness inherent to Native American speech. Third, while one learns much about Horace Axtell, a Nez Perce elder that I personally respect, the reader does not garner much \\"cultural\\" or \\"historical\\" information about the Nez Perce from the book. Granted, the reader can sense the sincere reverence Horace Axtell has for his Nez Perce traditions, but details are politely left unsaid. Fourth, Horace Axtell tells it as he sees it--which I personally like--which may be offensive or \\"boring\\" to some readers. Keep in mind, this is not a biography, a history, an ethnography, or a novel. If you can do that, then \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" may be something to look into.I have rated the book four stars because I feel the book, by the very nature of it's content, cannot adequately convey in words that which must be oral. Moreover, if I did not have two advanced degrees in Native American Studies, if I had not taught Native American Studies, if I had not spent years studying the Nez Perce, and if I did not have what I hope is a fairly reasonable understanding of various Native American cultural ways, I am unsure if I would have enjoyed the book. Then, again, I may be overly jaded in my perspectives, having encountered so many individuals who either think they \\"know\\" everything about Native Americans or hold overt and/or covert prejudices--many to the point of oblivious bigotry.On the other hand, if you love listening to your \\"grandparents\\" or elders tell stories and their own recollections, \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder\\" well could be your \\"cup of tea.\\" And, there is in deed wisdom to be uncovered. As I think Horace Axtell would put it, we all can learn if something is told us in the right way; and what each person learns may be different from another person. AND, each time we read \\"A Little Bit of Wisdom: Conversations With a Nez Perce Elder,\\" we may learn or put to mind a different understanding than before.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

It was titled &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.&quot; I liked the movie, but it really felt kind of incomplete, but the story was moving enough that when I ran across the book, I decided to read it. It is difficult with words to convey how very moving this story was. If you are already familiar with Mr Van der Post through other works, you'll understand. His view of the world is so positive, even in the face of great sorrow and suffering, he maintained such dignity and hope. I will never forget this book. I read a great great deal, but have never run across another book as profoundly moving as this one."},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","review":"This novel excels due to its ability to explain and justify the Japanese psyche during WWII. To use Sir Laurens van der Post's perfect words: 'The thing you mustn't forget about Hara,' he had said, 'is that he is not an individual or for that matter even really a man.' He had gone on to say that Hara was the living myth, the expression in human form, the personification of the intense, inner vision which, far down in their unconscious, keeps the Japanese people together and shapes and compels their thinking and behaviour. We should not forget two thousand and seven hundred full cycles of his sun-goddess' rule burnt into him. He was sure no one could be more faithful and responsive to all the imperceptible murmurings of Japan's archaic and submerged racial soul than he. Hara was humble enough to accept implicitly the promptings of his national spirit. He was a simple, uneducated country lad with a primitive integrity unassailed by higher education, and really believed all the myths and legends of the past so deeply that he would not hesitate to kill for them..... 'But just look in his eyes, there is nothing ignoble or insincere there: only an ancient light, refuelled, quickened and burning brightly. There is something about the fellow I rather like and respect.' That piece moved me the first time I read this most engaging book, and over the years I find myself drawn to that passage. What a wonderful explanation of the madness that overcame an entire nation! Despite his long, long sentences, do yourself a favour and read this wonderful story of betrayal and hope."},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","review":"Rooted in the soil of South africa and flowering under a japanese sun this book is like a collection of separate stories brought together in a unified theme of cultural misunderstanding. The childlike Hara, an archetypical japanese camp beast, his noble officer immovable as a rock, Celliers the unbreakable stiff upper lipped british officer and between them all, trying to make some kind of sense, the liberal figure of Lawerence. The stories of youth in South Africa and the growing appreciation of the tall athletic son for his grotesque brother who has hands that are the soul of Africa, who finds life where others see only death, a man who knows what Isac Denisen calls the Song of Africa. Magical stuff!"},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","review":"I chose this book as I had watched the movie, and had been moved to tears by David Bowie's powerful performance, as well as Tom Conti's. This book did not disappoint. FILLED with beautiful imagery, divine prose, and sublime characters, the small nods to other characters and little connections throughout touch one's heart, not to mention the heart-pounding action, and gripping suspense making one bite one's nails. I think, having seen the movie, I could supplant the writings with images, pictures, and voices, which even furthered the delightful process of bringing the characters to life. Overall, one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure, the honour, to read.

I have had my copy for over 30 years and every decade or so pick it up again for the random re-read. It's one of those books that can stay with you for a lifetime and touches you in whatever place you happen to be in your life. It really does hold timeless, universal truths for anyone willing to invest the time."},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","review":"More than in any other of Van Der Post's works, The Seed and the Sower dwells on the deeper psychological phenomena of mankind. Where, through abstract thought, two vastly opposing arguments may live side by side, and both bear a resemblance of \\"truth\\" in the course of logic reasoning. Only the holder of these \\"truths\\" at some point in life, in this case through guilt, may reach an understanding within himself of the damage he/she inflicts on others. Only in the darkest of war, facing death, does Celliers come to terms with the cruelty he had inflicted on his hunchbacked brother, at high school many years before. And he is eager to offer his life for that purpose, saving the lives of his fellow prisoners. It is the same double sidedness that shows up within Captain Yonai, who secretly demonstrates his ultimate respect for the man he has condemned to death. And it is Lawrence himself, the final Judas of the story, who's logical reasoning on his guilt in the face of his acquired power, abandons the thought to save the life of Sergeant Hara, betraying the man who before had saved his own life. It is in this light that Van Der Post finally draws a philosophical conclusion. Where he first paints the survival of species in a herd of antelopes, he lets us understand the paradox of man, killing his fellow, in order to defend the life of his sort to come."},{"Title":"Seed and the Sower","review":"Sir Laurens van der Post wrote a great book. The style and theme is a good read and makes you think about good and bad. Many have written reviews about this book so I don't even attempt to attain their level. The only thing that irritates me is Amazon's policy of DRM on their books. For several reasons I decides NOT to buy a Kindle but a Sony. I paid the full, normal price for the book but when I used Calibre to convert the e-book to the international standard of epub it gave a message it was protected. Why does Amazon try to force their buyers to use only the Kindle for their e-books? Can't they see that a lot of people like to buy their e-books but are not charmed by the Kindle? They should stick to their core business, selling (e)-books, cd's, dvd's etc. Not try to force their customers to purchase a Kindle for reading their e-books. E-books are the future so try to keep it an open standard.Fortunately I am not a computer illiterate and after some searching I found a way to remove the drm and convert it to e-pub. Now I am happy to read the book on my Sony TRS-1. Too bad it should take such an effort and for potential readers who are not that familiar with the internet and software it might become a barrier for to buy e-books at Amazon at all.Amazon learn from the mistakes of the music industry, Apple has removed the DRM on they i-Tunes songs because of the all the hassle.

There is an established tradition in Judaism of how the text was written and how to read what on the surface appears as a deviation from grammar or inconsistency in the meaning of the text. Criticism devoid of any tradition is unfortunately based exclusively on one's chosen ideology. The book perfectly explains this point, which is definitely honest and praiseworthy of the author E. Tov who tries hard to be neutral. The book also shows that all the present day critics are familiar with the Jewish interpretation of the text. Hence, the main lesson one can learn from the book is that although there are many improper ways one can convince oneself why the Jewish interpretation is wrong, the final criticism is always reserved for G-d, the Author of the Hebrew Bible. The claims of the professional textual critics, whether driven by desire to prove that the masoretic text is not authentic or by a desire to fit in among the left-wing academia, or to win yet another research grant by cooking up a new radically deviant interpretation, happen to be mostly a negative contribution to the overall understanding of the text."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible","review":"The reviews of the first edition were glowing, and rightly so because this is a superb book. Tov is a world authority in his subject, and has the ability to explain his complex technical subject with great lucidity.

This is disappointing, and we look forward to a more thoroughly revised third edition in the next few years. Anyone with a first edition need not bother with this one.

He pays a great deal of attention to the evolution of the Masoretic texts and their differences. Dr.Tov's experience as a professor at Hebrew University and Editor-in-Chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls publication project makes him uniquely qualified to write about the Hebrew Bible.

Especially helpful are discussions of how this field is different than that of Greek New Testament textual criticism.Note that this book is more of a manual for how to do textual criticism than it is a summary of the current state of knowledge in the field (although it does have a fair amount of that too)."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible","review":"It is a long time since a decent book on Old Testament textual studies appeared. Classics like those by Ginsburg and B J Roberts are largely obsolete and anyway almost impossible to obtain. There are some brief introductions around, but they do not begin to match the depth and erudition of this book. Tov is a brilliant scholar, and one of the World's leading authorities on the Septuagint and the Dead Sea scrolls, so he is well qualified to write this book."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible","review":"Reading \\"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible\\" by Emanuel Tov was both a joy and a challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in the world of the Hebrew Bible. Ancient manuscripts, Dead Sea Scroll finds, ancient versions, textual variants -- all of these things stir the Bible-geek in me. At the same time, the state of current scholarship with regard to the Old Testament text can be a bit troubling to an evangelical Christian. While the New Testament stands affirmed by numerous manuscript discoveries to the extent that almost all textual critics can agree on the vast majority of the minute details of the text, the same cannot be said for the Hebrew Old Testament.Emanuel Tov takes readers of all scholastic levels by the hand as he surveys the field of Old Testament textual criticism. This third edition of his classic textbook, explains things for the novice and scholar alike. Careful footnotes and innumerable bibliographic entries will impress the scholar, while charts, graphs and numerous glossaries keep the would-be scholar feeling like he is getting somewhere. I have no problem admitting that I am one of the would-be scholars, with barely a year of Hebrew under my belt. Yet I was able to work my way through this book, becoming sharper in my Hebrew and awakening to the many facets of the intriguing study of OT textual criticism.Tov has departed from a more traditional stance in his earlier versions, opting instead to follow the evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls and contemporary studies. He manages to keep away from a fatal skepticism, however, arguing that textual evaluation still has merit. The aim is still to recover the earliest possible text, but the recognition that there are often two or three competing literary editions of the text complicate the matter. An example would be the different editions of Jeremiah, with the Septuagint (LXX) Greek version differing drastically from the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT). 1 Samuel provides another example with a Dead Sea Scroll offering perhaps a third different competing literary edition. Tov points out the two very different versions of the story of David and Goliath and Hannah's prayer as he expounds on the problem.Rather than trying to solve each exegetical or specific textual problem, Tov aims to illustrate the challenges facing the would-be textual critic. He surveys the textual data, and reconstructs the history of the text - giving more attention to the accidents of history, such as the destruction of the Jewish state in A.D. 70, as weighing into the nature of the textual evidence we have. Rather than the Masoretic Text gradually gaining dominance, it was the de facto winner of the \\"text wars\\". The LXX-style Hebrew texts (which the Dead Sea Scrolls and other finds have confirmed existed), were ignored by the Jews as Christianity had owned the LXX as its own. The Samaritans had their version of the Pentateuch, and the existence of a variety of other text forms, such as those found at Qumran (the DSS) were forgotten with the cessation of a normal state of existence for Jewish people. The Masoretic text found itself with little real competition and over the years came to be further refined and stable. I should clarify here, that this is not to downplay the Masoretic text, as it manifestly preserves very ancient readings, and Tov repeatedly affirms the remarkable tenacity of the MT. Instead, Tov is saying that the majority position the MT holds among the textual evidence and in the minds of the Jewish communities in the last 1800 years should not prejudice the scholar to consistently prefer MT readings. Tov in fact claims that text types, such as are commonly discussed in NT textual criticism, are largely irrelevant in dealing with the OT text. Internal considerations are key in textual evaluation. I will let Tov explain further:\\"Therefore, it is the choice of the most contextually appropriate reading that is the main task of the textual critic.... This procedure is as subjective as can be. Common sense, rather than textual theories, is the main guide, although abstract rules are sometimes also helpful.\\"(pg. 280)Tov's textbook goes into glorious detail concerning all the orthographic features that make up paleo-Hebraic script, and the square Hebrew script we are familiar with. His knowledge is encyclopedic, to say the least. The numerous images of manuscripts that are included in the back of the book are invaluable. His discussion on the orthographic details of the text should convince even the most diehard traditionalists, that the vowel points and many of the accents were later additions to the text, inserted by the Masoretes. Some still defend the inspiration of the vowel points, but Tov's explanation of numerous textual variants that flow from both a lack of vowel points and from the originality of paleo-Hebraic script (and the long development of the language and gradual changes in the alphabet, and etc.) close the door against such stick-in-the-mud thinking.Tov's book details the pros and cons of different Hebrew texts, as well as discussing electronic resources and new developments in the study of textual criticism. His work is immensely valuable to anyone interested in learning about textual criticism, and of course is required for any textual scholars seeking to do work in this field.Tov doesn't add a theology to his textual manual, however. And this is what is needed to navigate OT textual criticism. After having read Tov, I'm interested in seeing some of the better evangelical treatments of the textual problems of the Hebrew Bible. I believe we have nothing to fear in facing textual problems head on. Seeing different literary editions of the text can fill out our understanding of the underlying theology of the Bible as we have it. Some of the work of John H. Sailhamer illustrates this judicious use of contemporary scholarship concerning the literary strata of the text.Tov's book is not law, and he sufficiently qualifies his judgments. He stresses that textual criticism, especially for the Old Testament, is inherently subjective. It is an art. And those who don't recognize that, are especially prone to error in this field. This book equips the student to exercise this art in the best possible way. Tov walks the reader through evaluating competing textual variants, and his study will furnish the careful reader with all the tools to develop their own approach to the text. Tov's findings won't erode the foundations of orthodox theology. I contend that they will strengthen it. As with NT textual criticism, paying attention to the textual details has unlooked-for and happy consequences. It strengthens exegesis, and allows for a greater insight into the meaning of the text. And it can build one's faith.Bible-geeks, aspiring scholars, teachers and students alike will benefit from this book. Understanding the current state of OT textual criticism puts many of the NT textual debates into perspective. Christians don't know their Old Testaments well enough, and studying the text to this level is rare indeed. I encourage you to consider adding this book to your shelf, and making it a priority to think through the challenges surrounding the text of the Hebrew Bible.Disclaimer: This book was provided by Fortress Press. I was under no obligation to offer a favorable review."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible","review":"A very thorough and scholarly work which is written in a lucid way for the layman and the boffin alike. It certainly has no theological axe to grind. However, I was dissappointed that the major differences between LXX and Masoretic were not pointed out eg. psalm 40:7, may be if a christian was to see its use in Heb 10:v? it might be a bit controversial? May be this would explain why Hebrews nearly did not make it into the canon of the NT? But this is not the purpose of the book! The plates are an excellent idea as you get to see the 'evidence' so to speak. A glossary of terms would be a good idea so that one can easily decipher what 'orthography' and 'morphology' are for example, without having to search for clues. On the whole a most pleasant book which certainly delivers the goods."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible","review":"As I started diving in translation and text criticism, I needed a pratical introduction to the matter.

My own first grader could read this book but I know from being around other children this age that they wouldn't be able to read this. While the print is still large, and most pages don't have a lot of text; there are quite a few pages. In addition, there are words most youngsters wouldn't know. I would include in that category, words like: Saturday, doctor, bandage, headache, captain, muscles, and fearless.As far as the story is concerned, I think most children in this age group would like the the topic. Kids are just interested in tooth loss.For myself, I really didn't care too much for some of the elements in the book. For one thing, dad has a pipe stand, and making smoking acceptable in any form, isn't something we applaud. In addition, the baby sitter is a little mean - perhaps she is a family member (lol). At one point, she tells the children that they are giving her a headache;, and at another point, she tells Arthur that he shouldn't make such a fuss just because he falls down, cuts his lip and is bleeding. (If you can't cry when you are bleeding, when can you?)Oh yes, and before I forget, Arthur loses his loose tooth by wrapping a string around it and attaching the other end to a door knob. (Classic stuff and I guess I don't object, but I thought you should know just in case you do.)Now lest you think it's all bad stuff I have to report, let me say that what the book does well is discuss how different people are afraid of different things. In this case, Violet (Arthur's sister) is afraid of the dark, while Arthur is afraid of blood. And the one good point that the baby sitter makes, is that real bravery is doing things you are afraid of doing: like going outside in the dark to do a chore.Three Stars. Artwork is okay but not special. Good Read-aloud. The story has some pro's and con's, but overall I believe most children will like the subject.

I actually prefer Lillian Hoban's Arthur the monkey over Marc Brown's Arthur the aardvark, so I purchased this book as well as other Arthur the monkey titles. This one reminded me of when I was scared to lose my first tooth. Plus this one teaches how to make taffy apples and s'mores, and tells how the s'more got its name on page 62. If you wish, buy the Marc Brown book listed above, then buy this book and compare the two feelings of each Arthur character.

But when the treat for dessert is taffy apples, Arthur doesn't want them because of his loose tooth(and his fear to pull it out), so Violet decides to make s'mores but has to go out in the dark to get sticks to make them-and faces her fear, so Arthur decides to face his fear-and chooses to be the,&quot;Captain Fearless&quot; he calls himself so pulls out his tooth and then he IS able to eat the taffy apples as well as the s'mores.

Thurber's style and language are antique but his enthusiasm and inquisitive nature remain fresh. He was a masterful, inventive and whimsical essayist, and his cartoons are still paradoxically light and dark at once. He was a humorist never far from the grim. After my forty years between, immersed in televisionisms and mushy prose, it is a delight to re-read one of the 20th Century's great stylists. In tackling word butchery, he writes: \\"The word 'insecurity' by the way, seems to have been taken over by the psychiatrists as their personal property. In politics, as in penology, 'security' itself has come to mean 'insecurity.' Take for example, this sentence: 'He was considered a 'maximum security' prisoner because of his police record and was never allowed out of his cell block.' ... \\"... I could prove that 'maximum' in the case of the prisoner mentioned above, really means 'minimum,' but I don't want to get us in so deep that we can't get out.\\" And later he writes: \\"'It's a bad city to get something in your eye in,' the nurse said. 'Yes,' the interne agreed, 'but there isn't a better place to get something in your eye out in.' I rushed past them with my hair in my wild eyes, and left the hospital.\\" Everyday people, politicos, crooks (and crooked politicos), the battle between the sexes, literature, modern art -- all fall under his wild eye and practiced hand.

In fact, it is less than 200 pages and too short to be a tome. No matter, \\"Complete Book of Chess Openings\\" by the late Fred Reinfeld is packed with openings, gambits, defenses and explanations why which moves will impact your playing.Reinfeld authored dozens of chess books, and was one of America's top players. He summed up his understanding of openings into this book, suitable for beginning and intermediate players.Included are what you'd find in most opening books:Center Opening, Danish Game, Bishop's Opening, Vienna Game, King's Gambit, Giuco Piano, Four Knights, French Defense, Sicilian Defense, Queen's Gambit, and much more. The moves are described in notation form, and he briefly points out the sensibility behind a given move. There is a page with a notation chart for those players unfamiliar with it.Where many great players falter as they prepare opening books is that they often overwhelm the reader with more material than is useful. Unless the player understands the reasoning behind the openings, the secondary and tertiary lines and variations are pointless. The player will have already lost. Reinfeld wrote this not for Bobby Fischer or even Garry Kasparov, but for the average player.I fully recommend \\"Complete Book of Chess Openings\\" by Fred Reinfeld.

Written by Robert Weinberg (subsequent volumes are by other authors), it details the entangled origin of both Statesman and Lord Recluse, and the beginning steps of moving Prohibition Era Paragon City from a hotbed of crime and corruption to the gleaming metropolis we \\"see\\" today.For CoH/CoV players, there's a certain appeal in learning some of this backstory, as well as more about Nemesis, some of the early heroes of Paragon (previously only hinted at in various plaques and statues about the city), and other geeky goodness like that.Aside from that, however, this is ultra-lightweight fluff. Though Weinberg occasionally tries to play on Doc Savage/Avenger/Shadow-style pulp conventions, it's never maintained for long enough to actually impart some flavor to the tale. Instead we get a bunch of stock characters moved through inevitable, predictable, uninvolving motions - the plucky girl reporter, the hardened Great War veteran and his \\"band of brothers,\\" the cunning inventor, the venal city officers, the gangsters, the megalomaniac villain, a ho-hum romance ... Only bits of the story sparkle, usually involving backup characters - a trio of sisters, for example, and a few of the fellow founders of the Freedom Phalanx.The Web of Arachnos certainly more entertaining than reading the newspaper or office memos, or being poked in the eye with a sharp stick. But it's not something I'd recommend to anyone other than someone who plays the games the novel is based on -- and then only if they're *really* interested in somewhat increasing their knowledge about the game's setting."},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"As I read the reviews for this product, my heart sank a little. I am, myself, a fan of the CoH/CoV games. So, like I said, I expected very little from the book as a result except for a backstory to add to my enjoyment of the game.However, after receiving the book, and beginning to read, I was immediately captured by the writing style of the author. His descriptive wording and appropriate word use were the first items to catch my attention. However, after a chapter, the story was riveting.As I said, I had read the previous reviews on this, and if I may say, perhaps some of them are overly critical. Keep in mind, for example, that the book is centered on two specific characters, those of Stefan Richter (Lord Recluse) and Marcus Cole (Statesman), and so therefore, mentions of the exploits of any other heroes prior to their appearance in the novel would be unwarranted. And, it would not seem illogical for someone with great powers to be eaither a) unaware of the vastness of them, or b) in an era when the world was just over the first industrial revolutions of America, afraid to show any level of supernatural ability, since the demonstration of such would instill fear in a great many people (including the politcial regimes of the day).Also, as to Recluse's metal spider legs, since he is a technocrat and obviously a fan of the scientific, it is not unthinkable that such a person would either a) augment natural appendages which grew as a result of his transformation, to be fitted with metal, or to b) have created that metallic set of appendages.Finally, though the characters might seem predictable, and \\"lightweight\\", the fact is that the author is playing on what we should expect. The great war hero, power hungry villain, megalomaniac Nemesis, plucky reporter, etc...are all the types of people we can relate with. Their characters are well fleshed out in the novel, and overall, it is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"I'm on the brink of trying out City of Heroes for the first time, and as I'm a bit of a newcomer to the superhero genre, I thought I'd get a feel for the story behind the game and it's story, before I dive in feet-first. Thus I picked up this book in order to acquaint myself with Paragon City and its denizens...The era is post-World War I; rogue turned soldier Marcus Cole is on the biggest heist of his life: uncovering the treasures of the Well of the Furies. But when a mysterious aura from the well affects him and members of his crew who came close to it transforms them into near demi-gods, he realizes that the powers given to him are a call to greater responsibility, responsibility which he -- in the guise of Statesman, the costumed hero -- brings to the crime-infested streets of his hometown, Paragon City, now in the throes of the Depression and the upheavals of Prohibition. And to add to the sufferings of the city, a mysterious crime syndicate known as the Web of Arachnos has arisen, spreading its threads into the heart of the city...The characters may be types -- the noble, chiseled-jawed hero, the troubled believer in science who slowly loses his humanity to the cold equations he trusts in, the plucky girl reporter who gets herself into scrapes while pursuing the big story -- and the plot is a little predictable, but it is this way only because it's typical of the pulp novel genre and it's direct descendant, the superhero genre. In some ways, since modern novels have grown away from this, it's almost refreshing to return to this kind of innocent story-telling."},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"It was... okay. Not a page-burner by any stretch, but if you're really into City of Heroes, it's not a bad read, either.The book introduces us to Marcus Cole (aka Statesman) and Stefan Richter (aka Lord Recluse) and takes us through their origin at the Fountain of Zeus, the downfall of their friendship, and through the first major battle of good-versus-evil for Paragon City. Along the way, we get to meet the Dark Watcher, Elementar, Vambrace, and even Maiden Justice, grandmother of the famed Miss Liberty. All of the events take place during the 1930's in a time when villains were diabolical and heroes were few and far between.As an interesting story of origins and a historical background for the City of Heroes game, the book was okay. As a standalone novel, though, it falls a bit short in a few areas.The writing style, while not quite bad, is not as good as it should have been. The number of big men in the book that have fingers like sausages is amusing. There's not much depth to the characters. Everyone is good or evil. Stupid or smart. Small or huge. Straight-and-narrow or guilty-as-sin. Maybe the author was shooting for Golden Age comic book-type simplicity to go with the time period in which the novel is set, but it usually comes off as very predictable and common. There are no real conflicts in the book, other than those solved by fists and bullets. No inner turmoil, no real climax except when the unstoppable force meets the movable objects (an outcome that's a foregone conclusion), and not much suspense to make you have to read the next chapter to find out what happens.Some of the details required quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. A fabled fountain of immortality under a site with millions of dollar's worth of undiscovered archaeological curiosities strewn about intact within an easy day's row of Crete? Stefan's transformation from Marcus Cole's closest friend to the twisted and murderous Lord Arachnos was a bit hasty and implausible. He went from Cole's loyal confidant to a backstabbing murderer with fascist ambitions in less time than it took Anakin Skywalker to go from saving the Republic to killing Jedi younglings. And the same hasty transformation happened to Marcus Cole as well. When we meet him, he is stealing priceless treasures of the ancient Library of Alexandria from a museum. One sip from the Fountain and he goes from being a criminal to putting away criminals. And even our new hero, upon closer inspection, has some curiously glossed-over flaws. He escapes justice for the crimes he committed by monetary bribes and payoffs. He enlists the aid of a crime family that, by the end of the book, the reader should still not be convinced is as legitimate as the author tries to lead us to believe.I am still rating the book three stars because I believe that it serves its purpose adequately--to give us a glimpse of history that got us to the Paragon City we virtually live in today. I just hope that the next novel will give us a lot more reason to care about our favorite characters in City of Heroes and a lot more reason to come back for more. Ideally, I would like to see a novel that a non-player could read and that may even entice him or her to give the game a try. Unfortuantely, by that standard, this one doesn't quite measure up.(The Freedom Phalanx is due to be published in April 2006 and is available here at Amazon.com. According to the excerpt in Web of Arachnos, it will be set in the mid-1980's.)"},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"As was described in an earlier review, the transformation of bandit Marcus Cole into Statesman was not adequately explained. I also want to know why Stephan Riechter, who becomes Lord Recluse, grows into a monster with metal-tipped spider legs on his back. This is not explained well either. There is also a scene where a non-super-powered reporter, who has been taking some martial arts classes, karate chops a large steel pipe or beam and bends it in two with her bare hands.Also, the superheroes that come to aid Statesman pretty much come out of nowhere. Elementar seems extremely powerful and it's surprising that he did not do anything with his powers until Statesman came along.I could go on if I felt like refering back to the book, but I don't. It's just not a very polished story in my humble opinion. I hope the author's own original works are better than this."},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"It is very hard to write a compelling book placed in a world the writer themself did not invent. Just see any of the various Magic: the Gathering novels for a good example of what happens when a writer fails to carry off a convincing story.The Web of Arachnos, on the other hand, weaves a compelling adventure about two inseperable friends who wind up dire enemies. The deterioration of their relationship and the creation of both a superhero and a supervillain is told with compassionate insight into what drives people to choose lifestyles and priorities most of us would label as \\"evil\\".An excellent study of human nature set in the universe of a popular online game. What more could a modern reader ask for?"},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"It's nice to finally have some good background written on City of Heroes.And by one of the best game-related fantasy author, no less.I raced through this book with delight. I hope you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Web of Arachnos (City of Heroes)","review":"The Web Of Arachnos fills a lot of details in on the history of Paragon City, and those who inhabit it. We meet Statesman, the iconic character of CoH, and his ex-friend, Stefan, now known as Lord Recluse. The action stutters in a couple of places, and the switch of the bonvivant Marcus Cole into the heroic Statesmen is not as well done as I was like, but it still was a great read. Recommended"},{"Title":"Still-life paintings from the Netherlands, 1550-1720","review":"Many art books are published each year and it is not often that a book comes along that stops me in my tracks. Such has been my reaction to this book. It is oversized, has plenty of color reproductions and the special quality of this book is the detailed reproductions that are included. One can actually study the brushwork and details of many of the paintings throughout the book. There is a visual feast for the reader here as well as thouthful essays on the artists and their work. Artists need good libraries to refer to and to inspire them and this book is one of those rare books which does both. It is a rare volume - being the catalog of the show by the same name. It is now out of print and finding it is difficult. It a book to relish, study, ponder and keep for a lifetime. Although the price may be on the higher end, it is worth every penny and more. It will not fail to provide insight into what makes a truly great painting. The work is from the golden age of still life painting. You'll never see better still lifes than the ones in the book.

The author weaves together several poignant experiences in the protagonist's life -- and ends with a visit to his home country.This novel is independently published by Author House, and would have benefited from greater editorial review.

She also opens the door for personal spiritual reflection. &quot;God is like a mother hen, a caring daddy, a smiling teacher. . . and much, much more.&quot; After each series of metaphors, Bohler allows for the child to imagine what God is like. The images in the book are inclusive - God is more than just a father! Also, the illustrations are simple and bright, very eye-catching! Bohler has done a wonderful job of introducing the amazing complexities of God's nature - the love, tenderness, joy and compassion - to a child. By listing the Biblical references at the conclusion, Bohler provides parents and teachers with a wonderful teaching resource. A wonderful Christmas, Easter, baptism, etc. gift for a child!"},{"Title":"God is Like a Mother Hen and Much, Much More","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!

Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefield.)","review":"[...]Chuck Thompson has made something special here and I strongly recommend his book to the historically minded traveler. I graduated a semester early from Lehigh University and played the classic college-boy card: Backpacking Europe. My travels were excellent; thanks in part to \\"The 25 Best World War II Sites: European Theater.\\" It is a thoughtful, thorough analysis of the magical relics of World War II. In addition, it is a superb travel guide. It encouraged me to see things I would not have seen, to go where I would never have gone. For the young American overseas, I can hardly imagine a more satisfying, paperback companion.From the \\"Big 25-list,\\" I went to the Normandy Beaches, twice, and to London, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Bastogne, Belgium/Luxembourg, Paris, Munich, Nuremberg, and Rome. When at these places, this book provided a plan of action based on Thompson's maps, directions, and rating system. In addition, Thompson's textual description of each area included both details and the wide picture, providing a compact history book for the weight-conscious backpacker. The obvious highlights, such as Normandy and Auschwitz, are well covered and worth visiting, but it is in the small, lesser-known areas where I felt the true value of this praise-worthy guide.Let me highlight several places in particular that won me over:*The Nazi Party Rally Grounds @ Nuremburg* - Germany's a big place and I may not have known where to go without this book. When I left Prague ahead of schedule, this small German town with the darkest of histories knocked me out. So much and so little remains from this mysterious lost time.*Maginot Line @ Longuyon* - Yes, I walked 12 miles across the French countryside to hunt out these ancient forts. They were closed when I got there; however, this ranks among my best days. Make sure to check the \\"Auxiliary Sites\\" section!*Patton's Grave @ Luxembourg* - On the same day as the Maginot Line. I walked 3 miles outside of Luxembourg at dusk to pay tribute to this great among Americans. I would have found none of these places without Thompson's book.*Belgium* - The European nexus of both World Wars, this tiny country is thick with history. When in Brussels, travel outside the city center to the Royal Museum of the Army and Military History. Thank you, Jay Blitzer, for taking me to Liege. Before I close up, the town of Yper in Belgium is *the* place for WWI battle sites. I rented a bike there and had an unbelievable time.In Thompson's introduction, he warns that, \\"Outside of major cities and a few noted exceptions, the only way to efficiently visit the battlefields and sites covered in this book is by car.\\" On the other hand, an adventurous traveler can use this book with excellent results without a car. I did.Here is my recommendation: go to Europe, use this book, and learn about human history. Take a Guidebook (Let's Go, Rough Guide, LonelyPlanet) and this book. I planned my trip using Rick Steves' Europe Through The Backdoor. These books will make a smooth trip, overall. Thompson's travel guide makes World War II battle sites approachable and memorable. A Thompson five-star site is a clear winner, hands down. I slapped myself for not realizing the value of Thompson's guide earlier in my trip. I missed Cassino, for example. When is my next vacation?I thank the men and women whose sacrifices protected the world in the 1940s. For next trip, pack a Thompson-guide and travel Europe through history. May we always have such an easy way to pay our respects."},{"Title":"The 25 Best World War II Sites, European Theater: The Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefields, Monuments & Museums (25 Essential World War II ...

The names seem dimly familiar--Anzio, Bastogne, Cassino--but the stories of these major Euro battlefields are long gone, buried under a mountain of pop culture trivia. No more. This guide to the most intense hot spots of WWII brings back the heroics, the strategies--and the places themselves, because this is a travel book, not a textbook, with all the info needed to experience these settings first-hand: the military points of interest, local accommodations, transportation and other attractions in the area. It's the kind of information that falls between the cracks of travel guidebooks. Thompson does an excellent job of bringing this period vividly to life, with a slew of anecdotes and nuggets that kept this Vic Morrow-loving &quot;Combat&quot; fan immersed from Normandy to Kursk.

Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefield.)","review":"My yearning to visit the World War II battlefields of Europe and the Pacific has existed since i was 13 (30 years ago). The reality of life is that the likelihood of me ever actually visiting these places anytime soon is slim (thanks to the economy). Then, there is the dilemma of which sites to visit when factoring the amount of travel time available (as well as money). This is where i find these books (both the European and Pacific volumes) extremely valuable.My inexperience with international travel does not allow me to make a credible evaluation of these books as travel guide. However, I can express how they provide a satisfyingly comprehensive taste as to what is available to see for those who can't actually visit these interesting places. Unlike most travel guides I've encountered, these aren't tedious and boring. They provide a tremendous amount of detail about what is available to see and why people may want to see it. Each listed site starts with a brief, but informative historical narrative, followed by a synopsis of how the locality exists today, a map of the general area that pinpoints of significant sites within the area (museums, memorials, foxholes, etc.). There is, of course, the expected general travel information (accommodation, dining and transportation details). Additionally, a small portfolio is located in the center of each book with color pictures of the 25 locations.The 25 sites in each book are \\"ranked\\" according to the author's opinion and the areas of interest located at each site are \\"rated\\" by the author: 5 stars - \\"a must see\\" ... down to 1 star. I did not interpret the author's rankings as influential, but useful in organizing the various locations in an easy-to-digest manner.Obviously, not every battlefield is represented in these books, but the author did very well in providing the most compelling places to visit, as well as dedicating a section at the end of each volume to \\"other areas of interest\\".For a non-traveler, like me, who wants to see these places, but can't ... these travel guides should fill that void or motivate you to actually plan a trip. I have not found any other source better at presenting a \\"then-and-now\\" perspective of so many World War II locales. If and when I do get the opportunity to visit these places, I'll definitely use these books. But, for now, I am content with having them as a resource in my library."},{"Title":"The 25 Best World War II Sites, European Theater: The Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefields, Monuments & Museums (25 Essential World War II ...

This book does not put itself out as a historical writing, only one that has coordinated and organized WW2 sites in such a way that a novice or buff can find the sites and learn more. While it ranks the sites (Holocaust sites are not ranked as they could never be stratified against another historical moment in time) it does so based on the ability of one to find the site, location, physical identifiers and the learning possibilities of that site. They do amplify the travel elements with historical facts for the reader to further support their choices.Great book!"},{"Title":"The 25 Best World War II Sites, European Theater: The Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefields, Monuments & Museums (25 Essential World War II ... Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefield.)","review":"When I have visited Civil War battlefields from Gettysburg to Shiloh I have brought along the respective volumes from the Time-Life Civil War series as a convenient way of recalling what happened. While nowhere as nearly profusely illustrated, Chuck Thompson has put together an excellent guide to \\"The 25 Best World War II Sites: European Theater\\" for those who are traveling to the Continent and want to see the best sites. This holds true whether they are brought by memories of serving in World War II, to see where relatives fought during the war, or simply to see the realities behind movies like \\"The Longest Day\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (in fact, Thompson makes a point of referencing dramatizations like \\"Band of Brothers\\" and other standard WWII fare).The goal of this guide is to direct travelers in Europe to those places of greatest importance interest with regards to World War II. Thompson's subjective rankings were determined by judging sites on the basic of three equally weighted qualities: (1) their historical significance; (2) the amount and quality of relics or points of interest remaining at a given site; and (3) the merits of each site as a travel destination, its services, natural beauty and general desirability independent of its association with the war. Consequently, Stalingrad and the Battle of the Bulge make the cut whereas Dieppe and Dunkirk do not, with London, Paris and Rome having an inherent advantage over locales that are not cosmopolitan capitals.The results of this tabulation is as follows: (1) Normandy I: Utah, Omaha Beaches; (2) Normandy II: Gold, Juno, Sword Beaches; (3) London; (4) Auschwitz-Birkenau; (5) Bastogne: Battle of the Bulge I; (6) Belgium/Luxembourg: Battle of the Bulge II; (7) Pas de Calais; (8) Berlin; (9) Washington, D.C.; (10) South Coast of England; (11) Cassino; (12) Paris; (13) Moscow; (14) Normandy III: The Breakout; (15) Munich; (16) Nuremberg; (17) East Anglia; (18) Volgograd (Stalingrad); (19) Norway; (20) Netherlands: Operation Market-Garden; (21) Rome; (22) Remagen/Eifel Region; (23) Anzio; (24) Kursk; and (25) Auxiliary Sites, which lists everything from the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam to the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, with the likes of Hitler's birthplace, the Museum of the Great Patriotic War, the Maginot Line, Berchtesgarden, the Medinat el-Alamein War Museum and the Treblinka Concentration Camp in between. This last chapter is arranged by country, so if you happen to be in the Balkans, Finland, Italy, Malta, or pretty much any other European nation, Thompson gives you an indication of what there is to see.For each of these sites Thompson lists the individual points of interest in the area, provides detailed histories and maps of the sites, and gives direction to everything from monuments and city museums to landing beaches and battlefields. The points of interested are rated from ***** (major site, must visit) to * (only if you have time or special interest), although Thompson wisely refrains from rating Holocaust sites. He also emphasizes in his introduction that these ratings are not meant to judge the relative importance of a battle or of the lives lost there, but to indicate the relative value to a tourist. He also provides an interesting perspective by noting that a visitor will notice that nations like England and Russia weave the mythology of the historic conflict into their national identities in decidedly different ways. However, the main concern here is the utility of this guide for visitors to any of these cites.For example, in the first chapter devoted to the Utah and Omaha beaches in Normandy, we begin with a description of what happened there during the war year (with a short list of sources and other readings), and a map showing 21 numbered sites. After a brief description of Normandy Today, Thompson goes through those 21 sites, where the Utah Beach/Museum, Point du Hoc/Range Memorial, National Guard Memorial/Bunkers, Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, and U.S. 1st Division Monument/Omaha Beach are the five-star rated sites. Cherbourg is listed as one of the Related Sites Beyond Utah and Omaha, while the Bayeux Tapestry is one of the Other Area Attractions. Thompson also covers Getting To/Around Normandy and Accommodations in the area (e.g., Hotel Du Juin 6).There are several pages of color photographs included to give you an idea of what there is to see, including the Fuhrer's rostrum at Nuremberg, Patton's grave in Luxembourg, Longues Battery at Normandy, the Gate of Death at Auschwitz-Birkenaur, and the Flour Mill in Volgograd. The number of people who will have the opportunity to see most of these sites is going to be relatively small, but even if all you get to see are a handful of sites in various locations, this is still a worthwhile investment. It can also help you determine what you should see, both in terms of desire and opportunity (for example, getting to Poland to see Auschwitz-Birkenaur might be impractical, but there are, of course, camps throughout eastern Europe, from Dachau west of Munich and Bergen-Belsen outside Bergen to Natzweiler-Struthof in France.The chapter on Washington, D.C. does show that there are some things to see on this side of the Atlantic, but also speaks to the utility of a European visitor coming here to see World War II related sites as well. Yes, there is a companion volume for \\"The 25 Best World War II Sites: Pacific Theater\\" by Thompson, which obviously covers a larger area geographically. But it should provide the same level of utility as this book."},{"Title":"The 25 Best World War II Sites, European Theater: The Ultimate Traveler's Guide to Battlefields, Monuments & Museums (25 Essential World War II ...

For one thing, the Baron Cosimo doesn't just live in ONE tree, but travels around from tree to tree, extremely far distances. While this seemed a little bit implausible to me, because the book never tries to pass itself off as a literal tale, it's quite acceptable. While I agree that the book has many messages on another level, the aspect of the book that appealed the most to me was the sheer romance of it. His incredible love with the little girl next door (who of course grows into quite a woman!) and his very different love of a girl he meets when he travels to meet others who he has heard live in trees, are the parts of the book that remain the most with me. Also, the number of adventures that he has, and his relationship with his pet dog, as well as the entertaining side characters (his sister, who makes suppers from absolutely horrifying ingredients! his mother, who embroiders military strategies onto pillows! who wouldn't be crazy about THAT stuff??) made this a truly enjoyable read for me."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"This is among the most graceful, least self conscious works of historical fiction I've run across.

That's a good way to attract readership; most of us shy away from heavy, dull stories that teach moral lessons, and while we can all enjoy simple entertainments, we sometimes want something more substantial. No one can enjoy being restricted to either oat bran or cotton candy - you need both. So this kind of mixture is a real gift, and \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" presents itself as a good example of the type. You get the feeling somehow that there's more here than just a silly joke, but what might it be?The title, of course, tells us all we need to know about the surface plot. It's about a young nobleman, just entering adolescence in 1767, who one day balks at a nasty supper. Upon being scolded he races outside, climbs a tree in the garden and refuses to come down. He spends the next 50 years or more up there, moving from tree to tree in the family's garden, then to other gardens and then to the forest, and he never touches the ground again.The jacket blurb correctly advises that Cosimo, in the course of his life in the trees, manages to help with the crops and winemaking, puts out forest fires, goes hunting with the help of his dog, studies philosophy, befriends solid citizens and underworld figures alike, draws the attention of his age's great men like Voltaire and Napoleon, and conducts various love affairs. This is all well and good, but what's the point?Let's take an obvious one first. This story takes place during a time when perspectives were changing very fast - although the events seldom get a mention in this novel, Cosimo's tenure in the trees covers the American and French Revolutions, the Catholic Church's decline in power and the various Napoleonic Wars. Cosimo's change in perspective is a little more obvious than that, and leads him at one time to discard all the trappings of civilization, at another to compose an elaborate plan for a new society, and just about everything in between. All of this makes sense, considering that his new life begins with an act of rebellion against parental authority and continues to question other kinds of authority from then on. So if you like, you can consider \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" a sort of metaphoric retelling of the Age of Enlightenment.Well, sort of. Remember how I said that Calvino was good at mixing the serious and the silly? If this novel were only an allegory of something else, we could do quite well without it, thank you very much. Fortunately, it works on other levels too; Calvino chooses his details with care for maximum entertainment value. It's probably not an accident, for instance, that just about all of the plot occurs during Cosimo's youth and young manhood - we see little of his middle years, and his old age only in the last chapter. Like most young men, this one can seem a little ridiculous sometimes, particularly when it comes to young women. It's one of this book's joys that for all his noble bearing and adventurous spirit, Cosimo falls flat on his face at times. Another such joy is the fact that Cosimo never quite loses the ability to show up authority figures, either by out-arguing them or by simply ignoring them.Calvino frequently used some very effective narrative strategies in his work, and \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" is no exception. Our narrator is not Cosimo himself, nor the usual unidentified third-person narrator, but Cosimo's younger brother, who stays on the ground, lives a normal life and watches the whole thing from a distance while remaining involved to one extent or another. It's from him that we learn of Cosimo's impact on the rest of the world, why we should care about him at all, and why a story like his could only have occurred at that precise historical moment. And it's not just because there are few trees in the modern age, either.To my mind, it's that last point that makes \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" a special story. The rest of it is a lot of fun, but it's the closing that provides its poignancy. I won't say much more, but ask yourself this question - if you were telling a story about a man who lives his whole life in the trees, how would you end it? For that matter, if you were the brother of a man like that, what would you hope for? I maintain that you wouldn't want him to climb down after all that time, but he couldn't very well stay up there, either. Wait until you see Cosimo's solution.\\"The Baron in the Trees\\", short as it is, can make you laugh out loud, but its ending is a sort of farewell to past times unlike anything you're likely to find except in Calvino's other work. This story was at one time published with a couple of the author's similar tales, \\"The Nonexistent Knight\\" and \\"The Cloven Viscount\\", under the title \\"Our Ancestors\\", and as that name implies, they all have something to say about the vanished past. So goodbye to Cosimo, and on to our other two ancestors.Benshlomo says, Changing perspectives is only useful if you do something useful with it."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Many people have already summarized the book in this space, so I'll skip the blow-by-blow. The Baron in the Trees is a fantastic, beautifullly written story that enchanted, entranced, and deeply moved me. Calvino's prose is lyrical and as lush as the world that Cosimo and Biagio inhabit. Read it--you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"the central conceit (someone who chooses to live in trees) is a good one, and is intelligently followed through. here we have the conflict between custom (nomos) and the natural law (physis), played out in a literal sense as the man-made house is abandoned for a life in the trees. what we are offered is a patchwork of stories that make up an unconventional life.i progressed through the book slowly and found there to be little dramatic tension in it, the result, perhaps, of the author preferring the 'anecdotal' style of narrating; Calvino tells us how most of the episodes will end at the beginning of each episode. intensity is only really achieved in the complicated relationship between Cosimo and Viola, which is handled with great perceptiveness and literary skill. that said, there is plenty to enjoy in this book; tales of piracy, bandits, wars and philosophers.the book contains some useful general insights too; Calvino is surely a prescient environmentalist when he tells us that the forests Cosimo inhabited throughout his life have been destroyed by &quot;men who loved nothing, not even themselves&quot;.overall, i thought that the ideas in this book were very modern, and that the author was extremely competent at evoking places, scenes, characters, etc. but the force of the work was slightly reduced for me by the anecdotal manner in which it was delivered."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"This is a truly charming book that will transport the reader into Calvino's modern past. He has a unique style of writing that makes the medieval ages seem alive. In this book, he portrays a young nobleman who vows to live in the trees. I think that the book has the same &quot;magic realism&quot; feeling as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. You suspend your disbelief that someone could (or would) live in the trees. This is a beautiful book that should be in everyone's library."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The Baron in the Trees appealed to me because I love the idea of climbing up into the trees and never returning to terra firma again. My only quarrel with the book was that it seemed rather forced towards the end. This might be my faulty reading of it, or it may be the way the book was written, but it seems only honest to mention it. Nonetheless, it's a very fanciful book, brimming with expectation and freedom, and definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Most young boys, presented with a plateful of boiled snails for dinner and forced to eat them, might well remove themselves from the dining room--just as Cosimo takes to the trees as a rebellion against the screwball whims of his family. After this memorable opening, however, any pretense of realism ends, because for the rest of his life Cosimo never touches solid ground again.The comedy of Cosimo's family is narrated by his younger brother, Biagio, who serves as the \\"grounded\\" foil to the folly of his parents and siblings. The boys' father is a bore \\"dominated by conflicting ideas\\" whose meek personality pales when set against the supremacy of the household's womenfolk. Their mother, the Generalessa, the daughter of the commander of the Holy Roman Empire's troops, has turned her household into a military camp, where even pieces of embroidery resemble maps \\"showing the disposition of battles in the Wars of Succession.\\" Cosimo's tough-as-nails sister, Battista, doubles as the cook, serving up basted baby porcupines and rats' liver pate and spending \\"nights wandering the house in search of mice, holding a candelabra, with a musket under her arm.\\"Although heir to this substantial, if quirkily managed, estate on earth, Cosimo establishes his own kingdom in the trees for the duration of the Age of Enlightenment, and he acquires first a local fame as a judicious protector (guarding against vagabond pirates and adolescent riffraff) and then a continental notoriety as a cerebral wit. A bibliophile even in his skyward perch, Cosimo corresponds with Diderot, to whom he posits a constitution for the ideal state, a Republic of Arborea. (Of course, once all of humanity had taken to the trees, Cosimo would necessarily return to his solitary life on the now-deserted land.) Being not exactly of the world permits him the distance \\"to see the earth properly.\\" (\\"Once it was only Nature that produced living phenomena,\\" says a bemused Voltaire. \\"Now \`tis Reason.\\") Even Napoleon, on his way to Milan to be crowned, pays a visit to this modern-day Simon Stock.One of Calvino's more popular (and most accessible) novels, the fairy-tale premise of \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" has occasionally been criticized for excessive cuteness, its farcical storyline often overpowering both its literary allusions and the seemingly haphazard references to seventeenth-century philosophy. Behind the folly, however, is a Donne-inspired morality tale that argues ad absurdum that there is no escaping the world; even from the air, Cosimo is as much a part of society as the most animated man-about-town on the ground."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"About midway through Calvino's refreshing recitation, the narrator tells us that &quot;Cosimo was still at the age when the desire to tell stories makes one want to live more, thinking one has not done enough living to recount.&quot; I believe that age is every age. Cosimo climbs into your heart from the very beginning, remaining as sure-footed there as he is up in the trees, and in so doing, reminds the reader that one doesn't have remain bound to the earth in order to find respectability. Though he tells his father, &quot;A gentleman ... is such whether he is on earth or on the treetops--if he behaves with decency,&quot; Cosimo chaffs at the world's heavyhandedness, pomp, and circumstance. Tarrying over our heads, Cosimo emerges as very down-to-earth."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The protagonist in this work is perhaps the best-delineated character in all of Calvino's works. Cosimo is both an ascetic stylite and participant in the Enlightenment, and the strains of his personality are ever stretched by contemplation, solitude, love, adventure, and the grotesque. Among Calvino's many fine works, The Baron in the Trees must be his greatest. More than any other work, it balances the author's penchant for wit, absurdity, and grand imagination with touching, yet never overwrought, sentimentality. The Baron in the Trees confirms Calvino's standing among the best writers in any language in this century."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"This is, by far, my favorite book of all time.

I have no regrets about buying this book!"},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Some people may think it funny that I rate this a good book for children. Although Calvino is predominately an 'adult' author, most of his books can be read by or to children without the problem of having to explain the subtle moods and feelings that most authors include to exclude the younger generation.This is a very enjoyable read, once 'into' the tale it becomes almost essential to follow through and find out what happens next. The writing is of such a high standard that it very easy to visualise the scenes happening as you read, one feels it almost too easy to translate to the silver screen, and that is when you realise just how well it is written!It would be enormously difficult to re-create the characters on screen. Who could play the stubborn old and young barons, the almost crazy mother and the sex crazed daughter, the haughty neighbour and even the indolent dog. Every type of character is here and whilst reading it is almost impossible not to relate on! e of the characters to someone you already know.This is a book not to be missed, one of Calvino's best!"},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"About three years ago I, not meaning to, got a three set of Italo Calvino books. It included &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot;, &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; and a title that I do not remember. Although at the time I could not get through the other two, I do remember that once I picked up this book I could not put it down.

The story follows Cosimo, who decides, at the ripe age of 12, to live in the trees; he sticks with this whimsical notion for his entire life. It's set in the last half of the 18th century, and the Cosimo character, for all his bizarre behaviour, becomes a representative of the times. Definitely worth a read, though if I could have given it 4 1/2 stars I would have been happier."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"This slim novel is so well worth reading. Magnificent. Calvino tells a story, that is the reader's for interpretation - kind, generous, wise and real. Can't do it justice in a review. I read it and, throughout, felt it was about all of love and life. I don't know if he brought this in only at the end, but it seems that one could read the entire book again with the thought that he is describing history (in a profound, parable kind of way) as much as anything else, and a reader could probably track the story differently then. Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Italo Calvino's The Baron in the Trees, is about a family and one son in particular, who chooses to live his life in the trees. As I see the trees in his part of Italy, they were somewhat umbrella like, with sufficient overlap so that a person could move quite a distance while never touching ground.I suppose the family didn't malfunction any more than most of the ones we know of, but one son, Cosimo, bridled at society and its expectations and so escaped into the trees. In spite of the element of escape, Cosimo soon tuned into the life of trees: \\"it was a whole different world, made up of narrow curved bridges in the emptiness, of knots or peel or scores roughening the trunks, of lights varying their green...\\"The world below Cosimo was flattened. He \\"who spent his nights listening to the sap running through its cells; the circles marking the years inside the trunks...\\" was definitely heeding a different drummer.The story is told by Cosimo's brother, Biagio, who, being more the observer than the actor and somewhat less adventuresome, reports on his brother's life with some degree of envy, even considering joining Cosimo. However, he is constantly told: \\"One rebel in the family is enough,\\" so he supports, talks to, and loves his brother, but doesn't go into the trees.In Cosimo's fantasyland, he gets lessons, has a girlfriend and social interchanges with many other people. He, in short, lives a life there, which Calvino admits may be as made up as words on a page, but has characters with which we come to care about.It may be a tale of the nature of reality, but it is very warm, often funny--not funny ha-ha, but pleasantly human as it points out the frailties of people. It's interesting in terms of, so how did he do it--live in the trees, that is? Here Calvino brings enough of the real world in that we are taken in. Our attention is arrested.We are delighted and charmed."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The Baron in the Trees is a book which escaped my attention as a child, and for reasons totally unknown to me. I can only hope I am in the minority.In a nutshell, a child has a tantrum with a strong old-fashioned patriarch and displays his hissy fit by climbing a tree. From that moment to his death, he never again will step on the earth. A concept which many of us as children dreamed could be done.In the span of about 60 years, the boy Cosimo becomes a man, a leader, and more. In aForrest Gumpmanner, his little world amid the arbors touches upon great events of his historical era - Voltaire, Rousseau, a bandit of fame, Napoleon, free masonry and more.The everpresent references to the names of the species of trees and often recited passages to the agility of Cosimo's leaping about the limbs of the well described trees render images of Cosimo's grace being akin to that of monkeys or comic book hero Spiderman. Cosimo is not only above his brethren in regard to space on earth, but his magnificent ability to step and dance on the tops of trees is deemed majestic to the earth-anchored people of his town.The stream of events, often involving a boy's or young man's travels from one venue (in this case forrest to forrest) to another, in which conflicts and victories are gained, remind me of another European fairy tale for adults:The Painted Bird. But, this involves much less gore than the often-too-explicit Bird.Recently, I read another book about a poor boy who jumped into a tree in India, remains steadfast in keeping residence in the trees, and becomes something of a swami of renown -Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard. Here, a rich boy jumps into a tree and becomes something of a philosopher. The similarities of concept are obvious.Although childlike fantasy lies as the foundation to the concept of this book, the braiding of the fictional accounts with great events of that time's history are meant for a more mature or adult reader. Whether old or young, this story is good fun."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The Baron in the Trees is one of the most enchanting novels ever written. When the Baron decides to take up his arboreal existence, one cannot help but believe he is making the right decision. Calvino fleshes out the Baron into one of the most believable characters in literature. This is an amazing feat considering the farcical lifestyle the Baron decides to adopt. Calvino takes the opportunity to create a world at once steeped in history, philosophy and politics while at the same time illustrating the everyday existence and lives of those around him. The cat skin hat, the exiles in the trees, the Napoleonic troops all brought to life with amazing detail. Memory, love and history all combine and swirl throughout the story. While there is nothing exactly magical or out of this world about this book, it is one of the best examples of magical realism I have read. I could not put this book down. Stop reading this review and buy the book."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Like most of Italo Calvino's fiction, &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; is pure enchantment that charms the reader into an alternate reality with the warmth of subtle humor and the pioneering spirit, similar to Borges's, that desires to explore fascinating new literary territory within the context of world history. In this novel, set in Italy in the late eighteenth century, Calvino tells the story of a young baron named Cosimo Piovasco di Rondo who lives with his eccentric family in a villa on the edge of the town of Ombrosa. One day when he is twelve years old, after an argument with his parents (about having to eat snails), he runs out to the garden and climbs an oak, declaring that he will spend the rest of his life in the trees and vowing never to set foot on the earth again.Like an arboreal Robinson Crusoe who has chosen his fate, Cosimo determines to make his living in the contiguous group of trees that link his family's garden with those of his neighbors and the forests beyond the town. He travels between trees by climbing and jumping from branch to branch, becoming as nimble and elusive as a squirrel, while he trains himself to survive by hunting wild animals for food and clothing and building a flume to draw drinking water from a waterfall. Even in the trees he engages in activities normally reserved for people on the ground: He continues his formal education, befriends a dachshund that helps him hunt, supports a bumbling brigand's reading habit, and even has an adventure on a pirate ship without touching the deck.Through his life in the trees, Cosimo becomes notorious throughout Europe and attains a reputation for madness that gradually turns into a strange sort of esteem. He converses with strangers, meets a group of Spanish exiles who also happen to be tree-dwellers, becomes a writer and natural scientist, and wins the hearts of many ladies who provide him with sexual gratification--in the branches, of course. Far from becoming a Rousseauian savage or a hermit, however, he remains quite civilized and gregarious; his palpable wisdom and curious residence ironically earn him more respect than he would get from the people if he were just a normal land-dwelling baron.Calvino presents the story as a biography narrated by Cosimo's younger brother Biagio, who with affectionate patience describes in vivid detail every aspect of Cosimo's life and is quite hilarious in his explanations of their beleaguered father, militaristic mother, and gruesome, mischievous sister Battista, a &quot;kind of stay-at-home nun.&quot; His efforts to explain Cosimo require him to delve into the mind of a political philosopher who aspires to be as influential as Machiavelli: When his father admonishes him that living in trees does not befit a nobleman, Cosimo replies that a true leader is someone who has ideas and communicates them to the people, not a man with an inherited title.&quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; may be read as a parable about withdrawing from reality and creating an isolated fantasy world in which to live free from the constraints of society as the ultimate expression of individuality, or as just a wonderful fable about a boy becoming a man on his own terms. One thing is sure: you'll never look at a tree the same way again."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Calvino is another of those writers I'd heard of, but would never have read had it not been for our book group's selection of this book. I'm glad to say that this is a tale enjoyable by children and adults alike, skillfully operating on several levels. The story concerns Cosimo, a noble born boy in late 18th-century Italy who one day defies his parents by climbing a tree and refusing to come back down. His life story is narrated by his younger brother, and Cosimo's adventures in the trees work both as charming tale for children, and as a metaphor for the Enlightenment for adults. Living among the treetops, Cosimo is seeking to distance himself from social traditions and norms while creating his own world and relationships. It obviously requires a little suspension of disbelief, but even those who normally hate magical realism (like me) will find it palatable. The cast of supporting characters are quirky and vividly entertaining, including his dog, militarist mother, disaster-in-the-kitchen sister, and exiled Spanish nobles. It's one of the most enjoyable (and short) piece of utopian literature I've encountered, and would make ripe reading for high school students."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Calvino never fails to mesmerize. His books suck you in and don't let go until the final word (and that final word always seems to include a touch of sadness that the novel is over). This is one of Calvino's earlier works, written in 1957, the same year he left the communist party (his reason is summed up in: &quot;my decision to resign as a member of the party is founded on the fact that my discrepancies with those of the party have become an obstacle to whatever form of political participation I could undertake&quot;). &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; does include some passages about disappointed political ideals (e.g., about the French Revolution), but the book touches on far too many topics to reduce it to a mere &quot;political&quot; novel.The story begins, as the first line of the novel tells us, on the fifteenth of June, 1767. Cosimo Piovasco di Rond&ograve; is a member of a family whose father has sights on climbing the aristocratic ladder. In the very first chapter there is a family scuffle, during dinner, which results in Cosimo going into the trees and vowing never to come down (&quot;And he kept his word&quot; Cosimo's brother, who narrates the story, states). Cosimo then resigns himself to a life in the trees. After some initial mishaps (dealing with rain, bathing, food, etc), he proves himself very adaptable to living off the ground. Human adaptability seems to be at the back of the story (along with many other things); his family and town almost grow accustomed to Cosimo's darting amongst the branches. Cosimo even makes a name for himself &quot;up in the trees&quot; (Voltaire asks about him, and Napolean insists on meeting him). Of course the big question that comes from this action, in the very opening of the novel, is why did Cosimo go up into the trees? Why didn't he simply run away? One possible answer is that he wanted to make an example of himself. Living in the trees (especially in the 18th century) would likely make one into a spectacle. Running away wouldn't make as strong of a point, and would sever ties to his family which Cosimo does not want to do (this becomes more obvious as the novel moves on). And why does he stay in the trees? One possible answer is that which his brother gives to Voltaire: &quot;My brother considers that anyone who wants to see the earth properly must keep himself at a necessary distance from it.&quot; Another possibility is, close to the novel's end, Cosimo is speaking with a Russian officer, who says, right after some members of his unit present him with the severed heads of some hussars, &quot;You see.. War... For years now I've been dealing as best I can with a thing that in itself is appalling; war... and all this for ideals which I shall never, perhaps, be able to fully explain to myself...&quot; Cosimo answers in like: &quot;I too have lived many years for ideals which I would never be able to explain to myself; but I do something entirely good. I live on trees.&quot; Rambunctous and impetuous youth led Cosimo into the trees (he was only twelve when he took to the branches), but his ideals, once established, kept him there the rest of his life. All of us make descions in our youth that we either follow through with or abandon. Cosimo never abandoned his decision, for good or ill.The novel reads like an adventure in places (e.g., when the feared, or imaginary, &quot;Gian dei Brughi&quot; is terrorizing the countryside, but evetually becomes addicted to novels - which in and of itself makes for a hilarious few chapters - Cosimo is there for almost every move); in other places it reads like a heartbreaking love story (e.g., Cosimo's nearly lifelong affair with Viola, which becomes so intense it's almost painful to read). A lot of action goes on in the trees, and the reader will likely not conclude that Cosimo has &quot;missed something&quot; as a result of his decision. Overall the novel is so readable that it's hard to put down (it could probably be completed in one long sitting). It has that mix of reality and fantasy that Calvino is famous for (it's easy to find references to Calvino as &quot;one of the world's best fabulists&quot;). Like other Calvino it's funny (Cosimo's sister serves bizarre arrangements of food to the family), heartbreaking (did Cosimo find true love in the trees or did he fail miserably?), poignant (he finds a great comrade in a small daschund he names &quot;Ottimo Massimo&quot; but the dog ultimately belongs to someone else), and a great read. The decisions one makes in life have impact on oneself and others, and in Cosimo's case his decision had vast impact on his immediate surroundings, regardless of the reasons why. Make a good decision for yourself and read this book."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"I devoured this book yesterday, I loved it--Ok, so I was in airports and on airplanes all day, but what a great way to spend those hours. Set in the Enlightenment era of the late 18th Century in Lombardi, Italy, Calvino's novel portrays the break of the individual from Tradition by...a man living in a tree!Calvino's writing is seamless; he has a great pacing between narrative/dialogue flow, a balance between fantasy and reality, characters that are engaging, and yes, satire.In his collection of essays, &quot;The Uses Of Literature,&quot; Calvino states that he wrote the protagonist, the Baron Cosimo, to be a &quot;Don Quixote of the Enlightenment.&quot; Cosimo strives for objectivity, to distance himself from his natural world by living between earth and sky. He sets up his society and livelihood, entirely in the trees, as his own Noble Savage. He is civilized and still brutish, a lady's man and wildly single.I think this novel could and should be taught in the colleges and high schools as Satire Literature, as Utopian Literature, as The Individual in Society Literature. If any of those themes don't appeal to you, then read it for its pleasure."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"I love everything Italo Calvino ever wrote. His writing has a light, whimsical charm that is present no matter what his subject matter and that never fails to win me over. \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" is one of Calvino's most charming and whimsical stories, but it's also touched with poignancy and sadness, a mixture at which Calvino excelled.When Cosimo makes his decision to live his life in the tree tops, we don't doubt that he'll do it. He's a perfectly believable character and perfectly drawn, as is his more practical, down-to-earth (literally) brother. The supporting characters are also very well-drawn and very believable. I don't know of any writer but Calvino who could make us believe in and sympathize with a person who lives out his life in the trees. Cosimo studies, endures illness and injury and even conducts love affairs from his arboreal home.I love this book and it's one of my \\"Calvino favorites.\\" It might not be quite the masterpiece that \\"If on a winter's night a traveler\\" is but it comes very close.

The magical nature of the story is compelling, and Calvino is a marvelous craftsman of fantasy. The book does have some flaws: I had fundamental problems with Cosimo's reasons for going into the tree in the first place and deciding to remain there; it seemed to me that he spent his life in the trees out of sheer stubbornness. This explanation, in the midst of a book that seemed to be trying to say something through Cosimo's wisdom, was unsatisfying for me. But the scenes which deal with human relationships are stunning in their truth (if not their objective reality), and the arboreal world Calvino creates is one that I'd like to see. One of my students recommended this book to me, and I am grateful to him for doing so. I'm somewhat at a loss to compare this book with anything else I've ever read--but I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"One of Italo Calvino's best and one of my all-time favorites. It's the story of a boy from a noble family who, out of disgust with people, climbs into a tree on his family's property and never comes down. He grows old in the trees but lives a full life. Extremely imaginative as only Italo Calvino can be."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Italo Calvino was one of the most underrated maestros of magical realism, where atoms fall in love and empty suits of armor walk and talk. And one of his most polished, reader-friendly stories was \\"Baron in the Trees,\\" a fable about a nobleman who lives his whole life in a tree. Yes, it sounds weird -- but the result is sweet, uplifting and full of childlike wonder.A young nobleman, Cosimo, was enraged when his eccentric sister made dinner out of his pet snails. So when his father ordered him to eat, he ran up a tree and swore to stay there forever. And he did, from his adolescence up to old age, becoming famous as the Baron in the Trees. Even at the death of his parents, he remained in the trees nearby, watching and helping -- but not coming down. Even when the Baron dies, he finds a way to ascend even higher...Without leaving the trees, he manages to hunt animals, educate himself with great philosophers, adopts an abandoned dog, lends bestselling books to a local bandito, battles pirates who are conspiring with his uncle, has an affair with a promiscuous Marchesa, and even lives with a band of tree-dwelling Spanish exiles.\\"Baron in the Trees\\" is a whimsical little story on the surface, until you look deeper at the message of \\"living in trees.\\" Cosimo removes himself from the ground, and also removes himself from the worries of ordinary people -- social position, power, material goods. He's happy just to have friends, books, and his own private kingdom.But even if you take it at face value, \\"Baron in the Trees\\" is an enchanting little story. Calvino's lush, detailed writing is always full of a child's wonder, and he sounds like he's living his own fantasies as he describes how Cosimo manages to sleep (a sort of fur cocoon), store his possessions and fall in live... while never stepping out of the tree. But Calvino manages to convey the bittersweetness of Cosimo's life: While he loves his odd life, he also knows that it alienates him from the rest of the world and leaves him alone.Cosimo himself is a relatively distant character, since the whole book is through the eyes of his otherwise-unimportant brother. But he is surrounded by equally quirky characters -- his Jesuit-phobic father, \\"general\\" mother, creepy disgraced sister, and an array of book-loving bandits, odd priests, and peasants who get used to the tree-dwelling Baron.A sweet, quirky fable about a young man who just won't come down to earth, \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" is a truly enchanting read."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"A beautiful fairy tale of a book. It never devolves into heavy-handed allegory. It's original, without stinking of Cleverness. Don't know what else to say.

There's no conflict in this book, no story, and no humor. ( \\"Whimsy\\" being a very poor substitute for the latter.) Just a boring character who climbs up a tree and decides to stay there. If that sounds silly and contrived to you, well, there you have it."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"I think this book is nice and readable but often overrated.We have something better down here...

The author actually makes me think it's possible to live in trees as he brings a lot of everyday activities into the trees. I was taken into another realm of carefree living for a few days. The end is a bit forced, as my interest was dulled as it tried to bring too much history into it; therefore, making it less \\"real\\" in a sense. Napolean speaking to Cosims, and other similar events were too ficticious and took away from the story."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Maybe Calinvo's best novel, certainly one of the great pieces of fiction. Imaginative, captivating and wonderfully human. Fantastic in the sense that all disbelief is suspended in a way rarely sensed since childhood. Good introduction to the author.

So clever and of the like as I had never read before. Fiction, but convincing. Would recommend it."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"This is such a breath of fresh air. Calvino seems to be really good at taking these incredibly simple premises and weaving this wonderful sort of fantasy out of them. He does such an amazingly precise job of balancing between these great little moments of pastoral humor and levity along with some very sober reflections on unrequited love and loneliness. Sure, the style is often cute to the point of being treacly, but so what? It's really hard not to fall in love with this world, trees, aristocrats, bookish vagabonds and all. Definitely a good book to read in the summertime for anyone looking for something more than the usual spy-thriller crap"},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"Loved this book. Fascintaing historical perspective of the mid to late 18th century. Cosimo, a wonderful character, takes to the trees to escape his parents in an unusual manner of rebellion. Calvino's extraordinary imagination shows once again in this book that he is one of the finest literary minds. Highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The Baron in the Trees is a story about a boy, named Cosimo, who one day defies his parents and climbs a tree. He stays in the trees for the rest of his life. While in the trees, Cosimo encounter things that normal boys do: he hunts, he studies, and he falls in love. The book has a promising start, Calvino's humor makes the begining enjoyable to read. But around chapter five, it becomes boring. There is barely any humor, and there is no suspense- you never wonder, or want to know what happens next. When reading, I noticed that many parts that happen later in the book are just repeats of what has already happened, the book is very repetitive, and predictible. Cosimo's adventures all take to long to explain. An event that should only take a page or two to explain, ends up taking an entire chapter, sometime ten pages! The book is not really bad, it has some humorouse and exciting moments, but Cosimo's lengthy adventures make much of the book boring."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"When I first started reading this book I was drawn into the story because Calvino is a wonderful story teller. This story is beautifully written, but it is too long. I started to lose interest just past midway but continued to read, hoping it would get better. So my critique is that The Baron in the Trees is charming and readable, but lacks the depth that I want in a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Baron in the Trees, The [Il barone rampante]","review":"The concept behind The Baron in the Trees is brilliant. I'm not so sure that the story itself is.Readers will find the idea haunts them and follows them around. Could a man really spend his whole life living in the branches of the trees? And what does that mean? Is it a metaphor for a life of intellectualism? Does it mean he died on the day he left the Earth? Is it a rejection of Earthly and mortal matters for the spiritual?This is left open, and I expect that I will spend years turning the story over in my head and again and again changing my mind about which suits my tastes best.But I think that the book does have a major flaw. Throughout it's 217 pages we follow the life of the Baron with the eyes of his brother. Most of the events are not exciting, not really. They are not memorable. I won't turn them over in my head. I don't even expect to remember them in a year, with the possible exception of the Baron's final poetic death scene.The story could have been 20 pages. And I'm sorry to say that, but we have an example here of an author having one brilliant, transcendently brilliant idea, but sadly only the one. I felt that I was meant to spend the rest of the book basking in that idea, and I suppose I did... But any story told in 217 pages which would be no weaker if told in 20 is flawed.Again, I expect to remember the beginning and the end of this story many years from now, but the middle is fading even now....Wait! Wait!.... and I'm afraid it's gone......EDIT: It's May 2011 and I don't actually remember the ending anymore after all...."},{"Title":"Peoples and Cultures of Asia","review":"The reading is fun.

Don't they deserve more attention in a book called Peoples and Cultures of Asia? How many pages on Afghanistan? 88! Yes, we are fighting a war there.Also, the part on China and Chinese culture centers too much on communism and cultural revolution.

I had a very simple midlet up and running in the emulator within minutes. If you know Java already, this book is wonderful. If not, you may want to pick up a copy of &quot;Java in a Nutshell&quot; to go along with this one. It will not teach you how to program Java by any means.The only things that disapointed me about this book was that the included CD-ROM does not include anything /really/ useful. It has the examples from the book, but does not include the referenced tools (such as Forte, Apache, or KToolBox). As all of these applications are free, they could have easily been included on disk. Instead the reader must spend a bit of time downloading materials on the internet. Also, it doesn't tell you how to get the Midlets into your phone.

This book comes with a source code CD and tells you to GO TO SUN for everything else.The SUN links are dead and good luck finding what you need.The author also states that you can get Linux versions butforget about linux.... getting a windows version first is impossible. I bought this book as a gift to have someone jump right into JAVA on cell phones but this isn't going to be a jump right in to anything. I am thoroughly disgusted with this tease.We buy these books to learn something new and get stopped dead in tracks when the book refers to online download resources thatdon't exist anymore or worse, cost more than the book.Perhaps I am too stupid to sift through the 500 versions of SUN releases and upgrades that SUN changes the names and acronymswithout leaving versions intact to download.I'd expect that from a 10 year old book, not a book copyrighted 2002.Perhaps I am asking for too much when I buy a $50 book and expect it to stand on its own and contain a CD of useful content that matches the instruction in the book. I want a book to matchindustry standards and last I heard, the web runs on unix so I'd expect the book's CD to have Linux SDK also.This book looks like it would be the one that tells me how to putJAVA apps on my cell phone. If the author ever gets around to it,perhaps he will tell us how to do that too.

They were also not everyone's cup of tea. &quot;Time Trials is of this nature. Either you will love it, or you will hate it. But you certainly will not feel ambivalent about it. The author takes us on a journey through Miriam's eyes as she travels through South Africa in the months leading up to that country's realization of a fully fledged democracy. The book functions on many levels. Firstly through our own evolution from hunter-gatherers, to herders, an agrarian society to an industrial society and finally reaching the space age. What is of importance here, is that these societies still all exist simultaneously in real life within the country itself and these groups are working towards a harmonious existence without negating each others right to exist. Secondly, the book explores the political scene where the underlying message is that South Africa, and the world at large has, is and will continue to move away from tribal and nationalistic models based on race, place and religion towards more diverse societies. The aauthor goes so far as to quote Oliver Tambo's famous statement that we should work towards unity in diversity. But in order to get to this point, South Africans have gone through an incredible amount of violence. There are many who might find the authors blunt descriptions quite shocking in places. Lastly, &quot;Time Trials&quot; explores our evolution towards what is commonly known as New Age philosophies. Synchronicity, intuition, telepathic communication and the ability to use the sixth sense, or rather, go beyond the five senses of the body. The author also makes Biblical analogies, which might be offensive to some. &quot;Time Trials&quot; is quick, concise and prosaic in many places and ..........something completely different."},{"Title":"Time Trials","review":"The style of writing in Time Trials takes a bit of getting used to but, once you're into it, you're hooked.

On various occasions she has also subtly touched on transformation, love, inner spirit, supreme spirit, eternity and meaning of life etc. Her approach to stay in touch with reality even in the midst of hard cruel happenings is not only enlightening but also reaching the inner being.

First of all lets get the negative bit out of the way... the book is short - too short in my opinion. It could have benefitted from more depth of scene.Okay, that over with, let's move on to the bright points, and there were many of them. First of all, as I say, I think I gained something different out of Time Trials. Not for me the 'love-vibrant-spirit-quest-eternal' message (though good luck to those who saw it this way). For me, it was a confirmation of all that is wrong with conventional religious preaching - the lack of tolerance - the hypocrisy - the whole 'beggerment' factor (Gail Evans uses a different word!). And I think that the author may well share some of these views with me. Though she lifts her heroine above this conformist mess, her book is filled with tiny snippets that would indicate her awareness of all that is wrong with conventional belief. I get the impression that she would fit well in a family of modern Quakers - hard-working, tolerant, generous, warm and sensual.For me, Time Trials would have been perfect if Miriam had discovered and embraced the fact that she was spiritually alone - that there was no all-seeing, all-knowing greater power. But then, this was Gail Evans' book, not mine, and she sums up perfectly why it is that people are more and more shunning the churches and more and more despising the duplicitous rhetoric of politics.The great strength of Time Trials is that it offers a message of hope. Clearly, different readers get that message from different viewpoints. Maybe that was the way the author intended it. Maybe Gail Evans has the tolerence to leave her book sufficiently ambiguous that the reader can interpret as he or she will. Either way, Time Trials is an excellent narrative of one person's search for truth in a world full of extremes."},{"Title":"Time Trials","review":"When I review a book I look for the insightful message from the book; what it does for me and also what could be its potential for other readers.I liked the conclusion of Time Trials, based on Marianne Williamson's A Return to Love; glorifying our existence as children of God and the author's wanting to share this message with others around her.

It begins with the successors to Herman Hollerith's tabulating machine -- punched card accounting machines -- and ends with the announcement of the IBM/360 series.But in addition to a relatively detailed description of some of the engineering behind IBM's early computers, it also provides a view of how that engineering was affected by the politics of a large corporation and the needs of its customers.The authors are all long-time staff of IBM and participants in this early history. To their credit (and IBM's), they show both the muddle and the genius involved: how IBM wound up both at the head of the pack and with a set of incompatible products by 1960.The technologies involved are all 50 years or more out of date. However, if you plan to spend time working as an engineer or manager in a technical firm, then reading this book carefully, along with the works of Frederick Brooks, Samuel Florman, Robert Lucky, and Henry Petroski, might offer as good an education as many MBA programs.(See our Amapedia article for details on publication history, author background, and content notes.)"},{"Title":"IBM's Early Computers: A Technical History (History of Computing)","review":"Just finished reading *IBM's Early Computers* and I'm sad to have it come to an end. What an epic struggle! From census tabulators in the 20's to playing catch-up with UNIVAC, to building the giant SAGE air defense computers, to making point contact transistors by breaking open diodes, to implementing the pioneering and massive SABRE airline reservations system. (That was a pair of 7090 solid-state mega-computers, running in tandem and serving thousands of terminals in real time.) Stops just short of the revolutionary IBM-360 systems but outlines where they were going with that effort. (I just ordered *IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems* which is in the same MIT Press series.)It's a fascinating story of how the elephant learned to dance. Reads like a historical novel, yet is written with a lot of meaty detail on the technical aspects of the engineering challenges. (You'll get the most out of it, if you're technically inclined.) At times, it was a struggle of engineering versus the sales suits. Begins in the twenties, when IBM (under another name) made punched-card machines. The surprising thing was how much computing, organizations were able to do without computers. By the late forties, card machines could do arithmetic and multiple-step operations, under the control of plug-boards. When general purpose computers were proposed, sales and marketing declared that there was no market for them and that customers would never pay the higher monthly rentals required!In just ten short years, IBM went from being an electromechanical machine maker to a pioneer in state-of-the-art electronics. The management and engineering effort it took to do that on the massive scale of their company was nothing short of Herculean. In spite of being written by people who were actually there, this is no puff-piece. Tells of the failures, along with the triumphs. Meticulously documented, with over 80-pages of footnotes, this is truly a magnum opus!"},{"Title":"Defining Markets, Defining Moments: America's 7 Generational Cohorts, Their Shared Experiences, and Why Businesses Should Care","review":"Finally, a marketer's guide to generations that doesn't leave you with the 1946-1964 dates marking the Boomer generation..._Defining Markets, Defining Moments_ is a fresh new research into generations and their use in marketing, and into defining what a generation IS.In this book Schewe & Meredith introduce cohort marketing by looking at the groups of people born closely enough together to have similar experiences growing up and coming of age. They then throw in a recipe on how to combine this with a few other demographic factors, more briefly introduced, like gender and urbanicity, to create a powerful formula for targeting demographic groups. Also included is information on how each generational personality will grow up and the way generations can continue to be marketed to as they go from adolescence to adulthood to old age -- how each generation will buy its first car, get married, buy a house or retire._Defining Markets, Defining Moments_ goes beyond \\"The Baby Boomers were born 1946-1964 after the war and grew up during the Vietnam War holding peace protests, remembering Woodstock, and are therefore a generation of ideals and can be marketed to through '60s music\\". These authors carefully considered their dates for the birth of generations and asked themselves exactly how old a person born in each year would be at critical moments of time. Therefore the Baby Boomers (born 1946-1954) who used to be all about love and peace are distinguished from the younger Generation Jones (born 1955-1965), the oldest of whom would be 14 and the youngest of whom (born Dec. 31, 1965) only 3 during Woodstock. Insights are gathered beyond the usual clich&eacute;s captured in generational marketing books. And rather than assuming history began with the Baby Boomers and leaving everyone older behind as a pre-Boomer group of fossils as many marketers do, these authors identify three pre-Boomer groups who are under 90 today -- the soda-fountain, \\"Blackboard Jungle\\" Postwar Generation (1928-1945); the World War II Generation defined by their entry into that war of sacrifice (1922-1927); and the frugal, elderly Depression Generation who came of age learning to do without (1912-1921). An interesting analysis that could be continued with today's nonagenarians and centenarians (even though I bet too many people thought they were too thin a slice to be interested in marketing to). Planning any new updated editions?On the downside, this book still has a few tweaks to work out with generational dates (1965: Jones or true X? Was 1920 really defined more by the Depression than the war?) or old stereotypes and clich&eacute;s that linger (generations defined by the economic recession or the Internet), or perhaps just look too much like the workplace and marketing information offered in other books. Maybe it's just me and some of the sentences seem copied verbatim out of other marketing guides. Plus, the description of Generation Y, or \\"Generation N\\" (the N-Generation, 1977-19??), is a little off.All in all, a decent marketing book and more-than-decent exercise in thinking about what really makes generations who they are. Several steps up from your annually recycled Elders/Boomers/Xers/EchoBoomers-in-the-Market guides, and a guide that will likewise give marketers who use it a little edge over all the marketers who use other books."},{"Title":"Defining Markets, Defining Moments: America's 7 Generational Cohorts, Their Shared Experiences, and Why Businesses Should Care","review":"I highly recommand this book to anyone that wants general knowledge on generations.

I felt like this book was money well spent."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"The author's tale is built on the British economic decline that has followed that nation's descent into socialism. Mr. Shute was in at the start of the decline, and like all good story teller's explains his idea of what happened in an intriguing tale."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Absolutely wonderful, one of Nevil Shute's best novels. It takes you on a journey of the mind and heart, transporting you to a different world."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"I first read this book 25 years ago, maybe longer. I was watching TV news and the reports of the repeat flooding in Australia and was reminded of the book which combines the huge event of the rainstorms and the consequent flooding that happens erratically in the Australian outback.It also brings in the native aboriginal culture and the British Royal family.Well worth the read as are all of Nevil Shute's books."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"I like Shute, and I am a frequent visitor to Queensland, but this novel and its characters seemed dated and unsatisfying. It was a 1952 \\"thought experiment\\" about a future for Queen Elizabeth and Australia that would bring us up to the present. There is a political agenda; this is less a \\"yarn\\" than what Shute is known for."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Almost science-fictiony tale told to Church of England priest by a dying down-and-outer Aussie in the rainy season in the outback (hence &quot;in the wet&quot;).Told as 1st person narrative of elder priest who went out to aid a parishoner living with a chinese buddist; and a glance of life in the future, or &quot;next life&quot; that will be in the new Australia, flying the Queen of England."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This book was written in 1952, just after Queen Elizabeth took the throne, and is an odd look at what Nevil thought would happen to the British Commonwealth, and specifically to the concept of Royalty, under the influence of post-WWII economic and political pressures, over a period of 30 years from the time of the book's writing. As is typical for Nevil, the book has no bad guys, no sharp dramatic tension, but rather some fine character portraits, a properly told love story, and some very exacting insights into social and political structures.The book is actually told in two separate pieces. One is a framing story of an elderly Church of England pastor newly assigned to a rather remote area of the Australian outback and his efforts to minister to a flock that is literally spread over an area larger than many states. Nevil's description of the area and people in this area both during the dry season and 'in the wet' is startlingly full of life, a fine portrait that does much to illustrate some of Nevil's social commentary, which creeps in almost from the side, rarely directly presented. But from this everyday world, we move to a totally different one as our priest, suffering from malaria induced fevers and hallucinations, is forced by circumstance to minister to an old, dying drunkard, Stevie. In trying to learn about Stevie's past, we enter the world of the future, as Stevie's half-incoherent words combine with the priest's inner hallucinations to form the story of David Anderson, an Australian pilot chosen to fly the personal aircraft of the Queen.This vision of the future shows an England of near total socialism, sadly depopulated by emigration to other Commonwealth countries, poorly ruled and near bankrupt, questioning the value of supporting the royal family. Opposing this are the pictures of Canada and Australia as vibrant, growing economies, and where one of the key differences in government is the idea of individuals being able to earn more than the basic one vote, available to everyone, by education, military service, public service, travel, and by special dispensation (i.e. 'The Queen's Favor). Supposedly this form of enfranchisement has led to better, more efficient government - whether it really would is an obvious topic for debate.What is intriguing about this is just where Nevil got events right and where his vision diverged from what really happened. Little things like his prediction that Christmas Island would be turned over to Australian governance in 1961 (actual was 1958) and his portrait of a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth (startlingly accurate) and major things like his prediction of England's economic sharp decline and turn towards socialism show just how in tune with the times Nevil was. At the same time, his predictions on technology were sadly off the mark, the 'security' procedures surrounding the Queen are almost laughably inadequate when seen from today's viewpoint, and he took the problems of England too far, not foreseeing its eventual recovery from losing its empire.Lying atop all of this is a finely told love story between David and Rosemary, a secretary to the Queen. Nevil's characterization is always very strong, and his ability to show a slowly developing attraction is highly realistic and satisfying. And just under the surface is some commentary on issues of race, as David is one-quarter abo, and commonly goes by his nickname of 'Nigger'. Nevil is clearly pointing out the invalidity of judging people by race, and by extension he makes the point that all 'class' distinctions are artificial and, in the long run, detrimental. In presenting this point, he shows some of the treatment of the 'servant' class in ways that may offend some modern sensibilities, but his portrayal is very accurate for the times.The last portion of the book gets into a metaphysics where all religions have a validity and circles back to the book's starting point, providing much food for thought well beyond the parameters of his envisioned future.Each of the above items adds to the total of this very strong book, a book that has been sadly neglected and out of print for a long time. It is very encouraging to see most of Nevil's works being brought back into print in the last couple of years, as almost all of his works are deserving of a read, this one especially so."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute captured some wonderful ideas about balancing the power of governance. In his new utopian community, created as a result of the horrific expense of maintaining the &quot;royals and their lifestyle&quot; should be explored for implementation in the U.S. By Shute's plan every man and woman received a birthright vote. However, you could add votes, up to a maximum of 4 (total votes to be cast = 5) by the following: (1) if you owned property -- I believe this was a requirement in early history. (2) If you completed a certain level of education -- presumably public high school (3) If you served your country in the Armed Forces, and (4) reserved for very special situations, like the Congressional Medal of Honor or the Nobel Peace Prize. With all of our computer technology this seems to make great sense to vest the governance of our country with those who have, mostly by their own efforts, contributed more than just being born and having a birthright vote."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute has the most emotionally compelling writing styles I've ever encountered. &quot;In the Wet&quot; is a odd and lovely example of this. Without ever being maudling, in a quiet, understated way Shute weaves a beautiful combination of feeling and character.&quot;In the Wet&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback. One can feel the heat, the dust, then the rain and the mud, as well as vividly seeing and being part of the scenery. The story is that of a Church of England parson well past his prime running a church in a very remote and widespread area. He's a practical man, acknowledging that &quot;wrong isn't always wrong&quot; in the Outback. He encounters a dying man who takes him on a trip through reincarnation, telling the tale of the life the man will live his next time around.As science fiction the book is severely outdated, yet--I've found this works well with the bomb classics like Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;--if you read it more as alternate history rather than a look to the future (the 'future' is the 1970s in this case) you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful writing, well-rounded characters, and the solidly crafted plot."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"As a dying man drifts towards death in the Australian Outback (it takes place in the rainy season, thus, \\"In the Wet.\\"), he tells an odd tale to a Church of England clergyman, of a pilot in 1980's Britain (the novel, written in 1952, is set in 1952) The story: David Anderson, a quarter-Aboriginal Australian pilot, is selected to fly for Queen Elizabeth, in a world where a sizable portion of the British people has emigrated, primarily to Canada and Australia. The remaining British have become \\"red\\",....Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel is the \\"multiple vote\\", which, when it was mentioned at the last SF convention I attended, immediately provoked a half-hour debate. Democracy has been modified, leading to the possibility of earning additional votes in elections...OK, so Shute didn't forsee the rise of republicanism in Australia and the Parti Quebecois in Canada. And television is mentioned exactly once, there's no satellite transmissions, and a lot of other similar difficulties. All the same, Shute provides an interesting political novel/love story for us.I withhold a fifth star on this one because I don't find the character of David Anderson believable. This guy's supposed to be a quarter-Abo born in a ditch who came up through the ranks. He talks like an Oxford grad, and knows a fair number of polysyllables. Not only this, the quarter-Abo, discussing how the Queen should allocate her time if all was fair, discusses the proportion based on the overall population of the Commonwealth, and based on the white (!) population. Shute should have avoided these obvious howlers."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is definitely one of Shute's best novels, His accurate portrayal of post war Britain to his vision of the British Commonwealth was excellent. He made the the characters and the country of Austrialia come alive and like most of his books I had a hard time putting it down. In The Wet was the the first Shute book I read and it is still one of my favourites."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is a wonderful book; it has instantly joined my personal top ten. Beautifully written, in the straightforward enconomical storytelling style which Shute mastered, it is several stories within a story, with wonderful historical accents, delicate interplay between Australian and English culture, a spicy dose of politics, a tender love story, and even some farsighted future gazing (the story was written in 1952)."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Although some of Nevil Shute's work is created using a fairly large canvas (one thinks of \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" more than any other), most of his novels are simple tales about everyday life. The trick, or real art, which they demonstrate, is in showing us a slice of that ordinary world we think we all know, as though it were the most normal thing in the world, and then bringing out the oddity that is never far below the surface. So \\"In the Wet,\\" one of his more imaginative novels, takes us bit by bit into the remote parts of tropical northern Australia, building up tiny details from characters and race days and scraps of conversation, until the real story, hidden just below the surface, begins to emerge. Shute, whose background is very much that of an experimental scientist with oil on his hands, is never more impressive than when he leads the unsuspecting reader through the mundane material world that we think we see, onto another plane altogether. Not afraid in the least of exploring spirituality, Shute acts as an intelligent, well-informed guide for the reader on a voyage of discovery. Never intruding on the narrative, yet masterfully keeping it in rein, he is an author whose novels have long been considered merely \\"popular,\\" when in fact they are often penetrating inquiries into the meaning of life.One other characteristic of Shute's writing that is perhaps more apparent today than it was in the fifties and sixties is that his work is always set in the contemporary period of a world undergoing vast change. He lived and served and worked through two world wars and the effects of these cataclysmic events were such as to shake up the foundations of the very science which had made so many people feel so secure for a time. Therefore, his texts today also provide interesting excursions into that world, from 1920 to 1960, which was not only metamorphosing into the more colourful world of the Beatles, Vietnam and Tricky Dicky Nixon, but which has since very completely disappeared from the ken of anyone much under fifty. Of course, if all you are after is a good story told by a competent storyteller, you won't be disappointed either."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is another of Nevil Shute's great stories of Australia. The frame of the story is really what is so marvellous. Shute is excellent in capturing the point of view of an elderly Church of England priest out in the sparsely-populated outback of the late 1940s. The futuristic body of the story is touching, to contrast Shute's projection of the British Royal family with the way that they have behaved in reality. But the voice of that old priest is what one simply cannot forget. It's similar, but even better, than the frame narrator of the old solicitor in &quot;A Town Like Alice.&quot;"},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"One of Shute's strengths is his ability to brilliantly project into a reasonable future, reasonable in view of the world as he knew it. His best known novel, On The Beach, is set in the future, as is this novel. Here the future takes form in the malaria-induced dream of an Australian bush-brother, stricken with a bout while tending a sick man during the Australian rainy season. From the small study in which he wrote, Shute gave his readers a prescient look at the English monarchy and race relations in the context of his usual fine tale. And, as is typical for this author, we are all ennobled in the reading. After the final page you too will wish to be worthy of the seventh vote...."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute was a sturdily competent author. His plots are as well constructed as his planes probably were. Solid, orthodox in design and execution, no unnecessary frills - the embodiment of the stiff upper lip of the Englishman. This is no exception as it artfully tells a future tale of an England riven by an envy-based Socialism (that its author had recently escaped from)that is rapidly destroying those few institutions remaining. It has a solid emotional connection to present-day 'utopian' Australia (as wonderfully observed from the point of view of one who lived there as, say, Orwell's 'Burmese Days').Hmmm...author wishes to tell of past or future and make politicised point therefrom. Problem - how to do this without breaking the emotional connection to the narrative of the present? Solution - make a character have a 'dream' of some kind.I rolled my eyes - this device was becoming hackneyed (cf.'An Old Captivity', 'The Rainbow &amp; The Rose' etc.) and one might have expected Shute to be a little more inventive with his literary devices. Nevertheless, it works and functions adequately as a means of establishing and maintaining a fluid connection between the two.Well done, sir!"},{"Title":"Chicken Poop in My Bowl","review":"I found it disappointing even though I was seeking clean humor.

Each year has a six-page introduction followed by spreads that all have a colored panel on the left with text relating to events that happened each month or day. The rest of each spread is devoted to photos and graphics with comprehensive captions.I rather liked the way pages mix news events with pop culture and everyday living. For instance the spread for part of March 1954 has six images, a sport and news photo (about Salk polio vaccine) a photo of blues singer Joe Turner, a book jacket, an LP cover (actually celebrating the work of cover designer Jim Flora) and last, an Archie comic book cover. They all get long captions that fortunately have something to say and give plenty of background information. Many spreads have additional colored panels for a longer look at a personality or event. You can just browse the pages or look up something in the comprehensive twenty-five-page index.Another reason I liked the book is for its excellent production. The paper is good quality and the layouts simple and straightforward. There are about a thousand images, news photos are mostly in black and white but all the pop culture items are in color. It is these graphics: movie posters, book and magazine covers, comics, record covers, ads that frequently make the pages sparkle.Overall a lovely book and made all the more worthwhile because I bought it at a very reasonable price. Take the trouble to check out the title with Amazon's More Buying Choices or internet book comparison sites and you'll be surprised at some bargain prices.BTW There is a Sixties volume (ISBN 141271009X) too.

The 1950s was a decade of atomic-age fears, triumphs in the arts, progress and failure in racial equality, the rise of youth culture, and the shift from rural and urban to suburban lifestyles. The book covers all these topics thoroughly and insightfully, as opposed to just being a bunch of facts and pretty pictures (although it does have these things). The visuals really bring the period to life and add to the understanding of the subject rather than taking away from it.

Has common names as well as catalog numbers for most objects, and there is a cross-reference list if you don't know the difference between M7 and M11 (I don't). There are lots of what I call classic &quot;pretty&quot; pictures of deep sky objects that you will never come close to seeing in real life, except by astrophotography maybe, but they are very nice to look at.This book is starting to show its age at over 10 years old. Some of the time-sensitive data is getting out of date. Overall, except for the star &quot;charts&quot; being so small and cramped, this is really an excellent reference book with useful tips on what to observe, where and when.Couple this book with something like the amazing Wil Tirion's Star Atlas 2000.0, and maybe a top-notch computer sky gazing program like Starry Night 3 or 4, and you've got a valuable reference book in a very small package that can't be beaten. It's still one of my favorite books to take in the field with me, but you can't rely solely on it. It has even stood up to the test of wear and tear over the years. Very durable, it resists lots of moisture and handling. It's made of glossy heavy-bond paper, the cover is a kind of plastic-y material impregnated with woven fibers.

I guess it's quite OK for the space.The 2000 word dictionary at the back is quite comprehensive.A weaker point is the \\"phonetical transliteration\\" system used - Hungarian is written fully phonetically in its original form (thankfully also presented here), but the phonetical transliteration provided here for English-speakers may result in blank looks in many cases - you could always choose to ignore it.The intro contains useful facts about the history and roots of the language, though the map showing where Hungarian is supposedly spoken might raise some eyebrows in neighbouring countries! ;-)The layout is attractive, with color illustrations.I even like the cover (different from what is shown on Amazon)- certainly better than a kitshy horseman or traditionally clad dancer could have been! ;-)Overall: RECOMMENDED.If you are planning to spend any time away from the major cities and tourist areas, you will find it VERY useful!"},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"I took one term of Hungarian in college, and I've been to Hungary a few times (but only for a few days each time). So I tried getting this book to relearn some of the language before going back to Hungary this year. It helped me do just that, and I was able to converse with plenty of non-English speaking Hungarians. This is a well-written book.But how much will this book help you if you don't know Hungarian at all? I'm not so sure. To communicate in a language, I think you really need to hear it spoken and painstakingly learn a bunch of vocabulary words (I like using flashcards to do this). I think it will be more of a help to those who already know something about the language, or at least have access to someone who can help them practice it.I'm glad I got this book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"This phrasebook is filled with loads of well-organized information and superb vocab words - I thouroughly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover while on the plane to Budapest. However, once I arrived in Hungary I was a bit disappointed to find that everyone spoke English (at least in the Budapest area). The phrases I tried got a few smiles, but the only truly useful part of the book was the dictionary. It was quite helpful in reading signs, ads, posters, menus etc.In spite of the little use I got out of it, I would still recommend taking this phrasebook to Hungary. It provides a bit of security for the short-term traveler and would become more useful the longer you stayed (especially for those who can speak a bit of Hungarian already or those who are studying the language)."},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"This pocket book is a must-have for anyone who, like me, has an interest in learning Hungarian or who plans to visit Hungary. Concise & comprehensive, it's a winner. The only drawback is that the 'pronunciation' provided seems to be geared to travelers from the UK &, as such, can cause difficulties for No. Americans. This ancient, beautifully soft, & richly vocalic language is certainly complicated for an English speaker. Along with a T&ouml;rkenczy grammar any traveler should be speedily humming along in party town Budapest. These people are warm, friendly, & openly admire most anyone willing to tackle their tongue, not to mention the cuisine & the wines!"},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"I love this book. It's small enough to just throw in your bag and go when you are exploring a new city. Since moving to Budapest, it has come in handy several times over - and the pronunciation is superb!

My last phrasebook left people in Poland laughing at me as the phonetic guides led me astray. The problem with this guide is that it was not correct with some of the basic words a traveller would want. Our hotel staff told us that we were using antiquated, formal versions for certain greetings and interactive words, and gave a lesson on what to say (and when) instead. We also found that we got blank stares when we asked about dinner at a resturant. We pointed out the word in the book and the server looked very confused. I guess this book fails to even provide a correct translation for \\"dinner\\"...and who knows what else? I was glad to have this book along -- it is basically useful -- but I've got to assume other guides do a better job with getting some of the basics right. If you book at a big hotel you can save a few dollars by getting a free, accurate lesson from the staffers, and forgetting this guide."},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"I purchased this before a recent trip to Hungary and was pleasantly surprised. It is pocket sized and easy to carry (which wasn't clear to me from the other info on Amazon). It has all the necessary basic phrases divided into useful categories, and a nice little glossary in back. It doesn't offer an extensive vocabulary, but for me it was the right amount and the limit was worth keeping the book small and easy to carry. I would say it is perfect for someone with no or almost no experience with Hungarian who needs just the basics for a trip."},{"Title":"Hungarian: Lonely Planet Phrasebook","review":"Even the Hungarians I stayed with used this book.

The research described in INFINITE MIND is on the cutting edge of exploring what we know about human energy fields. Hunt's descriptions of experiments she's conducted with aura readers and physicists make fascinating reading. For example, Hunt shares her amazing findings in the &quot;Mu Room,&quot; in which human subjects burst into tears when the electromagnetism of the air was depleted, and regained a sense of clear thinking when the electromagnetism of the air was increased. The Mu Room is a seven foot square shielded room located in the Physics department at UCLA, where the electromagnetic energy of the air can be altered without reducing its breathability (oxygen content). Other studies examine the energy fields of healers and the people they are healing, and the energy fields eminating from our bodies independent from our internal organs.INFINITE MIND is packed with gems of wisdom, such as Hunt's description of the five most commonly unintegrated spiritual experiences (experiencing a God-like energy, recalling a past life, gaining abilities to perform miraculous healings and alter material substances, acknowledging one's rage at God's apparent abandonment of us, and the Kundalini experience). INFINITE MIND is a book best read sequentially from beginning to end, since Hunt includes numerous personal experiences throughout her descriptions of scientific studies and experimental results.What I most enjoy about INFINITE MIND is the way Hunt weaves together a sense of wholeness from her exotic experiences with spirit healing in foreign lands, her unceasing commitment to scientifically investigating energy fields and thought forms, and her honesty in sharing her mystical insights along the way. Seldom is a reference book as riveting and relevant as INFINITE MIND. I give it my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"Valerie Hunt's research over the past 30 years into the human energy fields shows that the mind and emotions are not restricted to the brain and nervous system, but rather originate in the aura, out of which the body is originally formed. Dr. Hunt owes the breakthrough in her thinking about the location of the developing mind to Toronto's Dr. Tom Verny, whose book 'The Secret Life of the Unborn Child' shows that the unborn child, from about 3 months after conception, is able to think, perceive, feel and remember even though the brain is not yet fully formed. Mediums have long provided evidence that we all continue to live after the death of the physical body, in an etheric or spirit body, complete with mind, memory and personality. Near death experiences also corroborate this. In her recent book 'Infinite Mind' Dr. Hunt now provides us with the scientific evidence. Her research has important implications for mediumship in the field of communication with the so-called dead, and in healing diseases which originate in imbalances in the energy field before viruses, bacteria, genetic defects and other factors do their damage. Aura readers and medical diagnostics are tapping into the body's energy fields just as psychics and mediums are able to tune into the discarnate minds of the 'dead', who are actually living on in higher-frequency energy bodies. The brain cannot record these higher frequencies, hence spiritual experiences and dreams cannot be fully integrated into the body and brain, nor is language adequate to describe them. Regression therapy can only deal with the trauma and stresses during the present body's lifetime. However, attuning to the mind-field which exists outside the physical body and brain can enable us to recall past lives and help us understand the progress of the soul after this life is over. Dr. Hunt discusses telepathy, emotions, the mind and body and brain in healing and mystical experiences, and the soul's journey through lifehoods, all from the point of view of a scientist who has tested and researched each step of the way. Valerie Hunt's work is therefore a breakthrough in uniting science and religion by showing that they share the common ground of spirit, mind and energy fields; non-material phenomena that science,thanks to Valerie Hunt and dedicated researchers like her, can now begin to record and measure and so provide proof for the beliefs which religions have held since the dawn of time. They are now substantiated. This is an enthralling, well-written book that scientists, priests, pastors, ministers, theologians, therapists,psychiatrists,doctors, healers and interested lay people should keep with them for the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"This in response to a negative previous review of this book. Valerie Hunt may not be the most scientific of writers but do not dismiss her work because of that. The \\"mathematical chaos formula\\" picture you are criticizing as \\"Lissajous\\" patterns are not Lissajous. This image was derived using a mathematical algorithm designed specificaly to visualize/search for chaotic patterns in measured data. When this algorithm is applied to random noise, no pattern is produced. When a data set is chaotic, patterns start to appear. This algorithm is well described in many chaos theory books and it is used in physics and engineering. Valerie Hunt is not a mathematician but she does consult mathematicians who know what tools to use to analyze such data. But I do agree the book does not show enough details of her experimental results. I happen to know more of the details thru other sources and I happen to use the same mathematical tools in my work."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"Valerie Hunt takes us where no human has gone before in the scientific realm to demonstrate what the shamans, mystics and psychics have been saying for centuries: that the human energy system is real and causative, not the effect. This book is amazing and a must read for anyone interested in the healing process at the deepest levels and understanding the science of that process. I would rank her with the greats in scientific discoveries and theorists in models of human philosophy/spiritualism. Well documented, well presented by a mind that is obviously very well educated in the classic tradition, and a person that has delved into a broad spectrum of experience to draw from. Wonderful!!"},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"All of you intuitives &amp; energy workers out there should add this book to your studies.

Valerie Hunt is a pioneer in the field whose professional background in physical therapy, physiology and teaching curious students opened her to the exploration of consciousness, frequencies and the energetic, vibrational effect on the body. In her 90's, energetic and healthy, she continues to conduct research and currently is working on two $1 million grants in this field. Once past the first chapter of some highly technical information, the remainder of the book will keep you engaged with her personal evolution in this direction, experiences/stories and important studies that support the work."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"This book is poorly edited. First, there are numerous grammatical mistakes. Second, Hunt often goes on rambling, disjointed discourses that are hard to make sense out of. Sometimes she throws in some technical jargon that makes it even harder to understand. To be honest, I'm not sure Dr. Hunt fully understands them. If she did have a clearer understanding, perhaps her explanations would clearer as well.Having said all that, I still think there is valuable and important information here about the nature of the human mind and the bioenergetic field. Unfortunately, the presentation is poor, which reduces the author's credibility. However, if you are open-minded and patient (you don't mind constantly re-reading), the book may well be worth it to you."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Hunt's years of work to validate the reality of the human energy field, which in turn validates all the children and adults out here how have been using the PSI senses - so they must exist - but HOW? here is the answer..."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"This was kind of a hybrid between a beginner's neuroscience text and a new age shamanic Shirley McClain daydream. The idea that the mind may exist outside, and maybe even in spite of, the brain certainly is plausible enough: but, Dr. Hunt doesn't present her case very well, relying too much on electrographs coupled with unreasonable assumptions as compelling evidence. The writing was erratic and at times seemed like it was being presented by more than one author. Not really worth the effort in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"if you are looking for a more scientific view of the aura phenomena, that is the right book to look at."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"The book was as described...like never been read & only a very small tear in jacket cover.

She does better at the abstract nonsensical which can neither be proven or denied. Basically, as a scientific work, it is junk."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"On the bottom of page 19, Valerie Hunt says: \\"In the physical body there are two primary electrical systems. One is the well-known alternating electric current of the nervous system ...\\" In the nervous system there are no alternating currents, that is, a current that constantly reverses its direction. In the nerve there is an 'action potential' that travels in one direction only. When the 'action potential' of the nerve reaches the synapse of the target neuron, it releases a neurotransmitter into the synapse which fits into a receptor molecule on the surface of the target neuron. This in turn releases a second messenger in the cell. The neurotransmitter is then broken down and re-synthesized in the nerve terminal. There is no return of the 'action potential' to the original neuron."},{"Title":"Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness","review":"This book has a lot of ideas taken from people like Jung to make it seembelieveable.It is so good that a person like me with only a BSEE and Compute Sciencesdegree would swallow it as, except for the many technical errors and the fact that the end intent is selling a watch that is purported to cureillness is being sold at a riduculous price, with the come on that the profits are going to a non profit association.Come now.

I wanted to give it zero stars but one star is the lowest rating.There is no science at all in this book. It is pure nonsense.

There are lots of ways to be nutty but ultimately it all comes down to one thing: nuttiness."},{"Title":"True Leaders: How Exceptional CEOs and Presidents Make a Difference by Building People and Profits","review":"A great book. It has practical advice from interviews with 30 company presidents and CEOs on how to become a better leader. What makes the book different is that these leaders were selected because of their commitment to people and profits (in that order). These leaders where drawn from the Fortune list of The 100 best companies to work for as well the authors personal contacts. Another factor that I found appealing about the book was the broad group of executives that were drawn on with significant difference in lines of business, industries, and company size.The book is written in a very approachable manner. Some leadership books are exciting and inspirational, but don't really provide any steps for becoming a leader. This book is exciting and inspirational because it provides practical steps for becoming a better leader. It addresses both personal and business culture related topics that are necessary to define a true leader.The book defines a true leader as having the following traits:Social - Lover of people and the desire to build othersUtilitarian - Value money and the return on investmentIndividualistic - Desire to control one's destiny and influence the destiny of others.Traditional - Strong belief system of doing the right thing.The book is not a instant recipe for success, but rather a guide through a series of practical steps to improving leadership. I found it to be a useful exercise to take the chapters in the book and modify then slightly to form a rough leadership checklist. Here is that list:o Passion is a Prerequisiteo See what is not yet visibleo Care enough to connect and conveyo Treating learning like dirty disheso Do what's right and tell the trutho Trust is a musto Recognize and build peopleo Trust your intuitiono Risk to respond and growo Respect the importance of balanceLeadership styles and fads come and go. Bottom line who would not want management to treat them based on the list above. And if you are management what employee would not want to be treated based on the list above."},{"Title":"True Leaders: How Exceptional CEOs and Presidents Make a Difference by Building People and Profits","review":"I've read a lot of books about leadership that use exemplary leaders to make the author's points. Most turn out to be biographical anthologies. True Leaders is different.This tightly written (read: no fluff to bulk-up the book's size) book is organized around a set of values, which the authors found to be central to corporate success. With a focus on core values, leaders operate differently than those who are focused on what the bottom line will look like at the end of the next reporting period. Their results are stronger and more sustainable in the long run. Satisfaction levels-for them and for the people working for them-are much higher. Trust runs deep. True leadership is at work.The authors interviewed 25 CEOs from both private and public sector organizations. They confirmed that ten core values are the essence of their work: Passion is a prerequisite. See what is not yet visible. Care enough to connect and convey. Treat learning like dirty dishes. Do what's right and tell the truth. Trust is a must. Recognize and build people. Trust your intuition. Risk to respond and grow. Respect the importance of balance. And those core values are the chapters of the book.In each of the chapters, the authors explain the value and its importance, illustrating and reinforcing the concepts through stories from the CEOs. These perspectives are woven into the fabric of each chapter in a way that is very comfortable for the reader. The input from the CEOs brings the values to life, inspiring as well as educating the reader. The presentations are never \\"in-your-face,\\" but fit nicely into the pattern of the reader's experience with the book.Just about the time you'll feel like you've completed the book and are ready to close the cover with a silent \\"thanks\\" to the authors, you'll discover there's more. Over thirty more pages are organized into appendices talking about Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE), a leadership evaluation, a one-on-one discussion card, an attitudes and values graph, and profiles of the companies represented by the CEOs used in the book.

It's like a well fleshed out study outline in many ways. What I particularly liked is that even the very short books of the Bible are given equal treatment. You'll get ample material about 1 Peter, Micah, Obadiah, and other small books along with the big boys like Isaiah and John.Time lines help you keep a mental picture of what's going on around the events of each book. Where multiple opinions and theories abound, the authors introduce the reader to a variety of interpretations and the merits of each.While many of the author asides and comments may prove uncomfortably liberal for evangelicals or fundamentalists, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in digesting the Bible.

The books multi-facted approach to teaching emphasizes key points with inviting words, illustrations, timelines, and unique way pattern of organization for each chapter. The author has taken the very difficult task of approaching a complex and heavy subject and distilling it into important topics while still maintaining some depth. Reading and getting to know the bible can feel like an insurmountable challenge at times, but I found reading this alongside the bible has given me the confidence to navigating the book I may not have found otherwise. The content is appropriate for wide range of ages and levels of bible education, and each book of the bible is effortlessly covered in a couple pages. Even those familiar with bible readings their whole lives may use this resource to study from to keep the facts straight and the stories alive. This books layout and space also lends itself well to adding notes, with the potential of a long term companion to your growth.

The subject of this book is not the problem, but probably I was looking for a more substantial, rigorous treatment. Perhaps someone who has never considered or studied what the Bible says about heaven might find this more suitable. The second to the last chapter, \\"A Home You Are Invited to Claim as Your Own,\\" was the best to me, as it was basically the gospel message. It would be good for a person who is new to (not yet a believer in) Christianity. But I was put off by the long lists of items that run throughout the book (if you see a sample of that in the online excerpt, be forewarned that the book is filled with these lists.). So, the book is a bit \\"poetic,\\" and if you like that style, you may like this book. It also has a lot of exclamation points. If you like the very deep, wrestling thoughts of writers like CS Lewis, you might want to think twice about this book."},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"I found comfort with Anne's assurance that our heavenly home is where we will be welcomed into eternal peace and safety.I lost a loved one and had difficulty adjusting.

Both of these books have helped me to move forward in peace and hope."},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"If you are looking for a comforting book that assures you of God's love then this book may be of interest to you. I was expecting more vivid descriptions of heaven especially after reading numerous books on near-death experiences. This book mostly focuses on the description of heaven as given in Revelation 21.Some of the descriptions of how God's glory lights heaven seemed similar to other stories I've read where people have described a brilliant light that doesn't hurt your eyes and makes you feel unconditionally loved.Anne Graham Lotz also spends a great deal of time describing what heaven won't be like. She compares this earthly life with the heavenly life we can expect when we die. In some way she makes death seem less frightening and also explains how you can be sure you are going to heaven when you die.While this book is mostly about heaven there is a small segment about hell. This should be enough to convince you that you don't want to go to hell under any circumstances. Imagine being in eternal darkness when you could be enjoying the brilliance of heaven.This book will be especially appreciated by anyone who is afraid of death or who is concerned about their eternal destiny. I found this book to be very comforting and informative even though it did not describe as much about heaven as I'd hoped.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"I always hesitate to write a review that might be remotely considered scathing, but as a reviewer, I sometimes feel I owe to those who faithfully read my reviews to be as honest with them as I possibly can be. Therefore, sometimes it becomes necessary to be critical to the point that some may see it as callous. I hope that is not what appears here.As I began the first few pages of HEAVEN: MY FATHER'S HOUSE, by Anne Graham Lotz, I had high hopes. The book started off okay and in the early pages gives a nice rendition to John's life in exile on the island of Patmos. Then, however, I found a hundred or so pages of rather fluffy material that had little or no doctrinal value to it. In what had all the makings of a cheap parlor trick, in order to attempt to fill a few extra pages, we see simple questions that should have taken two or three single spaced lines, displayed in sonnet form diagonally across the page to eat up some that wasted paper. There are also numerous references to September 11th, but little connection to the subject matter, as well as brief historical tidbits such as the sinking of the Titanic.The final two chapters did contain bits and pieces of Bible Doctrine that I found to be fairly well delivered and appropriate to the subject. Perhaps, being the daughter of Pastor Billy Graham, it was appropriate for him to write (or at least sign) the forward, but seemed merely an attempt to sell a few extra copies.Certainly the intention here was to bring calmness and peace through the teaching of Word of God to those unfortunate souls who find themselves facing death; either their own or that of a loved one. In that regard, this book falls short. There are countless other sources out there that far exceed what is available here. If you do somehow find yourself in possession of this book, read the first ten pages and the last twenty, skip the rest.Pastor Monty Rainey"},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"Following a tragedy, I thought a great deal about Heaven. I realized there is so much we don't know. One thing that stuck with me was when the author talked about someone visiting her earthly father's home. She talked about how she would be received there in spite of falling short of what her earthly dad expected of her. He warmly welcomed her home when she had disappointed him and thought he might be angry with her. She told how strangers who didn't know her dad would find the gate to the family home closed because he didn't know them. There was a great deal here that helped me through a very difficult time, knowing that we are God's family and will be welcomed when we get to our Heavenly home, because He knows us and a place has been prepared for us.There's a time for heavy doctrine (I wasn't able to focus on anything very heavy at that moment) and a time for talking about what it's going to be like when we finally arrive Home with our Heavenly Father there to greet us. This book offered me what I needed when I needed it. It was like a conversation with a dear friend who was there to talk about these things when others didn't know what to do or say and when others had no idea why or what I was longing and aching to know."},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"Along with Joni Erikson Tada's, this is one of the best Heaven books I've read.

The book story by Ann Graham Lotts was very well written and very interesting. It tells all Christians about their new home when the Father calls us to come home to be with Him."},{"Title":"Heaven: My Father's House","review":"The author uses her earthly father's house as a comparison with her Heavenly Father's home in describing how one will feel welcomed on the other side. There isn't any new revelation in this book. She shares her personal insights and largely cites the Scriptures that talk about what is awaiting the dead in Christ.One of the other reviewers was correct to point out that this small book contains extensive poetic type lists. The plan of salvation is given near the end so people who are unsure how to make heaven their destination can do so.Her description of heaven is one involving preperation that is personal. She writes...\\"God...knows the colors I love, the scenery I enjoy, the things that make me happy, all the personal details that will let me know when I walk into My Father's House, I am expected and welcome, because He has prepared it for me!

Apart from the obvious -- cheese and chocolate -- I had no idea. But then I found this attractive book, and now my questions are answered.Sue Style here tackles the difficult task of giving us a culinary portrait of a nation which, as she points out in her introduction, is 'at least four countries rolled into one,' not counting influences from neighboring countries and cultures. The key, she says, is in realizing that Swiss food, wine, and tastes aren't monolithic, but rather vary (sometimes widely) from canton to canton.Aided by John Miller's skilled photography of landscapes (sometimes I wonder if it's even possible to take an unattractive photo of Switzerland), people, and ... not least of all ... food, Style not only gives us a wide variety of recipes, but also shows how those foods fit into the broader Swiss lifestyle. Bread, cheese, chocolate, and sausage ... each gets its own chapter, as do Swiss winemaking (who knew? -- 'Many Swiss wines never make it beyond the confines of the canton, let alone the country' -- yet some are apparently quite nice) and the art of the Swiss innkeeper.In all, whether you have no experience of Swiss food at all, or are a former visitor or resident looking to recreate happy memories, Sue Style's book seems like an excellent way to explore the surprisingly varied world of Swiss tastes."},{"Title":"Everything I Know About Cars: A Collection of Made-Up Facts, Educated Guesses, and Silly Pictures about Cars, Trucks, and Other Zoomy Things","review":"My children always find something new to look at in this fun book.

It's quite obvious isn't it? And if there is no text or even few lines so it's much more of an album (not a guide) then a book. Wayne's book is an album! Not a book, not even a guide. because there is almost nothing to read. It shows nothing more than the discus collection Wayne has developed. There is nothing the beginner or the experienced aquarist can use and learn from. There are less than 7% pages, more or less, of text and nothing new or useful- nothing! (2 pages of how to recognize male/female, 2-3 pages on disease, 2 pages on treatment, and 2 pages on food! And 1 page on the water chemistry- this information was so basic I was amazed) this book doesn't worth the 30$ I paid. This book can, maybe, help you identify a discus before you buy it (not so sure of it too, because most of the discus this book show are from Wayne is hatchery and some others discuses known in the market) - using the beautiful clear pictures, each spreading on single page, but it says almost nothing about maintenance or anything else. The reviews written on the back cover of this book doesn't reflect the contents of the book at all. I am deeply disappointed I expected much more when I read the reviews and got an album instead."},{"Title":"Wayne's Discus Guidebook","review":"When I pick-up this book, I couldn't put it down. I was amazed with all the NEW photographs showing off the latest development discus (not copied or copies of old photos shared by other discus books). These beautiful photos really show why I am drawn to the discusfish. I went through the book back-and-forth several times before putting it down. The book begins with the development of the Wattley Turquoise discus to the Blue Diamond and depicts onto the development of the red strains with the development of the Red Spotted Greens to the fully red spotted discus (as noted on the cover of the book). The photos in this book would really captivate all TRUE discus enthusiasts.The first time I read the book, I thought there were several well-written subjects. After going through the book several times, I, then, noticed that several authors had contributed in writing this Guidebook. Each subject was presented in a format similar to articles. Granted the text in this book accounts for approximately 20% of the 100+ pages, but I picked-up detailed information that I've not read elsewhere. Each article was concise. Since, I did not see the 11 subjects mentioned anywhere, I'll list them: \\"The Origin of the Wattley's Discus\\", \\"The Continual Improvement of the Wattley Turquoise Discus\\", \\"The Development of the Blue Diamond Discus\\", \\"Discus Selection and Purchase\\", \\"Important Techniques for Breeding Discus\\", \\"Sexing Discus-Differences Between Males and Females\\", \\"Understanding Discus Physiology\\", \\"Creating Suitable Water Condition for Discus Breeding\\", \\"Disease Recognition, Prevention and Treatment\\", \\"Central Filtration for Discus Hatchery\\" and \\"Beef Heart Preparation\\". The (3) US breeders who contributed to this book included: Jack Wattley (I think everyone knows of Jack), Dick Au (a top breeder and Author) and Wilfred Fong (Also, a top US breeder, I believe he's the first breeder who successfully bred batches and batches of Blue Diamond Discus in the USA in the mid 90's).

Nearly everything I want to know is somewhere in this set, and it's easy to find too. Sometimes I try to test it by looking up something I am sure that is too recent for it to cover, and usually it wins -- which makes me wonder how many things we humans reinvent because we can't collectively remember that we've done it already. The writers they get for the articles are top-notch, and make things understandable while still packing in more factual information than seems possible.I normally use the computer for everything, but for an encyclopedia I really can't live without the printed word experience. For whatever reason, it's much harder for me to focus well enough to understand complex topics when reading them on the computer screen, and I also am less inclined to try. Having the books' physical presence makes it much more likely for me to actually use them."},{"Title":"Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002 Complete 32 Volume Print Set (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002)","review":"A complete set of \\"Encyclopaedia Britannica\\" provides a near perfect answer to every reference need. Its age-long tradition is synonymous with class and accuracy: a sound testimony that reflects its over two centuries in circulation.This set of tools is something any versatile researcher would hardly do without. There is no imaginable topic that is not taken care of.The price of this collection may be above that of a laptop, but with it, you are done: no need for extra (general) reference tool. It remains a precious resource for anyone who can afford it."},{"Title":"Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002 Complete 32 Volume Print Set (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002)","review":"Please note that this review is for the CD version of the encyclopedia. I couldn't locate the multimedia version on Amazon, which I had written a review on a couple of months ago for some reason, so I thought I'd post the review here. That was a long review that compared the Britannica with the other major offerings with respect to features, such as the World Book, Encarta, and Grolier's, so if you're interested recommend you try to look it up as I go into much more detail on the different sets so you can make the right choice for you.That was a couple of months agg, and now that I've worked with the Britannica extensively, I wanted to make a few more brief comments. And by intensively I mean that each week I've spent several hours reading the various articles.First, a minor complaint. The CD version of the program is very slow running and very piggish when it comes to memory. According to my memory monitoring utility, my RAM utilitization goes from 65% availablility to 38% after loading the Britannica, and that's with 512 megs of RAM. It's the only program I run that impacts memory like that. I recently bought a new system with more RAM and now it runs much better. My old system was a nearly 4 year old Pentium III 650 MHz machine with only 128 megs of RAM (which is fine for Windows 98), but not for running XP, which I had upgraded to, especially if you want to run the Britannica program. My new system is a 2.6 GHz Celeron with four times as much memory, and the Britannica, while not blazingly fast, at least isn't dog slow anymore. I'm surprised they didn't do a better job with the speed. Most people will find this program runs somewhat slow on their systems if they're several years old unless they have a lot of RAM.That having been said, I'm delighted to have this great resource on my system. My interests are mainly in science and history, and 40% of the Britannica is devoted to science. The articles on physics and astronomy and medical and physiological topics are not as technical as I would like, but the other two areas I'm interested in, geology, and linguistics, have articles that are, to use an over-used word phrase, simply awesome. The articles on mineralogy, and on igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology, and geomorphology, are amazingly technical, and are at least at the upper division undergrad level and could even be master's level in terms of diffulty.The articles on comparative and structural linguistics are similarly good, especially the ones on the different language families, such as the Romance, Germanic, and so on, as well as on the super-family articles such as Ural-Altaic and Indo-European. These and the geology articles read more like they were written as technical reviews for professionals already working in the field, rather than for your average college student. Lastly, the articles on western and eastern philosophy, especially the classical periods, are very good too.Also, many of the history and biography articles are quite good, and I've read all the ones on the founding fathers, George Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, Hamilton, Franklin, and so on, and they were excellent as well. As I said, I like to read up and research a number of different subjects, and I read at a fairly high technical level in most of them, and the Britannica has enabled me to increase my knowledge of them substantially and to refresh my memory on many technical details I had forgotten from my advanced classes. So far I've read several dozen articles on various topics and am very pleased.Well, I've written more than I intended to so I'll sign off here. But I wanted to post a few more comments from a very happy customer."},{"Title":"Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002 Complete 32 Volume Print Set (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002)","review":"When I was a young kid going to school in the early 60's my chances (or any other kid in my neighborhood) of owning a set of Britannicas was as likely as a trip to the crater of the moon. Some of the familys that had a little money to rub togeather and really cared about their kid's learning went with the then popular \\"World Book\\".As far back as I can remember I was always mystified with a good encyclopedia. I never had any love at all for school I guess because they never taught me things that held my intrest,but holding that large, terrible,exciting and outstanding volume of the Britannica and going through the neat pages and viewing subjects that could hold my intrest for hours made me sware that one day I would own a set of my own.Now in my fifties I have owned 3 different year sets of Britannicas (including the 1986 Platiunm edition). I purchased all my sets used .My first set (1976) I gave as a gift to a friend who had young kids. I also purchased Britannica's \\"Great Books of the Western World\\" and \\"Annuls of America\\". All these Great volumes are kept on the bookshelves in my living room as so me and my family can at any time dig in and learn. My wife even bought a set of the Children's Britannica for our grandchildren that is better then most regular sets.I know that the computer virsion is now out and yes my kids in college as well as me have it on all our drives but believe me it will never compare to thumbing through those huge volumes and stopping several time on the way to your subject as to view other subjects that suddenly catch your eye...it's Great!These days I know a lot of families can afford a print set as it can be purchased new fron Britannica for not much more then the price of a good computer [...].Just don't go to the A&P; and buy the supermarket brand of Funk & Wagnals as this in no way can compare to the real thing...believe me - I been there and done that!\\"Enjoy\\" Joe Kopeck Parkville, MD"},{"Title":"Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002 Complete 32 Volume Print Set (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2002)","review":"I would just like to let potential buyer know that the Britannica company can be quite annoying once you make your purchase.

The process to mail these 5 pound books back is loathsome, and even when you do, the charge invoices keep coming! Even after several calls, the right 'account specialist' is never available to fix the problem, so you can expect another invoice the next month.I like the encyclopedia, but buy it from a dealer or used so you don't end up in the 'system'."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"The Edge is a good book.

I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"The Edge is the best book by Catherine Coulter yet.

He didn't eat the girl's salad. In the toilet seat scene, he put the gas canaster in the toilet and closed the seat lid. The other person was holding the porcelin tank lid.

Given her previous writing style, I honestly can't believe that she wrote this novel. The story is there, or could be, but the writing is so elementary it's juvenile. In lieu of &quot;See Spot Run&quot; she wrote &quot;Hot damn. Look what I found. Ripe bananas, to go with our mangoes.

I have read all of the author's books, and was very disappointed in this book. I was at least able to finish the book (which is why it got 2 points instead of only 1)... but I would not recommend this book. Her other books in this series are good. This one was written in first person, from the perspective of the main male character...which is different for the author...If you like a mystery (such as 'what is the plot') then you might like this story...."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This is the first time I have read anything of this author. I found it pretty good. From reading other reviews I have found that it is part of a series which I am interested in reading.It has all the makings of a great book: deceiption, bretrayal, family,ESP, murder, suicide, drugs, government agents. The characters were interesting and I really liked Sherlock and Savich even though they were secondary characters. I felt like they were most believable. I want to read &quot;The Target&quot; which I understand is a story that &quot;stars&quot; them. I think what turned me off about it was toward the end where Mac, Sherlock, Laura, and Savich were kidnapped. As they fight their way through the rain forest they end up on a resort beach. It was a little too weird. That is where I lost a little respect of the author.It is action packed though everyone is constantly on the run trying to solve the mystery at hand which turns out to be more than just the disappearance of Mac's sister.If i did it all over again this might not have been the first book I read of hers. I have since read &quot;False Pretenses&quot; which I was very inpressed with."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This book just seemed to drag on and on.

Usually that spells bad news for the romance in a book, but since Catherine Coulter is the author I decided to give it a try. I am soooo glad I did. I very much enjoyed reading a book from the male point of view. The romance and suspense was well done and the characters interesting and believable. I liked Savich and Sherlock coming to the aid of a friend and adding elements from earlier novels. This book is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I read The Edge out of sequence, that is, after I finished reading the other books in Catherine Coulter's FBI series. I found it an enjoyable read, but totally different than the others in the series.The plot, based on a mind-altering and libido stimulating drug and missing persons, is fast-paced. There's even a touch of supernatural with the telepathic link between Mac and his sister Jilly. All these elements combine to keep you reading.Coulter's descriptions of the different settings are vivid. You'll find yourself squirming at some of the encounters Mac and Laurie have with the native animal life in the Rain Forest.The 1st person male viewpoint is unique and, as you can tell from the other reviews, troubling for most readers. Because The Edge is not 3rd person POV, the characters appear to lack depth. You only get to view what's happening from Mac's viewpoint. I think that's why most reader found it more difficult to become absorbed.The Edge seemed to focus on suspense and leave out the hint of romance that you find in the other books of the series. The usual romance elements and sexual tension between Mac and Laurie weren't obvious. Even Dillon and Sherlock didn't come across as well in The Edge as they have in the other books.Not what we are used to from Ms Coulter, but the plot and the unique writing style make it an entertaining and interesting read. Worth the read for Catherine Coulter fans!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"The Edge is Catherine Coulter's fourth title in her FBI suspense series. The first three are The Cove, The Maze, and The Target. In this one, FBI agents and good friends, Mac, Sherlock, and Sherlock's husband Savich are back together again. Mac, who was introduced in Coulter's The Maze, is back. He is in the hospital recovering from a car bombing. On the light side, he is already making demands of the nurse who is also a friend, and on the serious side, he just had a bad dream that he and his sister, Jilly, drove over a cliff. The bad dream goes with the worried feelings he had been having about her for some time, but had brushed off after talking to their brother Kevin, who felt her growing eccentricities stem from living on the west coast. Now the worry and fears for her are back and this time even stronger, especially after he calls her husband Paul, and finds she really did drive off a cliff and is now in a coma. Mac heads out to Edgerton, Oregon, also known as The Edge, as soon as he is able. On arriving to The Edge, Mac finds his FBI credentials have preceded him and the only people who care to welcome him are the police -- Sheriff Maggie Sheffied and the Highway Patrolman who save his sister's life. After being refused a room at a B &amp; B, Mac decides to stay with the brother-in-law he barely knows. Paul and Jilly have been married eight years, and the only thing Jilly has ever told him is that Paul works in Pharmaceuticals and the sex is great. When Mac goes to visit his sister, he hears her voice in his mind yelling the name Laura. Once Mac finds her, confusion starts. To clear the confusion, Mac starts investigating on his own. Sherlock and Savich show up to help and everyone finds themselves far away from home and in serious danger. The Edge is a pretty good suspense novel. I wouldn't call it a thriller, even though there was an edge of the seat moment or two. The author has Mac and Jilly speaking in first person. Jilly's part is in italics. The characters are strong and interesting, and the dialog and action kept the pages turning. The plot was pretty basic with one exception, but I can't tell what that is without giving away the story. I will say the storyline, language, and sexual content is for mature audiences. As for spoilers from the last three books in the series, it didn't seem as if there were any, but since I haven't read them, I couldn't say for sure."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"It is impossible to think how this book could be worse. The plot alone is laughable. But I'm the kind of reader who can forgive a lame plot if the book has good character development or interesting dialog. This book has neither. At first, the characters may seem complex, but they're not. They are either all good or all bad. Unfortunately, even the &quot;good&quot; ones are so unlikable that I rooted for the real &quot;bad&quot; guys to kill them. What's worse is the dialog. Try this one. Men are shooting at the protagonists. Mac, intrepid FBI agent, is lying on top of Laura, intrepid . . . (well, can't tell you that, it would be giving away the plot). Mac says, &quot;Just hold tight, Laura. Think of me as your Kevlar vest.&quot; I did not make this up. It's no surprise that someone might write this drivel. I just can't figure out how it got published. Was the editor on vacation? I noticed the beginning contained no acknowledgements. That's probably because the author couldn't find anyone who wanted to be associated with such a miserable effort.

The Maze was great and after reading The Edge, you will have a hard time believing it's the same writer."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Coulter for many years so I was excited when I bought The Edge. She reintroduced previous characters from her other books &quot;The Maze&quot; (excellent 5 star book) and &quot;the Target( an excellent 5 star book). I thought WOW I love these characters. But Ms Coulter tried a different style of writing this time. She wrote in the first person of Mac ( a man) So ok I can handle this. Ms. Coulter still showed the charming wit that made her so well liked. The story is going strong and then you have only 5 or 6 pages left and your wondering how is this going to end and tie up all the different stories. The problem it didn't address what happened to all the characters involved in the plot. You finish reading this book and the first thing I said was what about so and so. Maybe Ms. Coulter is writing a sequel to this book to answer all the questions...."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"It's not as bad as the reviews below say it is, but I'm glad I read them before I read this book. So, I didn't read it expecting great - if you want great read the previous 3 books in this series. If, on the other hand, you have a free evening and don't mind lightweight, almost mindless fluff, or you just want to know what happens next in the series, go ahead and read The Edge - and pretend it was written by someone else. I'm reminded of people's complaints &amp; comments about James Patterson's When The Wind Blows (of course, I liked that book)...The Edge is told from the first-person point-of-view of the main male character. He is amusing at times, but he doesn't have a great deal of depth - neither does anyone else. The main female character seems to have been put in the book because a female was required - not because she adds much to the story. Unfortunately, you don't get to know what's going on in her head - which is one of the main problems with first-person narratives. More problems: Their relationship doesn't really develop, it just seems to come out of left field - one day he's having sex with one woman, the next he's decided he's in love with another... the mystery &amp; intrigue isn't really all that mysterious or intriguing... the psychic connection between the brother &amp; sister isn't really developed... and the villian left a lot to be desired - so did the ending. The storyline had a good idea, but didn't follow thru on it - most of the book and it's characters are like that - they had potential, but...I gave it 2 stars because:1. I wasn't expecting great, so I wasn't as disappointed as some of the other readers appear to be.2. The characters of Savage and Sherlock are continued from the previous books - they're my favorite characters.So, if you want edge, read The Cove, The Maze, and The Target - in that order. And then consider reading The Edge with an open and forgiving mind.Finally, I hope there is another book in the series, but I just hope Ms. Coulter goes back to writing like she did in the first 3 books of the series!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"There are too many characters &amp; not enough explanations.

Do yourself a favor, save your money and your time."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I ordinarily really enjoy Coulter's books (as far-fetched as they may seem). But I had a terrible time getting into this one because it's written in first-person from the male perspective. That and the story just didn't interest me. I read the whole thing anyway (how can you not?), but this is not one that I will read again."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"What a dreadful book. This is not the first book I have read by Catherine Coulter but it will probably be the last. I only read to the end because I have never been able to put a book down once started. From the beginning I was confused, first by who was actually telling the story then by the way the hero (?) Mac was able to justify the way he acted with Cal and then moved on to the supposed love of his life. Very shallow. There were so many other characters who seemed superfluous, I kept waiting for something to happen with them. And don't get me started on the whole being knocked out in Oregon and waking up in some drug lords compound in South America only to find their way to a resort! There are so many other things I found hard to take with this book that I'll leave it there."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I have read practically every Coulter novel written. She is a multi-talented, gifted writer but feel Edge was not up to par. It is the only novel I have never finished. After reading Target, Maze and Cove, I bugged the book store for weeks waiting on Edge. I was really disappointed. The storyline was good but I simply never could get into it. I quit reading right after Ford moved her into his house. Maybe I'll finish it one day. Maybe."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"It's the fourth in a series. This is the only one that's told from the first person point-of-view. The story's about a man who gets pulled into a mystery involving the illegal manufacture and testing of a drug which inhances sexual pleasure - but it has nasty side-effects. There's a sub-plot involving a psychic connection between him &amp; his sister - it's kinda weak and doesn't really go anywhere, except it begins the mystery (but it never does explain why or how they're psychically connected or if it did I missed it). The main gist is: After Mac (the main character) has a psychic vision of his sister's accident he tries to find out what she was involved in. His search leads him to the drug, drug dealers, and a beautiful woman. At first he thinks she's one of the bad guys, but she's not quite what she seems. They join forces and then the chase is on to find out who's behind it all... The dialog was a little simple and the story was missing the intrigue that the other books had. I kinda liked the humor, but it could have had a deeper plot and a better mystery and the ending's kinda flat - without any flash. The reviewer below called the book 'fluff' - I guess it is in places - fluff &amp; sex - but if you write a book about a sex drug I guess that's to be expected. Savich &amp; Sherlock from the other books are in it. From the reviews I've read everybody seemed to find them their favorite part of this book - me, too. Though this book is separate in itself, you might want to read the other 3 books before reading this one. Each one seems to lead into the next. Overall, I thought it was OK, but very different from the others in the series."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I'm a big fan of Catherine Coulter's FBI Series. So far, I've read six books from the series and have loved all of them...except The Edge. While she does bring back her best characters (the husband and wife team of Savich and Sherlock), the other characters lack depth. The character of Laura (a DEA agent and main love interest) was predictable and I never thought that I found out enough about her. Also, I wasn't fond of the first person writing style she used in this one. While Mac (the first person) is a good character, there's just so much action going on in these books that I don't want to be limited to the view of one person.As in the rest of the FBI Thrillers, the action was good. The storyline focused around the attempt to bust a plot involving the development of a dangerous new drug. But, some of storyline was a bit perverse to me. The effects of the drug seemed over the top and I never really thought of the two lead characters the same again after a particular scene involving a drugged-up Mac attempting to rape Laura while she was tied-up. I understand shock value, but this was a bit much for me. Plus, there doesn't seem to be a very good ending; there was really no closure.If you're reading this to keep up with the series (as I was), be prepared to wonder where the magic of the other books went. It's not a bad read, but it definitely lacks some key elements."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"Did I really bother to read this? Unfortunately, this is another example of what readers in America crave: fast paced, poorly written trash that can easily be converted to a TV movie of the week. It seems that even though all the rules of literature are disregarded, books of this type float to the surface of the mainstream, are touted by 'critics' and capture the public's attention. They are unavoidable, ubiquitously lining the best shelf space in bookstores, drugstores and magazine stands with their captivating jacket art, blatant reminders that publishers are out there to sell books, not provide the populace with good reading. The plot in this gem is unbelievable: the stereotypical FBI agent blunders into answers as crudely as he blunders into women. The reader may be careened down a bluff edging the Pacific Ocean in Oregon and then kidnapped to the jungles of Columbia, but somehow these spectacular locales fail to stimulate any of the senses. The supporting characters of the husband and wife FBI team, while sterling examples of love and commitment, lack real warmth, failing to move the reader other than to bore him. The author does her best to make Mac a 'regular guy' who loves his beer and falls fast for the hard-shooting gal DEA agent, but the reader gets the sense that Coulter is trying too hard . . . or didn't bother enough and should enroll in a remedial writing lab to relearn the basic literary elements despite the stupendous amounts of money she must make with such offerings. The mind peaking concept of the sex drug, while having intriguing possibilities flattens with its unfolding, coming off as contrived as a last minute twist in a child's bedtime story. I will say that the story does manage to compel the reader to read on, at least during the first ten or fifteen chapters. Afterwards? Mac and his DEA woman are transmuted into Rambo and Brigette Nielsen; they manage to courageously blast their way out of a jungle crawling with inept mercenaries while under the mind-altering and libido stimulating drug, all for the sake of millions of unsuspecting and (one could conclude) worthless substance-seeking American adolescents.

The whole thing was choppy and horribly edited, but the begining was far worse than the end. At one point Mac was at a deli with a woman. He ordered meatloaf and she ordered salad. Suddenly, he was served the salad, as if he had ordered it, and he ate it. Then, stuff about the meatloaf comes up, and it seems that he ordered that as well. Needless to say, I'm betting the woman he was with must have been crash dieting, because as far as I can figure she didn't ever eat a thing. Things like this crop up all throughout the book. (At one point he puts the lid of a toilet down while someone else is holding it across the room. Pretty talented.)I also hated the poorly done 1st person perspective. Sometimes 1st person can be fun to read; this was not one such instance.I do not recommend buying this book. If you really must read it, get it from a library, or go to a used bookstore (there will soon be plenty of copies there.) This sounds harsh, but I never would have gotten to the decent 2nd half if I hadn't been bored enough sitting at home to keep on ploughing through the first half.Hopefully Coulter will try to write a new book next time rather than relying on previous characters to carry her work."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"Wow, what a disappointment! The Edge started out with a telepathy scene written in first person. But then Coulter reintroduced two old characters, a terrorist bombing recovery, an entire community of villians, a rainforest survival trek, and drug therapy while killing off characters that were basically unimportant. The real crime was the ending that didn't tie up the plot's loose ends. It was as if Coulter thought that more characters and twists to the plot would make it the Edge a better book.

However, she leaves much to be desired in the ways of modern &quot;suspense&quot;. I've read all 4 books in this series. The only one I liked was The Maze. The Edge is BY FAR the worst. The first chapter really interested me, but it just went downhill from there. The characters are horrible--in all these books they barely know each other but fall in love at the drop of a hat. And they were so poorly developed; I just didn't care what happened to any of them. But even more painful is The Edge's storyline. It is so far-fetched! There are parts that just do not connect. It really seems to me that these 4 books were not of Coulter quality. Did she have deadlines to meet?"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I haven't been able to make it through the first chapter. I was thrilled when this book came out. I have read every one of Catherine Coulter's past books and loved them all. I grabbed &quot;The Edge&quot; and tossed it into my shopping cart on the strength of her name alone. I'll never make that mistake again. I can't make myself read this book at all. There is nothing in the first chapter to catch my interest. I hate the first person. The characters are as uninteresting as dry toast. I'm not willing to throw this book away yet. Hopefully the next time I attempt to read it I'll get through Chapter two before it puts me to sleep. I am hesitant to give it one whole star but your rating system doesn't go below that."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target, I couldn't wait to buy this book. Am I glad that I read the reviews and waited till it came out in soft cover. The book had a lot of potential and it grabbed my interest with the first chapter. It was unfortunate that I ended up forcing myself to finish the book. The story not only drags but the characters are not well developed at all. We know the same amount of information about Mac, Laura and the rest of the cast at the end of the book as we do at the begining the only insight we gain is their employment history. The first person perspective was alright but again sadly lacking, normally the reader is given an indepth view into a charater when this format is used, here it just annoying and shallow. I would definatly not take this book on a train, plane, or bus where it would be the only entertainment."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This book was so awful, I wish I never read it. The character Mac thinks with something other than his brain. It seems like a teenage boy wrote this book; I think I could have written a better suspense novel!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This is the worst suspense book I ever read!!!! The character Mac sounded like a oversexed FBI agent who used something other than his brain to think. The whole book was unbelieveable. It really is a waste of time to read. I think I could have written a better suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"After reading The Target and The Maze, I was impressed with Coulter's ability to pull off a romantic thriller. I assumed that The Edge, especially with overlapping characters, would be just as good, if not better. Well, to say the least, I was disappointed. The characters were ridiculously underdeveloped, even Sherlock and Savitch, about whom Coulter wrote a wonderful well-developed and believable story line. The main characters, Mac and Laura, have little to no personality, which makes it impossible to follow the romantic lead. The rest of the characters encounter each other with very poor dialogue... I can't think of one thing that will redeem the first 275 pages enough to make me read the last 75. This book must not have been written by Coulter herself, that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I've read almost all Catherine Coulter's works. Until this book, I'd never read one I didn't absolutely love. But, The Edge is disappointing. The prelude was great. Written in first person, it captures the attention with a shared experience thousands of miles apart. After that, the story completely fell apart. The characters were flat and the dialogue stilted. There was promise that the book was coming back to life about 2/3 of the way through when the main characters are kidnapped and subsequently escaped. The book ends quite suddenly with a &quot;formula&quot; kind of ending. It looks as if there are many spin off stories to come from The Edge....hopefully, the characters and the story will be more interesting in the next installment."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I truly enjoyed reading The Edge! I couldn't put the book down, it was that thrilling. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"just a note to the reviewer from huntress--Savich and Sherlock were the main couple from the MAZE--not the Target--if we're to take your opinion seriously, perhaps you should get your novels and your characters straight--The Edge is still C.C.'s worst and left me grinding my teeth two weeks later."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I always like to read one of Coulter's books but this one was almost unreadable!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I'm really sorry, but the charm and skill of this writer completely elude me. I barely made it through one chapter of THE EDGE before tossing the book aside. I swear I'm not just trying to be mean, but I've seen better and more competent writing in an elementary school notebook. To each his own, but I remain baffled by the continued success of this author. Don't not buy this book because I didn't like it. Maybe you'll have better luck with it!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I was a little wary of this book when I first picked it up and noticed that it was written in first person from Mac's point of view. However, once I got into it, I really enjoyed the change in style. The story is told in a way that keeps your pages turning and your mind hummming. Mac is a great character and being inside his head through everything was entertaining and amusing, as well as believable because his reactions and thoughts were very human.The suspense, the romance, and the fun that I have enjoyed in Coulter books in the past were all present in THE EDGE. Savich and Sherlock's part in this mystery also reminded me how much I loved THE MAZE. All in all, Coulter's done it again!"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I've really been looking forward to this book and was so disappointed! I usually love all of her books. The book was written from a man's viewpoint. The catch is, I had to keep mentally reminding myself that I was reading a guy's thoughts and not a female's. It just didn't click mentally for me. Because of that, it was difficult for me to become absorbed like I usually do. But, I have to say, other than than roadblock, the book is well written and amusing. I would recommend it because it is a Coulter but I'm curious whether any others had the same problem I did....."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I just wanted to say that Catherine Coulter's The Maze is one of my all-time favorite books. I was very disappointed in this novel. The dialogue really got to me. It was a good plot, the characters weren't too deep, but entertaining. I hard a hard time getting through it, however, due to the extremely weak dialogue."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"Coulter introduced a lot of characters, but failed to tie them together. There's the sheriff...what's her deal? Who was she really involved with and why? The old Chicago cop...he's just kind of thrown in there and written off at the end. The drug dealer...we never even met him! And, in typical Coulter fashion, she's got to throw in a little kinky sex stuff...but it made no sense to the plot.This book needed a strong editor, and a major rewrite. Just because you've got some bestsellers shouldn't let you get away with sloppy plots."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"The transition from the cottage to the jungle was rather jarring. The first half of the book was boring...the second half was strange but it was fun to romp through the jungle with Sherlock and Savich (I really didn't care about Laura and Ford). I got really sick of hearing about the bird and the cat. Overall, a really bad effort. On the plus side, the cover art is beautiful."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"A veces es obvio que el texto copiado por los criticos fu&eacute; tomado palabra-por-palabra directamente de la informacci&oacute;n del publicista.

Machetes hachando ansiosamente por las enredaderas, monos ruidos volando por los &aacute;rboles en lo alto, por lo general todo mendionado vagamente. No se compara para nada con los sitios reconocibles de &quot;A CAT'S FULL NINE,&quot; tan gr&aacute;fico y familiar como la palma de mi mano.Frecuentemente es cuesti&oacute;n de un escritor de romance que no puede entrarle totalmente al g&eacute;nerro espeluznante, y vice-versa, porque nunca pueden expresar todo al paquete con uno de &eacute;stos elementos excepto a costas del otro."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I can't believe how terrible this book was.

I have followed this particular series with great enjoyment. WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED WITH THIS ONE??? I did not like the writing in 1st person, you can't get into the head of the other characters. I also didn't really care for the male only perspective. Also, Dillon and Savich were great characters in their own story, but I really didn't feel this book did their characters justice. Real big disappoinment. Wish I had not spent the money.

What a disappointment. Am glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it. Kind of hokey and disjointed. The first person and from a man's point of view didn't bother me. Barbara Delinsky wrote a great book from a man's point of view. This book just bounced around and I had to keep going back to try to figure out what was going on. I thought the characters were kind of silly and was disappointed that she made Savich and Dillon so sappy!

If their relationship was expanded on or even developed properly then it would make sense. And the FBI and DEA agents didn't even come close to sounded or acting like real agents.

Mac had just recovered from a terrorist car bombing. Given leave, he went to Portland to care for his sister, Jilly, who was in a coma. When she finally came out of it, he had only a few hours with her before she disappeared directly from the hospital. No one saw her leave and no one knows if she went willingly or not. Jilly was a scientist. She and her husband, Paul, had been working on a new type of drug. The more Mac learned, the more worried he became.When an old man is killed to keep a secret, and someone is out using Mac and his partner for target practice, Mac calls for help. Fans get to see Dillon and Sherlock, the main couple from &quot;The Target&quot;, back in action! They team up to find Jilly and beat the bad guys who are after the drug!***Catherine Coulter dazzled readers with &quot;The Cove&quot;, &quot;The Maze&quot;, and &quot;The Target&quot;. Now she continues in &quot;The Edge&quot;! This one begins in a male view point, which seems different for this author. However, I am happy to be able to say that this new release is great and will go on my &quot;Keepers&quot; shelf next to the others! I recommend this to those who love thrillers, fiction, and/or modern contemporary!***"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I opened the cover of Ms. Coulter's latest creation with my usual sense of excitment and anticipation. The prologue was vintage Coulter and I snuggled down in my chair, prepared for a nice exciting read. Imagine my surprise(and disappointed amazement)when I turned to the first chapter and realized that she had written this story in first person point of view! Worse still, it was written from the male point of view! This breaks the first cardinal rule of the romance genre - no first person, please! Quite frankly, her character, Ford &quot;Mac&quot; MacDougal, just isn't a strong enough character to intice me into his head, which is how first person works. I, as a reader, don't care enough about this man to want to know his every thought at the expense of everyone elses! What I want and expect from Ms. Coulter is an exciting story mixed with just the right blend of mystery, intrigue and romance. I don't find that here. What I do find is a story that lacks character intimacy because the thoughts and feelings of Laura Scott(the female protagonist)are blocked from the reader. In fact, this character isn't even mentioned in the fly leaf of the book! Imagine that! A romance novel in which the female point of view is deemed so unimportant that it is literally withheld from the reader! Excuse me? Is the new face of romantic fiction that of a man's? Curious, don't you think? Not only is the real world a man's world, but now the romance world is becoming a man's world! I'm sorry, but that is how I see this latest attempt by Catherine Coulter. As a reader, I have certain expectations. One of those expectations is that I live vicariously through the female character in the story. I can't do that if the thoughts of that character are kept from me. Romantic fiction doesn't work that way. When it does, it's called selfish and thoughtless and we, as women, have lived with that reality for eons. That's why we turned to romance novels in the first place! They give us the fantasy that eludes real life. But it's alittle hard to enjoy a fantasy when it is viewed entirely through a man's eyes!Perhaps if Ms. Coulter had used this device in the other books of this series, I wouldn't have found it so jarring. But she didn't. Why the sudden change? Was Mac MacDougal such a strong character that his view point alone carried the story? Was Laura Scott's character so weak that she couldn't carry the story at all? Maybe there was something in the story itself(I can't imagine what)that precluded the third person voice. Or perhaps it's just a case of the author wanting to try something new at the expense of her readers. I guess only Ms. Coulter and her editor know for sure. As for me, I'll continue to plow through &quot;The Edge&quot;, but I can't promise to like it much. I just hope that in the future, Ms. Coulter returns her female character to center stage. It's where she belongs."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This is my first book by Coulter, and my last. Though the story was interesting enough for me to finish the book, and the research was really solid, the writing is childish. I found myself shouting at the book when characters delivered awkward, polysyllabic inanities during moments of high passion. And the ending, after a huge hysterical build-up, falls kinda flat. One star for plot and one star for research; deduct 3 stars for amateur-hour writing."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target I looked forward with great anticipation in reading The Edge. However, as I dislike first person narrative I had trouble keeping my mind on the storyline. I only read half the book. I hope the next book she writes is in a different format. If you dislike first person narrative don't purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I really hate to give a bad review since i enjoy reading but this was awful.

One week later with fewer than one hundred pages read, I have to admit that I've been wasting my time. What a disappointment to Ms Coulter's loyal fans! After reading one third of this book I find that the story has barely progressed. The characters are so poorly developed that I have no desire to even see how the story ends. The dialogue is silly and not even believable for a man of Mac's description. Will the real Catherine Coulter please come forward and write something worthy of her time and ours?"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I have read every book by Coulter and this has to be the worse. I truly believe Ms. Coulter must be using a Ghost Writer because the quality of work has really gone done hill. The concept of the Edge was interesting and it really caught my attention but due to the poor writing skills, I lost interest very quickly. I use to be able to pick up a Coulter book and be done in a day or two. This one could not hold my attention and it took me forever to complete it. Sorry Catherine, but you better start either writing your own material or else get better ghost writers."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This is certainly not her best work. I found myself interested in this story but I felt that this story was not very well developed. It had too many occurences and activities that did not make sense.

Just because she's on drugs...... Get real, I hated this book, about the only thing going for it is the nice paper and print. I own many of Ms. Coulter's books and disappointed just doesn't say what I feel about this book... And what in the world happened to &quot;Savich&quot;????? If all you are going to write about is his hard stares - don't bother to put him or &quot;Sherlock&quot; in your next book, give the couple some dignity."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"The inside cover sounded as good as her other RS; however it is written in first person, and for me, that was a stopper!

It was painful and incredibly disappointing--I'm praying her next novel is much, much better and that she takes her readers into consideration--the male point of view just doesn't cut it in first person for a romance novel--The Target worked with a male protagonist, but this one lost me by page 3. Please, oh, please Ms. Coulter, come back to us--where did you go?"},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I'm an avid reader of Ms. Coulter's, but this book was a big disappointment. There was no real plot. There was no definition of the characters. And I don't think Ms. Coulter had a definite plan for the ending as she just ended the book.

FUSION - Bruce Huntly."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This was the first book that I read by Catherine Coulter, and I am scolding myself for almost stopping with it. I have read many of her books now and I can't help but wonder if she had another person write this. The begining seems interesting, but it falls flat about the second chapter in. Mac is in the hospital, almost too weak to feed himself, but then he just sits up and leaves. But it gets better. In the rainforest, there are gun shot wounds and no food and the sexually aroused Mac, but miraculously, they endup at a Club Med. Now this may have all been okay, but it was written in first person from a man's point of veiw. Where did this come from? The love story and plot seemed to be thrown in at the end. The mystery was lacking, and it wasn't very suspenseful. If you want a good book by Coulter, try the first three or any of her historical romances. ...."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"First off, this was not her best. I'm not a fan of first person, but my love of C.C.'s books kept me going. It took a while to get into, and it had no apparent heroine for a long while (something I do not like). But once it got going,I loved it. first person was different, but not bad. I would have prefered third, but I can't have everything I want. Overall, a good read once you got into the story."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I find it sad to see Coulter lose the unique style that made her early works absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"I am a long time fan of Catherine Coulter and have read almost all of her books. It's a shame, when you know that an author can write books really well, to read one that is so poorly put together. After a week, I still haven't finished it--this from a reader that usually finishes a book this size in a few hours.The first person perspective contributes to the very disjointed feeling I had throughout much of the beginning of the book. The story seemed to jump around a lot, bringing in lots of characters right at the beginning. I had a hard time keeping track of them all. In addition, I could see no motivation for many characters actions.Worst of all--even though this is not technically a romance, I still feel Coulter should have followed some of the basics of romantic writing that she is so well known for and successful at. Particularly, I felt that Mac's &quot;quickie&quot; with Cal early on was too weird. Not even 2 days later he is in bed with Laura. This makes it very hard to believe in our hero, or to believe that our heroine (Laura) isn't a fool for falling for him.I could go on and on about how poorly editted this book was, how inconsistent the jacket flap was with what the book was about, etc. Even the paper is deceptively thick to make the book appear to be more than it is. If Coulter is going to continue in the hardcover arena, she and her publisher need to spend more time on improving on the quality of the writing and finished product. I will probably keep looking for the &quot;next book&quot; from Catherine Coulter, but I will take a careful look for reviews before I buy it."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"Ford \\"Mac\\" MacDougal is recovering at Bethesda Naval Hospital from injuries sustained following a car bombing when he is awakened from his realistic dream involving his sister. He calls her the next morning and finds she was involved in an car accident and is in a coma in Edgerton, Oregon. Two days later, Mac is on his way to see his sister and find out what happened.I had such high hopes for this story after The Maze and The Target but it was not to be. This story had a good, solid start with lots of interesting, quirky characters in a town that had lots of shadows and secrets. The paranormal possibilities were also there with Mac's odd connection with his sister, Jilly. Somewhere around halfway into the book, the story just lost itself. It was even more confusing to have two characters using first person narrative. It was often tough knowing who was delivering the dialogue, which was awkward at times. I got immersed in the extremely interesting events as they unfolded as we learned that something was amiss in the town and settled back to enjoy a compelling mystery. Instead of a build up to an exciting conclusion, the characters became mired in a puzzling abduction and the story culminates abruptly without a clear resolution. The epilogue seemed to be tacked on to attempt to wrap up some of the details but it was sorely lacking. I'm not sure I'd recommend this book because of the weak ending.On the bright side, I found Mac to be an interesting guy who I hope will appear again in this series, along with his love interest, who I won't name because that would be a spoiler. And, Lacy and Dillon Savitch are back, which is a good thing.I like this series and plan to continue. My hope is that the next book is back on track."},{"Title":"The Edge (FBI Series)","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and it will be the last. It would make a poor grade b movie of the week, absent the nudity and sex. Even the sex was bad! I got the feeling that maybe her publisher was bugging her to get this one out he door. The character development was very poor, the action was illogical and the premise was like something in a batman comic. Stark naked the heroes were able to escape from their captors twice in rapid succession using essentially the same predictable methods. How ridiculous! The period of time in the jungle was drivel.

As the story starts off it grabs you right from the second page. I like mystery and thrill stories, this book is both combined right from the beginning.

Mac has to find out what happened in the small town of Edgerton, Oregon and he is determined to do so.

P. Lovecraft","review":"This is a companion piece of sorts to Joshi's magisterial biography of Lovecraft, delving more into Lovecraft's literary and philosophical positions, and less into the details of his day-to-day life. Unavoidably, there is some duplication between the biography and this material.Few writers are lucky enough to have a biographer-critic who achieves a good balance among sympathetic understanding, broad literary appreciation, and unbiased dissection, but Lovecraft is fortunate to have Joshi, who does have such a balance. Joshi's lack of an academic position is, however, a pretty clear indication of the low esteem the literary establishment has for Lovecraft scholarship. In the past 40 years I've seen Lovecraft's literary reputation rise steeply in academia, but he has quite a ways to go, and some academic critic who's looking for a writer to champion has only to pick up this book and find a superb introduction to the writer, his work and thought.

Fast easy reading and a few pages with good family pictures."},{"Title":"THE PERSONAL NARRATIVE","review":"Indeed, much of this tale is apparently not true. The editor (Richard Batman) makes this clear from the get-go, and points out the most obvious whoppers with plenty of footnotes and clarifications. He also tells you that the publisher, Timothy Flint, admitted to adding some \\"topographical illustrations,\\" whatever that means. As you read it, you can inherently sense when the authorship changes, since Pattie's writing style seems to involve an excessive use of commas.So, what is the value of this book? Regardless of historical accuracy, this is still a reprint of a book that came out in 1831. That in itself gives it historical value, whether fact or fiction. The scenery, the sentiments, the lifestyle - they are all authentic to their time, and offer a window to the past from some primary source, whomever that may be. The relationships between the whites and the Indians are typical of any of the \\"mountain man\\" books you may choose to read, which may be more true than this. However I found the interactions between the Americans and the Spanish-Mexicans much more revealing and intriguing. The last third of the book, which depicts Pattie's experiences in California (with many events confirmed by other sources), is more personal, and at times heartbreaking. Whether or not he \\"saved\\" the population with smallpox vaccine is not half as interesting as his descriptions of the California missions he visited up the coast. As a Californian, I was pleased to read references to the La Brea Tar Pits, and amused to learn that two priests had robbed the St. Buenaventura mission of silver and gold prior to Pattie's arrival.I would recommend this book for readers who enjoy Mountain Man lore, Southwest/California history, or 19th century \\"historical\\" literature. (This book also contains several delightful original illustrations of a somewhat primitive style, reminiscent of Revolutionary Era artwork.)"},{"Title":"THE PERSONAL NARRATIVE","review":"I can't recommend this book because its partly or mostly untrue. Pattie, is one is to believe him, traversed nearly every corner of the old West from 1824 to 1830, participated in countless battles with Indians, rescued Mexican maidens, was one of the first Mountain Men to reach California, became a hero when he vaccinated 18,000 Californians against smallpox, explored large parts of the Rocky Mountains, and ended up in a Mexican jail from whence he made his way back to the United States and dictated his story to a journalist.Pattie tells a good tale and there is an air of authenticity in many of his travels. He probably saw some country out West, and some of his descriptions are no doubt valuable, but it appears he vastly exaggerated his exploits. The problem with reading the book is that you can't be sure what is truth and what is fiction.Well, telling whoppers was a tradition among the Mountain Men and Pattie seems to have been a master teller of tall tales -- and smart enough not to make them so tall that they are manifestly untrue. There's enough authentic material about the Mountain Men in the 1820s to ignore this book without loss. If you're captivated by Pattie, the editor, Richard Batman, has written \\"James Pattie's West\\" which tries to unravel the truth in this story.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society","review":"A deeply perceptive (short) paperback on the self-renewal of individuals and societies; why some decay and others remain innovative and creative. Now in his 90th year, Mr. Gardner continues to teach at Stanford. In clear, concise terms the author sets down the factors that produce deterioration in people and societies. He maintains they are caused mostly by failure to deal with change. The factors? He names five.SELF-DEVELOPMENT. Not just skills, but the whole range of our own potentialities for sensing, wondering, learning, understanding and aspiring. Gardner points out that this does not happen until one gets over the odd notion that education is what goes on in school buildings and nowhere else.SELF-KNOWLEDGE. By midlife we are accomplished fugitives from ourselves. Our lives are filled with diversions; our heads stuffed with knowledge; we are involved with people. Result: we've never taken time to probe our inner selves. We don't want to know ourselves. We don't want to depend upon ourselves. We can't stand to live with ourselves. A better way is to develop a more comfortable view of who you are. It is the true basis of inner strength.COURAGE TO FAIL. By the time we reach middle age, we carry in our heads a long list of things we'll never try again because we tried once and failed. Mature people learn less because they are willing to risk less. There's no learning without difficulty and fumbling, but if you want to keep on learning, you must keep risking failure.LOVE. Develop the ability to have mutually fruitful relations with others. Be capable of accepting love and giving it; of depending upon others and of being depended upon. Develop the ability to see life through another's eyes and reach out to others.MOTIVATION. A self-renewing person is highly motivated. The author points out that motivation isn't a fuel that gets injected into your system (motivation speakers won't do it); it's partly inner energy and partly the result of the social forces in your life. Gardner makes the point that we live in an over-verbalized civilization. Words have become more real than the things they signify and we need to return to the solid earth of direct experience because we are drowning in meaningless word tonnage.\\"For those who have accepted the reality of change, the need for endless learning and trying is a way of living, a way of thinking, a way of being awake and ready. \\"Life isn't a train ride where you choose your destination, pay your fare and settle back for a nap. \\"It's a cycle ride over uncertain terrain, with you in the driver's seat, constantly correcting your balance and determining the direction of progress. \\"It's dfficult, sometimes profoundly painful.\\"For those who are able to achieve self-renewal, Gardner believes they will also develop a more realistic survival view of the world: \\"Sensible people will understand that there will never be a time when we are not in imminent danger. Cruelty, violence, brutality will be held in leash only by unresting effort--if held in leash at all. \\"Sloth, indulgence, smugness, torpor begotten of ease and flabbiness begotten of security will always lurk in wait.\\" No society will ever solve the issue of the individual versus the organization. \\"No society will ever discover how to become civilized without running the risk of becoming overcivilized.\\"This is a profoundly thoughtful, penetrating piece on what makes you tick. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society","review":"What a terrific book! What amazes me most is that this book was written over thirty years ago and still has so much to say to people today. A basic breakdown of the book is this: organizations and individuals must use innovation as a way of preserving and renewing their institutions. If one chooses status quo as a preservation method, one will do the exact opposite one intended: the institution will rot, not thrive. This book is great material for any leader who wants to understand the dynamics of change and the type of obstacles one will have to overcome if one wants to lead innovation."},{"Title":"Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society","review":"Two recurring themes of achievers are mentioned in the first few pages of this book, the importance of toughminded optimism and the power of persistence. It is in that spirit that Gardner develops his topic. With the inevitability of change, openness to new experience is vital to self-renewal he claims. Being active in intentional change leads to growth rather than change by default he explains. Knowing how to creatively interact with changes in the environment is a learned ability that can lead to the development of new potentialities Gardner writes.This interactive process is experienced at the individual level also. Gardner describes healthy self-renewing people as those who both give and accept love. They depend on other people and are capable of having other people depend on them.Passion is part of the self-renewed life. He says people of that bent know they must have conviction about what they are doing and if they don't, they need to find something they can have conviction about.The principles he describes at the individual level have implications collectively as well. He goes on to state that &quot;it is important that a society create an atmostphere that encourages effort, striving and vigorous performance&quot; (p. 20). It is within social systems that individuals make their contributions. A lot of wise insight is provided in this book. He leaves the readers better off than when they picked up the book to read."},{"Title":"Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society","review":"I purchased this book as a course requirement but will continue to use this as a renewal product to recharge the batteries.

Prince Albert had the &quot;Royal Children&quot; read by George Combe. He sparked arguments between religious and scientific groups in a similar (and possibly more fiery way) than Charles Darwin.

DJ has written an excellent introduction into the world of Jabber, covering everything a programmer would need to become familiar with the protocol for this Open instant messaging system. He covers everything from the basics of what exactly Jabber is, how to deal with presence, messages, and basic extensions, all the way up to complicated and unfinished extensions such as XML-RPC. Anyone programming Jabber needs this as a reference, and anyone looking to get started in the Jabber world need not look further than this book."},{"Title":"Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML)","review":"When I first picked up this book, I expeted to understand the Jabber protocol in sufficient depth to implement my own IM client. Instead, the approach this book takes is that Jabber isn't just an XML-based protocol strictly for IM, rather it is a general purpose event notification protocol that has some very nice message routing and user management features built into it. While I was reading about the messages that Jabber has defined as part of the protocol, I could easily see other applications/devices generating Jabber messages to notify subscribers (either other systems, or people) of events.This book covers everything relevant to Jabber technology, from lowest level innerworkings and extensibility examples for developers to configuration and deployment for admins. Most of the book is spent looking directly at the Jabber XML protocol, instead of a specific API implementation. This way, the book covers the technology and doesn't get lost in how one particular API models the protocol."},{"Title":"Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML)","review":"I picked up this book after reading a good review on Slashdot.org, and I'm happy to say that I'm not disappointed.The book covers the installation of the server and the configuration (including a Jabber cluster), and then starts covering the XML protocol that is used to send information between servers and clients.Several useful real-world examples are given, including a CVS-notification system, keyword assistant, headline viewer, etc. There is even a project to hook Jabber up to a coffee pot using Lego Mindstorm, with the point being to show how flexible Jabber can be. Examples are in PERL, Python and Java.The book makes it quite clear that there is far more to Jabber than just instant-messaging."},{"Title":"Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML)","review":"This book was not published in June 30, 2009 - it was published on Jan 2002 - you really should not be able to make it look like it was published recently since this is what people check as an important requirement before they purchase a book.O'Reilly are listing it as a 2002 book - with the very same 482 pagesLook at the comments on this page - they are 2002 comments so those ratings are not relevant.I will be returning my book.Update...there is more to this: In every O'Reilly book I purchased (18), there is a page immediately after the table of contents that show the publishing information including the publish date:\\"Copyright yyyy editor\\"Why was this page removed in this kindle ebook?This is serious - the problem is more than just the waste of money on a book you thought was recent technology - the reader assumes it is recent and is being advised on technologies & practices of 2002 - working with xml has changed much since 2002 - so the reader would be wasting much time too.This needs to be corrected."},{"Title":"Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML)","review":"Expected this to be an ejabberd-related book, but its not.

Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the &quot;privilege&quot; of being successful.

Weird and terrific."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Murder In Silverplate","review":"Standard Silver manufacturing firm is shook when Production Manager Frank Antonelli is found dead amongst the equipment. Murder occurred because it is impossible to have either an accident or commit suicide due to safety features. Detective Walter Henderson heads the initial official investigation, but knows he will be removed from the case because his estrange daughter Vicki Sanders is the Quality Control Manager at the plant.As Walter interviews everyone who could have had the opportunity to kill Frank, no one stands out with a motive though the old time manager was crusty and opinionated. Not long after Frank's death, someone murders company President Ed Cantrell, who was modernizing the business at a rapid rate. Over the objections of her father, Vicki makes inquiries with the help of another manager Mark Ross even as the police wonder if the homicides are the work of two different killers with the second indirectly encouraged by the seeming success of the first.This engaging who-done-it starts as a fabulous police procedural in which Henderson leads the questioning of several folks including his daughter, but after the second homicide turns more into a wonderful amateur sleuth. Fans of both sub-genres will enjoy the investigations as Walter cannot hide his impatience with several of those he questions and with his beloved daughter for leaving her husband. Vicki is also a fantastic individual as she investigates the crimes along side Mark. Though the final twist comes from out of nowhere, readers will gain immense pleasure with this solid murder investigative tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Sketch","review":"This book is terrific!

Strap yourself in and wait for the Final Witness to appear.James Scott Bell does many of the things that Grisham does so well: tight plotting, believable motivations, crackling dialogue. Like &quot;The Great Divide,&quot; by T. Davis Bunn, Bell reaches for the top rungs of legal thrillerdom and succeeds. The narrative is leaner and less colorful than Bunn's, but this only allows it to race faster.While working in some valid Christian themes, often based on legal examples, &quot;Final Witness&quot; tells the compelling story of Rachel Ybarra, a young paralegal working on a case against the Russian mob. The details of the courtroom seem well-researched, and the struggles that Rachel goes through--with her alcoholic father, her boss, her FBI friends, and particularly her nemesis &quot;The Man&quot;--move credibly to a very satisfying end with a few surprises along the way.Bell's other books are going to the top of my wish list."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"I'm not usually a fan of legal dramas, but then I'd never read James Scott Bell before. This striking, well-written novel will keep you turning pages well after lights out! Set in L.A., Final Witness deals with the Russian mafia, a subject I'd never read about before. Fascinating detail, well-rounded characters and colorful description are obvious trademarks of this author. But it is his fabulous dialogue that elevates this fast paced novel to a higher level of fiction writing. Should most definitely be a movie! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"I was not disappointed. James Scott Bell has written another intriguing book. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"This book had me hooked from the first sentence. It was a great read and I'm looking forward to Mr. Bell's next book! This guy knows how to keep his readers in suspense while writing well (excellent dialogue for example), and I learned more about the legal system without feeling like factual data was being crammed down my throat. I'd definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"Final Witness is a 'minor' miracle of tight plotting, compelling characterization, and crisp dialogue. Law student/intern Rachel Ybarra becomes embroiled in a thick intrigue involving the Russian Mafia, set in Bell's familiar southern California. These complexities provide plot enough for a we-know-he-done-it-but-will-he-get-away-with-it? suspense yarn. But Bell provides a rich subplot, the role Ybarra's Christian faith plays in the secular setting of courts, cops, and federal agents. Bell handles all these elements without playing a single false note. Read his novel for the fun of it, and then read it again to learn from a fine craftsman at work."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"Couldn't put it down. Every time I tried to, Bell would end a chapter with a cliffhanger where I would have to read on...and on... This book went beyond the court-room thriller (though it does that extremely well). It delved into the motives behind the characters, their moral dilemmas,and the common theme among all people--their search for purpose. Great dialogue, visual scenes...this would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"This book was fast-paced and difficult to put down. Parts were quite predictable such as the romantic involvement of two characters. It's a typical beautiful girl gets nice guy scenerio. They fall for each other too quickly and you're not sure who's pursuing whom.Wouldn't you like a story once in awhile where things don't always turn out happy? Where it's more realistic? Does the main character always have to be a hero?The main plot involves the Russian Mafia. Mafia-type stories are not my type of read, however, I've read one of Mr. Bell's books previously and that was really enjoyable so I gave this one a try.In this one, you'll see that the government can't always be trusted. It's too bad too, that the legal system isn't really righteous, although this book portrays it the way it is. The criminal is so often portrayed as the victim, and they are often victorious! It really depends on the judge, jury, circumstances, witnesses and your lawyer. Evidence is quite often dismissed.Anyway, yes, it is worth the read. Just expect the expected in places."},{"Title":"Final Witness","review":"The book was in very good shape and I was very happy with the price I paid.

This was NOT a keeper."},{"Title":"Kiddar's Luck","review":"Kiddar's Luck is an autobiography of a working-class man from Newcastle which focuses on his childhood. I was fairly new to autobiographies and Kiddar's Luck fulfilled all my expectations of the genre. It gives an interesting insight into working-class life without being too sentimental and does not alienate the reader from his experiences. There is something for all readers to idenitify with, male or female. I particulary felt drawn to his descriptions of playing on the streets as this was the only place he had to go. There are many amusing parts to the book of the antics that him and his gang get up to. There are also more serious issues raised about the lack of oppurtunities available to him, as a working-class boy eith a very limited education. Essentially though it is an enjoyable, easy read and gives an interesting historical insight into working-class culture at the beginning of the twentieth-century."},{"Title":"The Jiangxi Virus","review":"The amount of research that underlies this fast-paced novel is formidable. There are details that only an expert could know about such diverse subjects as: biology, weapons, aircraft, internal dynamics of organizations like broadcasting companies and government agencies.It is an education just to read about viruses. Fifteen known varieties of Hemagglutinin and nine of Neuraminidase. A flu virus has a lipid bilayer surrounding a single-strand 8-gene RNA genome---not the more robust double-helix DNA. And antibodies that protect only against subtypes that have not undergone &quot;antigenic shift&quot;. One of the scientists explains how to cleave a specific gene on the genetic map, involving 50:1 dilution of distilled water on a supernatant. Whew!Schlossstein is obviously extremely knowledgeable about biotechnology, but his writing style is not at all pedantic. Paragraphs and chapters are short and pithy. Dialog is sometimes minimalist, helping carry the multiple story lines forward at a brisk pace.Exotic and diverse venues add more spice to the intersecting threads of the story. The reader experiences total immersion into unfamiliar places and situations, but emerges with a sense of authentic &quot;being there&quot;.There are thought-provoking issues of defense, security, and international relations.

The root of this type of analysis started from the Greek 2000+ years ago with Sanguine, Choleric, Phhlegmatic and Melancholic.The original form of this DISC apporoach comes from William Moulton Marston 1926 book Emotions of Normal People.There are similar materials come in many form: COLOR CODE (HARTMAN), Personality Plus, and several other books.This is not to replace all the more-in-depth psychology tools that profesional use, but this is a simple approach to see different type of people and how we can be more effective in fast forwarding ourselves. We can also see others and learn how to make them better in their works.The book contains a simple test and the description of every type and the combination of types. It is very well written and accurate. Although i feel a bit \\"dry\\" on the style of writing, i am totally satisfied and find the book of a very high value.This is not a dense reading, and you can jump forth and back and see your/other people's type of personality and use it to our advantages.Anyone interested on how to \\"see\\" him/herself and the other and how to make best use of psychological approach toward different type of people will be able to benefit from this book."},{"Title":"The 4 Dimensional Manager: DiSC Strategies for Managing Different People in the Best Ways (Inscape Guide)","review":"The book is short and very good.

In fact, it states that:When one feels one is in an unfavorable situation, but that one has power to act, one uses \\"D\\"When one feels one is in a favorable situation, and that one has power to act, one uses \\"I\\"When one feels one is in a favorable situation, but that one has no power to act, one uses \\"S\\"When one feels one is in an unfavorable situation, and that one has no power to act, one uses \\"C\\"But many people will answer those questions consistently based on whether they are optimistic or not, and whether they have self-confidence or not. Starting in chapter six, the book also begins to label people making generalizations about how to manage each type of person.It begins to sound a bit like Marcus Buckingham's \\"Strengths\\" books (which I recommend instead of this book), saying your style is your strength and you should often play to it. But based on the definitions, it would seem like better advice would be how to reframe the situation to apply a more appropriate style. For example, in most high-risk situations, one needs to respond more like a \\"C\\" than anything else. Unfortunately in no part of this book did it talk about reframing the situation to encourage a style that would fit better. About the closest it came, was suggesting that some assignments are geared more for certain types (again, contradicting the earlier premise of not labeling people)."},{"Title":"The 4 Dimensional Manager: DiSC Strategies for Managing Different People in the Best Ways (Inscape Guide)","review":"This book is great.

It has a novel plot: Bond not on assignment, but instead the target of a global manhunt. It features some memorable and vicious villains, and a nice amount of plot twists.Gardner's writing is taut, and we're reminded here that the Bond of the novels may be as suave as the Bond of film, but is considerably more ruthless. He repeats Ian Fleming's classic description of Bond's features as containing a hint of cruelty. Bond's ordeal in this book brings the trait more fully out of him than in other novels.The first half of the book is particularly good in establishing tension. There are, perhaps, a few plot contrivances, but nothing especially blatant. I've read most of Gardner's Bond novels and would rate this very highly among them."},{"Title":"Nobody Lives Forever (James Bond Master Spy)","review":"Maybe if I were British I could appreciate the style of John Gardner. He never ceases to completely bore me. I have read all the Ian Fleming's and though they are dated and quirky and sometimes corny I had a great time with them, so it's unfair to criticize the less dramatic British style of novel. But frankly I can't believe this franchise continued under Gardner. I made sure to give myself sufficient time between them, taking four years to read the first five novels. That's it. I quit. \\"For Special Services\\" is as close as I could get to be entertained, and \\"Role of Honor\\" the least enjoyable. After my struggle to get through 80 percent of \\"Nobody Lives Forever\\" I am selling off the other nine I own. Life is too short. For anyone agreeing with me I would absolutely recommend at least the first three Raymond Benson 007 books. Read them in order. Each one gets better. After a seven year absence I'm ready to start these again."},{"Title":"Nobody Lives Forever (James Bond Master Spy)","review":"They are reprinting the John Gardner series of Bond books. I own them all and I really enjoy them. Gardner did a great job in taking 007 into the eighties. This was such a hard sell for fans of the books by Fleming. They changed Bond as well as being more PC in writing about other cultures and countries.The films also changed the Bond landscape and moved the character into a more gentle and comedic persona. I always feel that Gardner had his work cut out for him.In this story Bond is on a case were someone is killing former agents and it turns up to be smersh.I found this story fun and a page turner. Give John Gardner's Bond a read and you may be surprised at how well they are written"},{"Title":"Nobody Lives Forever (James Bond Master Spy)","review":"This story picks up where Role of Honour left off. Of Gardner's 007 novels, it is the 3rd which features Bond's battle against the criminal organization SPECTRE.Like my review title states, the book was an entertaining read. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up the earlier Fleming novels. Whereas the earlier novels were highly descriptive to the point you felt as though you were standing in the story, Gardner's novels are descriptive, but from a technical standpoint (he delves into details on electronic systems, etc.). I find Gardner's novels to read more like a text book whereas Fleming's read more like a travel brochure. I'm not trying to undermine either author at all by making that comparison, but it's the best comparison which came to mind.For my personal taste, I enjoy the Fleming stories more, but that's not to say these stories are not entertaining. I would still recommend reading this book if you are a 007 literary fan."},{"Title":"Nobody Lives Forever (James Bond Master Spy)","review":"I HAVE SEEN EVERY JAMES BOND MOVIE THERE IS TO SEE.

What really finally finished me off was the hostage scenario.Bond would need a hostage????The only thing more ridiculous than that is he not only takes her along, but he picks up her girlfriend?????HUH???When that happened I dropped the book back in the library slot, along with three others I had planned to read.I just hope Bond 22 is not based on something from Gardner."},{"Title":"Investing Bible","review":"This book covers EVERYTHING. In DETAIL. The hardest part about investing is that if you have little to no experience, you have no idea what questions to ask or what to legitimately expect. And when it's YOUR MONEY on the line it's best to know what to expect and to be prepared. This book is what every investor needs. It provides authoritative, comprehensive, and detailed information on how to invest successfully. It has no radical or wreckless financial strategies. This book covers everything. It covers; how to evaluate the professionals and their advice, to investing effeciently with regards to taxes, to family financial planning, to evaluating a stock, bond, annuity, or mutual fund on your own. The only gap in this book is that it does not cover nor touch on real estate investing. But, I am sure the author refrained from that topic as it is not where her expertise and experience lays. But EVERYTHING ELSE was covered thoroughly to the level every investor should demand."},{"Title":"Investing Bible","review":"This is another excellent book from Lynn O'Shaughnessy, who has a talent for writing about personal finance in a way that anybody can understand.The Investing Bible is going to save me a ton of money.

After I did, I decided to switch to low-cost funds, like index funds, as the author recommends.

I was also pleasantly surprised to stumble across a chapter that includes the latest ways to save for college. This book is truly a keeper."},{"Title":"Investing Bible","review":"Lynn O'Shaughnessy has written two books, 'The Investing Bible' and 'The Retirement Bible,' that complement each other and provide the reader with all of the vital information necessary for making sound financial decisions.

It made my job easier."},{"Title":"Investing Bible","review":"Seeing how many books on personal finance, investing and the road to wealth are out there, you can never be too sure who to believe in. I think this book is a great resource for the world of investing. It's not a get rich quick scheme, nor does it try to revoluntionize the way we invest. It gives solid and practical advice and clearly breaks down the different facets of investing as well as explaining what each one does and is. My only complaint is the book was written a few years back so an updated version would be nice. Also, would be nice to read about alternative methods of investing with precious metals, collectibles, and any other idea.The book is definitley modeled after books such as 'the complete idiots guide', ...'for dummies', etc...but honestly, if someone has the good sense to inform themselves on the world of investing, that doesn't make them a dummy, regardless of how much they know.

They also feature a romantic plot, which is linked (somehow) to the thiller plot. \\"North By Northwest\\" is almost a perfect MacInnes novel, except that it wasn't. But if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean.THE VENETIAN AFFAIR is one of her best, written in the peak of the Cold War and the peak of her career. A resourceful, intelligent amateur gets into a situation where a skilled agent would fear to tread, and then manages with luck and pluck to get back out again. Several of the characters are continued in THE DOUBLE IMAGE (a better novel, but only by the smallest of margins).Try it ... you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Venetian Affair","review":"This is one of Helen MacInnes two best novels. The story is dated, a plot to assassinate De Gaulle, but the writing is good and the descriptions of Paris and Venice make it fun. I like her novels because they bring the locations to life. If you are going to visit Venice, this is almost as good as a guidebook to give you the feel of the place. I am not the only Helen MacInnes fan to spend hours tracing the locations of her stories. The characters are well done and, as usual, there is romance and a happy ending. This is one of her best."},{"Title":"The Venetian Affair","review":"As a teen back in the 1970s, I couldn't get enough of the bestselling thriller writers of the day, and Helen MacInnes was one of my favorites. I remember THE VENETIAN AFFAIR in particular, mainly because I read it in Venice in 1975. Now, all these years later, I found a copy on Amazon and read it again, and guess what? It's still great! It's a lively, colorful story of international intrigue, with the good guys and the bad guys chasing each other all over the piazzas, back alleys, and canals of the most beautiful city I've ever seen.It's old-fashioned, of course; it's actually very dated. (At one point, the hero warns the heroine that the villains they're up against are much, much worse than Nazis--they're COMMUNISTS!!!) And the villains' diabolical plot (assassinating Charles de Gaulle) was done much better a few years later, inThe Day of the Jackal. But I can tell you with authority that you'll rarely read better descriptions of Venice. After I read it, I went looking for the actual locations in the story, and they all looked, sounded, and smelled exactly the way she described them. The hero is gallant, the heroine is lovely, the villains are nefarious (they're COMMUNISTS!!!), and the suspense is nonstop.Helen MacInnes was a big star in espionage fiction, but today she's all but forgotten. Her books are out of print, and that's a shame. They're great fun to read, and this one has a special place in my heart. If you can find a copy, try it."},{"Title":"The Venetian Affair","review":"Back to the cold war era, a cold war spy thriller, written cold war era style.

The book itself cannot be described as high literature, but it is the only account of these events I can find, and has the merit of being based on interviews with relatives of those who took part and records provided to the author by the Royal National Life-boat Institution. Whilst this account is clumsy the events it describes and the determination of the lifeboat crew are truly heroic and deserve to be better known. I personally believe this story would make a spectacular film.During one of the worst storms of the century a three-masted full-rigged ship, with a skeleton crew was caught in the Bristol Channel. The crew were unable to prevent the ship being slowly driven towards the rocky coast and sent up a distress flare at about 6:30pm on the 12th January. The nearest up-wind lifeboat was at Lynmouth, a tiny fishing village on the north Devon coast. Unable to launch their lifeboat from Lynmouth, due to the massive waves, the volunteer crew physically draged the boat up countisbury hill and down portlock hill, two of the steepest hills in England (1 in 4). The 14 mile journey to Porlock weir involved a team of 20 men and 18 horses. An advance party of 3 men was sent ahead with picks and shovels &quot;to widen the road!&quot;, remember this was a 14 mine long road. They overcame many obstacles during the course of the night; at one point they had to take the boat off its lanuching carridge and drag its 3 and 1/2 ton dead weight for a mile. during the course of the night they knocked down many walls and gates, demolished the corner of a house and felled a tree. All this activity occured during a major storm, just to get the boat to a place where they could lanuch it. At 6:30am the next morning they lauched the boat. They did not stop for sustinance. At this point the real work began. They rowed the lifeboat out the the forrest hall and stood by the ship until a tug arrived to tow her to safety. Some of the lifeboat crew boarded the Forrest Hall and raised its anchors as the skeleton crew were too exausted to do it themselves. The Forrest Hall and her crew were then safely towed to South Wales.In terms of devotion to duty this story is incredible. The lifeboat crew were all volunteers who had already completed a full days work when they were first called to aid the Forrest Hall. They did not sleep for over 36 hours. They must have been keenly aware that all their labors could easily have been in vain for they had no contact with the Forrest Hall for the 15 hours it took them to reach her. And yet, despite all their doubts and hardship they persevered and triumphed."},{"Title":"Rose Baboian's Armenian-American Cook Book.

There is something moving about the care taken by the father to teach his wunderkind son all that he knew. The father was with Jeremy Bentham the guiding spirit of the philosophical movement Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism was a mechanical kind of philosophy which thought it possible to measure the goodness of action by measuring the amount of pleasure against the amount of pain. Mill followed the path his father set out from him, adopted his father's values and social conscience and was already by the tender age of twenty a distinguished intellectual figure. But then he asked himself the question if the realization of all his social schemes and all the grand social ideals would bring him happiness. And he understood that it would not. He understood in other words that all this focus on outward good and action, on mechanical measures for human life was missing some vital component in life and in himself. Mill went into a great depression. What brought him out was the reading of the poetry of Wordsworth and the understanding that there is a dimension of feeling, a dimension of the inner life which is somehow more important than all the social thought. This did not mean that Mill abandoned the path of social reform but rather that he changed its direction. Part of this change had to do with his meeting his relationship with Harriet Taylor, his embracing in a certain sense of liberal ideas on the role of women in society. Mill found himself and continued on his intellectual path, a path which would lead him to produce one of the masterpieces of modern political thought, \\"On Liberty \\"."},{"Title":"Autobiography","review":"This AUTOBIOGRAPHY makes more sense than trying to learn anything. John Stuart Mill was born on 29 May 1806 and died 8 May 1873, already old and famous in England and Ireland about when the young Nietzsche became a professor and started publishing his early works. James Mill must have learned Greek so he could read the original version of the Bible when he was studying to be a Scotch Presbyterian minister, but he didn't become a minister. He started to teach is eldest son, John Stuart Mill, Greek at the age of three. The AUTOBIOGRAPHY pictures the father and son working side by side until the father was appointed to a post as Assistant Examiner of India Correspondence in 1819, often attempting to follow suggestions of David Ricardo (1772-1823). John Stuart Mill learned to compare the ideas of Ricardo and Adam Smith at such a young age that his ideals easily rose above levels of thought that would be considered common. \\"Believers shrink from every train of ideas which would lead the mind to a clear conception and an elevated standard of excellence, because they feel (even when they do not distinctly see) that such a standard would conflict with many of the dispensations of nature, and with much of what they are accustomed to consider as the Christian creed. And thus morality continues a matter of blind tradition, with no consistent principle, nor even any consistent feeling, to guide it.\\" (Chapter II. 1813-21 Moral Influences in Early Years. My Father's Character and Opinions).The most honest portion of the book is Chapter V. 1826-32 A Crisis in my Mental History. One Stage Onward. Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) had provided Mill with the desire \\"to be a reformer of the world.\\" \\"But the time came when I awakened from this as from a dream. It was in the autumn of 1826.\\" I consider this a modern intellectual reaction, and was most interested in his early attention to \\"The results of association.\\" . . . \\"the strongest possible associations of the salutary class ; associations of pleasure . . . intense associations of pain and pleasure, . . . But there must always be something artificial and casual in associations thus produced.\\" His activities continued, but \\"this is the only year of which I remember next to nothing.\\" Modern mass communication has surrounded us with so much stimulus that it is difficult to picture many people getting through their lives without having every year end up like that. Nietzsche had an early friendship with Wagner and numerous books to keep reminding him who he was or what he thought that he ought to become, but the biographies of those who have lived since then lack the basic significance that we ought to expect of anyone capable of changing the minds in the world since Albert Einstein became the great thinker.Chapter VII. 1840-70 General Review of the Remainder of my Life, provides many political points which are still worth pondering. Current politics in America strongly in favor of a rich aristocracy, mightily in favor of winning a war on terrorism in battles far from home, I consider possibly as short-sighted as the interest of England in supporting the Confederacy in Civil War in America. Here I should let John Stuart Mill explain:\\"But the generation which had extorted Negro emancipation from the West India planters had passed away ; another had succeeded which had not learnt by many years of discussion and exposure to feel strongly the enormities of slavery ; and the inattention habitual with Englishmen to whatever is going on in the world outside their own island, made them profoundly ignorant of all the antecedents of the struggle, insomuch that it was not generally believed in England, for the first year or two of the war, that the quarrel was one of slavery. There were men of high principle and unquestionable liberality of opinion, who thought it a dispute about tariffs, or assimilated it to the cases in which they were accustomed to sympathize, of a people struggling for independence.\\"\\" . . . when there occurred, towards the end of 1861, the seizure of the Southern envoys on board a British vessel, by an officer of the United States. Even English forgetfulness has not yet had time to lose all remembrance of the explosion of feeling in England which then burst forth, the expectation, which prevailed for some weeks, of war with the United States, and the warlike preparations actually commenced on this side.\\"John Stuart Mill did what he could to keep daily events from turning into a war which would have split the United States permanently. He was later lucky to be elected to Parliament even though \\"it was, and is, my fixed conviction, that a candidate ought not to incur one farthing of expense for undertaking a public duty.\\" \\"I said further, that if elected, I could not undertake to give any of my time and labour to their local interests. . . . I made known to them, among other things, my conviction (as I was bound to do, since I intended, if elected, to act on it), that women were entitled to representation in Parliament on the same terms with men.\\" He often won by being right on the merits. \\"My position in the House was further improved by a speech in which I insisted on paying off the National Debt before our coal supplies are exhausted, and by an ironical reply to some Tory leaders who had quoted . . . my \`Considerations on Representative Government,' which said that the Conservative party was, by the law of its composition, the stupidest party.\\""},{"Title":"Autobiography","review":"This book should have been called The Education of John Stuart Mill. Mill's autobiography is mostly about Mill's education which made him one of the greatest thinkers of the nineteenth century. Mill also discuses, in length, the influences he was subjected to during the years. I found the book to be interesting and rather revealing. Mill was educated almost completely by his dad. Just to give an example of how demanding his dad was, Mill started learning classic Greek by the age of three. By around the age of twelve he already taught his younger brothers and sisters. Like every great thinker, Mill suffered from a severe depression, where he lost all interested in life. Mill thought the reasons for his depression were the neglect of his emotions and feelings by his dad, who didn't regard \\"feeling\\" as something important that needs to be developed. Another interesting thing to note is the development of Mill thinking along the years.In conclusion, this book is recommended to people who are rather familiar with Mill's work and would like to expand their knowledge of Mill's education and how his thinking evolved during the years."},{"Title":"Autobiography","review":"Mill's remarkable childhood education prepared him to be one of the leading intellectuals of his day (far surpassing his father, James Mill, who was no slouch, but not in his son's league) but while I admire his erudition and achievements, one has to wonder if the deep depression he fell into in his mid-20s had something to do with that.Mill's contributions are better remembered than many of the other famous British intellectuals of the period--such as Herbert Spencer--whose particularly invidious version of the theory of Social Darwinism is best left languishing in obscurity. Who today remembers the prolific Spencer, whose collected works run to over 20 large volumes?Mill is frank about his depression and how debilitating it was, and what a struggle it was to pull through it. But with the help of his best friend, he pulled out of it and went on to write many important works in philosophy, logic, political science, and economics.Mill's I.Q. was certainly very high (estimated by psychologist Katherine Cox using a modified ratio I.Q. method to be at least 200), but very likely his father's misguided efforts to produce a prodigy and homegrown, British Wunderkind (to compete with the legendary \\"Infant of Lubeck,\\" no doubt :-)) were the cause of his long, serious depression.Mill's text on econonics, which was called Political Economy back in those days (also the title of his book, if I remember right), was the longest running and most successful college text of all time, being used for the next 50 years until the 1920s when the \\"New Economics\\" of the day, championed by the field of microeconomics and the theory of the firm, made a more modern, updated text necessary.For me the most interesting part of the book was Mill's theory of history, with positive periods of creative cultural development being followed by periods of negation and dissolution. Mill summarizes it as follows (I think I'm remembering the quote more or less accurately): \\"During the positive periods mankind adopts with conviction some positive creed, claiming jurisdiction for all their actions proceeding from it, and possessing more or less of the truth and adaptation to the needs of humanity; when a period follows of negation and dissolution, during which mankind loses its old beliefs, of a general and authoritative character, except the belief that the old are false.\\" Mills theory has parallels to the earlier Hegel's historical dialectic and later to Oswald Spengler's theory, and to later 20th century historian Arnold Toynbee's idea of \\"challenge and response.\\"For another more literary (and probably more interesting) take on depression by another British intellectual, you might try Richard Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy (not to be confused with the African explorer by the same name). After all, anyone who says that \\"Giraffes live for love,\\" not to mention palm trees, can't be all bad. :-)"},{"Title":"Autobiography","review":"In my estimation, John Stuart Mill is one of the great great geniuses in history. He is in that top echelon (from what I've read) right up there with Aristotle, David Hume, and Ayn Rand. There is alot to learn from reading his writing, both in terms of content, and most importantly, method. His approach is to see all sides, be open to new evidence, and honestly search after truth.In this concise 205 page autobiography, Mill gives us a mainly intellectual autobiography of his intellectual development and his writings, as well as the tremendous influence of his father, James Mill, and his wife and most intimate friend, Harriet Taylor. What I got it from it was a picture of a man constantly growing, constantly open to learning, honest, searching, willing to be fallible, and desiring to know the truth. I don't agree with some of Mill's conclusions concerning socialism and probably some others, but I have the utmost respect for the his reasoning ability and intellectual honesty. This book touched me far deeper than did Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography because while Franklin just seems to relate his own life and events, there seems to be more relection and insight in Mill. As someone who has only read \\"On Liberty\\" and \\"Utilitarianism\\", this is also a great introduction to Mill's thought because he discusess all his writings and he gives alot of background in terms of what was going on his life, in the times, etc...

Mill chooses not to share many narrative details of his colorful life, but instead focuses on the plethora of theories that shaped one of the greatest minds of his century. At times references to obscure works or persons can be tiresome as he &quot;gives credit&quot; to them.

Closely educated by his father James Mill he acquires an astounding knowledge of philosophy, economy, psychology and whatever one calls education at that time. As he says in the book, he was far ahead (25 years) of people his age. In all of his modesty (he thought he was only average in matter of intelectual powers)he lists that he began to learn Greek by 3, Latin by 7 and so on. The result for the Sociological Sciences was the work done in many fields and most notably in Economy and Philosophy. But, what was the outcome of all this to the man John Stuart Mill? Did he enjoy himself doing what he did? Did he find his father had educated right?Just read the book and find for yourself."},{"Title":"Autobiography","review":"I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it.

It was a simple and easily understood concept: those who have more give some of their wealth to those who have less. Humanitarianism describes this personal level of voluntary aid to lessen the suffering of others, be that as a result of systemic poverty or of natural or man-made disasters. Unless the humanitarian crisis is close to home, the individual's commitment to help is channeled through a myriad of aid organizations operating in the affected region or country. Complementing the work of international agencies (UN, Red Cross, NGOs) is the CHARITY OF NATIONS: governments directly engaged with the other players in the \\"humanitarian enterprise\\". However, governments do not operate selflessly. While, their main responsibility is for the well being of their citizens, they may be very reluctant to have \\"outsiders\\" interfere in their affairs. In the donor countries foreign policy interests always intrude on their humanitarian response to emergencies. As a result the simple concept of charity has become highly complex in modern times.Smillie and Minear present a thorough and substantial analysis of the multifaceted issues that drive humanitarian assistance. They reflect on the changes in the relief, aid and emergency \\"business\\" since the Cold War. They discuss in some depth the new approach used since 9/11: increasingly, humanitarian demands are being balanced with security concerns. Other novel trends, they explain, are the increasing commercialization of aid delivery and the difficult relationships between military personnel and aid agencies. The definition of aid agencies as \\"an extension of security forces\\", promoted by the US administration in Afghanistan and Iraq, has exposed humanitarian aid workers to more dangers than ever before. For many, it has put into question the NGOs' claim for neutrality as they operate among the different sides of the conflict and the essential non-political character of humanitarian aid in all circumstances. On the other hand, aid agencies have not only become executing agents for official government aid programs, they also rely on the increased security maintained by the military in crisis countries.The authors offer detailed case studies of humanitarian crises, such as Sierra Leone, East Timor and Afghanistan, to exemplify the range of responses by the international players. They expose the wide ranging difficulties experienced in each scenario. Summarizing the divergence between assertions and practical applications, they identify systemic problems in the humanitarian enterprise as it is currently implemented. All players, whether governments, UN agencies or NGOs, they each have their own approaches and perspectives, the authors state. They even vary in their definition of the commonly accepted humanitarian principles. For the recipient governments this multitude of actors is highly confusing. Such confusion, among other reasons, is leading to mistrust and antipathy. Often it seems that, in particular, the local NGOs are overlooked by the international actors. Those groups, though, \\"for all their weaknesses offer the best long-term hope, also in terms of prevention\\", assert the authors.Three levels of emergencies are being distinguished, with the first level receiving extensive attention and support worldwide, such as Afghanistan, Iraq or the very recent Asian emergency following the tsunami. The second level is treated with a modest, often lingering response and describes most of the \\"traditional\\" humanitarian crises. The third level can also be termed \\"the forgotten\\" disaster or emergency. Many African crises, whether as a result of natural or man-made disasters, fall into this last category. Unless the country is strategically important to donor countries or attracts media attention, or is just \\"lucky\\", very little humanitarian assistance and support will be forthcoming. The authors observe that non-government international aid agencies, themselves dependent on donor contributions in their home country, are also limited in the range and level of support they can offer unless the emergency moves into the media limelight, which the authors term \\"the CNN moment\\". One can name the Ethiopia famine in the 1980s as one such example.The authors criticize the weaknesses of the international humanitarian system that allows such uneven response to human disasters. The right to humanitarian assistance should be consistently and equally applied across the globe. They argue in favour of a new humanitarian crisis management system with a \\"strengthened multilateral core\\" and agreed upon guidelines and principles. Such as system would move towards a new way of financing the response to humanitarian crisis as well as the fundamental next steps of reconstruction and development. They stress that monitoring effectiveness and accountability will have to become essential components of future aid delivery.Smillie's and Minear's study, based on years of research and field work by the authors and the \\"Humanitarianism and War Project\\", extensive interviews with many players from diverse relevant agencies, represents a major contribution to the necessary debate on \\"Humanitarian Action in a Calculating World\\", the subtitle of the book. Despite the difficult and at times technical subject matter, it is written in clear language that is accessible to the interested non-specialist reader. The book is a must for all those engaged at any level with international humanitarian action, policy makers and practitioners. Those concerned with improved systems for sharing resources and expertise between the richer and the poorer countries will find the proposals for increased accountability and monitoring the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance thought provoking and compelling. Detailed notes, relevant statistics and a selected bibliography assist the further research.

The Makioka Sisters is about four sisters living in pre-World War Two Japan. The sisters are from a Samurai family which is declining in fortunes. Two of the sisters are married and spend most of the three books trying to get the other two sisters married. The book really allows us to see Japanese daily life, from interaction between families, worries about employment, the traditions, the holidays, the fashions and even problems a normal family had. The book, funny enough, got the author in trouble because it was about nothing. It neither attacked the government or military nor did the book support or help the national war effort. It was thought of as a waste of paper.The chronology in the front of the book is very useful to understand what is happening during the author's life. If you want a taste of Japanese life, this is it. But it isn't a bus or train book. It is 498 pages of small print, complex plots and twisted sisters. Not easy, no matter how much you love Japanese culture. But worth it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This book holds a very special place in my reading history. It opened my mind in the subtlest of ways. It is a book about the meeting of cultures, east and west, and to my surprise neither side wins. Tanizaki shows that blindly revering the past can yield fatal results, but so can blindly flying into the future. Tanizaki's sentiments lie somewhere inbetween. The novel is longer than most and moves at a pace which reveres eastern tradition while assimilating western forms, in short, this is a perfectly poised work that does not sacrifice anything to short term gain nor martyr itself for some unwinnable cause. Tanizaki is a master at a game that his whole culture is (and less obviously ours) is playing. Neither way is completely correct and neither way wrong. The characters in this magnificent novel all walk in between. In some ways the novel belongs to the twenties in which it was written, in other ways it belongs to us."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This is a sweeping view of a changing Japanese aristocratic and domestic life. As everyone else has said, it's a long book, and it's not flashy, but its characters are enigmatic and real, and after you have read it you wish there was more.

It is probably a cultural thing but I feel it could have been edited to a short story. And should have been.

I could not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"I am somewhat reminded of Willa Cather's works in that there is not any real action or deep plot but boy is there a lot of story. Unlike Cather, however, The Makioka Sisters spans a relatively few years in the lives of its characters. The whole plot, if you can call it that, revolves around trying to get the third of four sisters married. The problem is that Tanizaki could have made the story half as long or twice as long as it is. Unfortunately, he chose the latter. However, it is well written and an easy read. Although I did enjoy most of it, I began getting impatient about 100 pages from the end. Tanizaki must also have thought it was time to wrap things up as he seems to have rushed things at the end trying to wrap up loose ends.

A wonderful portrayal of a society through a tiny detailed snapshot. I especially enjoy the sympathetic character of the second sister's husband, as it is rare to find such a thoroughly likable man in a book primarily about women."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"The Makioka Sisters (Sasame Yuki, Light Snow), first published in 1948, was written by Junichiro Tanizaki (1886-1965). Tanizaki wrote The Makioka Sisters after translating the Tale of Genji into modern Japanese and the Murasaki novel is said to have influenced his own. It tells of the declining years of the once powerful Makioka family and their last descendants, four sisters. It has been translated by Edward G. Seidensticker in 1957. Powerfully realistic, it mourns the passing of greatness while celebrating in wonderfully evocative detail the beauty of a particular time and place, Osaka in the 1930s. In its creation of beauty out of sadness it can be compared to another family saga, The Maias (1888), by the Portuguese master Ea de Queiroz (1845-1900).Why is this long book, largely concerned with trivial family procedures, one of the finest novels written? It is not concerned with great events, causes or philosophies. It has little concern with the war Japan was fighting with China, and then the USA, when the book was first published. Indeed its characters don't think about the war, and in a positive way, which doesn't trivialise their concerns at all (most people in fact don't think about the reasons for a war: perhaps it's better that way). This doesn't mean the book is escapist or superficial, just as the concern with women's lifestyle, dress, makeup, etiquette or social vanity make it something written just for women (books and films were once made - by men - to capitalise on what were considered women's 'little' concerns). Tanizaki does that wonderful thing a great artist can do, he finds the universal in the most exact examination of the particular, and makes a work of relevance to us all. Read another family saga, The Brothers Karamazov (1880) and my candidate for the greatest novel yet written (though I'm more than cynical about the word 'great') and marvel at the many routes artists find to the universal.My review is impossibly partial: The Makioka Sisters is the most beautiful novel I've ever read. The language (translation) is so smooth and flowing, the characters and situations so gentle and muted, yet precise and meaningful, that reading the book is like seeing the universe in a drop of water - you see, which is moving, and awareness of where and how you see brings amazement and then a real pleasure.In this beautiful book the characters have a greater degree of reality than many real people - Tanizaki is a great master of characterisation. I know more about them than I do about most of the people I know. It is done by the accumulation of enormous amounts of detail, but detail which, trivial though it may appear, is just right. The result is the creation of a most ethereal and delicate beauty, a lovely world crumbling to extinction yet all the more precious because of its inevitable passing away.Sachiko, the second sister and her husband Teinosuke are that rare achievement, a convincing depiction of really good and admirable people, though in no way heroic. They are very ordinary people, but their goodness, their little troubles and worries, their faults, even weaknesses, all serve to charm and captivate. Of all the characters in the book these two are the loveliest. It is a real affirmation of humanity to have created two such kind and gentle and sensitive people, and to have made them so real and convincing.The careworn life of Tsuruko (first sister), the hesitations of Yukiko (third sister), the unhappiness of Taeko (Koi-san, fourth sister) all gain from contrast with the stability and happiness of Sachiko and Teinosuke. And what an evocation of the old ways of Japan. Changing rapidly even as Tanizaki writes of them.Detail by detail - Etsuko's games with the German girl Rosemarie, Itakura's leather coat, the 'old one', Koi-san's mimicry and mingled love and resentment of Yukiko...there are literally thousands of details. Teinosuke's love of Spring in his garden, the vitamin injections the sisters take, the forthrightness of Itani - all, everyone, is so precise, not random at all, chosen to evoke mood, reveal character, show milieu.So powerful and evocative has the book been - yet nothing really happens, except to Koi-san. The war approaches, the old Japan changes, Yukiko gets married - unforgettable!I've seen advertised a TV serialisation of The Makioka Sisters, but can't imagine how it could succeed. So much of the book's effect is through language. Visually, certain scenes stand out, such as the cherry blossom viewing or the flood. The narrative though is largely uneventful, small actions that dramatically and convincingly reveal a character's state of mind, early history or personality.Written with love, a strong love of people and place, the book creates love in the reader. Because of Tanizaki I have loved Osaka in the late 1930s and have learned to treasure and respect its people. For those hesitating to undertake reading such a 'Japanese' work as The Makioka Sisters there is the perfect bridging novel The Wind-up Bird Chronicle (Nejimaki-dori kuronikuru, 1995) by Haruki Murakami, which does mention the war - and Charlie Parker and 'hard-boiled' detective stories and Jungian archetypes and the surreal: a roller coaster of a novel and one of the best as well."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"The Makioka Sisters is a special novel for two reasons. Much of Japanese literature this century is very taut and relatively short. One thinks of Soseki, Mishima, Dazai, Kawabata and the two most important of Tanizaki's other novels, Some Prefer Nettles and Diary of a Mad Old Man. Instead of being 150-200 pages, this book is around 500 pages. The popular description of this book, about a merchant family in decline, might imply a book like Budenbrooks. Yet this book is very different from Thomas Mann's fine novel. For a start it only covers four years, not a couple of generations. More important the theme of decline is not a primary one, and Mann's theme of cultural enervation is absent.What we have instead is a book that seeks to be a work of &quot;photographic realism.&quot; It seeks to be &quot;real&quot; not in the sense that Flaubert or James or Tolstoy are realistic. Instead of portraying complex themes and ideas while keeping an eye on what would be actually plausible, Tanizaki seeks to describe what actually happens. This sort of realism is not highly valued since it is often unimiginative and often psychologically shallow. And indeed in this book it can often appear tedious and unrewarding. But a closer examination reveals certain virtues.In a sense Tanizaki's book is &quot;like life.&quot; The story of Taeko of of the youngest sister who cannot marry because custom dictates she must wait for her older sister Yukiko to be married. The story of her two possible fiancess and the eventual pre-marital pregnancy appear, not as part of a complex, organic scheme as, say, the story of Anna Karenina, but as a series of discrete events, moved often by coincidence and chance. A flood becomes a crucial event, one character is killed by a quack doctor, Taeko becomes ill with dystentry at a crucial moment, a proposal is botched because Yukiko cannot summon the courage to answer the telephone. Since this is often how life happens it is not unrealistic and indeed has a special value of perspective.Tanizaki's sense of style and detail are also interesting. For example there is little on food (by contrast one remembers the Christmas dinner in Buddenbrooks). There is the Japanese emphasis on the intense aesthetic absorption in a taut, sparsely described expression of nature. Two of the leading incidents in the book describe watching cherry trees bloom and having a firefly hunt in the night. At one point Sachiko, the second sister and the most important one in the novel, watches her young daughter and her German friends plays with dolls and the German girl accurately tells where babies come from. It is interesting that Sachiko approves of this realism.Most interesting is the fact that this book takes place from 1936 to 1940, during, of course, the Japanese invasion of China. Tanizaki itself stared writing the book during the second world war, and his publication was delayed on the grounds that it apparently did not help the war effort enough. It was not actually published until 1948, when Japan was occupied by the American occupation. How much did this change the political tone? Perhaps not as much as one might think, since the Makiokas write their German friends that they are pleased that their ally is doing so well in the summer of 1940. Yet at the same time the absence of ideology and fanaticism is striking. The Makiokas naturally agree with the austerity campaigns, they refer to the invasion as the &quot;China Incident&quot; like everyone else, and they vaguely wish for peace. This is not unrealistic per se (the Makiokas are probably too old to worry about conscription) and the absence of politics is also not unrealistic. After all women did not have the right to vote at this time. Before commenting on how the Makiokas have escaped the trap of ideology, and before making comparisons to Jane Austen, one should consider while reading this novel the idea that such privatism is essential to such a regime. Instead of totalitarianism smashing individuals and transforming themselves into empty masses, one should consider the insights of Rudy Koshar and William Sheridan Allen that regimes feed off this sort of privatism and political isolation."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"THE MAKIOKA SISTERS tells the story of the lives and relationships of four sisters in the late 1930's and early 1940's in Osaka, Japan.

It is the responsibility of Sachiko and her husband Teinosuke to find a suitable husband for Yukiko, who must marry before Taeko as custom dictates.The book takes us through several years in the lives of the Makioka family (curiously, since there were only daughters and no sons, both sisters' husbands took the name Makioka), as they experience the joys and disillusions of life in an extremely close-knit family. As their wealth and prosperity wane, they realize that you sometimes must make sacrifices.It was wonderful to read this book knowing that not only was it written by a native Japanese, but that it was also written in that time period, in the early 1940's. Knowing that every description and every conversation was authentic made this an amazing book.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has an interest in Japanese customs, society and way of life. It was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"The first time I read The Makioka Sisters, I called it \\"fragile and lovely.\\" Recently, I read it again. It's not really fragile and lovely. Actually, it's very matter-of-fact. The narrative mostly recounts events and the characters' reactions to the events. There isn't much description or imagery, like in Kawabata. Even big events like the Osaka flood are recounted straightforwardly, with precision instead of lyricism.But the book is very perceptive about its characters. Tanizaki knew everything about the social class of the Makioka family. The book is full of countless trivial little details about their daily habits, mannerisms, styles of dress and conversations. For example, during one of the family's attempts to marry off the third sister Yukiko, the prospective husband is concerned that she seems moody, and the whole family tries to dissuade him in writing and on the phone. Tanizaki perfectly captures the frantic, businesslike quality of the negotiations, simply by describing their arguments at length. He is so perfectly attuned to the routine of a family of this class that, just by describing it, he can recreate a whole period of history. And his extensive knowledge of small details also makes the narrative very lively, and often funny. The book moves slowly, but I found it addictively readable, both the first time and now.The book is much more than a period piece. It captures the superficiality and transience of a sense of closeness between people. The four Makioka sisters are surely very close to one another. They've been together since they were little, and they get along very well. The three younger sisters live under the same roof until they're all well over thirty. Basically they're each other's closest friends. And yet, the second sister Sachiko has no idea whatsoever about what goes on in her youngest sister Taeko's life. She spends much of the book misinterpreting Taeko's motivations. Taeko also remains friendly towards Sachiko throughout the book, which of course does not in any way prevent her from telling Sachiko nothing of her inner thoughts.Similarly, Sachiko has a very good husband, by any standard. He's very capable, treats his wife well, agrees to support her sisters even though there's really no good reason why he should do so, and engages in self-sacrifice when the situation calls for it. Sachiko should be very close to him, and their marriage is overall harmonious. But their relations are \\"comfortable\\" more than they are \\"close.\\" Sachiko is closer to her younger sisters than to her husband, and we already know the real value of that.The oldest sister Tsuruko grows particularly estranged from the others, since she lives separately from them and also has the formal duty of managing the family. Possibly the most touching moment in the book is a tiny episode in which Sachiko visits Tokyo and goes to the Kabuki without inviting Tsuruko to come along. And Yukiko is the most \\"traditional\\" of the sisters, but she's not particularly fragile. Actually, she's the most physically resilient. And in the ending, she rewards her family's efforts in trying to find a match for her by acting grumpy and aloof toward everyone. Tanizaki subtly points out that she comes to be excited by the prospect of marriage, but what makes this observation so amazingly accurate is that she's excited by the prospect itself, not by any individual man.All this is perhaps the root of the feeling of \\"fragility\\" that I had when I first read the book. It is true that Tanizaki's characters are members of a declining noble family, and that the setting is just before World War II. We know that the Makiokas' comfortable lives will shortly be obliterated, and this is poignant knowledge. But the true \\"decline\\" in the book is not so much one of material wealth or social standing, because Sachiko's husband is still very successful, and Yukiko can still find an attractive match, and hey, their chances of surviving the war are as good as anyone's. The true \\"decline\\" is in the way the book gradually reveals that its characters are not really all that close to each other. Furthermore, it suggests that this particular decline is not a product of modernity, war, or lack of tradition, but rather that it is simply the natural state of things."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Junichiro Tanizaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; (MK) has been hailed as a classic of postwar Japanese literature. In style and content, it resembles Naguib Mahfouz's masterpiece of Egyptian life, &quot;Palace Walk&quot;. The novel relates how the once grand Makioka family clings desperately to the past as it copes unsuccessfully with its declining fortunes and social status, and the encroaching tide of modernity. The Makioka sisters' growing desperation is evocatively captured in their endless shuttles between their beloved hometown Osaka and the increasingly dominant but alien metropolis Tokyo, and in their many failed attempts to marry off the third sister, Yukiko, which according to Japanese tradition, must precede any marriage proposal for the rebellious youngest sister, Taeko. I lost count of the number of miais the unenthusiastic Yukiko had to attend because they all ended the same way. In rejection and tears. These repetitive events that lead to dead ends give the novel a claustrophobic edge, though this has a tendency to wear the reader down. Written in flowing prose and plain narrative, MK offers a richly textured picture of a crumbling order, a society in transition as it begins to take in foreign influences ranging from western fashion to a working lifestyle for women. It is also a time of war and upheaval around the world. Non-Japanese readers may be amused by the plethora of Japanese rituals (eg, the meddling of matchmakers and the customary investigation into the social background of suitors, etc) and their stylised manner of speech and thought, but that's the way it was and to some extent is today. Osaka and Tokyo are metaphors for the old and the new. The Makiokas reveal their parochialism when they complain endlessly about the inferior lifestyle they have to suffer in Tokyo. As a family epic, MK is strangely less than compelling. The plot is static. It goes nowhere. The novel's lack of momentum may not be incongruous with its own artistic ambitions but is ultimately tedious. Characterisation is on the whole shallow, though Sachiko, the second Makioka sister through whose eyes the story is told, is pretty solid and comes to life. So does the rebellious black sheep sister, Taeko. MK is an important but not always engrossing read."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"As in &quot;Buddenbrooks,&quot; we are introduced to a bourgeois family in decline, and through them we enter deeply into their society, so different from our own--and both societies, Germany in the late 19th century and Japan just before World War II, are about to undergo tremendous changes. And as in Jane Austen, the plot is propelled by the search for a husband, in this case for the third Makioka sister. This book is absolutely enthralling. It's long, but the pages fly by."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Amen to the reviewer who compared this work to Pride and Prejudice. After the first chapter, all I could think was that Jane Austen had been reborn as a Japanese man named Junichiro Tanizaki. This work is intelligent, subtle, and carefully observed. I especially enjoyed the distance Tanizaki kept from his main character, Yukiko. We only understand her from the viewpoint of other characters in the novel--but despite her silence, she dominates the story."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Tanizaki set out, during the war years, to write a book like The Tale of Genji, in tribute to what was best about the Japanese past. The amazing thing is, that he succeeded. He was able to transfer the spirit of the Japanese masterpiece (which is also a world masterpiece) in modern times and delicately describe a whole civilization which had really been destroyed, even before the war was lost, in the dreadful militarism that caused the war in the first place. This book is beautifully written. As other readers have noted, it does go slowly. So does War and Peace. So do a lot of the other novels that really make you think about life, and love and important issues. The book echoes the leisurely pace of the Makiokas' lives and is very nostalgic--but it is realistic too and does not depict the old society as perfect. Each sister has her own, fascinating character. They do not easily fit into stereotypes. Particularly interesting to me is the character of Taeko, the youngest 'modern' sister who will not (or cannot) behave like her more decorous sister Yukiko, the perfect 'traditional' Japanese woman--who can't get married. Taeko behaves very badly by the standards of her time--and very normally by our standards today. It is interesting to see the tension, and the ways in which her behavior affects everybody around her. Not only are the sisters interesting, but there are many very wonderfully drawn secondary characters, like Saeko's cultured husband, and the foreigners, the Russians, the German family with the two children--Just as interesting as the people though are the customs and the culture. There's cherry-blossom viewing, and a firefly hunt and descriptions of how to wear kimonos and many very wonderful descriptions of Taeko's traditional dance-- It's all a whole different mindset than the way we live today. Really civilized. And yet, at the same time, the Japanese army is committing the horrific atrocities in Nanking--I would read this first, and then Genji, if you haven't done that (you'll really go back to another time). Also best, I think, in the Seidensticker translation.Someone who likes this will probably also really like In the Shade of Spring Leaves, a translation of the stories of Higuchi Ichiyo, along with a biography of a fascinating woman who died way too young."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This has to be considered Tanizaki's masterpiece. It is a beautifully written, deliciously observed tale of the decline of a privileged upper middle class Osaka family, told through the lives of four sisters. I have read this book three times and learn someting new each time. It is a thoroughly modern story with elusive and ghostly antecedents. Although the tale takes place only 60 years ago, on the eve of pre-war Japan, it describes a world now vanished. Tanizaki's writing is fluid and clear. His description of Kyoto during cherry blossom viewing makes me sorry I've never been there at that season. The sublety Tanizaki brings to the emotions and motives of each of the persons attending Yukiko's many miais is amazing. Unfortunately, the film of about a decade or so ago doesn't do the book justice. Thank you, Tanizaki-san, for giving us the Makioka Sisters."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This book offers a wonderful glimpse into the pre-war life in Japan among aristocratic women. Four sisters, Tsuruko, Sachiko, Yukiko, and Taeko struggle to maintain the family honor and to construct satisfying lives. This is made especially difficult by Yukiko's inability to find a husband and a tradition that prohibits younger sisters from marrying until the older sisters marry. Addictively engaging, this book takes the reader to Japan to spend some time living in the Makioka sisters' world."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Just read it!

I found it tedious, and horribly boring. The author failed to make me interested in ANY of the characters, let alone care about what happened to any of them. The pace is horrendously slow, painfuly descriptive, and at times confusing about who is who. There is practically NO dialogue, and character development is entirely narrative if there is any. All the reviews I've seen so far just seem to be shallow regurgetations of people who were told the book was SUPPOSED to be good. It boggles my mind how &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; won ANY awards at all. It is more of a rambaling history of every little thing that happens to a family who you really get no attatchment to at all, wether the details are relevant or not. If you insist on reading this book, check it out from the library, and save yourself some money."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"I bought this book because Min Jin Lee, authore of \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" identified it as one of her favorite books (along with more well-known Western classics like \\"Vanity Fair\\" and \\"Jude the Obscure\\"). \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" \\"Vanity Fair,\\" \\"Jude the Obscure,\\" and \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" are all \\"novels of progress\\": they follow a protaganist (or, as in the case of The Makioka Sisters, a family) through social class struggles; these novels are about oppportunity, lack of it, economic reality, and personal dignity.I find The Makioka Sisters to be a less than compelling novel. The central question, \\"Who will the third sister marry?\\" is just not very interesting; the young woman seems completely uninterested in any of her suitors, and they in her. Marriage is nothing but a way to secure social status; the only things that matter about the suitors are age, any previous marriages, existing children, salary, employer, and family status. None of them seems particularly passionate, opinionated, funny, ambitious. None of them has any discernible personality.The Makioka sisters are similarly bland and lifeless. None of them seems to have been touched by sexual desire (except possibly the youngest sister, whose scandalous romance, a family embarrassment, is referred to as a social liability for the family and not as a glorious fling or a fulfilling passion).None of the sisters seems to want anything out of life except to cling as much as possible to the prominent social status their family once enjoyed. None of them seems to love their husbands or friends or children. They seem to desire only \\"proper behavior\\" from those closest to them. The remote possibility that a woman might actually want something for herself is hinted at in the youngest sister, who has a bit of a career of her own, a little spending money, and possible secret liasons; but her main job is to contain her indiscretions in the margins of her sisters' more formal and acceptable lives.Honestly, I love Henry James's novels, so no one can accuse me of needing a fast-paced plot, or a lot of steamy sex, to stay interested in a book. I can be hooked by beautiful writing alone. But the main characters in this book are so stiff and lifeless, and the things they care about so dead and hollow, that -- despite my admiration for Min Jin Lee -- I just can't stay focused on it. I keep picking up other novels, and then trying to force myself to get back to this snooze-fest.The only thing about this book that I can recommend is its anthropological value. In The Makioka Sisters, you learn curious details about the bizarre vetting process to which prospective brides and grooms subjected each other in 1930s Japan. At one point, a suitor thinks the prospective bride looks thin and pale, and worries she might have TB, so she submits to a chest X ray to prove that her lungs are clear. Then her fmaily hires an investigator to find out more about the suitor's family, discovers that his mother is senile, and calls off the match because of \\"insantiy\\" in his family.This intrusive, clinical, ruthless approach to matchmaking is completely unlike anything I've encountered in Western culture. The notion that you might want to like your spouse, or at least tolerate them physically so that you can have sex and possibly children with them, does not even appear on the horizon (except obliquely, in the form of the concern that the suitors not look too much older than the bride). The Makioka Sisters is a curiosity, sort of like The Tale of Genji: something you read just to get a glimpse of how other cultures play the mating game.But if you want a great read, go buy Free Food for Millionaires."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"When taken into context of the environment, this book does afine job of portraying the demise of the aristocratic class.

The characters belong to an upper class family, and are concerned with appearances, understated refinement, and tradition. Scenes such as the cherry blossom viewings and the firefly hunt are given as much importance as great floods and miscarriages. Although the characters have great depth, they are still not quite accessible--they belong to a different age and class, and float before the reader like a painting on a silk screen. Although the themes of encroaching modernity and falling family fortunes are forever in the picture, in the end it is tradition that has the happy ending, modernity that has her hopes crushed. As other readers have remarked, this is a significant shift from Naomi, where the \\"modern girl\\" is the clear and decisive victor.In many ways, The Makioka Sisters is a full-length novel version of Tanizaki's essay \\"In Praise of Shadows.\\" Few pages go by without a mention of traditional elements of Japanese culture: poetry writing, architecture, nature, dance, etc. None is a casual reference; all have layers of nuance and undertone. Still, there is the feeling that Tanizaki has Traditional Culture win the battle but lose the war, for he--like us--knows that Japan has lost World War II and the elegant world he has created will not survive the following decades of strongly Western-influenced modernization. The youth and beauty of the Makioka sisters and their world is to scatter in the wind like the petals of so many cherry blossoms.Captured best in the scene where Sachiko lies awake watching a lone firefly play about in her kimono sleeve before she lets it go, the book is a reminder that there is no such thing as true timelessness. The Makioka Sisters is very much a story about a family, a nation, and a culture on the brink of violent change. This book will reward readers with the insight and patience to savor every detail and contemplate every nuance. Tanizaki's masterpiece, this book deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"I was never sure, to be honest, whether I would ever get through this book ... but I'm glad I did! What started off as a slow read turned into a delightfully quick one, until I finally realized that I was so entrenched in these women's lives that, like all great books, I just didn't want it to end.

I bought it because of a quote I read somewhere that it was the Japanese version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I don't know if that is true (it is more complex) but it certainly held my attention. I think the other reviewers have admirably covered the plot so I will just add a few comments. You feel like you are living with these people - even though it is an entirely different culture. And I was intrigued by the insights into that culture. The names are of course a mouthful for Westerners but fortunately in the beginning the book lists out all the main characters and their positions. In the beginning I was constantly referring back to that list but soon didn't need it. My only problem was envisioning all the beautiful descriptions, particularly of clothing (like kimonos and even western dress), and their hair and the rooms. So I went to NetFlix and found they had a 1983 Japanese film which I immediately got. It helped me a great deal even though it completely changed some of the plot. The book is much better than the film (which seems stilted and artificial to us today) but still I enjoyed the contribution that the film made to my insight. Now I want to look up more of Tanizaki's writings. I would love to see a sequel to this book to see how these characters managed in 1945.... I will look to see if any of Tanizaki's writings cover that period. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"A really fine, hypnotic piece of writing.

How the two navigate the vicissitudes of the Japanese wedding dance is instructive and interesting. Sachiko's youngest sister Taeko is the rebel, trying to run away with one profligate beau before settling on a man of a lower class. When he dies, she rebels again, ending up pregnant by a lowly bartender.The book is concise and is very interesting in how it deals with class.

The subject of decline of clans seems to be transcultural.The Makiokas have had their best years. Now they are struggling to keep up appearances. Main plot driver is the attempt to find a suitable husband for sister #3. Yukiko is nearly an old maid already with her (initially) 27 years. Proposals have been declined in the past, and now expectations need to be adjusted downwards. Sister #4 is also unmarried, and she has unusual ideas of being financially her own boss, with a doll business and ideas of learning designing/ dress making and dance teaching.Does this sound like a recipe for lengthy boredom? It is lengthy, ok, but to me it never reached a stage of boredom. It is a beautiful piece of prose, which must be partly due to the translator, Edward Seidensticker. The interesting historical period adds flavor.The time at the start being 1937, it is amazing how far away from politics the text stays, which is a statement in itself. The ladies of the family can't be expected to bother with such things. It seems unseemly to even mention them.Sister #4 is a bit of a rebel and has made friends with a foreigner, a White Russian woman divorced from an Englishman. This leads to a most amusing and interesting dinner party between some Makiokas and the Kyrilenkos. This is the first time that China and other unpleasantness are even mentioned, after nearly 100 pages into the 500! The Russians raise the issue of the so-called Xian incident, of December 1936, when Chiang Kai Shek was abducted by a regional warlord with the objective to press the nationalist government into a more focused fight against Japan. (CKS was, it appeared, more interested in the civil war against the Communists.)On page 111 sister #2 reads in a newspaper that Japanese carrier based units have bombarded Swatow in South China. That is the first time that we learn that Japan is at war. The whole aggression against China is euphemized as The China Incident. The first person who says, explicitly, that Japan is at war, far into 1939 now, is the Makiokas' German neighbor. Trust these blunt Germans to tell the truth, these uncultured beasts!Tanizaki was a master in pinpointing the intricacies of dos and donts of his protagonists' social world. You don't look the world into the face or even the eyes, it is unseemly! We get a walk through the world of marriage arrangements, and a lot about the Japanese version of a caste society into the bargain. We spend time with people who fear nothing more than the disapproval of their peers. (How I hated that attitude at home!

Four sisters trapped in the gap between traditional Japanese mores and those infiltrating from the West. Each of the sisters comes to life with the authors wonderful descriptive language. Much is left to the imagination, however, in keeping with his theory that the reader MUST participate in the effort with the author and not merely sit back passively.

Mr. Tanizaki has drawn the characters of the Makioka family with great care and precision. I sat bolt upright when he first puts Yukiko together with her domineering little niece Etsuko, a scene that perfectly illustrates the personalities of both characters with subtle directness. At that point Mr. Tanazaki had an attentive reader and so I remained. It is said that this is a \\"novel about nothing\\" but that couldn't be further from the truth, it's about life as perceived through the eyes and experiences of one family, principally the four sisters. Life is often about nothing much, I suppose that's why we have the desire to read. The writing has a beautiful ethereal quality, I am reminded of fog or mist or cigarette smoke and yet at the same time it is robust and gripping. The details of the city, Japanese arts, kimono and nature are superb giving great ambience and sense of place. The pace is leisurely but a sense of urgency is implied through the nerve wracking task of getting the recalcitrant Yukiko married off and the knowledge of the cataclysm of war that is lurking but never delved into. I suppose this is a work for a particular audience that can revel in the slower pace of sixty plus years ago in a tightly confined social structure but Mr. Tanizaki rewards the reader again and again with flights from the ordinary into the sublime.

At the same time, the melange of ingredients, which include marriages with and without love, intense scrutiny of the tiniest processes of day to day living, gentle (and not so gentle) satire, the Osaka/Kyoto flood, is unique. At some point you realize that what appeared to be a novel of manners, with an omniscient narrator is an entirely subjective chronicle from the viewpoint of one character, and she's charming.

However, these wartime preparations are a bare glimpse in the background as the four sisters involve themselves with family life and, specifically, the marriages of the two younger sisters. According to tradition the fourth sister cannot marry until the third sister marries and much of the 540 pages of this book revolve around her marriage proposals. Her younger sister, however, has already tried to elope but the family has stopped that and she is asserting herself by going into the business of making dolls and leaving the confines of the house each day to go to work. These two sisters live with the second oldest sister and her husband and young daughter. They have been upper class in the past but their fortunes are now dwindling. However they still live in a household with servants and a degree of elegance in Osaka. The oldest sister and her husband and six children live in Toyko. They are considered the head of the family and need to be consulted on all matters.With an eye for detail, the author creates this world in a way that made it easy for me to relate to. He takes us into the world of arranged marriages, filial devotion, various illnesses, a torrential flood, the decline and decay of traditional Japanese culture and the evolving preparations for war. All this is told against a background of descriptions of everyday life and the sense of how these siblings take care of each other. I was totally drawn into the story, identified with these sisters and found myself understanding their way of life. I loved reading this book, didn't want it to end and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Considered Tanizaki's best novel, this work has been called a textbook of Japanese behavior. The author began writing it around 1942-3 in the midst of World War II. Magazine publication in installments was banned after the early chapters were judged insufficiently supportive of the war effort. The work was finally published in book form in 1948, a few years after the war's end. The English translation came out in 1957.The novel began in the late 1930s among a formerly wealthy merchant family from Osaka and ended around 1940, before the outbreak of war with the United States. The family consisted of two married sisters, with their husbands and children, and two younger, unmarried sisters. Much of the novel dealt with the family's concerns about finding a suitable groom for the third sister and determining whether the fourth sister should be allowed to travel abroad, take up a trade, and continue meeting a suitor from the past. There was seemingly endless description of these two concerns, mainly from the second sister's point of view.Determining a proper marriage candidate for the third sister meant endless rounds of negotiation with each successive prospect. Each point of discussion was passed up through the hierarchy of the family ranks for decision, with soundings carefully taken of everyone's potential reaction, and any eventual decisions that resulted then passed back down. Any unexpected development restarted the cycle. Throughout, it was essential to show outward respect for the proper forms, maintain the face appropriate to one's place in society and keep the family's name unsullied. The sister herself, the one on whose behalf the entire family was working, showed the least interest of all in tying the knot and was content to remain dependent. Given all this, it was no wonder she was long past marriageable age.With the fourth sister, by tradition her conduct was regulated by the family of the first sister. The family heads were so stuck in the past, however, that their decisions for her bore little relation to what realistically she needed to do. Ready to marry, she wasn't free to act until a groom for the third sister was chosen. The second sister, her go-between within the family, sympathized with the predicament but wished to avoid a family upset. This meant endless thinking about how to divine everyone's true motives and spin discussions, avoiding confrontation while protecting the family name. And continued reproaches to herself or others -- thought but unexpressed -- for hesitation or lack of proper consideration. What happened in effect was continued avoidance of any clear resolution until too late, when events forced the family's hands, so to speak.The author was skilled at setting up contrasts between the actions of the two younger sisters or the two older sisters, and at establishing situations where a character would condemn another for something and behave later in a similar way. When action on a larger scale occurred from time to time -- a flood, a medical crisis -- his powers of description were memorable. And the irony of the conclusion, after the family's endless consideration of its good name, was very pointed. Not to mention the irony of having the novel conclude, after more than 500 pages, with hoped-for events still in the future.At the same time, what I could appreciate was affected eventually by the book's seemingly interminable proceedings. One wondered sometimes whether the author was intentionally drawing out things to the point of parody. I also had trouble figuring out exactly where the author's sympathies lay. With Teinosuke, the second sister's husband? Not with any of the four sisters, it seemed, most of whom were described from the outside, none of whom received compassion unmixed with mockery. The characters were almost entirely closed to each other, rarely if ever sharing their deeper thoughts. And how class-bound they were, so much of the time.For reasons like these, I didn't enjoy the book all that much. Another novel read recently that was set in the past and focused on the lives of women -- The Doctor's Wife by Sawako Ariyoshi - with a far narrower scope, less mastery and much less detail but with clearer, unalloyed compassion, was preferred."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Others have commented that this book is slow-going, which I can understand--there certainly isn't a great deal of what you'd call 'action,' in a Hollywood sense--but on the other hand, I found it an amazingly effortless read; pages would simply melt away at an astonishing rate. It's very much a novel after the manner of the nineteenth-century (though it's probably best to avoid Jane Austen comparisons, which, though superficially appealing, ultimately don't really work very well): no modernist jiggery pokery (not that I have anything against that, necessarily), just a straightforward narrative of things that happen. One sometimes forgets how effective this can be, when done well.All this notwithstanding, perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel is its ambiguity: out of the three sisters (the fourth, Tsuruko, being a very minor character, although this does also apply to her, to an extent), only one, Sachiko (the novel's de facto protagonist, I suppose), is made entirely psychologically comprehensible by Tanizaki. Taeko and Yukiko remain to a large extent mysterious throughout. I find that the glib characterizations of them and other major characters in the Vintage edition to be very misleading: nobody in the book can be so easily characterized. Even Taeko's old flame Okubata, who the reader is likely to quickly write off as 'total jerk,' is ultimately given the benefit of the doubt.One thing that may seem strange to some readers is the way that world events of the time are understated. The novel takes place in the years leading up to World War II, concluding at the end of 1940. However, in spite of occasional references to Hitler and \\"the China Incident,\\" there is little effect on the lives of the Makiokas, and insofar as they are aware of these things, they remain undemonstratively, naturally, loyal to their country and their allies. This, of course, is nothing more than self-evidently realistic, and I certainly hope nobody would be deranged enough to condemn them for it. People have to live their lives; it's not as if the US hasn't been involved in its share of ignoble wars (hmm...can we think of a current example?). Tankizaki may be subtly critiquing this behavior, but it never becomes more than an undercurrent.At ANY rate! This is nothing like my preconception of what Japanese novels are supposed to be like was, based on reading Mishima and Kawabata. It is, however, excellent in its own right. If you want something a little more circumspect than your average novel (whatever THAT beast would like!), go for it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"The war in Asia is already going on, and Pearl Harbor hovers on the horizon. The readers are very well aware of this, as was Tanizaki. The book was published between 1943 and 1948. To the Makioka sisters, the war is still very distant, though. The concerns that are urgent to them are of a more everyday character, not least important the matter of finding a suitable husband for Yukiko, who is past thirty. That we have this knowledge about the future will probably make the final chapters of the book seem heavy with irony to most readers.The fortunes of the house of Makioka have been declining for some time. The junior branch, the family of Sachiko (the second sister) and her husband Teinosuke, nevertheless lead a comfortable upper middle class life near Osaka. The younger sisters prefer to stay with them. Sachiko is the center of the story, insofar as it is told mostly from her point of view. The events, however, revolve around the two younger sisters, Yukiko and Taeko. There is drama and some tragedy, but much of the book simply records fairly undramatic events in the lives of the Makiokas in the years leading up to the Pacific War. Above all, the story conjurs up a world that was already disappearing at the time of the story - and was soon to be in flames. I would describe the book as bittersweet.To me, The Makioka Sisters was not exactly a page-turner. It took me more than a month to read all 530 pages. It was, however, a highly engaging book, beautifully told and easy too read. I never felt bored."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This is a portrait of an upper middle class family attempting to preserve its status is a changing world. Junichiro Tanizaki tells the story with sympathy and humor. Two of the four Makioka sisters married while the family wealth and status were in tact. Sister #3 must be married before sister #4. This marriage and required investigations and negotiations haven't gone smoothly. As the family fortunes decline, the delays in finding a suitor for sister number #3 and the lifestyle of sister #4 decrease the marriage value of both.Tanazaki pays attention to detail in his portraits. He notes the accents, the kimono, jewelry, injections, small talk, superstitions, who sleeps soundly, the size of the rooms, guarded and unguarded discussions with and about the servants, and the formal letters which exchange greetings, pleasantries and heavy verdicts.Some of the best parts relate the inner thoughts of the characters and how their thoughts incorporated what they presumed to be thoughts of the others. This is best done with Sachiko, as she cares for her sisters, dreads telling her husband of Taeko's troubles, navigates the judgment of the \\"main house\\", gets pressured into a miai for Yukiko or a punishment for Taeko. You think you know a character like Yukiko, but mid-book you learn why she rejected her first suitor, you hadn't suspected it, but it fits right in and you think ahhhhh.After the \\"main house\\" moves to Tokyo, you can feel the out of touch patriarch making colder, more detached decisions for the others. Were this a meritocracy, Tatsuo would never be heading this family. Teinsuke cares for three Makioka sisters supposedly due to geography, but clearly he does it because he's the better man.The book has the stuff of everyday life such as memorial services, dance lessons. waiting for others, seeing a former suitor on a train, inane dinner conversatons, and huge efforts that die on a \\"missed\\" telephone call. It also has the Japanese aesthetic appreciation: the Kabuki, the cherry blossoms, firefly hunts and the curiousity about the west.Current events are a backdrop such as the Chinese \\"incident\\", Okubata's interesting \\"opportunity\\", and German friends return to a country at war. The economy is taking a toll on the family fortune at the \\"main house\\" and a military contract benefits the others. At this time, Japan has been opened to the world for 3 generations and class structures are rigid. There is a anticipation that there will be a war and the characters seemed resigned to it. They have no positions such as \\"pro war\\" or \\"anti war\\" or any \\"fight for the country\\" fervor.This book isn't for everyone. To appreciate it you need some background (not a lot, but some) in Japanese culture and sympathy for people trapped by the social conventions of their times."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Not having read many Japanese novels, I cannot agree or disagree with those who argue (and there are many) that this is the greatest Japanese novel of the twentieth century. That said, it took no more than two chapters to convince me that Tanizaki was onto something remarkable.The novel's theme is highly recognizable--an aristocratic family, fallen on hard times, desperately clings to family mores that are at increasing odds with a changing society--but Tanizaki's handling of this and other themes is original in its humor and detached irony. Tanizaki is never pious, never over-earnest, and his ability to treat the family's frenzied attempts to marry off the respectable third sister, Yukiko, often had me clutching my sides. Impossible to forget Sachiko's obsessions over the dark spot on her sister's eye (she is convinced that the spot is responsible for spoiling her sister's prospects), but equally hilarious are the descriptions of Katharina's eccentric Russian family, Koi-san's and Yukiko's attempts to avoid the Tokyo \\"main house,\\" and O-Haru's negligible hygiene All this is written in a style that is a paragon of simple elegance, subtlety, and enviable vividness.Many reviewers have made much of the novel's few references to political events, with some even arguing that \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" offers a rebuttal to the authoritarian regime of the 1920s and 1930s. I disagree. The momentous issues of the day--the China Incident (translation: a skirmish that would escalate into one of the bloodiest wars of the twentieth century), German and Japanese military ambitions, and the beginning of World War Two--are danced around, alluded to, almost avoided. The Makiokas go about their mundane business while the world goes to pot, and this explains, perhaps, why we care about them so much: we, the readers, know that the world will soon tap them on the shoulders - and hard."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"The primary emotion that I felt during the reading of this novel (at least the first time) was impatience, slowing building to a combination of irritation and finally incredulity. Why won't the \\"main house\\" in Osaka drop its pre-occupation with rank? Why won't the unmarried Yukiko show some decisiveness? Why doesn't Koi-san actually rebel and break free, rather than go through the charade of submission, deception and clandestine affairs? Why won't the well-meaning, practical Teinosuke take charge? When will the sisters have a mature relationship between themselves?Perhaps this is what makes the novel so good; out of the initial irritation comes understanding of the characters and a reluctant, grudging empathy. They have their own reasons for doing what they do, their own philosophy of life and the reader is encouraged to replace judgement by understanding. Interspersed in this family drama (which could probably have been placed in any culture) is an interesting backdrop of Japanese-German relations as war-clouds are gathering and the typical understated Japanese reaction to the tragedies of life, death and birth."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"Reading \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" is a bit like taking a long train journey on a local train that stops at every station. Tanizaki's novel, the story of four sisters of a once affluent family that has fallen into decline, moves along at a leisurely pace for most of its 500 pages. The novel is set in the years 1937-1941, a tumultuous period in the history of East Asia, yet events barely intrude. One hears of Japan's aggression in China as merely \\"the China incident,\\" and December 1941, has more to do with the impending betrothal (after many disappointments) of the third sister, Yukiko, than it does with the onrush of war.This is a book that is set mostly within the walls of the Osaka household of the second sister, Sachiko, and her husband, Teinsuke, with whom the two unmarried sisters, Taiko and Yukiko, live. The eldest sister, Tsuroko, and her husband, Tatsuo, run the \\"main house\\" in Tokyo (the branch of the family with which decisions about money and marriage lie). The realism of the novel lies in its inclusion of intricate detail: a spot that appears and disappears over Yukiko's eye; the choice of restaurant for a \\"miai\\" (a social gathering to assess the suitability of a couple for marriage); the type of medications Sachiko carries in her bag; the type of dress (western or kimono) a sister is wearing, and so on. So minute is that detail that it may leave a reader who is unfamiliar with Japanese culture quite unhappy by the time yet another \\"miai\\" for Yukiko commences.Yet when the family goes forth into the world, in its circumscribed way, there are scenes of great beauty---of firefly watching, cherry viewing, Fuji-gazing. And this world IS circumscribed, so much so that the three sisters who live in Osaka never adjust to Tokyo (and indeed, their small disasters happen there). Every minute the Osaka sisters spend in the capital reminds them of how provincial they are; ashamed of even of their \\"western\\" accents, they are relieved to return home. Although modernity has crept into the sisters' lives(a phonograph, the films the narrator often mentions by title, cigarettes, permanent waves),they are still often startled by the brusque certainty of some of the more modern women they encounter, with their smart western clothing and lacquered nails. Within the family itself, it is Taiko, the youngest sister, who struggles the most with this tension between modern and traditional ways, and thus is is she who wears western dress with the most ease, while, paradoxically, she is a skilled practitioner of traditional Japanese dance.The last scene in the novel is set on the train that is carrying Yukiko, the third and most \\"Japanese\\" sister, toTokyo for her marriage, at long last, to a dissolute aristocrat; his connections, the family hopes, may lift the Makioka name to some of its former luster. Even here, the novel moves as slowly as it ever did. There is no grand denouement, and the story closes on the most intimate and mundane of details. However, by this point, the accumulation of bits of information about the world at war has gained force, and it seems to carry the Makioka sisters straight into a long dark tunnel from which one knows they will not emerge unchanged.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters (Borzoi books)","review":"This story, primarily set in Osaka, spans a period of four years (from 1937 to 1941). This period, is a tumultuous period for Japan, and we view it from the perspective of one family. The Makioka is a family in decline and after the death of the parents, the husband of the eldest daughter adopts the Makioka name and becomes the head of the family. There are four sisters: the eldest is Tsuruko, married to Tetsuo (a bank employee); Sachiko, married to Teinosuke (an accountant); and the two unmarried sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, who live with Sachiko and Teinosuke.Tradition dictates that Yukiko should be married before her younger sister, Taeko. Tradition also dictates that unmarried sisters should live with the head of the house. Some traditions, it seems, are easier to ignore than others. A number of attempts to marry off Yukiko fail: Yukiko herself, seemingly passive in many ways, exerts considerable influence from the shadows. Marriage to someone at some stage is seen as inevitable but Yukiko does not seem enthusiastic. In the meantime, Taeko is trying to live her own life.This is an amazing novel. The shifts in fortune for the Makioka family, the changes within Japanese upper-class society, and the influences of the Western world all shape the story. On the face of it, this novel is about the minutiae of the lives of sisters during a period of four years. The turmoil of Taeko's life, the attempts to arrange a marriage for Yukiko and the challenges faced by the careworn elder sister Tsuruko with both social standing and family to maintain contrast with the comparative happiness of Sachiko's life. The detail of the lives of the sisters provides an intricate view of upper-class Osakan life immediately before World War II: tradition and obligation as well as moments of great beauty.

Earle Ellis, in this comprehensive volume, sets forth criteria for finding \\"Pre-formed traditions\\" in the New Testament. This is merely the logical outworking of twentieth-century NT scholarship. He follows Jeremias, Brown and a host of others in identifying \\"hymns\\" and other pre-formed pieces in the NT, which as Ellis claims stems from four missions. This book is another in Ellis' small collection of essays/books which focus upon literary criticism. His views on Midrash have been rightfully dismissed by many scholars. There is very little new in this book (he even reprints a few older essays) but I suppose it is a good synthesis of conservative NT scholarship. It must be read critically."},{"Title":"The Making of the New Testament Documents","review":"The book is based on several years of research; fresh and insightful. Dr. Ellis introduces the reader to the development of the New Testament Canon. He argues forcefully that, from the beginning, the early church accepted the books of the NT as Scriptures. The NT Documents were widely circulated in various Christian circles in the first century. For instance, Jesus' teachings were likely accepted at an earlier period. For, \\"They were of necessity used by his apostles in their 'kingdom of God' missions since it was his message and not their own that they preached\\" (34).Prof. Ellis insists that from the earliest time, apostolic traditions were orally communicated, written, and transmitted by the apostles themselves. Such elements contribute heavily to the formation of the New Testament Corpus; particularly the four Gospels. The authenticity and authority of such documents were no doubt accepted as the \\"Word of God\\" by the earliest Church. (1)\\" Both the Gospels and the New Testament letters are attributed to persons in the same or related apostolic circles. (2) Both are, in part, products of a corporate enterprise in which an apostolic figure as the leading contributor and overseer is aided by and uses traditions composed by others. (3) Both give indications that their traditions were composed by the same or related circles of highly gifted pneumatics, that is, apostles, prophets and teachers\\" (Ellis, 33).We can comfortably trust the New Testament and embrace it as the Word of God; not because scholars declare it to be so. God inspired fallible men to write \\"The Infallible Word.\\" It has God for its origin and Author. The providence of God guided and preserved the entire process. That is, the formation, development, and transmission of the NT Documents."},{"Title":"The Making of the New Testament Documents","review":"Ellis's study here of the New Testament is a tremendous feat of detailed scholarship, taking in several types of historical evidence. Using such categories as pre-formed traditions, vice and vitue lists, and secular history sources, Ellis compiles an impressive amount of convincing evidence to show that the major works of the New Testament had early first century origins--certainly well before the Fall of Jerusalem (70 a.d.). In this regard, he is in agreement with other eminent scholars such as Harnack, Robinson, Thiede, Wenham, et al.This book is aimed for the university person. At times its use of the Greek or the German, for example, can frustrate an ordinary reader. But as a source for scholarly articles and books on both sides of biblical controversies, Ellis's work is a gold mine. It can lead one into a lifetime of reading on early first century Christianity. Many pages contain extensive bibliographies offering sources that cover various approaches to an issue.For those sceptics who rely on loose and unsupported cliches like, \\"The Gospels were written several decades after the death of Jesus,\\" this careful and compendious study by Ellis leaves them looking a bit arbitrary and uninformed."},{"Title":"The Making of the New Testament Documents","review":"Dr. Ellis, research professor of Theology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, is outstanding in this volume. He has brought more credit back to American theologians. He is well respected in Europe (mostly Germany where he studied) as well he should be. This work is the total sum of important background as to the formation (author, date, recipients, and purpose) of ALL of the New Testament Books. A must for any pastor, preacher, teacher, or general student of the Bible. A word of warning, this is not for the casual reader of the Bible. Have a background in formal theological education (such as Greek, Hebrew, Theology, etc. . .) or have a very good ability to look up words in a dictionary. This book is nothing less than stupendous.

So far as we know, the New Testament came about as a result of the selection of various biblical books to be combined into one publication.But still we are taught in our early Sunday Schools that these books, and only these books represent the word of God. We overlook the fact that the original books would have been written in a variety of languages: Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic (presumably the language in which Jesus spoke), and probably others such as Egyptian, Latin and others. We overlook the fact that King James had part of the Bible rewritten.The author goes further to say that the books of the New Testament appear to have been written by more than one person, a committee if you will. This is based on studies of the books themselves in terms of their history, writing style, vocabulary, etc.The book certainly presents a different viewpoint that is most interesting."},{"Title":"Old time fiddle tunes for the Appalachian dulcimer","review":"I just reciently started playing mountain dulcimer and I bought this book to help me learn a few songs.

Others have adopted some of her techniques, but Storyteller ranks as a classic work of Native American and American literature--and a great read."},{"Title":"Storyteller","review":"Leslie Marmon Silko's book STORYTELLER is definitely unique, both in its physical presentation and content. Physically, the book itself was printed lengthwise, or horizontally, as opposed to a regular book, which is printed vertically. The words within, when written in prose, are printed vertically in two columns. However, STORYTELLER is also unique in that it also contains poetry, though perhaps not in a form you are used to. Silko also included pictures, which she describes as being connected to the stories.I was required to read sections of STORYTELLER as part of an English 200 course. It was unique in the sense that it contains many stories, which were orally passed down by the Laguna Pueblo people for generations before finally being written down. The stories were not used by the Laguna to reprimand tribe members, or teach them a lesson, but rather to give them inspiration and sometimes provide them with the origin of a particular tribe custom. The stories illustrate the concepts and beliefs of American Indians, specifically the Laguna people. I was also required to write a paper on this book tying the cultural ideas of the natives to the stories. When writing this paper, I included some concepts of the Native American people, which readers can see within the poems and stories. Here are some you can pick up in the stories contained in STORYTELLER:1) The concept that the universe is unified, and no being or object is above another. There is no hierarchy of supernatural, natural, and humankind in Native American beliefs like there is in Western, Christian beliefs.2) All beings have the power to create. Animate and inanimate objects are directly related to each other, and often appear one.3) Symbolism in Native American theology is not the same as symbolism in Western culture. The symbols of the native people are literal metaphors; they are not similes, and do not stand for something. For example, you will read about the Buffalo People and Spider Woman. The buffalo ARE the people and the spider IS the woman. There is no \\"like\\" here. Native American symbolism articulates reality.4) Cyclical time. The Laguna do not measure time in a linear way like we do. Every is continuous, including the seasons. Thus, their stories can not be pinpointed to one moment in time.5) Lack of emotion. The Laguna people do not mention emotions in their story like we do. You will not see a story stating, \\"The woman felt happy,\\" and if you do, it shows the Western influence of Silko's Aunt Susie, who articulates these stories. Native Americans feel as though emotions are personal, and to imitate the emotions of others trespasses on personal integrity.Naturally, there are many other Native American beliefs expressed within the stories, and I found picking these elements out fascinating and surprisingly quite enjoyable despite my extreme dislike when it comes to writing a literary analysis. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Native American people, or someone who enjoys something different from \\"normal\\" literature.If you are purchasing this book for school, and need to write an essay on it, or if you are reading this for personal enjoyment and don't understand the stories/poems, I suggest taking a look at the following essays, which will explain what goes on in Native American literature:Paula Gunn Allen's essay \\"The Sacred Hoop: A Contemporary Perspective,\\" contained within STUDIES IN AMERICAN LITERATURE: CRITICAL ESSAYS AND COURSE DESIGNS. I read pages 3-22, which was very helpful in understanding this book.Leslie Marmon Silko's essay titled \\"Language and Literature frrom a Pueblo Indian Perspective,\\" contained in YELLOW WOMAN AND A BEAUTY OF THE SPIRIT: ESSAYS ON NATIVE AMERICAN LIFE TODAY.

The first thing that strikes me about STORYTELLER is the way the book is formatted. Normally, the reader shouldn't pay attention to it; it generally has ntohing to do with the book. However, in STORYTELLER, it is a signal to the audience that this collection of writings is going to be personal, and based on the importance of oral tradition. The text flows around the page as if it was spoken word. Intimate family pictures compliment various stories for a very personal feeling......unfortunately, many of the stories didn't live up to my expectations. While some stories, like the title story, were interesting, many were too vague to me, as a cultural outsider, to understand. I wasn't really connected with Tony and his friend in the story of the oppressive state trooper, after they start to believe he is an evil spirit. I start to look at it in an overly critical way because I wouldn't say the officer is possessed, I would reason that he's simply racist. This is definitely geared toward those interested in Native American cultural studies, but not necessarily appealing to the general public."},{"Title":"Storyteller","review":"Silko has no shortage of opinions to share, mostly on how her people have been put down through the ages. She's not wrong -- Native Americans have indeed been done a great deal of dirt through the years -- but her style is accusatory and confrontational, not likely to win many converts to her cause.

Contrary to one reviewer, the section on yoga philosophy is short and to the point.The section on yoga teachers and styles can be very useful in helping to decide what yoga style you might wish to explore.The section (the bulk of the book) on yoga postures is adequate but unexceptional. The descriptions are ok, but the photos are small and not especially clear. No variations are shown for advanced practicioners or for those with limited flexibility.There is a brief description of yoga props, but no information on how to incorporate them into your practice.The section on sample yoga routines is mediocre.This book is best as an inexpensive supplement to a good yoga class or video tape.

And then, after it was transcribed, they went to work on it.If you are a stickler for details, this book will provide them.

Those who have read anything from 2 + 2 publishing understand that the foundation for poker is based in probability and expectation. It is for that reason this book is not an easy read. It is a textbook. It is very effective one at that. Sklansky goes beyond the fundamentals to provide insight into specific plays that produce positive mathematical expectations in a variety of circumstances. This book is for the person who is looking to study the game of poker and become a better player. It will not fit the guy who is looking for the fast, easy way to do... well anything.If you are new to the game or are still fine tuning the basics in your home game (counting outs, understanding pot odds and position play) I recommend investing some time in some other books before this one."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This book is extremely good for gaining a solid foundation of Texas Hold 'em. I read it on and off for around 6 months and realized that while I learned some valuable lessons and picked up important bits of information I need to read it over and over again to truly take in everything that is being said. For me it is like a good movie that you see once and figure you saw it all only to watch it again and pick up something new, then a while later watch it again and see even more that was missed.I highly recommend this book for students of the game. This is essential reading if you want to compete seriously. Even if you think you know it all and the book makes sense, read it carefully and understand that many serious players have read, re-read and learned significantly from this and the other classics. It will help your game."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Hold 'em Poker for Advanced Players is simply the best single volume study of Hold 'em as it is played today that I have ever read. It is endlessly informative, rich in detail and illustrations, complex in its treatment of complicated concepts, and insightful in every important way. It omits nothing of any importance to the game.The book begins with a consideration of general starting hands requirements, adjusted for playing style, position, etc., and follows through on the play of each, as well as general considerations for each type or class of hand, and its relation to the innumerable factors impacting expectation or the play of other. Once this analysis is dealt with, Sklansky deals with a whole series of more individual or isolated cases or concepts and miscellaneous topics. The important details considered are too many to list here; Hold 'em played well is an enormously complex game, and Sklansky addresses it from every angle.Sklansky's writing style is very dense. He does not blather on about his personal experiences, drop names, or chat; he instructs in the style of a particularily dry math or statistics professor. He is direct, thorough, and exhaustive (sometimes exhausting). You will not read this book in one sitting and become a professional caliber player. You need to play, then return to the book and read much of it again; upon doing so the reader will find, again and again, that now he finally really understands some new concept. It is a work of extremely subtle and complex analysis.Nobody playing Hold 'em for money today can do without this book."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I really am not a fan of the reviews, but I feel that I have the obligation to recommend this book because if you read it, you will understand better the others players' game, and the best of it you'll get a big edge over them."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is a great book by the original expert in Texas Holdem, David Sklansky. After learning the basics this book is great for teaching the finer details and less obvious nuances of the game. It's a must for anyone who's serious about learning Texas Holdem."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"The most updated version of the book is excellent for all forms of play in Hold'em. This book is primarily designed for the more skilled games, $10/$20 limits and up. However, the updated version (1999) has a wealth of information about playing against less skilled players you find in lower limit games ($2/$4, $5/$10, etc).This book is clearly for advanced or at least experienced players only. Beginners will not take much if anything from this book! It's pretty clear it builds off a few books more toward the beginner, which I haven't read. If you aren't experienced at this game, check out the more beginner level books. The concepts in Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players are extremely complex. Most notably, many of these concepts are very subtle in the book. They're very easy to pick up if you are a solid Hold'em player. But if you are new to the game, they'll be difficult to pick up and much of the wealth of information in this book will be completely lost.This is must read information for anyone who wants to play this game at any serious level and win money."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This book is definitely the deepest reflexion on poker strategy, tactics and techniques. Anyone playing in 10-20 and over should study this book with attention. In lower games some of the tactics presented are yet too much sophisticated. I highly recommand it for any serious player !"},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"It's important to understand that this is a textbook, not simply a casual read or handbook. The information is presented in a manner that is to be studied, not skimmed. I've talked to some people who were very disappointed in this text. They told me it didn't give them tips or rules to use when they played, which they expected because everyone speaks so highly of the book and say it is one of the best. Simply put, these people were not advanced players and they just didn't have what was needed to understand this text.Sklansky approaches the game from an analytical stance. He teaches you about concepts, not specific situations. He presents you the theory of how to make good decisions, he doesn't teach you how to walk into every game and win. Sklansky repeatedly reminds you that if you make more good decisions than bad you will come out ahead. The text explains to you how the game is about odds, rather than luck or emotion. It gives you the information you need to understand the game from a mathematical and statistical standpoint. If you instantly feel queezy when thinking about those things, this probably isn't the book for you (yet, anyway). If on the other hand, you're able to handle intense analytical rhetoric, definitely get a copy of this text, it will blow your mind and you'll likely see the game in a completely different perpective.Before getting this text, really evaluate your abilities. I liken it to the following: Let's say you are a diehard CSI fan. You know what tests they use, what type of things you can DNA from, and how to play slueth. But, do you think you would be able to pick up a text on advanced molecular biochemistry or molecular genetic assays and be able to understand the theory covered? You might be able to pick up a little here and there, but overall you'd likely think the text was jibberish that made no sense to you. That's alright though, you aren't trained in forensics or molecular biology. You haven't studied it for several years so a book written at such a high level would logically not make sense. Poker for Advanced Players is much the same. Most people can't pick up a text aimed at a graduate or professional level when you've only taken a few introductory courses.Does this mean that you will never understand? No, it just means that you need back up and start near the beginning. You need to train you're mind to think a certain way.However, if you are seeking quick and easy tips on how to win more money this probably isn't the approach for you. There are plenty of books available for those kinds of tips."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This review is a direct response to the review written by Gamboler. It is clear that Gamboler has little knowledge of expert play and is most likely a member of the huge army of loosing players! I have read Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players so many times I have wore out the pages and the cover. And let me say that I beat my game for two big bets an hour using the concepts in this book. This is the best book ever written on Hold'em, cosequently, and serious player or potential serious player really need to read this book."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Noone can maintain this book is well written. It is 'organized' in a chaotic way, and the writing style is terse and somewhat boring. However, the reason to give 5 stars to this book is that it gives an enormous amount of information (compared to books that are much easier to read such as Lou krieger's books), and the information is accurate. Time and time again I noticed that after thinking about some issues for a long time I finally arrived at conclusions that were already written down in this book.You have to read and reread and reread this book to get everything out, because it is too much to digest at once."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I just recently started playing poker, and in less than a year I am a consistent winner at any medium limit holdem that exists. I play 3-6, and I play 30-60, and I owe my winnings to this book. The stategies discussed are nothing short of brilliant. The only shortcoming of this book is that if a reader takes it too seriously, it can actually cost you money. The most important thing to remember is that this book, unlike most other poker books, does not tell you WHAT DO TO...it mearly presents everything that you need TO CONSIDER in order to make the correct decision. Regardless of what limit you play, this book is a tool that can be used to assist any intelligent player in making the correct decision."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"After reading several of the 2+2 offerings, I finally got around to picking up this one. I have to say that it is an excellent companion to Ed Miller's superb work, Small Stakes Hold'em. What I love about Hold Em for Advanced Players is that it recalibrated my fundamentals which is exactly what the mathematician ordered. It seems that the more I'm online competing, the more likely I am to make plays I should never be making. One can only be beaten so long by knuckleheads making straights with 9/5 offsuit before you start becoming experimental and see raise after raise with suited connectors that may have no value after the flop.Admittedly, the book is not brand new, but they did update it to make it more in keeping with today's aggressive, aggressive, \\"I'm all in like Gus Hanson,\\" game. The focus is ring games, which most of us play them online. I did not heed the author's advice when I got it (to read it straight through first), but skipped ahead to the new chapter on playing in loose games. Based on my experiences, their advice was on point and quite helpful.I perused the reviews below, and, I have to say that I disagree with the recent about there being too many exceptions to the information given. I find the inability to state things categorically, and, for every instance, to be in the nature of the game. Endless and bizarre exceptions basically are Texas Hold'Em. It's semi-formal rules with exceptions everywhere you look. If there were not so many contingencies, the fish would never win, and, as all of us know, the fish win quite a bit. The randomicity of the game causes authors like Malmouth and Sklansky to alter their advice slightly depending on the situation, and to always try to find a way for the player to get an edge and slant the odds in his favor. And what is \\"in his favor\\" depends on the hand, the street, and the bet. A great many people long to impose order upon poker, but you cannot completely do so. With any form of gambling there will always be some chaos inherent; there's no getting around it. Once you accept this fact, you tilt far less. As for the writing style, okay, these are math guys. No, they aren't great writers, but so what? We are looking for their expert analytical guidance. I don't care if the sentences are choppy and devoid of personality. If you ask me, my game could use a little less personality. As a fellow soldier in the trenches, let me say that this would make a valuable purchase."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I am an advanced player, and I can tell you: this book is not very helpful to the great majority of readers. Sklansky and Malmuth certainly seem to know alot about poker. But they just don't know how to communicate their ideas in a useful fashion. (As they acknowledge in the book, they decided to self-publish rather than employ an editor to help put their knowledge into reader-friendly shape.)Some of their recommendations are obvious (i.e., raising with two aces), but that is okay: how-to books are supposed to do that. But much of their advice is of this type: &quot;In this situation, you should definitely call. However, sometimes a raise is the correct play, and on other occasions you should fold just to mix up your play.&quot; This kind of &quot;advice&quot; mixes up only the READER. And the authors neuter some advice by hinging it on the personal characteristics of the remaining players (i.e., whether they are likely to fold, call or raise.) Reading your opponents is an important aspect of poker, but that is something (1) learned only through a great deal of experience and (2) impossible for even experts to do without having played with the other players. Finally, as others (and the authors) have noted, the book is not well-written or organized.I give the book 2 stars because about 50 of the 300+ pages really does contain useful information. But you have to wade through alot of mishmash to find it.There are lots of other books out there that present USEFUL information to players from novice to advanced. You should seek them out instead."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is not a book to read while drinking a beer and watching the ballgame on TV. Like most Sklansky books, it's packed with information delivered in a dry, straightforward style reminicsent of college math or engineering texts. The ideas, while often subtle, are very powerful if the reader will take the time to read, re-read, and probe them in poker games and out.Much of the material is in the form of brief essays. The portion on non-optimal play in loose games is worth the price of the book all by itself. The same can be said of the heads up play section. I recommend that you take notes and re read the sections several times as you study, then chat online (2+2 forum is a good site to do this)with some playes about what you've learned.This book in my opinion is Sklansky's best book, with Theory of Poker a close second. Take the time and make the effort to understand what he's saying and take your game to a new level."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is an excelent book, but take the title to heart. It's for advanced play. Perhaps a better way to put it is to say that this boook contains information you'll need to properly play mid and high limit hold 'em. If you're playing low limit hold 'em then you should be studying Lee Jone's book &quot;Winning Low Limit Hold 'em&quot; and Sklansky's first Hold 'em book.Some of the plays in this book will still work in low limit games. But remember, in low limit games people will play just about any cards and they rarely fold. So the extensive coverage of bluffing, semi-bluffing, reading cards, and so on won't be of much use in a low limit game. But once you're ready to &quot;tighten up&quot; and play in the larger money games this information becomes very important."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This book can be tough to read if you're not really familiar with hold'em, but once you get used to the lingo, it's a good read.

Mr. Sklansky's thought process are almost spaghetti-like making him hard to follow increasing his cult-like status.

I mean, betting patterns and the actions players should take are so different depending on if a game is limit or pot-limit, or no-limit. If anything the book seems more catered toward limit play (which is far less popular), but the fact that there was never a clear distinction at any time, really annoyed me. This book is way overrated, everyone said for me to read it, but I'm sure there's better Texas Hold 'Em books out there.

Yes, you can adapt the strategies to no-limit games, but this book gives very specific advice on how to act on specific hands, so in that context, it doesn't necessarily cross-over well into no-limit.Hoenstly, after reading the first few chapters, I found myself flipping through the book as a found the concepts not that \\"advanced\\".

It was not the best investment I've ever made.Sklansky and Malmuth are both very knowledgable about the game...odds, probabilities, etc. But they are not great writers (and they admit that in the beginning). The book is very boring...and not well written. Most of the info is common sense, but there a few pearls of wisdom.It is DEFINITELY not for a poker newbie. But if you have some time in at the tables and want something to read on the john, give it a shot."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"The ideas contained in this book are outdated and useless, even harmful. The concepts were developed by Sklansky in another era for another game. The modern game typically has two to three players seeing the flop for two to three bets. When Sklansky wrote his original book based on his experiences in relatively low limit games i.e the 10-20 game at the Gold Nugget) where a tight game was described as one where around five players saw the flop for half a bet or a full bet. Another section of the new book talks about games where no one at the table takes the game seriously. Those games just don't exist at levels high enough for the player to have a chance to overcome the rake (20-40 or higher).Particularly dangerous is the book's oft stated theme of rating suited hands much higher than non-suited hands. For instance, 10 J suited is rated equivalent to A Q offsuit. Playing small suited connectors is suicide in the average high limit game (seeing the flop against one or two opponents for two to three bets). There is only a minimal difference between say A Q offsuit and A Q suited in this type of game because (1) you hit flushes very rarely (about 4% of the time when you're suited) and (2) you'll actually make more flushes with the off suited hand. Playing garbage hands in hopes of hitting a 1 in 25 flush is the biggest single error made by bad players and this book sytemically reinforces this error. This 1 in 25 shot is particularly ill advised when you play in game with lots of two or three handed flops.The other problem is that strategy suggestions repeatedly encourage calling way too loose and raising way too tight, just the opposite strategy that consistent winning players employ. I suspect that Malmuth knows that the strategies suggested won't work in high limit games and are thus of no use (or even detrimental) to advanced players.It is certainly true, however, that an amateur player could benefit from the book as long as they understand that the book will not turn them into a pro or enable them to overcome the rake in low limit games.Finally, the authors discussion focused almost exclusively on structured limit games. There are only a handful of truly successful limit poker pros in the world. Anybody that can play, even a little bit, should focus on playing no-limit or pot limit. Even the authors admit that many of the really difficult situations are break even decisions in limit poker. In open limit games, however, these situations are extremely critical.Psychology, tells, and betting strategies are so much more important in no limit that most working, practicing holdem/omaha pros refuse to play structured limit. Limit poker is great for the house, because they end up with all the money. If you have some talent (and some passion) for the game and you're trying to become a serious player, pass on this book and pass on limit poker in general."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is a great book if you know a lot about poker. The first time I read this book I was very confused about the concepts within the chapters. However, once I played at the casinos, EVERYTHING made perfect sense. My game has greatly improved because of this book.One thing to be cautious of: many of these concepts relate to higher stakes tables. Even 5-10 tables may have too many players who are not good enough to use these strategies on. Also, if you like to play poker but do not have much experience at casino tables, you will have difficulty reading this. I read a few of these chapters a couple of times when I first got it because it is truley for ADVANCED players!Overall, if you are a good player and want to become great, this book will definitely help.

While many of the ideas can be applied to no limit games, the author continually discusses limit play. This is important since there is little in the book about pot odds and implied odds. And since the author assumes you are playing limit games, the discussion regarding these topics is limited to \\"if you are raised on your right\\" and so on. For people who want specifics about how much of a raise on your right should cause you to fold, this book is lacking.I will say, however, that the section on hand rankings has improved my play (in both limit and no limit games).

Originally published in 1988 and now in its 3rd edition, this book was the kind of resource for Hold Em players that was simply in short short short supply at the time that the WSOP had 167 entrants in the main event and Johnny Chan repeated against Erik Seidel. Now nearly 20 years after it was first published, this book still contains outstanding advice on how to improve your game, from the basics of starting hands to discussing pot odds, implied odds, steals, and bluffs. While this book is marketed towards the LIMIT Hold 'Em player, that doesn't mean that No Limit players can't get something out of this as well. Discussion on the types of things mentioned before (starting hands and odds) still are very similar as you transition from Limit to No Limit, they just need to be \\"tweaked\\" a bit as you move up in games.The one thing that this book will NOT do much for you is learning to play NL Tournament Hold Em (NLTHE), so if that is your main focus, pick up Dan Harrington's EXCEPTIONAL books which discuss the subject. If you are a cash player mainly and want to improve your game or are even just learning the game, you would be making a wise decision to pick up a copy of this book.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"If you dont feel confident with your strategy and tactics this is a great book to read.Although I would recomend reading \\"the theory of poker\\" first by sklansky as these two books are like two peas in a pod."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Before I read this book, I was losing regularly in the poker rooms of Las Vegas. Since studying the concepts discussed in the text, I am now WINNING regularly. Now when I bet or raise, not only am I confident that I'm making the correct play, but I know WHY it is the correct play.Sklansky and Malmuth take a simple, step-by-step approach. They can explain even the most complicated mathematics in easy-to-understand language.If you want to take poker seriously, read all the Sklansky, Malmuth, and Caro that you can get your hands on. If you play Texas Hold'em, read this book first."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I am really wondering about the reviews on this page. Some were critical, but then there was a huge mass of positive reviews, completely ignoring the obvious problems with this book.Let's try to get a picture of this. A book is good if it not only contains valuable information, it must also transfer this information to the reader. The second part is where this book fails completely.In an essence the book offers you a collection of plays. The authors are trying to come up with concepts and rules, but at the same time they are giving so many exceptions, that the concepts and rules become vague and unreliable. In the end the reader is completely confused and doesn't know what to do with all of this.Also their starting hands are questionable. Some guys did research on it and they discovered a few errors (http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/mummert/poker/). Now it is up to the reader whom to trust, which adds even more to the confusion.Overall I gave 3 stars for the information that must be hidden somewhere in this book. I didn't find much, but I can't deny that some conclusions made me say \\"ahhh\\". If you don't mind reading the same stuff twice or more before you vaguely understand what the authors wanted to say, I am sure you can find a few gems.This book will definitely put you in the twillight zone of poker education. When you read it you have the feeling that there is lots of important stuff presented to you, you just don't know if you will ever understand it."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I feel like people are in two camps about Sklansky, and there are times when these two camps appear to find as much common ground as listeners of Rush Limbaugh and Obama campaign volunteers. Well, maybe a little more than that. Still, there's a lot of difference. One side finds Sklansky too dry, technical, unrealistic about how people really play, and just a bunch of mathematical postulating with little practical value. The other side seems to think that Sklansky is the seer of poker theory, that he has the ability to single-handedly determine the correctness of any poker play, and that all his complicated formulas and theories can turn anyone into a winning player, if they only study his books to exhaustion. I may be overstating slightly, but based on the other reviews for this book, I don't think I am exaggerating too much (btw, I'm not sure which side are the Rush listeners, perhaps both).Well, I'm in both camps about Sklansky, and this book serves as a great example of why. I think there is no doubt that Sklansky's poker theory is virtually unmatched, even in this new age of internet poker players, many of whom could, if they so chose, be associate professors at MIT (but why would they, considering how much they can make playing a card game online.) He does a fantastic job really fleshing out the many details in making proper choices. It does get very complicated, but it has to be in order to take all the details into account. Any attempt to give a correct answer requires an acknowledgement of all those details. Anything short of that is intellectually dishonest, and most likely wrong.On the other hand, Sklansky does not do himself any favors in his manner of writing. His insistence on accurately and fully explaining his recommendations, often do more to cloud his recommendation than to clarify. Great poker theory does have to be complicated, because poker is a complicated game, but it doesn't have to be death to read. Additionally, Sklansky has a particular blindness when it comes to poker, in that he thinks all the theory can, in itself, make you a good poker player. I think it helps to add a dose of Mattew Hilger, whenever reading Sklansky, and it'll make you a more complete player.I've said a lot without saying a lot about the book specifically. So, in brief, this offers a lot of the value that Sklansky's Theory of Poker offers, but with a focus just on Hold'em and with a bit more practical advice, assuming you are advanced enough to know how to implement a numerically-based poker style, and complicated plays within your overall poker strategy. It's a challenging book, but to write it off without putting in a serious effort to understand Sklansky's viewpoints means consigning yourself to a level of mediocrity, because you need to know this stuff when you get to a certain point in your poker career. Take that as you will."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is the fundamental text of Hold'em for serious students of the most complex form of poker. Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players is as deceptively simple as the game itself. While the book is an &quot;easy read&quot;, the simple and concise writing style of the authors belies the multitude of information and savvy advice contained within every page. Each reading stimulates one to a thought provoking analysis of hands played, whether won or lost, and how those hands could have been played more profitably. The authors carefully define poker theory and tatics in a context that naturally applies to all poker games, and then show how to apply these concepts into a coherent winning stratagem for Hold'em. A beginner may initially be better served by a different text, but every player with aspirations of winning should certainly study this book.

I managed about a 50% success rate in understanding.This is more of a &quot;caution review&quot; than a review.

The downside is that I felt like I was back in College again and had to re-read sections and study and take notes. I probably should have ready Hold'em Poker by David Sklansky before this book, but I will definatley spend more hours pouring over the valuable information in this book."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is simply the best Hold'em book ever written.The first half of the book follows a traditional style. The authors cover opening hands, position, the \\"if you're checking a lot, you're a [bad] player\\" philosophy, calculating basic pot odds, and a variety of other topics essential to your game. This half of the book should be memorized. Don't kid yourself; if you don't know how to play a suited jack/nine from the fifth position, you will not win consistently playing Hold'em. Calculating pot odds separates the men from the boys, but you will need to get a copy of the Theory of Poker to truly cover that topic.The second half of the book is a wealth of short essays covering topics ranging from how to play especially difficult hands to more general topics such a slow-play and the semi-bluff. I can't tell you how helpful this part of the book is. For a newbie, there is too much information here to absorb, but just reading the text will help you recognize when players are using these techniques against you. With time, you will learn how to use these techniques yourself.The second part of the book also is an excellent reference for those times in a game when you just were not sure what the correct play was. Make a mental note when that happens and bust out this book when you get home. More than likely, you will find the information you need to make the correct play the next time. Keep in mind that when you're not sure how to play out a hand, your opponent likely has the same problems. If you learn from these difficult, often misplayed hands, you can gain a significant advantage over your fellow-players.Bottom line: Read this book over and over again until you can recall it line by line while sitting at the table. There is not a better way to spend your time than reading this book if you want to increase your hourly take at the Hold'em table.Five Enthusiastic Stars - HawkeyeGK"},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"When I first bought this book i wasnt technically an advanced player. I understood the game, the rules, and many plays from just playing poker a lot. The problem with Hold'em is no matter how many books you read, you are destined to loose hundereds or thousands of dollars in the process of your Hold'em education. We have books like this one to give tips on how to cut down on the cost of your education. Honestly, if you're a regular player at the game of Hold'em you got to have this book for your collection. I say collection because all Hold'em players have a book collection :)Must reads:David Sklansky's - Theory of PokerDoyle Brunson's - The Super SystemThe absolute must of them all= Mike Caro's - Book of Poker TellsThis book gets more in to detail of things to do in certain situations or variations of Hold'em than it does about basics of the game. I really dont think anyone is going to get lost buying this book and being a beginner. You at least need to know what the basics of the game are, which can be learned by watching the World Poker Tour or World Series of Poker on TV. What David goes into more are Low limit, high limit, loose games, tight games, etc. and tips on what to do in certain situations against many or few opponents.I cant really say too much more that hasnt been said in all the other reviews. There is a lot of good info in this book. The bottom line is, for this game you must be as educated as possible about every kind of play there is.

It is really absolute must reading for anyone who intends to play Texas Hold'em in a casino and wants to be a winner. One notable thing regarding this book is that if you have not read &quot;Hold'em Poker&quot; by David Sklansky, this book may not make much sense to you. It really is for advanced players, and describes many plays that are sophisticated and beyond the scope of a beginning book on poker. The hand rankings are critical for beginners learning the difficult art of pre-flop play. The advanced plays described in some of the later chapters become the basis for winning play after the flop, particularly at the middle limits. Some of the plays are not all that useful in the small limit games, but the section on &quot;loose games&quot; is critical for beginning players learning how to navigate large multiway pots. Overall, this book is must reading, and anyone who hasn't read it is probably not going to be playing anywhere near optimally, no matter what limit of Texas hold'em they play."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I was furious after I read some of the other reviews of this book. I looked only out of curiousity, considering I had already read (and reread) this book four year ago- before Varkonyi won the WSOP on ESPN or the WPT was being televised on the Travel Channel. The fact was, this book changed my life and my playing to a degree where I considered myself semi-professional. If you want a book on \\"How-to-begin-learning-poker\\" get Skalansky's skinny book on Hold 'em. But these pages are packed solid with enough information to make the book seem even heavier in your hands than the number of pages implies. Markus Damanski from Germany found it hard to understand, maybe english is not his first language. Jamie Landry from Seattle said she had to read it two whole times before she gleened a couple ideas from it! wow. And J. Gelling from NY gave it one star with an example quote to illustrate it's complexity which he could not follow.BUT... my response is: Noam Chomsky was not easy to get through. St. Thomas Aquinas made me want to pull my hair out. J.R.R. Tolkien's Silmerillian is just a bunch of nonsensical words! My points are as follows:1. THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE TO FIND THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS BOOK. I have read them all. Yes, all of them. Many times.2. THERE IS NO WAY TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION IN A MORE PRECISE FASHION THAN IT IS. I had to read sentences, paragraphs, and whole pages over and over and over again until I understood it too (just like Chomsky & Aquinas), but there is no way I could I have said it more succinctly.3. THEY ASSERT THAT SINCE SKLANSKY OFTEN REFERS TO LIMIT HOLD EM ON HIS LESSONS, IT HAS LITTLE OR NO VALUE IN NO LIMIT HOLD EM. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. I could not reasonably move up to no limit hold em until I could understand and apply (with dicipline) the ideas and theories he presents for limit games.I play all over CA and NV at medium stakes ($5/$10 No Limit or $10/$20 Limit) against dozens of old men and young rookies (I'm only 28) who think they know it all. But it only takes a conversation at a short smoke break or a couple rounds of the blinds to recognize the basic theories they lack. And they scoff at me, \\"bah, i never read those damn books, sonny.\\"Well, most of us are not smart enough to have spontaneous knowledge of complex ideas. The next best thing we can hope for is to be smart enough to follow the line of logic of smarter men than us like Einstein, Chomsky, Aquinas, and yes, even Sklansky.

Hardly. Worthwhile to read several times? Definately.Overall, this is a solid, advanced poker book. It is full of numerically based, money making advice as well as intricate \\"plays\\" designed to extract the most value from a hand.With that being said, the reader must be warned that the author, in addition to being a solid poker player, is a busnessman and is aware of the money this book will make you if you take it's advice. Thus the hefty price tag.I should stress that this is an ADVANCED book. The author makes the assumption that you are playing with tight agressive SMART players. If you are consistantly playing low limits and getting beat by idiots drawing out on you this book will not solve your problems (i.e. it is intended for $5/10 and up limits.) Additionally, if you have not played quite a bit of hold em', you might not fully understand the value of some of the advice that this book has to offer.Overall I highly recommend this book along with the shorter, hold em' book (titled \\"Texas Hold em'\\" I believe) by the same authors. The information is solid and will undoubtedly help your game."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"For people just surfing a list of poker titles, you will have a hard time understanding this book if you don't have a grounding in basic poker theory and some game-specific reference material already. Most of the terminology used by Sklansky and Malmuth is explained in detail in _The Theory of Poker_. For an easily read and perhaps more clearly written introduction to Texas Hold'em, I recommend _Hold'em Excellence_ by Lou Krieger or _Winning Low-Limit Hold'em_ by Lee Jones.Both of the basic books came after this book, however, and both pay extensive tribute to its lessons. It makes sense to read the simplified versions first, and then progress to this.An example of the different level of detail can be found with discussions of how to play a pair of jacks before the flop. Lee Jones tells you to raise with it in early position, and reraise the pot if it gets to you beforehand - which itself is sound advice, because you want to make worse hands pay to catch cards that beat yours. However, Sklansky sees it differently and goes further in explaining himself. &quot;If no one has opened and you are in an early position, it is usually best to raise with JJ in a tight game and to just call with it in a loose game. With two jacks you would prefer either to have no more than one or two opponents in the hope your hand holds up without improvement, or to have as many opponents in the pot as possible when the majority of your profits come from flopping three-of-a-kind. The worst scenario is when exactly three or four opponents see the flop with you. This most likely would occur if you called in a tight game or raised in a loose game.&quot; This won't sink in nearly so well until you've built some good fundamental assumptions about playing the game and put in some hours of playing and thinking.No book will make you a strong player by itself, as Sklansky will point out in the introduction to any book on poker he's ever written. However, if you've read the Krieger and Jones texts a few times and come out a winner after six months of hold'em at the $3-$6/$4-$8 level, you might want to invest in this as your spring training before taking a shot at $10-$20 stakes and higher."},{"Title":"Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I have most of their titles-the best poker advice backed up with easy to understand examples. contains the least amount of dubious advice of any poker text. this book will make a difference to your bankroll.

You will have to go to the tables and come back to the book to fully understand all the aspects of their discussion. This means that those with more experience will gain more from it. This book is for those who play higher limit games, perhaps 10-20 and up because poorer players predominate in the lower games. Poorer players don't respond to betting action like they should, partly because they are ignorant and partly because the cost of mistakes, or staying in lousy hands, are so low. Your education will hindered in those games, therefore this book is for serious hold'em players who wish higher study of a structured Casino game.

The normal tip goes something like this: In this certain situation, you may want to consider checking or raising, unless you think the bettor may be bluffing or is tight aggressive, in which case a strong play would be to check-raise. If you're in an early position, definitely think about folding, but the blinds may want to call half the time, however only if the pot odds are right and 4 other conditions are met... Now take 150 similar -sophisticated- plays, and thats the contents of the book.Would I recommend this to others? Well, certain players may want to consider buying it, while about 1 in 3 may want to think about checking with their friends first to see if they have a copy. A good play might be to consider a used copy, but only if the price is below the normal buy-in of their weekly game.

Although the points are nice to review over, most &quot;advanced&quot; poker players would have a solid foundation on the basics of preflop play.In light of this, I would think that this is actually a book that is well suited for beginners as well. The book follows a systematic formula which describes more advanced information such as specific hands and how they are to be played in the latter half of the book while the opening parts give the readers a general idea of how to start your preflop play. In this fashion, beginners can follow the book chronologically and practice the &quot;theory&quot; as he/she advances in their game. This practical application is extremely important from my point of view.Overall, I think that there is value in owning a copy of this book, especially if you're in the beginner-intermediate skill level range.

Still, if you want to understand how older players got to where they are today, reading this is an absolute must. On the other hand, if you follow the advice in this book you will be a certain slow loser at today's higher stakes tables. I bought a new copy because I loaned my old copy and it isn't coming back.

These books are loaded with alot of information and alot of hope. I truly believe through my intense study of the game and through many years of grinding it out, there is only one way to become an advanced player and that is through experiance. There I said it. You can read a poker book a day, and still learn nothing about proper game play till you put it on the line and see what happens. The main intent of these books are to have you ponder on the mind frame of a poker player. But unless you have played the game for 25-30 years like the one's writing the books, you can't truly appreciate what they are talking about.I am certain that once you learn the basics of the game in question you shouldn't buy a single book telling you how to perform, save that money and buy a software where you can try your own strategies through countless simulations. In a weeks time I have played up to 5,000 to 7,000 hands and learned from myself, how to play a hand or how to play it different.I hear It already you can't learn poker from a software. So untrue. Remember the game in question here is Limit, where the only way to win is through straightforward play and value betting. A software is the same way. Of course a software on No-Limit would be nowhere as valuable due to obvious reasons. I am a consitant winner at any level up to 40-80 because I have seen so many hands in so many different situations. And they hype from the one guys reviews about the rake will kill you in limit, don't play limit, blah, blah, blah. Buddy, just like NLH, it's about game selection. The rake will kill you in a very tight game, when 3/4ths the time your in the pot you will fold quickly but not in a game where your profit comes from others mistakes.Good luck at the tables."},{"Title":"A Brush with Hong Kong","review":"Parker's got an eye for humor, beauty, and the essence of Hong Kong.

Between the rivers Raba and Prut. II. Armoured adventure","review":"This book on the 1939 campaign is unusual in a number of respects. First of all, it describes the war against the Nazi German invaders from the viewpoint of a soldier. Second, it includes a sizeable description of the combat operations of the Polish forces in 1940 France. Owing to the fact that the book was published soon after the events, it was not colored by subsequent political and military developments.The combat operations of the Black Brigade began near Krakow, then proceeded almost due east to the Rzeszow area, and finally to the Lwow area. On September 17th, the USSR stabbed Poland in the back. The Black Brigade moved from the Lwow (Lviv) area south, and crossed the border into Hungary. There the troops were eventually disarmed and interned, but managed to evacuate to France.In the first several days of the 1939 war, the Brigade had successes against the invading Germans. Kurcz comments: \\"The men fought splendidly. Corporal Dziechciarz alone knocked out with his gun no less than seven enemy tanks and did not give up the fight until he was attacked simultaneously by three tanks using incendiary ammunition. He was burned and carbonized.\\" (p. 24). Also: \\"We discovered that, although the enemy had a tremendous superiority in aeroplanes, tanks, and guns, we could put up a very effective resistance. The soldiers proved splendid fighters, without a trace of any inferiority complex or \`armour panic'. Especially the anti-tank units did extremely well, while their Polish 37 mm anti-tank guns confirmed the hopes we had placed in them. Some of the 37 mm guns knocked out several German tanks each, while their crews fought to the bitter end, until their gun was smashed by a shell, until all the men were killed by enemy fire or crushed by the tanks.\\" (p. 26).Kurcz encountered a Messerschmitt that had just been shot down. (p. 33). He came across the dead and dying crew members, and had thought about his own brother that, as he later learned, had suffered a similar fate.Ironic to the absurdity about Polish cavalry charging German tanks with lances and sabers, Kurcz contrasted the 1939 war with the 1919-1920 one. In the latter, there had been almost no planes, almost no armoured vehicles, and cavalry that had still used lances and sabers. (p. 98).Kurcz encountered several instances of German fifth-column activity. For instance, he wrote: \\"There were some villages with German farmers in the neighborhood of Jaroslaw and they formed a strong fifth column. Parachutists dropped by the enemy reinforced their ranks. Sometimes we saw them coming down and in Jaroslaw three of them came straight down into the hands of our soldiers.\\" (p. 84).In common with many authors, Kurcz points out that the absence of rain in the first few weeks of the war had facilitated Luftwaffe attacks, and had made the water levels of rivers so low that they could easily be crossed by the enemy. (p. 116). The constant movement of refugees clogged the roads, hindering the movement of troops. (p. 64). The Polish troops experienced extreme fatigue and sleepiness caused by being forced to be constantly on the move in order to avoid encirclement by fast-moving motorized German columns.When in France, the Polish troops were subject to humiliating comments regarding the rapidity of Poland's 1939 defeat. Unfavorable comparisons were made with the Finns' resistance to the Soviets, even though the events were not remotely comparable. (p. 136). For a time, the Polish soldiers feared that they would be sent into combat without an adequate period of training on how to use French military equipment. (p. 155). In the actual combat, Kurcz found French resistance inadequate, as when he commented: \\"We asked him [a French commander] to explain why the whole Corps found itself unable to hold a front which could be easily held by a small Polish Brigade.\\" (p. 174). In the end, the Poles were the ones surprised (and chagrined) by the rapidity of France's very rapid defeat."},{"Title":"Eternity and time","review":"W.E.Best is one of those rare Christian writers,that when you read one of their books,you always come away with numerous fresh insights(and a deeper understanding)of God's Word,no matter how many books you have read on the authors subject.What are time and eternity? Do they have anything in common? How can they be distinguished from each other? There are satisfying answers to these questions in this treatise.Those who have little or no interest in 'the things of God' do not pay much attention to the concepts of eternity and time. But surprisingly 'the people of God'do not often give the close attention that eternity and time warrant.The terms are often used by Christians but rarely is there even a feeble attempt to give a precise definition of them.The first third of the book defines and contrasts the subject at hand.Chapter 8 'Man Was Created In Time To Live Eternally' has an illuminating discussion on Dichotomy and Trichotomy. The writer gives a strong apologetic for Trichotomy. He elaborates further in Chapter 9 on the difference between spirit and soul(dichotomists assert that they are two terms referring to the same thing).An excellent point is made that animals have a soul but not a spirit and this is a significant distinction of man from the animal world.On p.59 Mr.Best writes \\"Through his spirit,man attains God consciousness;through his soul self consciousness; and through his body world consciousness.From this point of view man is Trichotomous.\\" A part of man being made in the image of God is his tripartite nature.Mr.Best gives the best defense for Trichotomy(and refutation of Dichotomy)that I have come across.In the second third of 'Eternity and Time'(in various places)the author gives a sound refutation of soul sleep and the idea of the soul being bodiless between a persons death and the resurrection on the last day.This is the type of book that will help a believer set his mind and heart on the things above and is very deserving of a wide hearing.It is a weighty spiritual treatise and very unique in its subject matter.

Turandot was, of course, completed by Franco Alfano, some year and a half after Puccini's death.=================================================&#8203;After his books on Verdi (1969) and Mozart (1978), this is the third volume in Mr Osborne's The Complete Operas Of series. It is the first one which is a considerable disappointment. And the reason for this, almost exclusively, is Mr Osborne's ludicrously dismissive attitude. This is also the case in his later volume on Wagner (1990). The fifth and last book in the series, the one on Richard Strauss, I have never read and, frankly, I am afraid of doing so. As regards Verdi and Mozart, whatever criticisms he may have, Mr Osborne often writes with enthusiasm and even affection, precious qualities that go a long way to excuse his somewhat high-handed and self-conscious attitude. Well, virtually all traces of enthusiasm, let alone affection, have vanished into thin air by the time he came to write \\"The Complete Operas Of Puccini\\". I do wonder if Mr Osborne didn't write this book, as well as the one on Wagner, out of some perverse desire for completeness, apparently unaware that the first prerequisite to write about any subject is to have a genuine empathy with it.To begin with the good news, Mr Osborne's book is wonderfully comprehensive and organised in his usually fine manner. Each opera Puccini ever composed, including several that are seldom if ever staged (or even recorded) today, is discussed from every possible point of view: historical background, sources and composition of the libretto and the music, synopsis, musical analysis. Though this is no biography of the great Italian composer, each chapter starts with fairly detailed and well-researched account of Puccini's life around the composition of the work in question; in the case of the first chapter quite enough information about Puccini's ancestors (a long list of distinguished local musicians) and childhood is also provided. As made clear by the author in his introduction, the book is especially designed for the lay reader who wants to get further insight into some of his favourite operas. There are quite a few musical examples between the pages, but the writing is on the whole delightfully non-technical. When instrumental passages are discussed, they are identified in terms of orchestration and simple musical terms (e.g. tempo indications) and can easily be located by anybody even slightly susceptible to music; besides, in most cases the musical examples are accompanied with lines from the libretto which makes the identification even easier.Again as usual with him, Mr Osborne writes a clear and lucid, if a little dry and mannered, English and he is often insightful both about the music and the historical background. One notable example about the latter is Mr Osborne's case that Toscanini's famous world premiere of Puccini's last and incomplete opera, in which the Maestro didn't conduct Alfano's now generally accepted ending, may have been as much an homage to Puccini as a snub to Alfano, whose work Toscanini apparently didn't think much of. Mr Osborne's musical analyses are remarkably readable and sometimes offer the reader revealing touches as regards Puccini's complex use of leitmotivs. To take but one minor example, it is fascinating to read that the opening theme of the second act of La Boheme, which takes place in \\"Cafe Momus\\" in the Latin quarter in Paris, has actually been introduced in the first act, while Schaunard mentions the Christmas celebrations in the Latin Quarter. This is subtle and difficult to notice without assistance. It is also a fine example of Puccini's masterful use of recurring themes (something which Mr Osborne otherwise condemns harshly; see below).The historical background is often illuminating as regards both the music and the libretti. For instance, it is perfectly fascinating to know that Henri Murger's picaresque novel Scenes de la vie de Boheme, from which the libretto of La Boheme was later adapted, was largely drawn from life, Murger himself being the model for Rodolphe (who became Rodolfo in the opera). All four of the bohemian characters - the poet Rodolfo, the painter Marcello, the musician Shaunard and the philosopher Colline - were firmly based on real-life models; in Paris of the 1820s and 1830s the famous ''Cafe Momus'' was also in existence.Mr Osborne's decision to quote one complete chapter (some 12 pages!) of Murger's original is perhaps a trifle questionable, but it is rather interesting to notice the numerous differences. The chapter in question refers to the material for the last act, but here Mimi dies in a hospital and Rodolphe is informed about that by a friend. The novel, however, is rather dull, verbose and quite unsuitable for the stage. Interestingly, it was adapted into a highly successful play by a Murger's friend, but for this version Mr Osborne is unfortunately taciturn. At any rate Illica and Giacosa, Puccini's librettists, did a superb job to craft a very effective story well-suitable for the opera stage. Whatever the quality of their poetry, in combination with Puccini's music the effect is ravishing. I am not ashamed to confess this final act to be one of the most moving moments in opera I have experienced. Those who find it, in the unforgettable phrase of Mr Osborne, ''too cloyingly sentimental to stomach'', must be curiously cold-hearted fellows.But now I come seriously to what I have so far only alluded: Mr Osborne's, to say the very least, highly questionable attitude. Only about \\"La Boheme\\" and \\"Turandot\\", from Puccini's still popular works, does he allow himself to express some qualified admiration - accompanied by quite a few barbs, to be sure. He is generally appreciative, if far from moved, about Puccini's less-known music dramas, such as his ''Wild West Opera'' \\"La Fanciulla del West\\" or his cycle of three one-act operas \\"Il Tritico\\". This tendency to regard more highly the most forgotten makes me wonder if Mr Osborne does not suffer from some snobbish preconceptions that popular taste is necessarily poor; this is unlikely, however, as in his books on Verdi and Mozart he had to deal - and did deal admirably - with a number of operas at least as popular as Puccini's masterpieces. But when he comes to Madama Butterfly and especially to Tosca, almost every trace of appreciation, to say nothing of affection, in Mr Osborne's writing simply disappears. The chapter about the former he finishes with this astonishingly ambiguous sentence: ''But, if one responds to Puccini at all, Butterfly remains solidly in one's affections.''Now I venture to suggest the extremely controversial notion that Mr Osborne is one such man, one who doesn't respond to Puccini at all. This is the only explanation of his generally negative and sometimes almost vicious attitude. And this is the greatest mistake any writer, critics firmly included, could commit: writing about something out of pure negativity. This is not criticism. This is a pathological superiority complex in print. Nothing more, nothing less. True criticism, whatever its value, stems from positive response which, it cannot be repeated too often, has nothing to do with blind adulation and does not in the least prevent one from finding faults now and then. Yet, when there is an implacably negative attitude from the very beginning, an essential conviction that what you deal with is no good, which I am sure is the case with Mr Osborne and Puccini, one certainly has no business writing books on the subject. Those who read and believe them do so at their own peril.Mr Osborne reaches the peak of his deliberate perversity when discussing the music of \\"Tosca\\". Now this is truly baffling stuff. Cavaradossi's ''Vittoria'' arioso (which quickly turns into trio) in the second act is ''musically poor stuff and dramatically risible'', Scarpia's music, except for the finale of Act 1, is ''disappointing throughout the opera'', the theme from the first love duet is repeated many times later ''sometimes to dramatic purpose and sometimes not'', a theme from the end of the second act - and this is Mr Osborne at his most condescending best - ''does something to elevate the stature of the opera at this point'', and so on and so forth. He finishes the chapter with these astonishing lines:\\"Tosca\\" can hardly be described as its composer's finest creation: its lyrical pages are, with one or two exceptions, not among Puccini's most successful, and its dramatic music rarely rises above a workaday level. The fact remains, however, that it is one of Puccini's most popular operas, and would stand high on any list of popular operas. [...] Tosca is popular with audiences not because of the quality of its music, but because its melodramatic plot is tautly constructed, and its three leading roles give their interpreters ample opportunity to shine vocally (Cavaradossi), dramatically (Scarpia) and both vocally and dramatically (Tosca). And, of course, it contains in 'Vissi d'arte' and 'E lucevan le stelle' two highly effective arias.\\"What I have omitted above is Mr Osborne's quoting the wise words of Joseph Kerman, from his \\"Opera as Drama\\" (1956), that Tosca is a ''shoddy little shocker'', and Benjamin Britten's even more profound statement that he was ''sickened by the cheapness and emptiness'' of Puccini's music (Opera, February 1951).One doesn't know where to start the discussion of a passage so rife with ridiculous rubbish.At first glance, according to Mr Osborne, \\"Tosca\\" must be this unique creature of an opera that has remained in the standard repertoire, nay even attained amazing popularity, not because of its music, but because of its plot and drama. This is, of course, pure nonsense. Mr Osborne admits as much in the very next sentence. What a glaring contradiction indeed! The music is of poor quality, yet two of the major characters ''shine vocally''. As for the fiercely intense drama, who would dare predict how far the libretto would survive on the theatre stage only, without Puccini's music? Indeed I would. Not a single performance!I am inclined to think that Mr Osborne takes the audience for a trifle bigger fools than they are. No matter how intensely dramatic and ''tautly constructed'' the plot may be, nobody would go to the opera house, much less make or buy a complete recording, because of the drama on the stage. This is not theatre. This is musical theatre. The same goes for ''Vissi d'arte'' and ''E lucevan le stelle''. These are surely two of the most famous arias, for soprano and tenor respectively, in the whole of opera. All the same, nobody - least of all the public at large - would stand two hours of boredom because of five minutes vocal brilliance.As for the lyrical pages, I take issue with Mr Osborne and do claim that both love duets, in Act 1 and in Act 3, are definitely among the finest things Puccini ever composed. So, for that matter, is the whole of Act 2, which must rank as one of the most highly-charged dramas ever put on the opera stage. Any moral objections one may have to the violence or the pornographic undercurrents of the second act are simply beside the point. It is musically and dramatically as close to perfection as anything ever composed by anybody.Now, it goes without saying that \\"Tosca\\" is not for children, nor for prigs, prudes, the squeamish and the faint-hearted. It is extremely violent. After the final curtain the body count is exactly four, and only one death (Angelotti's) is altogether off stage; Cavaradossi is shot and Scarpia stabbed very much on the stage indeed; as for Tosca herself, her suicide may be said to be half-offstage. The death of Scarpia, which forms the end of Act 2, is probably the most horrifying thing in all opera. After stabbing him with the words ''This is the kiss of Tosca!'', Tosca watches the villain expiring with words like ''Is your blood choking you?'' and ''Die accursed! Die! Die! Die!''. When Scarpia is dead, come the cynical ''And now I pardon him!'' and the contemptuous ''All Rome trembled before him!'', sung in a low, menacing voice, accompanied by anguished strings.Nor is the nearly pornographic sexual innuendo between Tosca and Scarpia, which occupies a good deal of the second act, or the highly erotic overtones of Cavaradossi's wistful fantasies in ''E lucevan le stelle'', very suitable for the morally fastidious. I imagine something like the latter prompted Deryck Cooke to describe memorably the essence of Puccini as ''despairing eroticism''. But this, too, is an important part of the story. It also has, in addition to certain dramatic significance, some of the most sublime music in existence.But all that is beside the point. On the theatre stage Tosca may be a revolting spectacle, which is probably one of the reasons why Sardou's original five-act play didn't survive the test of time, but in the opera house or on record, with Puccini's magnificent score and a trio of great singer-actors, it is a chilling yet compelling drama, or melodrama if you like. I have never been able to listen to it without being terrified yet fascinated, trembling in cold sweat yet exalted by what must be one of most gorgeous dramatic scores ever composed. And what is the use of great art if not to sharpen your sensibilities as regards the whole of humanity? Have you never wondered how it feels to kill a man? Have you never wanted to do so? If you are not as saintly as to answer \\"no\\" to both questions, you might just find Puccini's Tosca surprisingly self-revealing.Perhaps Mr Osborne found the melodrama much too lurid for his taste? Perhaps his prudish consciousness was outraged by what he rightly (though at the wrong place!) describes as ''quasi-pornography''? Whatever the reason, it must be said here and now that his musical analysis of Tosca is a shameful ranting that should never have been published. Virtually all his negative points can be refuted as easily as he no doubt made them. And that's what I propose to do now.Mr Osborne's curious remark that Scarpia's music is ''disappointing throughout the opera'' is strangely inane. If he meant melodic richness and vocal splendour, he was certainly right. But Scarpia is not there to delight you with ravishing singing. He is there to frighten you, to repel you, to disgust you. He is the kind of man who is turned on, in every sense of the phrase, by the misery of others. Unscrupulous, hypocritical, corrupt, lecherous and sadistic, Scarpia is probably the most loathsome creature in all opera; Jago from Otello is a saint in comparison. Mr Osborne enjoys declaring this or that ''aria'' of his to be ''unmemorable'' or full of ''empty rhetoric'', while he completely fails to understand that, in the first place, talking of ''arias'' in Tosca is very misguided. Small wonder that he would miss the point completely. And the point is that Scarpia, no matter how disgusting he may be, is a fabulously done character, if necessarily simplified for the stage. When his largely declamatory part is performed by a baritone who is endowed both with great voice and with great ability to act with that voice - say, for example, Guiseppe Taddei or Titto Gobbi; or, in more recent times and in smaller degree, even Sherrill Milnes and Ruggero Raimondi - it's an extraordinary experience, both aurally and visually.Mr Osborne's disparaging remarks about Puccini's dramatic use of his leitmotivs also reveal nothing but the author's outstanding superficiality. Strangely enough, other eminent writers (Mosco Carner, Richard Osborne) have been equally condescending about that. They invariably state that Puccini's use of the leitmotiv technique is radically different than Wagner's, by which they of course imply that it is inferior to Wagner's admittedly more complex and far-reaching method. But why? Because Puccini's short themes do not change throughout the work and are largely used for mere identification; this is the same as Debussy's famous dismissal of the leitmotivs in Wagner's Ring as ''calling cards''. I do not think this is the case at all. Indeed, Puccini's orchestration has always impressed me as very Wagnerian, although this is, of course, a dangerous oversimplification. In other words, I imagine Wagner would have admired Tosca, even though it is not something he could possibly have composed himself. But let's get few direct examples. The finale of the music drama is condemned by Mr Carner (in his liner notes to Karajan's 1979 recording for DG) as ''dramatically entirely irrelevant'', and here is what Mr Osborne has to say about it:\\"...and the wildly inappropriate statement by the full orchestra, 'tutta forza con grande slancio', of Cavaradossi's 'O dolci baci, o languide carezze' from his aria 'E lucevan le stelle'. The theme from the love duet or even the fateful Ex. 26 would have made a more suitable conclusion. Even better would have been the Scarpia theme with which the opera began.\\"Well, at least in this case, unlike in most others, Mr Osborne offers some alternatives of his own. But it would have been much better if he had spent a few sentences more to tell us why these alternatives are better suited. (For the record, ''Ex. 26'' is the brooding theme in the strings from the end of the second act which was referred to earlier and which accompanies Scarpia's writing of a safe-conduct pass for Tosca; and Cavaradossi's line translates, roughly, as ''Oh soft kisses, oh sweet caresses''.) For my part, the reference makes perfect dramatic sense: Cavaradossi's anguished erotic fantasies, infinitely amplified by the blast of the full orchestra, are in line with the tragic end both lovers have just come to. It is quite possible, of course, that now and then Puccini sacrificed dramatic consistency for a purely musical effect. But I don't believe that, either. Puccini was too much a man of the theatre to do that. Moreover, he definitely was skillful enough a composer to finish Tosca quite effectively with any theme he liked. Nor is the argument that the theme in question is associated entirely with Cavaradossi any more viable. After all, his erotic reveries definitely refer both to him and to Tosca.To take one other example, in the first act Cavaradossi and Angelotti leave the church accompanied, ''incongruously'' as the dismayed Mr Osborne tells us, by the jaunty melody associated with the comic character of the sacristan. This, again, shows an appalling disrespect for Puccini's masterful use of his leitmotivs; it also shows that labeling themes as ''calling cards'' is a very dangerous business indeed. As a matter of fact, the reference to the sacristan's theme, cleverly interwoven with others, can very easily be explained: it simply anticipates the appearance of the sacristan himself; for he does appear no sooner than the painter and the ex-prisoner have left. And this, indeed, is a very Wagnerian use of the leitmotiv technique.There are also bigger issues in Tosca which Mr Osborne glosses over. The role of the church as regards the characters is a case in point. Tosca is presented as a very pious woman and it is perfectly in line with her character that she should remove the Crucifix from the wall and put it on the bloody chest of the dead Scarpia. This is no ingenuity of some modern director; it is written in the libretto. Scarpia himself, though he uses religion, as anything else, to satisfy only his vile instincts, is not without some God-fearing nuances in his make-up. When, in the end of the first act, he bursts out passionately that Tosca makes him forget even God, but then remembers where he is and kneels down to pray during ''Te Deum'', I am never sure how much of a humbug he is. On the other hand, Cavaradossi is an acknowledged free-thinker. He is called a \\"Voltairean dog\\" and has influenced even Tosca's rigid piety. The banter between him and the sacristan is as amusing as it is pointed. And Tosca's faith in God is, indeed, greatly shaken by the events as well; her famous aria in the second act finishes with a direct question to God which sounds almost like accusation: ''perch&eacute; me ne rimuneri cos&igrave;?'' (''Why dost Thou repay me thus?'') The whole issue is rather complex and certainly worth a study, in respect to both the historical period in which the opera is set (1800) and Puccini's own attitude.So much about \\"Tosca\\". But even about La Boheme, where Mr Osborne unbends as much as using such untypical words like ''moving'' and where his treatment of the music is more detailed and more insightful than anywhere else, there are quite a few nasty touches. Probably the nastiest one is the glorious finale of Act 1 (Rodolfo's and Mimi's introductory arias and, immediately afterwards for life is short, the love duet) about which Mr Osborne loftily declares that ''Puccini's lyrical genius operates at its highest'' - and two sentences later he states, with even more nauseating loftiness, that we shouldn't complain if the composer ''is functioning at the aesthetic level of the cheap romantic novel, when he achieves his aim with such conviction.'' What's that supposed to mean? Puccini at his best is like a ''cheap romantic novel''? Well, his librettists may well be there, but his music is definitely on another, infinitely higher, plane.Leaving aside the trademark ambiguity of Mr Osborne's conclusions (as if he was afraid of expressing any unqualified admiration, and in each case he felt compelled to drag Puccini through the mud), the discussion of the last act of La Boheme is dismal. We are told that Colline's little aria about his old coat (''Vecchia zimarra'') is ''dramatically a mistake and musically slight''. In fact, it is neither. Mr Osborne obviously equates shortness with smallness. He should have known better. When performed by a bass who can manage the mezza voce well, the aria is incredibly moving. And dramatically relevant, because Colline's is going to sell his coat, not for any other reason, but to help the dying Mimi. One wonders if Mr Osborne would consider Musetta's short prayer from the same act to be ''dramatically a mistake and musically slight''. Of course it is neither, and for the same reasons as Colline's aria, but the remarkable thing is that the author does not even mention it!Mr Osborne also objects that Puccini should finish the opera with the theme from the end of Colline's ''Vecchia zimarra'', apparently forgetting that the final word of the aria is ''Addio'' and thus the theme fits quite well Rodolfo's irreparable loss. Earlier in this chapter Mr Osborne even quotes Ernest Newman to support his theory that Puccini revived old tunes promiscuously and without any dramatic purpose. Well, we all know the ''authority'' of Mr Newman as regards Liszt and even in the case of Wagner, by far his forte, his wise remarks have been largely, if not entirely, superseded. I wonder if it wasn't Mr Newman with whom this fashion of degrading Puccini's dramatic sense started. Mr Carner and Mr Osborne seem only too eager to repeat his ''authoritative'' opinions.The third act of \\"La Boheme\\" reveals, for yet another time, that Mr Osborne works according to some preconceptions of his own that have no truck with Puccini's dramatic thinking. When his expectations are not fulfilled, it never crosses the author's mind that it might be he who is wrong, not the composer. After his flippant remark that the two fortissimo chords that open the act are \\"Puccini's method of telling the audience to shut up and listen\\", a little later Mr Osborne tells us that the repetition of these chords in the middle of the bleak winter brilliantly described with quiet music seems to be \\"a miscalculation on the composer's part\\". It never occurs to Mr Osborne's that the chords in question might be, for instance, an amplification of the drama for which the cheerless winter alone is not enough. In the very next paragraph, the author high-handedly tells us that at the appearance of Rodolfo \\"he and the orchestra between them produce a reminiscence from the happier past of Act 1 which is hardly appropriate to the situation.\\" As a matter of fact, since Rodolfo is about to break with Mimi and is reluctant to do that, such reminiscences are more than appropriate.It is obvious from the very contents of the book that Puccini was a very slow worker, producing even in his prime no more than one work every few years. While engagements in productions all around the world (from Milan to London to New York), quarrels with librettists, and certain laziness on his part may have played part in this, the main reason certainly was his perfectionism and conscientiousness. Keeping this in mind, I do think we can do him justice only by first trying to find some way to explain his own use of his own music, and then - and only then - by trying to impress our own fantasies on his works. Not so with Mr Osborne. He accuses Puccini of poor dramatic sense and inappropriate use of his own thematic material on nearly every page of his musical analyses. To say that this is arrogant is an understatement. As I have shown several times already, it doesn't require some startling intelligence to supply alternative, and dramatically relevant, explanations of Puccini's music. Far-fetched and fanciful as they may be, I really don't think they are a bit more far-fetched and fanciful than anything the author may offer you. But Mr Osborne goes even further. Discussing Alfano's ending of Turandot, he finishes the last chapter of his book thus:\\"The short final scene which follows without a break is disappointingly perfunctory. After the chorus has sung a few bars of the Imperial Hymn, Turandot announces that the name of her unknown suitor is Love ('Il suo nome e Amor!'), and with a choral restatement of the theme from Calaf's 'Nessun Dorma': not altogether appropriately, since Calaf had used that phrase to declare that his mystery remained locked within him, but there can be no guarantee that Puccini would not, in any case, have chosen the same phrase to bring the curtain down. He was not very particular in these matters!\\"Truly stupefying! Imagine Giacomo Puccini, one of the most dedicated to the theatre composers who hardly composed anything else but music dramas, being ''not very particular in these matters!'' And why should Alfano's ending be regarded as ''not altogether appropriately'' conceived? Actually, it makes a wonderful sense that the same theme should be used at both places, for it is only in the finale that Calaf's mystery is finally revealed; it is no longer ''locked within him''. Significantly, Mr Osborne neither offers an alternative solution nor reminds us that the ''restatement'', in this case as in many others, varies greatly in orchestration and character than the original appearance of the theme. Thus it may well serve a dramatic purpose Mr Osborne never even imagined.Yet this is not the end. There are few paragraphs by way of conclusion of the whole book which Mr Osborne uses for an outright ad hominem attack on Puccini, declaring that he lacked, not only the musical genius of Verdi, but also his qualities as a man. Or in the author's memorable words:\\"His will, bequeathing a very large sum of money to Elvira and to Tonio, [Puccini's wife and son] was thought distinctly ungenerous by many because, unlike Verdi's, it left nothing to charity or to his community. More to the point, surely, is the lack of generosity of spirit Puccini revealed in his lifetime. His character was neither philosophically reflective nor especially attractive in any way. He was self-centered, and his principal interests outside his music appear to have been sex, fast cars, and the shooting of birds.\\"Big deal!As far as artistic stature is concerned, well, it goes without saying that Puccini did not have the versatility or the productivity of Verdi; nor, for that matter, his melodic gift. That said, within his narrower range Puccini did achieve the utmost mastery. Apart from Verdi, Wagner and Mozart, no other composer may boast four music dramas - La Boheme, Tosca, Madama Butterfly and Turandot - which are in the repertoire of almost every opera house on the planet. Mr Osborne admits with his usual grudge that Puccini is indeed Verdi's successor, as often claimed. But it is a claim well-founded on several fronts. Where Verdi left off with Otello and Falstaff, Puccini took over with Manon Lescaut (which is still revived regularly, and it is well-worth it). From Puccini's contemporaries, the verismo masters Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Cilea and Giordano, none has remained in the repertory with more than one opera (which is hardly as revered as any of Puccini's ''big four'' anyway). The most important point to note is that Puccini's works are not just popular. They have remained so for about a century now. And there are no signs that their appeal with audiences all around the world is diminishing.As for the purely ad hominem rubbish, this is really very base of Mr Osborne. It is very feeble and irrelevant, too. First of all, if we are going down this shameful road, we may make a fine case that Verdi, like Puccini according to Mr Osborne, was hardly a man of any great sophistication, culture or philosophical depth. And we can make quite a nasty case that Verdi was and remained all his life a peasant. But this is absolutely the wrong way all the same. For what exactly, pray tell me, do the personal shortcomings of a composer have to do with his artistic achievements? Unless you are a snobbish prig and a nauseating snob like Mr Osborne (to give him back his ad hominem with a vengeance), the answer is that: nothing whatsoever.Last and least, Mr Osborne should be reprimanded for his spectacular laziness. The parts dealing with the historical background are often riddled with quotations of intolerable length. Their value is rather a mixed bag. It is completely fascinating to read the extremely graphic scene of Butterfly's suicide in the short story of John Luther Long (one of the main sources for the libretto), but a full page with the bizarre \\"English\\" that was bestowed on her by Long and Belasco (who adapted the story into play, another source of the libretto) is totally unbearable stuff. Both the play and the story are also quoted at unreasonable length, with Mr Osborne barely supplying few short comments in between. It is also charming to read a whole scene from Sardou's La Tosca, the one that became the basis for the beginning of the first act, but do we really need it in the original French with English translation running as footnotes? The only place where Mr Osborne's profligate quotation is excusable, and even desirable, are Puccini's letters. Ironically, they largely refute his foolish attempt for character assassination. They draw the picture of a man, not so much self-centered and ungenerous, as remarkably self-assured and candid.In short, excellent resource for historical background, extremely poor inspirational value and deeply flawed musical analyses, marred by negativity and superficiality. A book to be read selectively and with great caution. Even worse than Mr Osborne's Wagnerian attempt actually, as his dislike for Puccini seems to be more deep-seated and all-pervading."},{"Title":"Inside Greenspan's Briefcase : Investment Strategies for Profiting from Key Reports and Data","review":"Rob Stein's book is a work of genius.

This is the controversial question behind The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the Globalisation of Sex Commerce, one of six edited books by scholars from the Research Network on Gender Politics and the State (RNGS). The network, established in 1995 and including 39 researchers from 16 western post-industrial countries, aims to study women's movements and women's policy agencies to determine what effect, if any, they had on getting states to improve women's status in the late 20th century. RNGS came into existence after the publication of Comparative State Feminism, edited by Dorothy McBride Stetson and Amy Mazur (Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1995), when it became clear that more extensive research was needed to analyse state response to women's movements' demands. Joyce Outshoorn and her team of researchers examine prostitution policy in twelve countries (Australia, Austria, Britain, Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United States) and should be applauded for their decision to focus on prostitution, which is generally considered to be a public health or social problem and is thus often relegated to the sidelines of political science/policy debates.Outshoorn's introduction provides useful background information for those who are unfamiliar with the sex work/sexual exploitation discussion, which has split the feminist movement since the 1980s. She also explains how prostitution was traditionally seen by states as either a \\"law and order\\" or as a morality issue until the second wave of the women's movement brought prostitution back onto the political agenda in the 1970s and problematised the issue. It is interesting that the researchers did not take the nation state as their point of departure for analysis but rather policy debates within each individual country. Outshoorn cannily fends off criticism that this qualitative approach lacks the rigour of its quantitative counterpart (i.e. national case studies) by arguing that careful attention to detail and increased observations make the qualitative approach more useful for theory-building. Outshoorn also outlines how each researcher was careful to stick to the RNGS framework when classifying results so as to \\"maintain reliability and to avoid the problems of conceptual stretching\\" (14). This is certainly the case throughout the book, as information is presented in a remarkably consistent fashion.However, despite Outshoorn's team's impressive methodology, it soon becomes tiresome to read one detailed policy debate analysis after the other and I often found myself bogged down in detail and losing sight of the broader picture. This is perhaps an unfair criticism, as I read the book in one sitting for the purpose of this review instead of \\"dipping into\\" it for information on one individual country as a \\"normal\\" reader might have done. Thankfully, Outshoorn provides a neat summary of her analyses in the conclusion, which answers her original question - \\"Do policy agencies matter\\" - in the affirmative. Outshoorn emphasises, first and foremost, that women's policy agencies were particularly successful (in nine out of the twelve countries) at achieving access to the debates and attaining their demands when they managed to gender the prostitution debate, as it had remained profoundly gender-neutral up until the 1970s, glossing over the fact that most prostitutes are women. Interestingly, the United States was the only country to focus almost exclusively on prostitution involving young boys, thus completely ignoring the \\"female question\\". Some countries preferred to focus more on trafficked women, possibly because their assumed victimhood made them less of a political \\"hot potato\\" than those women who were perceived as having, for whatever reason, chosen sex work. Another factor, which contributed to the success of feminist policy agencies was if they were allowed to participate directly as \\"insiders\\" in the policy-making process. Most important, however, was the policy environment, especially if it was compatible with the approach of the women's movements, although the data of the research team highlights that \\"issues around sexuality appear to lie on a different dimension in politics than the left-right divide, and that the left is not always one's best friend on these issues.\\" (291). These results explain why radical anti-pornography/anti-prostitution feminists and the religious right have often forged an alliance, which is not as strange as one may think.Perhaps one of the most striking aspects of the study is its emphasis on the profound differences between feminists as regards their policy demands and successes. For example, we learn that in the Netherlands, a distinction is now made between voluntary prostitution, regulated as sex work in brothels, and forced prostitution, prosecuted as illegal; in the Australian state of New South Wales, street prostitution was legalised in 1979, although it was later prohibited in areas near dwellings, schools, churches and hospitals; of course, Swedish prostitution policy, which took the unusual measure of criminalising the client in 1999, has received the most attention in the press in recent years. As interesting as these differences in policy outcomes are, however, they leave one fundamental question unanswered: how successful were these individual policies in their aim of improving conditions for prostitutes and minimising the danger of their work environment? I am aware that my question here is somewhat unfair, given that the focus of The Politics of Prostitution prevented such a question being answered, yet it is a question I cannot prevent myself from asking, having worked with street prostitutes in Glasgow and witnessed first-hand how their lives were made even more complicated by British prostitution policy. Writing about the effects of policy in the Australian State of Victoria (a brothel licensing scheme, strengthened in 1995) we learn only, for example, that \\"to date, it cannot be said that these measures have offered better and safer working conditions for most workers in the prostitution industry.\\" (31) As already stated, it is clear that it was beyond the RNGS team's remit to delve too deeply into this area, yet I would suggest that a book dealing with these matters is long overdue. If such a book existed, feminists would perhaps be able to get beyond focusing on the polarity of the sex work/sexual exploitation debate and concentrate on ensuring that prostituted women get what they deserve most: protection, not condemnation, from the state and a life free from violence and persecution."},{"Title":"The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the Globalisation of Sex Commerce","review":"I haven't had the chance yet to buy & read this book.

So I will recommend the book as a very useful one in the history of Christianity in the 20th century (incidentaly the name of the seminar as well). Reading this text in relation to the others out in or around its publication really gave us all a good perspective.That said, it has to be the silliest and least well-argued book on fundamental theology I have ever read. If you really have the time to read this book, I suggest you read next to it Rahner's Foundations and Pannenberg's Systematic Theology, to give you a good overview. You'll see that, basically, Henry proof-texts and extrapolates from the Bible doctrines already suited to the fundamentalist outlook he owns. Clearly, Rahner also comes up with an equally Roman-friendly doctrine, and Pannenberg's is Lutheran and ecumenical, but neither Rahner nor Pannenberg come even close to flirting with the myopia and Bible-worship Henry seems quite proud of. It is almost unfair to read these three authors together, but they are held to be representative of their traditions (maybe some grumbling about Pannenberg) and it may shed some light. Henry's position is, if the Bible says it, that settles it. Rahner doesn't so that with the Magisterium (he was one of the most radical periti at Vatican II), and Pannenberg doesn't do that with anything that I can see excpet his experience of the risen Christ and the liberation that entails. So, unless I accept Henry's basic presuppositions (sorry, I am not willing to be that ahistorical), I am not going to get much out of his work at all except 20th century history of conservative evangelical thought.

Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"This magnum opus of Dr. Henry's theology is simply the most thoughtful, incisive, and relevant work in modern theology, evangelical or otherwise.Henry's basic propositions are at once both simple and profound - that revealed truth must be communicable in propositional form, that is, in complete sentences, with subject, verbs, and objects. Truth is not a commodity for the intellectually or spiritually elite. In other words, if you cannot tell me in plain language what the truth is, then I must question whether or not what you are considering is really the truth. Furthermore, God has set this example by personally revealing Himself in this manner in our own objective, external history - the same history of which we are all now a part. This is not to say that there are truths in the universe that are not communicable verbally, only that the Truth that has been revealed by God must be, and has been, communicated in that manner.Henry's antagonists are those theologians (Barth, Bultmann and company)who propose that history is of two kinds - the day-to-day, external, objective history with which we are all familiar, and a special, internal \\"geschichte\\" history where God reveals himself internally to individuals within gaps in the causal uniformity of external history, and the less extreme theologians (Moltmann, Pannenberg, and company) who propose that there is one, encompassing salvation-history (\\"heilsgeschichte\\") within which there is no distinction to be made between the natural and supernatural and hence, no need to distinguish between two different kinds of history.Although some find the concepts of geschichte and heilsgeschichte intellectually appealing in that the altogether-other God is revealing himself in an altogether-other history that is suitable to His nature, it falls short of the biblical concept of salvation, in which God has revealed Himself personally and powerfully within our own, external day-to-day history, where we live, die, marry, raise children, and work out our lives. The logical conclusion of geschichte seems to be that, if our salvation has been wrought in a different kind of history that stands apart from our own familiar day-to-day history, then so must our Christian life be wrought in a similar fashion. Heilsgechichte hold up slightly better under scrutiny, but still falls short by de-mystifying the supernatural into the realm of the ordinary. Henry demonstrates that these concepts are neither biblical nor Christian.Once, he told us a story about a press conference he attended with Karl Barth. During the question and answer period, Dr. Barth was engaged in several lively discussions on his theme of geschichte. When it came Dr. Henry's turn to pose a question, he asked, \\"Herr Barth, what would the newspapers have read on the morning following the resurrection?\\" The visibly disturbed Barth responded, \\"Did you say you were the editor of Christianity Yesterday, or was it Christianity Today?\\" Henry calmly responded, \\"That would be Christianity yesterday, today, and forever.\\"I am aware that his detractors use the tired, old, \\"just another [biased] *evangelical* perspective\\" argument, as if the mere use of the term dispatches Henry's contribution to the growing body of truly irrelevant theology. I sometimes wonder if these detractors have taken the time to make an honest appraisal of Henry in the same manner as they request the rest of us to do with Pannenberg, Moltmann, Barth, Bultmann, and company? Or even worse, does geschichte and helsgeschichte captivate their attention because they allow salvation to be considered separately from the course of daily life?I am afraid, however, that you must read Henry for yourself and decide, as I, the student, am not greater than his Master."},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"Carl Henry was a theologian of great character and insight.This series is his opus.A few clarifications: Dr. Henry was an Evangelical theologian not a Fundamentalist (he broke with them in the 40s), a term which is particular to Protestantism from 20th Century America; but which was redefined by a religious studies project at the University of Chicago to defame any conservative religious viewpoint which may effect public values.

God, Revelation, and Authority. 6 Volumes.Seeing the incomplete rubble of humanism and a shattered epistemological foundation, Henry attempts to provide a consistently Christian perspective to God, authority, reason, the limits and benefits of systematic theology, etc. Henry argues in the opening books that we are facing the rise of a new Dark Ages. Humanism cannot maintain a long-term vision for civilization, but neither can the modern church, given their inane infatuation with the world and their faulty epistemology (assuming that the church shares a Foundationalistic or Postmodern epistemology). Therefore, the Church must reorient herself around vigorous thinking and a firm commitment to Scripture.*Focus*Henry's main sparring partner is Karl Barth. Barth was arguable the most influential voice of the 20th century (if not always the best voice). Therefore, when Barth speaks people listen. Henry listened and responded with 6 volumes. This is where reading Henry gets difficult. Many readers will hear Al Mohler or David Wells (rightly) praise Henry as a clear theological voice in this century. That is true, but one must also know the context in which Henry wrote, otherwise nothing is clear.Another difficulty in reading Henry is the deep, philosophical well from which he draws. I began Henry with *no* philosophical background whatsoever. I was lost on many of his discussions. Without a basic philosophical framework in mind, I thought Henry was skipping from topic to topic. So, before beginning Henry I would recommend a basic philosophical overview (Colin Brown or Richard Tarnas). While slow going at first, it will pay dividends later.Also, it wouldn't hurt to know what Barth is saying either. I do not share Barth's worldview. I think it is dangerous and a wolf in sheep's clothing. That being said, Barth appears in almost every chapter. Begin with a small Barthian book (*Humanity of God*, perhaps).While I can't give a full overview of what Henry said, here are some questions/issues he wrestles with:*Is human language adequate/sufficient to deal with religious phenomena? Henry takes the affirmative and deals with Langdon Gilkey.*Can man actually do a systematic theology? If so, what constitutes biblical categories?*How does God reveal himself to man? When God reveals himself to man, he uses propositions that have corresponding truth-value.*Is natural theology adequate, or even viable? No. While I agree with Henry's conclusions, I think Greg Bahnsen via Van Til does a better job here. Interestingly enough, and Henry didn't develop this point: deny natural theology and natural law goes out the window. If natural law is not an option, then what is? Think Greg Bahnsen.*On the practical level, how are evangelicals to do theology and face the crisis of the future? Evangelicalism lacks the intellectual nerve to write a modern day *City of God.* In other words, the Secular West is falling at an alarming rate (as was Rome) and we need, but lack, an Augustine to answer the crisis. (I will address this in my conclusion.)Now, as to the reviwer who said that Henry ended up arguing for a god as abstract as Aristotle's, I have only to say that he/she did not read Henry. Henry spends 30 pages arguing specifically against such a deity. Oh well, wisdom is justified by her children.Henry's Method for Theology is as following:Divine revelation is the source of all truth, the truth of Christianity included; reason is the instrument for recognizing it; Scripture is its verifying principle; logical consistency of a negative test for truth and coherence a subordinate test. The task of Christian theology is to exhibit the content of biblical revelation as an orderly whole.\\""},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"Carl Henry had an illustrious career, which influenced most theological seminaries and bible colleges, some even unbeknown to today's generation. In a time of opposing views from differing higher-criticism schools (Bultmann, Barth etc.) his was the lone evangelical voice calling to remain true to the revealed and propositional Word of truth.'Christianity depicts itself - essentially theological though it be - not as a supremely constructed metaphysical theory, but as a revelation, differing in kind from secular philosophies grounded in rational reflection. Its basic premise is that the living God should be allowed to speak for Himself and to define the abiding role of reason and the meaning of revelation.' p 95His work is majestic. His grasp is overarching, always worldview-ish, always generational, always God-centered. The 6 Volumes display the journalistic powers he had, and the power to reason and debate.

He passed away recently, but his influence in especially Christian institutions and seminaries will long outlive those of Bultmann and Barth.The following quotations are from one chapter alone, 'Secular Man and Ultimate Concerns', Book 1:'The ecumenical movement with its focus on 'what the Spirit is saying to the churches' rather than on what the inspired Scripture ongoingly says, has meanwhile been more open to an emphasis on charismatic renewal than on a recovery of the Reformation.' 1:131'The universal disclosure of God penetrates deeply into all man's confidences and doubts.

Henry (1913-2003) was the founding Editor of Christianity Today, and one of the foremost evangelical scholars of the 20th century. In these six volumes (originally released in three sets of two volumes, in 1976, 1979, and 1983), he summarizes a lifetime of research.In his 1999 \\"Series Preface,\\" Henry states, \\"The six volumes ... represent my effort to challenge the course of modern theology..... 'God, Revelation, and Authority' is a challenge to the fluctuating theological outlook of a century that lacked religious compass bearings.... I aimed to exhibit the logical power of truth and the permanent relevance of the scriptural alternative.\\"The first four volumes are subtitled, \\"God Who Speaks and Shows.\\" Volume I, \\"Preliminary Considerations,\\" argues that \\"the debate in theology today ... is being waged most fiercely over the significance of the competing cultural frameworks and interpretations of human meaning and worth,\\" and asserts that \\"Christianity professes to supply the enduring conceptuality that alone makes possible an ongoing unity of theology, philosophy, history, and science.\\"The next three volumes contain Henry's \\"Fifteen Theses\\" (which are briefly summarized in ten pages in the Preface to Volume II), such as, \\"Revelation is ... God's free communication by which he alone turns his personal privacy into a deliberate disclosure of his reality\\" (#1), \\"God's revelation is rational communication conveyed in intelligible ideas and meaningful words\\" (#10), and \\"The church approximates the kingdom of God in miniature\\" (#14). The scope expands significantly in volumes III and IV (Vol. II was 334 pages, while III and IV are 487 and 614 pages, respectively).The last two volumes are subtitled, \\"God Who Stands and Stays,\\" in which Henry argues, \\"that divine revelation is rationally given and is to be rationally understood, is a basic presupposition of biblical theology,\\" and \\"The biblical presuppositions concerning God remain the most significant guideposts for human affairs and for the planet that provides man's temporary dwelling place.\\"Though fairly comprehensive, GR&A; is no \\"Systematic Theology,\\" summarizing all of Christian doctrine. And Henry is sometimes too prolix in terms of his summaries and commentaries on other theologians (James Barr, author of books such asFundamentalismin particular seems to receive far too much attention), and somewhat skimpy on Henry's own views. Nevertheless, this series is an indispensable addition to any serious theological library."},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"I've not had as much opportunity to pore through Dr. Henry's masterful work as I've wished to have. This is a truly scholarly work, not for the shallow of mind, but for the thoughtful reader. It will certainly be found far more worth pondering than either the touchy-feely or pontificating idolized by the destructive reviewers whose only real basis for objection is that &quot;His postions are lucid, logical, and precise.&quot;! Oh my! God forbid that positions should be lucid, logical or even make sense, something mindlessly equated with &quot;Aristotelian lenses&quot; (meaning: it doesn't agree with me), as they are predictably blind to their own. His refusal to come down to such a tower of ignorant babble understandably condemns him from the start, but for those few heroic today who still will pursue truth instead of the mindless fantasies of modernism and post-modernism, or even admit there's any to pursue, unlike today's minions too self-centered, narrow-minded &amp; bigoted (intellectually or otherwise), ignorant and lazy to do so, will find a real treasure trove here, pearls unrecognizable to swine (Matt. 7:6), but oh so wonderful to the diligent, noble Berean who dilligently searches to see if these things are so (Acts 17:11).For a good post-mortem on modern theology, including the &quot;Death of God&quot; &quot;theothanatologists&quot;, see John Warwick Montgomery's Suicide of Christian Theology, though any of his works are worthwhile, including his &quot;In Defense of Martin Luther&quot; dealing with those who love to twist and pervert Luther to serve their own ways and ends as badly as they do Scripture."},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"\\"Evangelical theology is heretical if it is only creative and unworthy if it is only repetitious\\" said Carl F. H. Henry (9). Henry attempted to answer what kind of future modern theology held. In the mid-1970s, he envisaged a theology of \\"no God,\\" a study of the \\"Lord of the past,\\" \\"the dead Savior,\\" and an \\"irrelevant logos.\\" After forty years his predictions became reality attesting that God was considered a \\"non sensory reality\\" (1:23); however, it was not God, but man who was suffocated to death in lack of truth and meaning (1:29). From this profane vacuum, Henry elicited a poignant admonition sui generis in order to revive the \\"God who speaks and shows\\"; he propounded the fifteen theses that affirmed supremacy of divine revelation against the unwieldy controversy over the reality and nature of such divine disclosure (2:7-16; vols. 1-3).Nevertheless, Henry recognized that his environment, i.e. the vacillating status quo of science, mass media, universalism, liberalism, fundamentalism, nihilism, pragmatism, different religions, new religions, and even diverse yet anti-Christian cultures from every side circumvented and precluded his attempt to revive a \\"true and meaningful\\" theology based on the authority of Scripture. Counteractively, Henry proffered his prolegomena, i.e. vol. 1, which preceded the discussion of the fifteen theses.First, Henry seemed to point at modern philosophers: From Kant and Descartes to Hegel and Schleiermacher: philosophers effected detrimental consequences for modern theology whether intended or not (1:36ff). Second, theologians like Barth, Bultmann, and Schleiermacher, according to Henry, dismantled the whole foundation of Christian belief system when they diminished the sufficiency of God's revelation in Scripture and enfeebled the authority of Scripture: whatever their own purposes were they obfuscated the meaning of Scripture, turning it into mere myth and experiential resource (1:44ff). Interestingly Henry then moved into a discussion on epistemology. In a move that he only justified later when he drew his theses on the propositional truth of Scripture (cf. vol. 2). Again this is remarkable that Henry actually foresaw this demise of true theology in 1976 (In fact, his prophetic envisions preceded this in 1947 with the publication of The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism). As Winston Churchill's own countrymen forsook his warnings against the rising Nazi regime (cf. Churchill, Memoire, 149), many of his contemporaries neglected his warnings, which only a decade later provoked him to write Twilight of A Great Civilization, which affirmed that his words had been fearfully relevant.The intricacies of modern theological methods demanded, as Henry realized, new theological theses rather than amendment of such schizophrenic theologies, which only left Henry unworthy resources unable to build up true theology. Thus, Henry's progressive argument successfully illustrated a tactical and teleological supremacy of his theology; he elevated reason through revisiting Augustine and Aquinas, and provided a strong \\"philosophical rationalism\\" (90) on the basis of the \\"Christian revelation\\" (93), which let the living God alone \\"speak for himself\\" (95). With biblical conscience and theological conviction, Henry captures what he believed to be God's message in his revelation (cf. the fifteen theses). Whether his philosophical theology is the best cure for modern theology is yet to be tested, and Henry's heavy dependence on Gordon Clark's assertion on the propositional truth of Scripture seems vacillating, but his methodological arguments against modern theological methods are efficacious."},{"Title":"God, revelation and authority,","review":"The debate over the reliability and authority of the Bible goes on.

Because of her background, she makes the tragic stories of the first five women who climbed K2 (Wanda Rutkiewicz, Liliane Barrard, Julie Tullis, Alison Hargreaves, and Chantal Mauduit) come alive. These women were all complex individuals, but they all had what I consider an insane drive to achieve something few people would bother to achieve. And in the end, like so many other top mountaineers, they ended up dead.Some may romanticize their deaths as something they would have \\"wanted,\\" that the manner of their deaths was better than rotting away from Alzheimer's, cancer, or getting killed in other, more mundane accidents, but in the end this reader was totally appalled by their foolhardiness, their stupidity even. Just in case the reader may think I am sexist, I also think it is idiotic for men to engage in high-altitude mountain climbing. Sooner or later, there is a very real chance a person will die from it. And for what? For bragging rights? Talk about pointless.Nevertheless, this is a great read, almost as good as Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The True Stories of the First Five Women Who Climbed K2, the World's Most Feared Mountain","review":"Just like everyone else, I could not stop reading this book!

Or is it a weakness for climbing cliches? It is difficult to find well - written mountaineering books, and Jordan's lack of climbing experience (or is it writing experience? Or both?) marrs this attempt.The climbers she covers are all exceptionally interesting, and Jordan does do an adequate job of depicting the difficulties encountered by female alpinists in the hyper macho, competitive and male dominated world of Himalayan climbing. Especially interesting to read about are Mauduit and Rutkiewiecz, opposites in their personal style in the Himalayas. But I do agree with other reviewers - too much juvenile male-bashing here. And given the arena, its not hard to find easy targets.But her attempts to resurrect the psychological states of these five dead climbers can be awkward, and sometimes just inept or embarassing. The writing in general is unexceptional, too amateurish, and sometimes I wondered how much she really knew about the climbers, or climbing in general. In the end, it comes off as an attempt to write a feminist critique of Himalayan climbing by trying to show that there was some general feminist motive shared by all five of these climbers. And as they are all dead, we can't ask them, but Jordan founders in this respect. In the end their only shared legacy is a love for the highest ranges in the world.Overall, worth reading. Not worth buying."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The True Stories of the First Five Women Who Climbed K2, the World's Most Feared Mountain","review":"After finishing this extraordinary book, I was compelled to put my boots on and head out for a hike.

She also avoids that common problem of many nonfiction accounts, including every irrelevant detail her research uncovered. Instead, she sifts and sorts to provide the right level of information and keep the narrative flowing.The main problem with the book is the hackneyed writing. She uses cliche after cliche to try to describe the women's relationships with the Himalayas and the obstacles they encountered on their climbs, and even as I was gripped by the actual events - avalanches, fights among team members, frostbite and snow blindness - I found myself rolling my eyes again and again as she employed another banal, overused phrase in an attempt to impress the reader with her passion for her subjects and the material. Instead of adding to the narrative thrust of the book, her writing continually takes you away from the subject to think, \\"Oh, God, another journalist writing her first book.\\"Given the other reviews, this problem will not bother many readers.

I knew nothing of alpine climbing to begin with, but became engrossed by the descriptions of the mountains that inspired the lives of the first five women who climbed K2. Myself, I am inspired by the strength of these women. One reviewer commented that the author seemed to have something against male climbers. I did not get this feeling, but rather felt that she was descrbing things as they were, with men often resenting and feeling threatened by these women's accomplishments. As other reviewers have said, these women were indeed complex. I was struck by the pattern of some of their deaths: continuing on when weather was bad for example, or underestimating their need for gear in their summit bids. But then, at 8,000+ meters in freezing temperatures and with little food to eat and scarce oxygen in the air, one can understand how decisions would be difficult!

As Jordan portrays these women, they're pulled to K2 with the force of a drug, and it's totally understandable. As each woman passes through her pages, the picture deepens - and while I know I could never live life to the extreme that these women did, and pay the price they paid, I shared a little of that mystical intensity of experience through Jordan's fine writing."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The True Stories of the First Five Women Who Climbed K2, the World's Most Feared Mountain","review":"There just aren't many books by women about high-altitude climbing so this one was a welcome addition to the pantheon. Jennifer Jordan (who is not herself an Alpinist) has written an interesting but slightly flawed book about the lives and deaths of the first five women to summit K2.Everest may be the world's tallest mountain, but K2 with it's unpredictable weather systems, isolated location, avalanche danger (made more prevalent by global warming), technical complexity and colder climate is considered the more difficult climb. At the time this book was written, out of the nearly 200 people who had summited, only five were women who are all now deceased (there have been a few more women who have successfully summitted in the time since.) Three had died on the descent, the other two later on subsequent climbs. In the group were two Frenchwomen (Chantal Mauduit, Liliane Barrard), one Pole (the legendary Wanda Rutkiewicz) and two Brits (Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves.) Jordan has researched their lives as best as she could given some (particularly Barrard) left little in the way of autobiographical information. Along the way, they deal with sexism-both from the Pakistani government as well as, more depressingly, their male climbers-as well as certain advantages of biology (women seem to be less prone to high-altitude sickness and frostbite although the reasons for this are still speculative.)Jordan has lots to say about sexism in mountaineering that was quite illuminating. Additionally, she is a worthy voice for these women who are not near as famous as their male counterparts. She clearly liked some of the protagonists better than others but she does make the effort to portray them as the complex, flawed and original women that they were. There is lots of information about the history of mountaineering both in the Karakoram and on Europe's summits and some great anecdotes about the women's early climbing experiences.What was less enjoyable was Jordan's thesis that there is a curse on women who climb K2 (the mythology being that K2 is masculine energy as opposed to Everest's feminine energy.) With a 1 in 7 chance of a climber dying on descent, it is sad but not surprising some of the first women to climb K2 did not make it down. As many men in the book survive K2 only to die on a future summit as well (Michel Parmentier, Rob Hall and Benoit Chamoux to name a few), Rutkiewicz and Mauduit's later deaths are indeed tragic, but also not unexpected. High-altitude climbing is a hobby with high mortality rate. No mystical reasons need be sought and I think it does something of a disservice to the climbing community-female in particular-to spread superstition. As some other reviewers, I also found Jordan's habit of speaking of the dead's thoughts in their final days as disconcerting since some, such as Hargreaves who died in a storm on her descent from the K2, could not have left a record of her thoughts on making the summit. While Jordan mentions in the beginning she took \\"Perfect Storm\\" liberties, it was mildly off-putting.Despite these complaints, I still did enjoy this book. It is for the most part well-written and gives attention to a chapter in mountaineering that is sadly marginalized. Read it and learn about the pull of the Death Zone, the history of K2, and the victories a small group of exceptional women experienced in a male-dominated sport."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The True Stories of the First Five Women Who Climbed K2, the World's Most Feared Mountain","review":"Savage Summit outlines the lives of the first five women to summit the notorious K-2, a mountain renowned for its negative energy and misogynistic vibes.

It is apparent that Ms. Jordan spent a great amount of time in researching K2, as well as the other 8,000-meter peaks that she so vividly describes. This is truly a book that I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Three Fates by Nora Roberts Is fantastic. I was a little worried with how she would handle the three different love stories in one book but ofcourse the unstoppable Ms Roberts pulls it off. And boy does she pull it off. My favourite couple were Malachi and Tia but the other two were great too. This is one of the less scary of Robert's romantic suspence novels. I like all of them but this one has more of a focus on romance and just works on all levels.So worth anybodies money!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"It was fate that Nora Roberts have another hit. This woman knows how to tell and story and make you wish you were part of it. The characters draw you into their lives and you feel as if you're actually their living the moment with them. A must read for all Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"My favorite from Nora thus far. I still have trouble deciding on my favorite couple. The plot was never lacking and the humor, as always, was top notch."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"First off, let me say that while I do like series where the characters are recurring and plot lines that twist together, I am a little tired of having to read all the trilogies that Nora Roberts puts out. I am a big fan of her work, but I find it frustrating that I enjoy so many of her series, and then never end up finishing them (based mostly on a tiny budget and lack of dorm room space).The Three Fates, however, had it all in one package. Usually the three main couples would have been broken up into a three part series, but here they all come together and fit like puzzle pieces. Well-developed and intriguing, this book is definitely worth the investment.The story revolves around the Three Fates, a set of mythical statues that have been separated by history. In comes the Irish Sullivan family: Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca. By a twist of fate and lineage, they end up searching for the fates, and along the way rewrite their destinies. Their counterparts take the form of Tia Marsh, a mythologist, teamed up with Malachi; Cleo Toliver, former stripper, teamed with Gideon; and Jack Burdett, security expert, teamed with Rebecca. Over three different continents and multiple cities, these three couples chase the Fates, with the infamous Anita Gaye tight on their heals. Anita is one of the more perfect villains, driven by greed, ambition and vanity to get what she wants. And she wants the Fates. It will take all of their diverse skills to stay one step ahead of her, and deal with falling in love at the same time.As I said before, normally Roberts would break up the stories into a series, but it was all intertwined in this novel of suspense and love. The characters were layered, the plot thick, with just enough humor to keep it from being too dark for a Roberts' work. Yet again her style comes through, with verve and enthusiasm. If you are in the market for good reading, without the burden of buying the next in the series, I recommend this book heavily."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Loved this book. I'm new to Nora Roberts- this represents my third read. I thought the characters, suspense and dialogue were all very entertaining. This was a relaxing, heart-warming escape. Clever turns, lots of variety of locale & action but it all was sewn together very well. Ultra-romantic too. Thanks Nora!!! I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I read Three Fates for the first time when it came out. Since then I have read it about three times (4 in total) and it gets better each time I read it. It is the story of the 3 Sullivans (Mal, Gideon, and Rebecca) and the three people who fall in love with them (Tia, Cleo, and Jack), each of whom have a line on one of the three legenday statues known as the Three Fates. Since one of the Sullivan ancestors had stolen the first of the statues just before the Lusitania sunk, the Sullivan family has kept the statue, never searching for the others. That is until Mal takes their statue to Anita Gaye, who steals it from him. Now the chase is on. First, Mal goes in search of Tia, whose ancestor had owned theirs before it wa stolen. Then Gideon goes looking for Cleo, whose ancestor is believed to have the second statue. That is where the trail ends until they meet Jack, who has a surprising connection to their past. Together, the 6 of them work together to get the first statue back from Anita.Three Fates is a thrilling adventure full of twists and turns that keep the reader enthralled from the first page to the last!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"The primary requirement of any work of fiction is that it be convincing. I wasn't at all convinced by \\"Three Fates.\\" I wasn't convinced that three little silver statues were worth millions of dollars or worth risking life and limb to acquire for no particular reason. I wasn't convinced that the Sullivans et al. would have cared enough to risk their lives to get the statues. Nora Roberts usually does a better job of convincing the reader that the tale was at least remotely possible.The characters themselves aren't much more than one dimensional, with the possible exception of Mia, the author of books about mythology. She at least had some texture with all her imagined ailments. The Sullivan brothers are hard to tell apart. Cleo, the stripper, is simply crass and not much else. The others are of single character traits as well--tough, sniveling, murderous, egotistic, etc. Characters have to come alive, have contradictions, for a book to work, and that doesn't happen here. Jumping in and out of bed, per se, does not do it--at least, not for me. The sex scenes are just re-runs after all.Finally, there is the problem of the writing. There seems to be endless talk, and that smacks of padding--anything to fill the requisite number of pages. I found myself leafing ahead to see when the story was going to pick up again.All in all, this is a disappointing book. Roberts has done far better."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"this is a book ive been putting off reading for a while and i wish i hadnt waited so long. good story, good characters, steamy scenes and some excitement thrown in. there are 6 main characters but she picks 2 that are more main then the others. its definitely worth checking out, its long but youll make it through quick."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I am a Nora Roberts fan. I love her books she keeps me so captivated I usually can't put her book down. This one had way to many passages, to many people and to much going on at the same time. I do love the suspense and the story line but the problem is I didn't know sometimes who she was talking about. If you like a story line and a book that constantly moves and of course the evil person who wants it all at no expense than this is a good book for you. I still love Nora just this book is just not like her others."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I was rereading this book last week and realized what it was that made me not love this book. It wasn't the plot - a fun plot about the search for three statues that go together (The Three Fates), but because there are three 6 main characters (3 couples), it feels like you don't really get to know any one of them well enough. What I love about Nora Roberts is her characters - she just has awesome characters that you can't get enough of it. But I felt that each couple separately was too little information. She really was trying to cover too many plots in one story. If she wanted to do out this properly, she should have done a trilogy (like she's been doing with others like - the vampire series of last year for example).Anyway, the book is good - just not one of her best. I definitely felt like I was left short at the end."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Whenever I need a light, fun, fast paced, happily ending read I turn to Nora Roberts. Three Fates wasn't anything spectacular for me, but it was an entertaining book that I enjoyed reading. The characters were all interesting and although a bit formulary, their relationship with each other was compelling.The story revolves around the Three Fates, three statues that are meant to be together, but at the beginning of the story, are in three different hands. Supposedly when together, the Fates have powers and a net worth that far exceeds that of each of them alone.A group of six people, including a family of two Irish men and their sister, come together to find the Fates, restore them back together, and sell or display them as they belong. There is also an evil woman who is trying to do the same. There is a race to the finish, as well as some twists and turns thrown in. In Roberts typical fashion there are three love affairs thrown in (note six people on the search team, three men, three women), and a picture perfect end to the story.I haven't read enough Roberts to compare this to others. However, I can say it is an interesting and captivating read. It isn't earth shattering or cerebral in any way, but it is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Malachi, Gideon and Rebecca Sullivan are siblings with a mission. They are the owners of a small silver figurine, one of a trio of figurines that, apart are merely valuable, together are priceless. The Sullivans had a dream of reuniting the pieces. However a miscalculation on their part, resulted in the theft of their own figurine by an unscrupulous and greedy antiques dealer. It becomes a race against time and a battle of wits between the Sullivans and the very dangerous Anita Gaye to locate the other two pieces. Along the way the siblings encounter adventure, murder and love.This story unfolds itself in three acts. The first act is merely the setting of the stage, the meeting of the players. Malachi, the oldest of the Sullivans attempts to tracks down one of the Fates through Tia Marsh, a neurotic hypochondriac who is tougher than she looks. Gideon the middle Sullivan son tracks down Cleopatra Tolliver, a tough, free-spirited stripper who just might know something about one of the figurines. And Rebecca Sullivan, the youngest daughter with a talent for hacking gets surprised by Jack Burdett, a security expert who knows a lot more than about what is going on than anyone else. We also get to meet the nefarious and beautiful Anita Gaye.The second act brings all the players together. The six people with an abiding interest in the Fates form an uneasy alliance. Not altogether trusting, they squabble and keep secrets until a shocking act of malice forces them to realize that Anita Gaye is more dangerous than they thought and they need to band together to defeat her.Things really get enjoyable in the third act. It reads like an old fashioned caper where MISSION IMPOSSIBLE meets OCEANS 11. The band of six each use their own unique talents to trap a spider in her own web.This was a fun book. Being a Nora Roberts, it of course is well written and full of sexy romance. In that sense the book will hit some very familiar notes for Roberts fans, especially the first two-thirds of the book. If the whole book had run on the same vein, then this would have been a 3-star book. But in the last third she kicks it up a notch and it gets really fun. I liked the art of the con and the understated humor.My only quibble with this book (and this is why it is a 4-star and not a 5-star) is the character of Anita Gaye. She was a boring villain. Too villainous, too black not enough grey. For those Roberts fans who've read PRIVATE SCANDALS you will recognize the doppelganger of Angela Perkins."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"What a shame that Nora Robets put her energies into concocting an elaborate plot with such unappealing characters. Her heroes and heroines lacked the usual depth and selfless motives. Some really unbelievable plot devices (eg.who would expect to bring a statue through customs in a purse without being searched?) The finale had some excitement, but overall a disappointing book for someone who has enjoyed her many other novels."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I am a die-hard Nora Roberts fan...this book just didn't do it for me...there were too many characters (three couples) crammed into one book. Many scenes had all six characters together in a room which tended to get confusing. It felt like one of her trilogies crammed into one smaller book. Is Nora trying to imitate Suzanne Brockmann? Suz does it much better. Second, I was repeatedly questioning whether the storyling seemed realistic or not (e.g. decisions to not include the police/FBI/other \\"authorities\\" in very dangerous situations). Third, I'm not sure what I (or other readers) though about the ballerina-turned-stripper character. Somehow, it felt more degrading to read about her rather than liberating. Overall, I was disappointed. I'm hoping the third part of her latest trilogy is better!!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"In Three Fates, Ms. Roberts once again combines the Irish with the American way of things. This story takes you on a ride of romance, greed, and most of all, intrigue. The three siblings, Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca are determined to reclaim their stolen Fate from the charming and deadly Anita Gaye and also find the other two Fates. On the way, they each find someone they are drawn to and eventually realize that they cannot live without. Tia, the mythologist, is a scared, timid, hypochondriac; Cleo, the sexy exotic dancer, and Jack, the wealthly collector who is also a securities expert-all are connect in some way to the Fates and in turn, to the siblings and each other. This is a highly enjoyable book, and I honestly could not put this down until I was done with the last page."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"There are enough love stories (three main ones)and plots in this to have been a miniseries. It's a good thing it wasn't because the main story wove everything together very tightly.You've got a fantastic mix in this book. Take one erudite but shy heiress, one temperamental stripper, one naturally brilliant Irish girl, one pair of well-mannered Irish brothers, and one paranoid security firm owner with all the right connections.Add in some energetic sex, thrilling escapes, daring missions and crushing revenge and you've got this wonderful fun, funny, and occassionally heart-wrenching tale.This is a truly well-crafted story that you don't want to miss!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts books. It's also one of the best books I've ever read. I truly enjoyed the characters and how they interacted with one another, and following the exciting plot with it's twists and turns. This book is a page-turner and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I began to read Nora Roberts back in the early 1990's. Back then I always looked forward to her books. In the two or three years I haven't read any of her books because I thought that she was not writing at her best. Well, I got a copy of the \\"Three Fates\\" hoping that she had improved. Well, she hadn't.The \\"Three Fates\\" tell the story of the Sullivan Family how a past family member came to posession of a small statue after the sinking of the Lusitania. After having it stolen from them, The Sulllivans will stop at nothing to bring the Three Fates back together again.This was a slow book, that had simple characters, who had a hard time holding my interest. The only reason that I finished it so I got it off of my bookshelf and into my used bookstore bag."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Runaway adventure, romance and suspense are lined up in Nora Robert's opus which spans from the sinking of Lusitania on May 1915 where Greenfield steals an antique Greek statue from Wyley and miraculously survives. The Sullivans who are Greenfield's descendents decides to trace the other two statues to complete the valuable collection. The Irish triumvirate consists of Malachi, the eldest who is attracted to mythology professor Tia Marsh in his information-gathering; Gideon, the second son gets hitched to cynical exotic dancer Cleo while Rebecca falls for Jack Burdett, a security expert who owes the third piece. Ambitious antique collector Anita Gayes is the villain who resorts to murder and deceptions to lay hands on the statues. While Three Fates is a jaunt of an adventure, the plot while sprawling remains assuringly predictable with a cliche villain. Roberts's most vivid portrayal is perhaps Cleo who is the most daring and vivacious out of the three. This resonates too the readers' desire for the more daring experimentation that appears in the earlier works of Ms. Roberts."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"As always, Nora Roberts give us a beautifully constructed story with wonderful characters and settings. Unlike her usual novels, Three Fates focuses on 3 couples as they search for 3 statues. Their search takes them to Europe, Ireland, New york - and each of the 3 couples are diverse and captivating.This easily could have been as 3 separate stories (like her other trilogys) and i was disappointed on how brief some of the storylines for the couples seem. But all in all, it was a great summertime read!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I have to admit it! Three Fates was quite fun! The plot was very readable, with the characters moving from Helsinki to Ireland, and from to Prague to New York, all for the sake of the three fates and pots and pots of money as well as romance. I especially enjoyed the beginning, with scenes of the sinking of the Lusitania. Well done."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I felt that Three Fates was a great read. It kept me entertained through out the entire book and I couldn't wait to what the characters were going to do next. I laughed, was on edge and got mad a couple of times. To me that qualifies as a good book. Three Fates is a book to get comfy with and let your imagination swirl around you!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"What I can I tell you, except that I loved it!!!! Could not put it down. There was something magical about Malachi and Gideon, (have to love those Irish men). Tia was very special and kept me laughing most of the time. Malachi should be commended for turning Tia around. I did not like Cleo that much at the beggining, she was not right for Guideon........ Jack and Becca great toguether and Eileen should have participated more on the quest. Great story over all, excellent plot. I wonder if Anita Gaye will escape from prison and tries to steal the Fates again, will make an excellent sequel."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. There are so many threads running through this book and she ties them all neatly up at the end. This is one of those books that you say &quot;I'll read ONE more chapter, then go to sleep&quot;...over and over! You will LOVE all the characters-and they are SO varied!!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts has outdone herself yet again... as in Montana Sky and The Born in Ice, Fire, Shame trilogy, she has written the story of siblings in a convincing, entertaining, loving way that not only keeps your interest but captures your heart.Roberts had a knack with tales if Irish origin, and it was nice to see her return to that influence in her latest novel. With so many re-releases of her earlier work, it is easier each day to see how Roberts' skill has inproved and her scope broadened. She is much more than a romance writer. She's a marvel."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This book was very enjoyable. The characters were all likeable (The ones that were supposed to be anyway) and the plot was interesting, as well. Beca, Gid, and Mal, were all the classic irish characters full of backbone and pride, which i love. the way that everyone is connected to the statues and each other is clever. Twists and turns at every corner, I love it! Anita Gaye was a good villian. She was the perfect amount of evil so that the story wasnt too twisted, but i did find her to be a little on the slow side when it came to catching on to what malachi and the other were doing, not that i didnt love seeing her go down! I also liked this book because the storyline wasnt surrounded by romance, the thrill of the plot is what the book was mainly about!But bact to the question in which i entitled my review. Could it have been three seperate books? ... No i dont think so, everything happened at the same time, how could the author leave out certain parts just because it didnt fit in with a certain couple. There just wasnt enought time between events to make it a trilogy. And even though at times when all of the characters were talking together it got confusing if you read it carefully enough you can figure it out.SO in closing, the reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of five was because when compared to other books by Nora Roberts this one isnt one of her best. Very Good, but not Best. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys fast paced, never a dull moment, thrillers, with a hint of romance to balance it out, Nora Roberts fans shouldn't be dissapointed, I wasnt."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts did a good job in this book, but it was a little hard at times to keep all the story lines in check. She would start off with one character, and then the next chapter you would all of a sudden be introduced to a new one on a different story line. Once all the characters have lines that mesh together, the plot was a cinch to follow."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts continues to amaze me with her writing! This book was probably one of the best books she has written. It combines mystery, romance, murder, and mythology all under one cover. The plot never stalls, it is fast moving. I started reading the book and didn't want to put it down. Three Fates will not let you down! I'm so glad that her kids got on her nerves back on that snowy Western Maryland day so she would start to write and keep me spellbound on the days my kids are doing the same. Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This is the second Nora Roberts book that I have read and it will probably be my last. This decision is prompted in great part by the fact that I am not a fan of romance novels. (Excuse me; the cover calls Ms. Roberts a write of women's fiction. And please, get another photo that makes you look less like a .... well makes you look a bit more plesant.) At any rate, for me to read a work of \\"women's fiction\\" there needs to be more there than a love story. Well in the case of this book, it's three love stories; and amazingly, between three siblings. And of course they are all trying to unite the three fates. The trilogy thing gets overworked, as does the analogies to the three fates.The three fates are three women from mythology. The first spins the thread, the second measures it, and the third cuts it. By the middle of the book, whenever one of the characters, usually Tia, went into another one of their soliloquies about \\"weaving-the-thread-into-a-tapestry-and-we're-all-destined-to-be-together\\" rants, I just skipped to where the story actually started again.At any rate, Ms. Roberts' attempts at injecting some form of meaning or depth into her fiction are shallow and contrived.As another reader pointed out the Prologue was good, and then, the book falls flat on it's face. I have always been amazed at how in \\"women's fiction\\" people manage to fall in love at first sight. In reality, I just don't think that happens. We have six people in this book, three of which are related, and they all fall madly, head over heals in love within hours of meeting their soon to be partners. The chances of that happening are slim to none. And the pairings are so bizarre. We're to believe that a healthy Irishman who runs a boat tour company in Ireland is going to fall for a neurotic, wealthy PHD; that his younger brother is going to fall for a rebel, ex-exotic dancer, who is also rich but has had a falling out with her family; and that their sister falls for a wealthy self made man in the security business. Of all the romances, the last was to me the most believable.Bottom line: not really believable, not literary, not worth your time.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"What a great story from Nora Roberts! Loved the characters and couldn't put it down. Great summer read. Also check out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin - WOW!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I have not even finished this one yet but I have to say I love it!. The attitudes, the neurosis, the melding of all these differnt personalities. But, the best part is you get a trilogy all in one book! It is brilliant the way she has created 3 seperate love stories in one single book. I am hopeful for more like this."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I really enjoyed this book, particularly the historical aspects. But the token gay character bugged me. I shouldn't say that - she so rarely writes any at all, I guess I ought to be grateful. But I\\"m not. A black gay man who's a dancer in New York City? Is that really the best Ms. Roberts can do?"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This book was definitely a fun read. It took a little while for me to get into it, but once I did, I wanted to get home as soon as possible to keep reading it! I would suggest buying this book."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I read romances not only for the I-love-you parts, I like romances that offer 3 dimensional characters and various personalities that conform a family-type environment. Now, when you get a funny and interesting bunch of friends who, against all odd, act like family and are bound together by a mystery involving fantastic objects with history, twists, fast paced adventure and a bit of magic, now you got yourself a winner. Three fates is romantic, but it is more like an adventure book with good sex, quirky characters and very interesting combination of magic and history. It is faster paced than most Nora Roberts' books, and it is from her mythology-magic era, but it is not her usual, couple meet-hunted down by obvious killer-everything is find, type of story. three fates is one of the most unique works of this author. So, if you are a fan of Roberts', read this book if you want to get out of repetitive looking romances. If you have never tried this author, you are loosing on one of the best American fiction writers there is. Nora is a great author, no matter how many books of hers you read, she has a way of pulling you to the pages and into the story that is unique and exemplary. Besides, I promise you the one in three fates is not a plot you have seen too often in any books. If you have, please let me know where I can find them, because i haven't.Over all, great for new and old fans alike."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I love Nora Roberts books and I loved this one I was reading the book but wanted it on cd so I could multitask and listen to it in my vehicle.

I find I cannot be disappointed.She is just that Good."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This older tale by Ms. Roberts is told in classic Nora style. By that, I mean she creates three female leads and three male leads that come together to make three romantic and interesting couples. They work together towards a common goal, and battle a ruthless villain. This is a fun story. Any fan of this prolific author will have a great time with this book.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I can nearly always count on Nora Roberts to write a good book, so if I see something that even remotely sounds interesting, I can pick it up without hesitation.Three Fates is that good, solid book. It has seven or eight main characters, and each is well-written. Of course, the three fates as a collective are a character in and of themselves. Each character, or set of characters, is given an opportunity to be on top so the reader gets to know them.Because of the number of main characters, and the chance each got to be up front, when I finished the book, I actually felt like it was a bit too short. So much was put into characterizing that the last few chapters of mostly action weren't really enough for me. Some of the personal advances seemed wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am. I must note that I enjoyed reading the book, and while I was reading, this too much, too fast didn't feel that way. It's only on reflection afterwards that it seems that way.I liked the characters (the ones I was supposed to like, anyway), even the peripheral ones. I'd like to read more about the core family characters, whether back in Ireland on their home turf, or on travels related to the job, in the case of Jack and Rebecca. I'd like for Ms. Roberts to find a way to work the cop and the Greek Tycoon into the background of another book or two. The cop might even be able to carry a book on his own (with a female companion, obviously - this is Nora Roberts).Bottom line - I enjoyed it and it was a good use of my reading time.I read the hardcover version of this book, and I don't remember where I got it. I do know that I paid for it, so I got nothing out of this except the pleasure of reading a good book."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"After reading Three Fates I can honestly say this book needed a lot more work. I honestly believe it should have been made into a trilogy. The reasons being that the 3 couples highlighted in this book were just not given enough foundation to build believable relationships. Especially the relationship between Jack and Rebecca. They were, I thought, the most promising couple of the three but were not given nearly enough scenes together. All of a sudden they met and the next day the were in love. Believe me I am a huge romantic and definitely believe in soul mates and falling fast, but this fast was just not anywhere close to reality. Part of what makes Nora's books so amazing is her ability to make her characters extremely relatable. The plots or story lines may not be, but her characters always are, and thats what makes her books so wonderfully believable. With Three Fates I felt all of the relationships were extremely rushed and there was just not enough behind these characters. I also felt that the main characters, the siblings with which the book was set on, did not have enough content to make readers develop a connection to them.I believe that if this book was a trilogy it would have had much more potential and would have turned an okay story into a great one. If each of the couples and their quests for each of the fates were devoted to one book in the trilogy, it would have given the characters a chance to really develop and made their relationships much more believable and relatable.Overall, I give this book 3 stars because I believe no Nora Roberts book is below that. But next to her other books such as Montana Sky (which also had three relationships, but was done the right way) or Carolina Moon, Rivers End, Hidden Riches or any of her trilogies, Three Fates just pales in comparison.Again a story with potential as a trilogy but very messy and predictable as a book."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This book as absolutely charming, exciting, and very funny.The book starts out with Malachi and Tia.Malachi is the oldest brother of an Irish family. His family has a legendary story from a great-great grandfather, who had brought a silver Fate statue into their family. However, he knows there are two others. So he tracks down someone somewhat unsuspecting to his intentions for information.Tia is totally clueless, and very adorable. She's a book writer, and studies in the greek mythology. She's kinda kookie, and she's not sure how much she can trust Malachi. She needs plenty of advice from her lawyer and hairdresser to help her see things clearly. She also has this goofy attribute from her mother; she's very obsessive compulsive with the maniacal many diseases that her mother has instituted to plague her mind.There are also secondary stories intermixing: With Gideon, the second brother and an exotic dancer running through Rome and being chased around New York. And also Rebecca, the younger sister gets pulled into the mix with a wealthy New York security executive, who also collects sculpted art and has a personal interest in the Fates."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This is the story of the search and struggle for the small statues of the three fates. The fates are interlocking or stand-alone. Together they are nearly priceless. There are six characters who lives intertwine and make for great reading."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Once again Nora Roberts manages to keep her readers enchanted with a storyline that is completely unique. Mixing Greek mythology into the plot is a wonderful way to keep things interesting and prevent the story from becoming stale. It's always refreshing to know that if I pick up a book by Roberts, I am not going to be sucked into another typical \\"romance\\" storyline with Fabio as the leading man. Robert's realistic characters blow me away everytime, and the amount of knowledge this woman has of various cultures and general information just amazes me."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I loved the way Nora was able to put three stories all in one book. I felt the storyline flowed nicely between all the characters. Her characters are often very similar to other books but you gotta love them anyway. I thought the story was well written and I didn't want to put the book down. Again, Nora has done it! Whenever I get bored with other romance novels or mysteries, I always turn to Nora for a winner every time."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora is very capable of making three relationships into one book very credible, a la The Villa, but Three Fates didn't live up to that expectation. It had an absolutely great storyline, but the story itself wasn't her best told. Although Three Fates is wildy incredible in every aspects, the rushness of it was not easy to follow, and the dialogues seemed different from Nora. Hope Chesapeake Blue is going to good."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Like most others, I have found Nora Roberts to write consistantly interesting and entertaining stories. Like some others, I have found this one lacking in many areas. I was able to take breaks without worrying about what would happen next. This will not stop me from picking up her next novel, but I hope this was a blip in the otherwise consistant creativity I have come to expect from Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"this books is great, especially if you are more drawn to Nora's romantic suspense novels. It never fails to amaze me how Nora links her characters together, and this book is a prime example of that.For those of you who are avid Nora fans, you know her books range from romance, romatic suspence, fantsy and more. In this book, you get a little of all her genius. Starting with historical, with the sinking of the Lusitania, then the legend of the Three Fates, a trio of small statues and the quest of several people trying to obtain them. Nora also gives the reader a little bit a greek mythology, which makes me wonder, is there anything this woman can't write about?Once again, she introduces us to three siblings, and gives the book a strong family element. The siblings of course, find love, but never without trial. The villian is a little over the top, as her motivation is not really substanial enough to make her actions believable. I only point that out if that sort of thing matters to you, to me it does not, because I certainly don't read her novel for their believability, I read them to be swept away in a story. And that, unquestionably, is something her novels always do for me.Is this book my favorite of hers? No. But it's definately worth the price of the harcover."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I'll have to admit the book cover sounded interesting enough, but it seems NR gets into everything by threes, and it gets to be a bit much. I thought the women in this book were as goofy as all get-out, as well as an embarrassment to the female gender. And I never cared much for that. She had all the couples climbing into bed together too soon. The plot surrounding the Three Fates was a great idea, but the prose failed to follow through. I still think NR's first books were some of her best, and I still believe she's one of the greatest romance writers of all times. I'm just not big on this book. I've read much better with NR's name on the cover."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Wonderful read! Once again Nora is able to spin a tale about strong family ties, love, revenge and so much emotion that you can't stop reading until the end... and then you are left wanting more.Loved this read!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts has drawn again on her love of Ireland to depict this novel of intrigue, romance and humour.It tells the story of the Three Fates - small statues - and one family's determination to re-unite the set against the odds. Along the way, each one of the clan meets their match and towards the end are all united as a group against the protaganist who also wants the Fates. This character was a little weak in comparison to previous villains in Ms.Roberts books but this did'nt upset my overall enjoyment.There were great moments of humor and I loved the characters of Tia and how she overcomes her hypochondria, loud, brash Cleo and gentle,strong Rebecca. The three guys Malachi, Gideon and Jack were great too!!Although the characters were not as finely drawn as in previous novels - the downside to having three couples/relationships in one book - I'd still recommend it as a great read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Like the other reviewer said this was not one of her best. I liked the characters, though. They all seemed interesting, especially Tia. She reminds me of someone I know (and like), with all her hypoallergenic and natural products &amp; health problems. But the quest for these satues, I didn't understand and I thought that it was just unbelievable that they managed to get everyone together and be robbing all these places and sending Anita to jail without hardly a hitch. Also the subject of how far the characters would go for revenge &amp; greed kind of upset me.But there were some good parts in there"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"The three Sullivan siblings Malachi,Gideon and Rebecca are determined to recover a family treasure which was stolen from Mal some years ago when he was duped and seduced by a clever, ruthless antiques dealer Anita. When the passenger ship \\"Lusitania\\" was sunk by German torpedoes at the beginning of WW1, the ancestor of the Sullivans, Felix Greenstreet seized his opportunity and stole a silver statuette which was subsequently handed down as a family heirloom. Three statuettes make up the whole piece and the Sullivans begin a search to locate and purchase the remaining two pieces as well as regaining their own original statue. This is an extremely entertaining story involving greed,lust, murder and fast chases around Europe and the U.S. The \\"goodies\\" are all likeable and good looking and the story is peppered with sizzling sex scenes which don't overstep the bounds--in other words--a darn good read ."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Roberts does it yet again!

One of my favorite Nora Roberts books and I've read them all!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"While this book wasn't bad, I did find Three Fates too busy to be entertaining. It seems to me that this book was very similar to The Stars of Mithra, but with different characters and a statue instead of gems."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"In \\"Three Fates,\\" Roberts takes us to two intriguing European countries, one of which is seldom the setting for novels of this genre - Czech Republic. While Roberts romanticizes the southern Irish city of Cobh, she unfairly portrayed Prague as a dreg city from which one would long to escape and never return. She did a good job portraying Irish-English dialog, but fell short with her Czech. The only Czech word in the book is \\"Praha,\\" which is Czech for Prague. Nowhere else in the book does she include any Czech words, tribulations that the American exotic dancer Cleo may have gone through to learn the language, her reaction to the sound of the language, or hints about the Czech culture except that Prague has an area that is teeming with strip clubs (as does every major European city). An uninformed reader might think that Czechs don't even have their own language. Homework, Ms. Roberts! A little \\"jak se m&aacute;, dobre\\" would have been a nice touch here. And I wonder how many readers know that \\"Cobh\\" is pronounced as \\"Cove\\"? Nowhere do we read this in the book. Other than that, of course, I found it an exciting read. Despite the opinions of other reviewers, I thought the story had just the right amount of character development, especially for the villianess Anita."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"NORA ROBERTS NEVER FAILS. THREE FATES WAS WITTY, SUSPENSFUL, AND A GREAT READ."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I'm an avid Nora Roberts reader--I've searched out all of her old stuff that's being reissued this year. I found the story good for a light beach read, but not nearly as good as some of her classics (i.e. Honest Illusions, Hidden Riches). It seemed somewhat perfunctory, with everything neatly fitting the formula--a little too pat for me. I don't buy many hardcovers any more, and I wouldn't spend for this one. Paperback, maybe"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Another terrific novel by Nora Roberts. I couldn't put this book down. What a great story going back to the sinking of the Lusitania and tying it into a modern day murder mystery full of suspense and some great touches of romance. This story introduces the Sullivan family...three colorful and totally delightful Irish siblings who meet their mates in pursuit of the mythical \\"Three Fates\\". As always Nora Roberts weaves a tale full of surprises and great characters!!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Very dissappointed with the use of trashy language. I usually buy Nora Robert's books without thumbing through them first. Won't do that anymore. Usually pass on my books to my Mom, but not this one. Recently we were discussing how we enjoy Nora's books and appreciate they aren't full of profanity. I truly hope this isn't what we can expect from her in future books. If so, I won't be spending my money on them. The story line was great. She's too good an author to resort to the profane."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I have to say that when I first saw this book on shelves, I hesitated to buy it. Nora's books of late have been lacking. Still, I hoped for the best and bought it anyway. The only interesting chapter was the prologue and it went downhill from there. It was drawn out, totally boring and could've been wrapped up in less than one-hundred pages. The characters were unlovable, the plot was horrific and I couldn't even get halfway through it. It aws the first Nora Roberts book that I remember not finishing. Save your money people, Nora has totally lost the talent that pennned such books as Hidden Riches, Montana Sky and Honest Illusions. Maybe all the fame has gone to her head and she doesn't think her fans are deserving of a well-thought out book. T ime to look for a new author which is heartbreaking because Nora has been mine for almost a decade. However, I can't continue to shell out money for books that make Nora richer and leave me unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I could not get through this book which for me is very disappointing. I am an avid Nora Roberts fan. To me this book started okay but was too boring to keep going. It is rare that I will stop reading a book before the end. My time is valuable and I felt it was being wasted . I hope others do not judge Nora Roberts based on this book.My favorites of hers are:The Three Sisters Island trilogyThe Irish TrilogyThe Donovan LegacyMidnight Bayou"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I am a Nora Roberts fan, but this was one of the best. I loved the unique and witty characters."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Although the book was entertaining, it wasn't quite up to par with some of Roberts previous books. I've read almost every single one of her published books - and this one wasn't one of those books that just gripped you til the very end. Sometimes I read her books in one sitting - because it's so interesting I just can't put it down. This one took a few days- because I wasn't enthralled with the story. Perhaps it was because I didn't really feel like the Sullivans REALLY had any claim to the other two fates. Perhaps it was because I wasn't too enamoured with one of the heroines who was a stripper -- and how that was, in some ways, glamourized. Perhaps it was because once again we have men and women falling in love and getting engaged within a matter of days ... hahaIf you're wanting a casual read, this is for you. If you're wanting another NR \\"thriller/mystery\\" - this one doesn't pass the test."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers here (e.g. the characters make it into bed with one another before the plot starts rolling, Cleo's character can be less pushy, dialogue can be confusing at times when all six characters are talking all at once, etc.), but I am still giving the book four stars, as opposed to three and under, because Three Fates was definitely a good read, if not a perfect one. The plot definitely takes some creative twists and turns, and Roberts has made an obvious move away from her usual only-revealing-the-bad-guy-until-the-end model, which actually enhances the plot and the flow of the story. The suspense is effectively interwoven with heartwarming romance, so even though the book does not show Roberts at her best, the entertainment value is still up there."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"The Sullivan siblings, Malachi, Gideon and Rebecca, are on a mission to find the three statues which are known in Greek mythology as the Three Fates. One of the statues had been in their possession until it was stolen from Malachi by Anita Gaye, a rather unscrupulous art dealer from New York City. The three Sullivans travel around the world meeting other individuals who also have an interest in reuniting the statues. The combination of the Sullivans and their new found partners in searching for the statues brings the reader a great story. There is mystery, romance and danger in the search for what they feel is their rightful possession of the Three Fates.This is a great summer read. Loved it from start to finish. Nora Roberts has provided another great novel."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This is Nora Roberts, it has to be good! I look forward to every new book that she puts out, and have yet to be dissappointed. Most of her books follow the formula, boy meets girl, they fall in love but don't tell each other, have a big fight, then make up and say they love each other, THE END. This really works, but with this book, we have a different story all together, combining the lives of these three siblings in a way that makes the story exciting and hard to put down. This is a definite read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This novel was gifted to me by my father, who is ninety. He can't get enough of Roberts. Indeed. The blurb on the jacket says: \\"Nora Roberts is indisputably the most celebrated and beloved women's fiction writer today.\\" The Three Fates refers to Greek mythology, which my father used to read to me before I could read myself. I have fond memories of that. And so I began ... and then I quit, after reading 417 pages. I was 7/8ths of the way through the story and had had enough. I knew how it would end and didn't care for the characters - the heroes or the villain. If I'd have thought the villain would triumph, I might have kept going. But time is precious (whether or not our time here on earth is fated.) It was six against one--three adorable couples against one wicked witch. The three couples (It was fate!) were so full of love and passion and cutesyeness I had to laugh to keep from vomiting. That's just me, obviously many people like this kind of drivel. One reviewer objected because she thought the narrative \\"unconvincing.\\" She was being kind. I think this kind of writing and story does a disservice--putting fanciful notions in the heads of readers that become an ideal and then an expectation and then a projection and finally - heartbreak, grief, despair and blame. Hey, I'm all for joy and the pursuit of happiness - but that that is fated and linked to your \\"soul mate,\\" is just nonsense and a dream buster. People, real people, don't talk and act like these characters. Okay, it's fiction; but fiction informs people about life and remember, 2000 years ago people didn't know much of the way things are. So here we have layer upon layer of fantasy wrapped up as titillating destiny. I think it's fine for a man or a woman of 90 years to read this stuff ... hey, they can look back and rewrite their story if the want, if it brings them joy; but dad, grandma, whoever - don't try and tell your kids or grandkids that that is the way it went down. I was there. So, having set aside THREE FATES, I walked into the bookstore and saw ANTHROPOLOGY OF AN AMERICAN GIRL (2003), by Hilary Thayer Hamann which was on my list of books I wanted to read. Now here's a promising novel ... hmmmm, fate?"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I actually liked the book, I was surprised. I didn't really enjoy Villa or the trilogy with the fairies (started okay - ended flat). I'd also read a couple of bad reviews for this book, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it enjoyable. It did take me a while to actually like some of the main characters, but by the end of the book they grew on me.But, I do have a couple of complaints. The first is minor: the relationships were a bit fast, especially the sister's. Love at first sight is a nice little fantasy but I really think you need to actually hear someone speak before you decide you want to spend the rest of your life with this person. Chemistry is lust, infatuation and attraction, but it's not love.It's not a big complaint, afterall, this IS fantasy, but I thought it could have been done better.My biggest complaint is the 'language.' I don't know what it is with romance writers lately, but from Sandra Brown to Nora Roberts, they all seem to think that swearing is now a requirement for a good story. I don't mind a few words here and there, but when the writers start having them come out of the characters' mouths every time they open their mouths I have to wonder what's going on. Shock value? Realistic? Maybe this is the norm where they live but, as shocking as they might find it, I can actually go thru my whole day with out hearing most of this language. I think I'd probably start avoiding some people if every other word out of their mouths was an obscenity. I really wish the writers would stop trying to go 'reality' on us. This is not my reality.That said, I really did like the story and recommend it to any Nora Roberts fan. But if you are offended by, or just plain tired of, foul language (words that start with 'f' and 'God') you might want to pass on this one."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Years before, their ancester had stolen a small silver statue of one of the three fates. Now, an unscrupulous antiques dealer has seduced one of the three Sullivan siblings and stolen the treasure from him. Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca swear to get the fate back--and to find the other missing statues in the set. Together, the fates are incredibly valuable and can even, the rumors say, grant wishes. But where, after being missing for decades, could the other two statues be, and how can the Sullivans retrieve their missing property given their own doubtful claim?Author Nora Roberts always writes a compelling and emotional story and THREE FATES is no exception. The three Sullivan siblings are intent on their goal, willing to lie and cheat to succeed, but each time they lie, they get into deeper trouble with the true loves that they discover during the course of their adventure.After linking up with a mythology expert who happens to be the descendent of the man from whom their ancestor stole the first fate, a stripper who owns the second, and a security expert whose great grandfather owns the third, the Sullivans are finally ready to make their move. But evil Anita Gaye is also on the trail of the statues she doesn't already own--and she's willing to do anything to get them. It will take a clever plan indeed--like something out of THE STING--to trip Anita up.THREE FATES is an exciting adventure with Roberts' patented sensuality, but it falls short of many of this fine author's other works. First, the Sullivan's ethical or legal claim to the statue they covet is certainly suspect--why, after all, hadn't they attempted to return it to its rightful owner during the decades it had been in their family posession. Second, their scheme to eliminate Anita as a threat seems to me to make them morally little better than she is. Third, the idea of six capable and intelligent people combining to squash a single woman, however evil, seems something short of heroic.I enjoyed reading THREE FATES and would certainly recommend it--but I couldn't help thinking as I read it that Roberts has missed a chance to write something truly superior and slipped back into something merely satisfying."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I give Nora Roberts' latest book Three Fates four and a half stars (if possible) but not a full five. Why? I look forward to every one of Nora's books. They're always head and shoulders above most romance novels. And this one is too - it's very, very good. But it's not her best. What's wrong? Too many strong characters, that's what. I enjoy 2, maximum 3 main leads and then a whole bunch of interesting secondary characters. In the prologue we have the Wylies, Felix Greenfield, the mother, the small child and thousands drowning as the Lusitania sinks. Then we switch to the present cast: Malachi and Tia, Gideon and Cleo, Jack and Rebecca. Toss in a very strong villainess and a good cop friend, some good best friends and you need a Cast List at the beginning just to keep track!! I also resented that Gideon and Cleo, who I truly liked, got pushed into the shadows. And Jack? Didn't he seem like Roarke's twin brother from Nora's IN DEATH series? Strong, handsome billionaire who's a technical computer whiz - I was waiting for him to pull out a brandy snifter, light up a cheroot and say: \\"My darling Eve,...I mean...Rebecca...!\\" Anyway, this is as good a story as any of Nora's but a bit of overkill in the plot and way too many main characters."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Three Fates by Nora Roberts is another really good story. I love Nora's weaving of families together into a tapestry that is the heart of this book. She is so productive and consistently entertaining."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I have never been overly wild about Nora Roberts, but once in a while one of her books will jump out and bite me. this was one of them. I got it from the library and was late returning it because I didn't want to give it back."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts sells a huge number of books, but if you've read her for a long time, you'll notice that, for the last five years or so, they are written from a &quot;Nora Roberts&quot; cookie cutter in the Nora Roberts book baking factory. Anyone can write them. They're getting pretty dull to the point that I've passed on several of her more recent books, where I used to buy them all.Well, this one follows her pattern but the plot is interesting enough to pull the characters along. Not that the plot is believable, but everything is put together well enough for an OK book.If you want to read good Nora Roberts, go back five years and more to her older books.It is unfortunate that many of the classic romance authors are in this cookie cutter phase."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"A good story, nice theme and idea. Strong characters. I really did like the book, as it was the first Nora Roberts I read. But now that I've read her others, I really think that she didn't quite pour all of herself into it. Still, the plot was excellent, settings were great, and the whole idea behind the Three Fates statues uniting the characters in &quot;fate&quot; as it was really played a nice touch. The only thing I thought went a little extreme was it was rather graphic. Otherwise, it was a great read. I do recommend this book to someone interested in a read with adventure, history (even if its fiction), and romance. Cheers."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This was a quest book, pure and simple. The international themes were well developed and the Mystical and mythical elements were interesting. The only problem was a slight lack of depth in the romance relationships. I suppose this is forgivable, since she did have three romances to develop, but you only have to read 'Montana Sky' to know that Ms Roberts can do a better job than this. I kept wishing that I could rearrange the partnerships and pair them up differently. I also have to admit I found the cold-blooded way that Malachi set out to seduce Tia for information bit unsavory, especially when he realised how delicate she was.Having said all this, the book was still highly enjoyable and while perhaps it is not as emotionally satisfying as it could have been, it is still worth buying. I won't be swopping it any time soon."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Considering that the majority of the books that I have read lately have been real stinkers, it's refreshing to finally read a book that is good. The plot held my interest, the characters were fun (even if they were a bit insecure and too prone to love at first sight), and I enjoyed seeing what was going to happen next.The only negative comment that I have to make, is that it seemed as though it wrapped up a little too nicely. It was just a little too easy to break into her house, a little too easy to manipulate the police, and a little too easy to make the scenerio go their way. I would have preferred to have seen them have to struggle a little more, however I really think the three fates were only a sideline to the real story of each of the siblings hooking up with a individual who either had a fate, or whose relative used to own one. The book almost would have been better if it had been stretched out into a trilogy, allowing for a better fleshing of the characters. I would have enjoyed seeing more dynamics between Rebecca and Jack, rather than instantly being in love and wanting to get married. A little too unbelievable for my tastes.However, considering the books that I have read recently (The Pursuit, Springwater Wedding, The Summerhouse, etc.) this one was pretty good. Get it at your local library."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"As the Lusitania is going down, petty thief Felix Greenfield is in the cabin of Henry W. Wyley stealing one of the THREE FATES statues. By the time he realizes he is in danger, he pockets the valuable item, saves a mother and son, and vows to turn over a new leaf. He is rescued and settles in Ireland and raises a family. Felix's descendants, the Sullivans, hold on to the statue until Malachi loses it to Anita Waye, a black widow who slept with him in order to steal it.Malachi and his siblings Gideon and Rebecca not only vow to get it back but they intend to find the other two statues, uniting THE THREE FATES before selling them. The Sullivan siblings meet their significant others while pursuing the statues, not yet realizing that Anita, who is one step ahead of them, will kill everyone who gets in her way. The group must find a way of outwitting her without anyone getting hurt in the process.Nora Roberts has written a work of romantic suspense that will please her many fans as will as those readers who like some romance in their thrillers. The book moves at a rapid pace so nobody will get bored during this fascinating read. The Sullivan siblings and their significant others are a varied group that makes for lively scenes and interactions and turns THREE FATES into one of Nora Roberts' best mainstream novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Three Fates had the capability to be a fine book, however it reads as a jagged outline. The characters do not have the usual full development that I expect from a book by Nora Roberts. The pacing &amp; plotting are out of step and the usual depth of imagery is missing. The potential is there, however I would call this book a first draft manuscript &amp; ask the editor for the revisions to smooth out the storyline. I will continue to buy Nora's books but I have to say that this particular book was born to soon. It misses the mark for fully realized characters &amp; easy transitions from place to place. I was never able to be swept into the story fully, a trait I have come to expect from a novel by Nora."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Of all the hype about this book, I was a little disappointed. It had a good plot,good humor and good characters. In the first half there were times when I lost interest, it wasn't until the last half of the book that I was excited about what the ending would be. The writing was easily understood, the sensuality WAS NOT a 7 as one review said.

Three Fates is a fantastic book. Once I started it, I could hardly put it down.

Their flaws makes them more human and you can relate to their imperfections. Truly a good read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I never am dissapointed when I pick up a Nora Roberts book. Three Fates is no exception! The characters are so entwined with each other that it seems without each part/role the story would never be complete.

Definitely Nora Roberts at her very best - great adventure, great romance, snappy dialogue, great story...!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This book is a definate page turner. Although it is not her best work, it is kept me guessing right until the end. The characters in this book are very different and a lot of fun to get to know. I like the plot and the suspense, but was disapointed that some of the relationships of the characters weren't as deep as in some of her other books. All in all, a very entertaining read. I highly recommend this book as all of her books that I have read so far. I think her novels and trilogies are a lot of fun! I always can't wait for something new from her. I read her books to go to another place and time. She never dissapoints me. This book was a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This was a good NR book. However it was very slow.

Engrossing plot, nice bits of humour smoothly mixed in to make it a fun read.

Amazing to see how luck and love shape the lives of the characters."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts is my favorite author so anything she writes will be a hit with me, but I have to say that this book is at the top of my all time favorites. I read it when it was first released, and then have re-read it so many times my paperback copy fell apart. Fortunately Kindle happened since then and I could get my Kindle version, and now don't have to worry about wearing it out. Tia Marsh is the reason for me that this book is so wonderful. Watching her evolve through the intricate, suspenseful 'sting' operation is a joy. My favorite scene is when she leaves Morningside Antiquities after planting all the bugs and she is skipping and giggling her way down the street just so pleased with herself, and relieved that she pulled it off, too, and thrilled that she doesn't care if strangers think SHE is strange for laughing at nothing they can see."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"this book was refered to me by a friend and I Just love it.

Having read so many other Nora Roberts (especially the trilogies) I had hoped that the intertwining characters would give the same pleasure. It just didn't work for me. It was slow to get started and the characters just didn't develop for me. Not one of her best works.The foundations of the characters were good, strong heroines, interesting me but it didn't go any deeper with them so you never felt the urgency to read more about them.Started - didn't finish."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts is at it once again, turning out another thrilling novel complete with a satisfying story line and sensuous romance. In 1915, the LUSITANIA sank off the coast of Ireland, ostensibly taking with it the first of the Three Fates, small silver statues collectively worth a fortune. But Felix Greenfield, a thief, had the fortune to steal the Fate from collector Henry W. Wyley and survived the sinking of the ship.Fast-forward to the present when Felix's Irish descendant, Malachi Sullivan, attempts to recover the first Fate from Anita Gaye, owner of Morningside, a New York antiques dealer, who duped him of his treasure. In this quest, he pursues Dr. Tia Marsh, mythology expert and an heir to the Wyley fortune. With Tia's knowledge concerning the three female Greek statues, Malachi thinks she just might help his search for the remaining two Fates. Tia's fragility is craftily combined with her brilliance to highlight her strong characteristics, which continue to emerge when Malachi follows her back to New York.Brother Gideon Sullivan embarks on his own Fate-seeking quest when he locates Cleo Toliver in Prague. Cleo, a down-on-her luck dancer working at a strip club, just happened to have an ancestor who supposedly owned the second Fate. Even as Gideon and Cleo embark on a wild affair, some men that think that Cleo may have something they want, chase them through Prague.Enter Jack Burdett, owner of a multi-million-dollar security agency, who takes a trip to Ireland and visits Rebecca Sullivan, sister of the biblically named brothers. Is Jack's interest in Rebecca of a business nature as he enjoys a pleasure tour in her family's boat?When the Sullivans, along with Cleo and Jack, descend upon Tia's New York apartment, the three couples must combine their efforts to locate the Three Fates and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. As the romance heats up, the pairs find that their past and futures are inextricably linked to the Fates.Fast-paced adventure enthralls the reader following the fascinating players as they travel across Europe and back to New York again in this sizzling romance. Ms. Roberts' ability shines as she creates six unique and appealing characters whose differences accentuate their strengths."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"As an avid fan of Nora Roberts, I was delighted to see the story of the Three Fates start and end within the pages of one book. It must have been tempting to split the story line into three lucrative and separate entities, but instead the reader is treated to real interaction between each pair of lovers. In fact, this interaction between all the players is one of the strengths of this book.Ms. Roberts has once again given us engaging characters. Her depiction of Cleo, especially, was beautifully drawn. The reader is allowed to see the entire woman, not just the hot stripper. The Irish contingent is Nora Roberts at her best -- lovable, laughable, and a family truly united. Her villian, Anita, is almost a cardboard cut-out of evel personified, and does not really have an impact on the story line, other than to act as a catalyst for the other characters.An exceptionally enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"This is not the best effort from NR. I had trouble getting involved with the story revolving around Greek mythology and the three fates. The story started out well explaining how the first fate spins the thread, the second measures it, and the third cuts it, but it fell apart after that. I didn't feel the compulsion to reunite the statues.Part of the problem is that the story felt rushed, as it really is a trilogy compacted into one book. Six people meet - Cleo and Gideon, Tia and Malachai, Rebecca and Jack fall hard, and build their lives together. Sorry, I didn't find it believable. The characters were not as finely tuned, as I would expect."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I love all of Nora's books, but this was not her best works.Three Fates is the story of a trio of Irish siblings and their American lovers as they fight to reclaim three ancient statues.Nora Roberts has a distinct gift for writing character driven plots, but the Three Fates did not showcase this ability. Instead we get three implausible love stories crammed into a single volume, with not enough attention paid to each couple.Several characters even fall into the 'unlikable' category, (at least for me). Ex-Ballet-dancer-turned-stripper (Cleo's) constant sarcasm and phrases such as 'slick' etc. Grated on my nerves. Gideon, and Mal, the two brothers had no personality and were virtually interchangeable. Jack was a cardboard cutout. Also,I was surprised at how quickly all the characters jumped into bed with their respective partners. There was harldly any romance at all! =-(The best character in the series was Tia. The slightly anxious mythologist. Nora should have written the book about Tia and Mal, and left out the four other characters.Overall, a disappointing read. I would recommend only to diehard Nora Fans."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Ms. Roberts books are becoming a bit predictable, 3 siblings meets 3 loves-of-their-lives and everyone ends up happily everafter. Well it is fiction. I'm worried about the formula of characters that Ms Roberts seems to follow recently; Women #1 not sure of herself, needs showing how valuable she is. Women # 2 is on the wild side and needs to discover she's worth loving, # 3 is practicle, no nonsense, can't pull the wool over her eyes, yet falls hard and fast for the man of her &lt;our> dreams. Mix up the numbers but the descriptions fit Born in... series, ...the Dream series, or the Ardmore series.I did appreciate the low key sex, I thought the really graphic stuff of recent books was leaning toward pornographic. And, as always, the concept of family figures prominently. I love the Irish connections, I'm as enamoured with the emerald isle and the perceived romance of it's inhabitants as anyone else is."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"Nora Roberts is regarded as one of the most beloved writers from the romance genre. Not content to write what I refer to as pure romance titles, Ms. Roberts is also well known as a writer of romantic suspense books and under the name JD Robb, a mystery series set in the future. Three Fates, a recent book is a good example of both the authors romance writing, sense of adventure and even weaves an ancient tale within the plot.The three fates of the title are three silver statues which when linked together are not only worth millions but are pieces supposedly with great powers according to legend. Also according to legend, one of the fates was lost when the Lusitania sunk. But was this fate really lost after the sinking? Could it have been taken off the ship somehow by one of the few survivors? And what has happened to the other two fates? Most importantly why are certain people being pursued, their homes being searched and then an innocent man murdered? Six young individuals, all somehow connected to one another by family, coincidence and the three fates find one another and romances begin, alliances once thought unlikely are forged, and over two continents the search is on for the three fates.This was a good book. It especially intrigued me to learn of the history behind the statues and where they were hidden for almost 100 years. The characters and each of their backgrounds were interesting and fine examples of Ms. Roberts ability to provide them with far reaching connection to one another. If you enjoy romantic books with a dash of suspense and adventure, Three Fates will surely be a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I loved this story!! It was perfect, we did not have to wait for the trilogies, we got all of them at once.If you are used to Nora Roberts, you know that their are often a trio of friends/siblings that you follow, in this wonderful story you get them all at once. It is nice to have the brothers/sister all involved so closely on the same time line.The backstory is the Lusitania is sunk while a thief is stealing one of the \\"Three Fates\\" small silver statues depicting the greek fates. His life is changed when the ship sinks and he lives. He reforms himself, this is the story of his great grand children.2 Brothers and 1 Sister go after the fates and in doing so find the love of their lives. It is nice having such varying characters in such depth. I loved the dynamics between the 3 women, their strenghts/weaknesses really complement each other and you watch them become stronger because of the bond that they made. I have 2 girlfriends that give me this type of strenght and it was nice to see it written about and captured so well in this book.Not just a great romance, but a wonderful testament to friendships found in unlikely places, which tend to be the most enduring!!!(not to mention hot men and great chemistry) Don't wait, this book is worth full hardcover price!!!!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"The Three Fates was an excellent and entertaining read! The search for three statues that have changed the lives of the people who have held them through history... The blooming romances of the lead characters... Everything interchanging and and intertwining with everything else... I loved how the story was written as a fictional take on what FATE can hold for us. There were a myriad of lines throughout this book that felt simply like poetry to me!I especially liked Tia, who was introduced to us as a paranoid hypochondriac but transformed herself, with a little self-esteem, into a strong woman! And ooooh, Malachi! Why do I always find myself in love with Nora Roberts' leading men? This lady knows how to write a man the way a woman wants!On the downside, I have to agree with another reviewer who stated there were too many lead characters in this one! That was my only problem with this book. As soon as I got engaged in the story of Malachi and Tia, I was forced across the world to be introduced to Gideon and Cleo, and then Rebecca and Jack! Too much! I grew impatient to learn what happened with the first couple by the time I was finished reading about the second. BUT, by the end of the second couple's introduction, you are intrigued and enthralled still!Great job again Nora, keep up the fantastic stories for us chicks who have to get our romance and excitement somewhere!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"When you're as prolific a writer as Nora Roberts, you're bound to repeat yourself a time or two, but The Three Fates rings just a bit too familiar for me. I was waiting at the door of the bookstore the day this was released and had finished it by dinner. And while if offered an interesting story (the mystery and romance of the Three Fates, three silver statues, was the best part) the characters were too similar to other recent paperback trilogies. Basically, she crammed three love stories into one book but I never really felt that I got to know any of the characters well enough to connect with them, with the sole exception of Dr. Tia Marsh. Her shy, hypochondriac was funny and sweet and I enjoyed watching her change and grow. But I would have liked to learn more the Sullivan family, Cleo and Jack. I'd love to see Ms. Roberts' next hardcover focus on one set of lovers so you can really get to know and understand the characters. These three sets of lovers all fell too hard, too fast for there to be any enjoyment watching them take the fall. I wouldn't pass this one by, just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I really wish Ms. Roberts would break out of her trilogy mindset- especially when only half the characters are interesting! I really liked Tia, Mal, and Cleo, but the other three were very flat. Also, long-time fans may find numerous cases of deja-vu in this novel; this author tends to use plot devices and character details over and over in her books.Still, this one went along at a quick pace and kept me entertained. Worth a library borrow!"},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"I am a huge romantic suspense fan and I was not disappointed with this book!! I loved the characters and their romances.

She moves the story along at a rapid pace and grabs the reader's attention immediately. The action in the story is exciting and the romance (sensuality) is not overwhelming, but nicely done.Roberts, as usual, exhibits an amazing knack for writing Irish men. I don't know what it is, but she manages to make each Irish man she writes stand out characters, Malachi and Gideon are *no* exception.I highly recommend this book for first time Roberts readers. It gives a great taste of her style and finesse with a story, as well as being an engaging and fun summer read."},{"Title":"Three Fates","review":"\\"Three Fates\\" by the prolific Nora Roberts is a superbly written, thrilling and romantic tale that readers won't soon forget. Vivid characters, breathtaking settings, and a strong plot combine to make an affecting story of love, justice, and the fateful decisions that shape our lives.When the Lusitania sank in 1915, over a thousand people lost their lives. But Felix Greenfield, a second-rate thief, survived the experience with a small silver statue he had just stolen from Henry Wyley. Unbeknownst to him at the time, that small silver lady was one of the Three Fates, three long-separated and priceless statues. The Fate Felix saved from sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean became a family heirloom, passed down through the generations.Fast forward to 2002, as Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca Sullivan are determined to recover their great-great-grandfather's treasure from an unscrupulous antiquities dealer, Anita Gaye, who stole it from underneath their noses. They plan to reunite all three of the Fates, and will do everything in their power to keep them out of the wrong hands.Their quest will take them from their home in Ireland to Helsinki, where the eldest brother, Malachi, meets a lovely, brilliant, but neurotic professor, Tia Marsh, whose vast knowledge of Greek mythology will be a great asset to their search.Next, Gideon travels to Prague, where he tracks down Cleo Toliver, an exotic dancer and the ancestor of a reputed contact to the Fates. Cleo sees the Fates as her chance at a new life. But it's not long before Gideon and Cleo are forced to flee across Europe from the hired muscle tailing them at every turn.Finally Rebecca, the youngest Sullivan, meets Jack Burdett, a sexy security expert and art collector, when he travels to Ireland in order to figure out the Sullivan's connection to the Three Fates.Eventually, all six of them end up in New York together, pitting themselves against the ruthless Anita Gaye, who will stop at nothing to acquire the Three Fates. Their unlikely team pulls together into a unit in order to recover each of the Three Fates and administer their own brand of justice to Anita Gaye.Amidst the mayhem and excitement of the quest, romance is blooming in the hearts of all the main players. Each romance is distinct, original, fresh, and full of passion and tenderness. It is wonderful watching Malachi and Tia, Gideon and Cleo, and Rebecca and Jack come together. One might think that with three separate romances in one book, there might be too many people and too much going on for proper development, but Nora Roberts skilfully portrays each individual and each romance perfectly. The reader becomes absorbed in the trials and triumphs of the characters to a point where it's hard to remember these aren't real people.\\"Three Fates\\" is a fantastic Nora Roberts novel that you do not want to miss. I was utterly captivated by this marvellous tale, and could scarcely force myself to put the book down until it was finished.

I really think it's going to be rare in a couple of years that anyone under the age of 25 will even consider picking up something like \\"Three Fates\\" to just pass the time.

Gorman (acclaimed Navajo artist)&quot;Pablita Velarde has told the story of her Santa Clara people throughout her career and has become a legend in her own time.&quot; --United Features SyndicateThe cover and title page painting -- titled Old Father Storyteller -- may be Pablita Velarde's best known work. The elder is shown telling people of the pueblo stories about the stars and constellations, which march in an arc across the sky. This painting, which Velarde was inspired to by her father's stories, won the Grand Prize at the 1955 Gallup Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial.It is also recognized by archaeoastronomers (scholars studying pre-contact native star lore) as one of the few records in which pueblo constallations can be identified, and star lore is told. (Long Sash is basically the familiar Orion, for example.) So that story has uses in Native-centered science. Beautiful uses.There are 6 stories in the book, each with several of Pablita's fabulous paintings. &quot;Turkey Girl&quot; is the Tewa version of a Zuni storyteller's remake of Cinderella. Turkey Girl -- clad in finery by her flock of turkeys, instead of a fairy godmother -- goes to a dance, and is not recognized as the ragged orphan, courted by many men. But when she is found out by her mean stepmother, there's quite a different ending from Perrault's (and Disney's).She doesn't wind up with any of those Indian men, indeed, those Prince Uncharmings are all chasing her to kill her for a witch! Some kind of big turkey spirit hides her; she disappears into a canyon with her flock. Turkeys are found no more by people hunting them for food. The moral and ethical meanings in this Indian transfiguration are very different from Cinderella. The only moral of that one is that nice clothes get you in anywhere. The Indian storytellers disagree.Velarde says in her preface: &quot;I was one of the fortunate children of my generation [she was born in 1918] who were probably the last to hear stories firsthand from Great-grandfather or Grandfather. I treasure that memory, and I have tried to preserve it in this book so that my children as well as other people may have a glimpse of what used to be.&quot;Velarde's father was a respected Tewa storyteller in the Santa Clara Pueblo. She and her sisters as children had heard these stories during summer nights when they returned from Indian boarding school (where Native children were forced to go in US government attempts to destroy Indian culture by separating children from their families, language, and homes) to help their father farm his fields. In the late 1950's, when her marriage to Herbert Hardin, a non-Indian policeman, was breaking up, she returned to the Pueblo, recorded her father's stories and translated 6 of the most memorable into English for this book, which her paintings illustrate. The stories are told simply and clearly, as Pablita told them to her own children, and had been told them, as a child, by her father.At that point in her life she was already an acclaimed artist, with the Bandolier National Monument murals, many prizes, and paintings in museums to her credit. In 1954, the French government had awarded her the Palmes Academiques for her outstanding contributions to art, the first time a European government had recognized Indian art as fine art, rather than primitive craft.Dale Stuart King, who had hired her as to paint the accurate -- and artistic -- murals of traditional Pueblo life at Bandelier National Monument, liked the stories and published them in 1960. The book was chosen as one of the best Western books of 1960. This handsome reprint, 35 years later, uses improved color printing techniques to make Velarde's art available to children and others in highest quality. It's one of Clear Light Publishers' best-selling books, and they have (not on Amazon.com) a special slipcased, signed gift edition for $200, for rich folks with art-loving friends.You can see some of Velarde's murals. at http://www.viva.com/nm/PCCmirror/murals.html. These murals in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center are explained and shown, large and in details. In addition, see a painting by Pablita's daughter, artist Helen Hardin, who died untimely young, in 1984 at http://www.wingspread.com/fa/fa048.html.Content and art reproductions and quality are identical in the paperback and hardcover versions of this book. Schools may need to get the paperback for cost reasons; parents and art-loving adults interested in Indian culture should get the hardcover, for permanence.Reviewed by Paula Giese, editor, Native American Books website, http://www.fdl.cc.mn.us/~isk/books/bookmenu.html"},{"Title":"Old Father Story Teller","review":"This is really an amazing book. Velarde's work is magnificent and worth seeing in person if you ever get the opportunity, and the vitality of her paintings comes right through in this volume. It is impossible to imagine the story without the art, or vice versa. The stories are beautifully recounted in a traditional style that is nonetheless easily accesible to readers who aren't at all familiar with the Tewa people. It's a great introduction to an oral literary tradition that most of us would never encounter otherwise--certainly not with so much beauty and attention to detail. I wish she had written more books, because this is one of the best storytime options I can think of--I remember being fascinated by it as a child, and it's still worth a very good read as an adult."},{"Title":"Peterson's Graduate Schools in the U.S. 2001: Explore Graduate and Professional Programs With This Easy-To-Use Guide","review":"The book held no substantive information on the schools or programs.

The difference is night and day. Learning the Basics of New Testament Greek has what you need to learn the language, but it doesn't make it easy. At all.It assumes a working knowledge of grammatical and linguistic terminology, which is unfortunately an unrealistic expectation for most Americans trying to learn a new language.There are three very frustrating aspects of the book even IF you have a basic grasp of how English grammar works:1) The concepts are presented in an abstracted format, crammed together into large blocks of text that present multiple points at once. You get a lot of indigestible English talking ABOUT Greek, but very few visual examples. This book tells you without showing you. It explains difficult concepts and leaves you to apply them later, when you get to the exercises. It is very difficult to use if you are a visual learner, and even the visuals that it does occasionally provide are poorly arranged on the page, crammed together between large blocks of text. Totally lacking are such standard tools of Greek learning as a visual aid for prepositions like the famous circle chart. There are a few basic tables for the declensions and verb tenses in the back, but these could be supplemented. The main problem is that the text doesn't take your hand and lead you through the actual Greek: it explains everything in one massive dose, and then boots you into a big block of exercises.2) The text is unnecessarily complicated by the premature introduction of technicalities and exceptions to the rule. Before even giving you several good examples of the basic concept in action in Greek, the book burdens you with every possible variation and anomaly. Again, mostly without visual examples. It's sort of like someone just standing up and telling you ALL the rules, and then pointing to a page of exercises and saying \\"OK, now go for it.\\"3) Further, within the discussion of a grammatical concept, the text will supply rules that only apply in verb tenses you haven't learned yet-- it begins speaking of situations in the aorist, for example, without even once having told you that there was such a thing as the aorist and without having made any attempt to provide a basic definition of the aorist and its purpose. This is highly frustrating and makes the lessons indigestible.One other complaint is that the vocabulary could be more logically presented-- it doesn't really work from most-frequently used words in the NT to lesser-used words, it just kind of jumps around.In brief, this book is not at all intuitive in its approach to learning language. It is a very stiff and outdated approach which forces you to confront the material by learning the rules in the abstract and then later attempting to apply them in real life. With a good teacher who puts a lot of things up on the board, you might be alright, but this is NOT recommended for self-study.I've ended up working through the parallel chapters in Mounce's book as we go, in order to learn the concepts for the exercises. Do yourself a favor and get Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. It's a very digestible, step-by-step approach to learning Greek that breaks things down well. It has an encouraging and conversational tone, and it is rich with visual examples on the page with a user-friendly layout. Each chapter first presents you with an exegetical insight showing you why a particular point of grammar shines light on a real passage from the New Testament. Then it walks you through ENGLISH grammar and shows you how the concept works in your own language, before walking you through its usage in Greek. This is VERY helpful for people who are not familiar with the mechanics and terminology of English Grammar. Mounce also takes a unique approach that emphasizes learning a few simple rules for noun cases and verb forms that allow you to recognize what is happening in the morphology of a word, instead of having you memorize countless paradigm charts. Translation: less rote memory work. The end of the chapter has a summary of the basic points, followed by vocabulary. The vocabulary is neatly arranged so that you're learning the MOST-USED words in the NT first. The vocab chart actually tells you how many times each word appears in the Bible, and shows you the total percentage of word appearances you have learned of the NT. By chapter 8 you will already be able to recognize 1 out of every 2 words in the NT. By the end of the book, having only had to master 320 words, you will know 80% of the New Testament. Throw in the fact that this book comes with a CD that contains introductory lectures for each chapter, as well as vocab quizzing software and parsing software, and you just can't beat that package, especially if you're trying to learn this on your own. Be sure to get the workbook, too."},{"Title":"The Second Part of King Henry VI (Shakespeare, William, Works.) (Pt. 2)","review":"Who says that sequels never live up to the original? Part 2 of this trilogy does just that! Immediately, Shakespeare grabs us with Gloucester's understandable fury at King Henry VI. This is soon followed by York's conspiracy to seize the crown himself. Later we are offered some comical touches with a false miracle. Some chilling pagan prophecies also grab our attention. Also Later, there is the hard passage where Gloucester uncovers the treason of his wife and later stands trial and is found guilty of crimes he is innocent of. Later his corpse is discovered. Shakespeare does not stop here! There is the chilling triangle between King Henry VI, Queen Margaret, and her lover Suffolk. King Henry VI is at his best in the trilogy when he banishes the vile Suffolk and faces down his queen. The scene where the delirious cardinal confesses his guilt is a scene of horror followed by Henry's touching forgiveness. The rebel Jack Cade simultaneously offers comedy and horror. His death at the hands of Iden is artfully drawn. But Shakespeare does not stop here! The War of the Roses actually starts.The demonic Richard III actually makes his first appearance in this play. The icing on the cake is yet to come. Clifford's father is killed in the war, and Young Clifford offers a sorrowful, terrifying, and yet beautiful passage on his intent for revenge!"},{"Title":"Serene Compassion: A Christian Appreciation of Buddhist Holiness","review":"This book is a great academic treat for Christians who want to examine the truths of Buddhism from a Christian point of view. In each chapter, Carmody presents the basic tenets of Buddhism, and then compares them to synonymous ideas in Christianity. Additionally she points out ideas which are contradictory or not compatible between the two. What is nice about this is the non-judgmental approach that Carmody takes - she is obviously a genuine Christian believer who has practiced and studied Buddhism, and despite her commitment to the Christian gospel, has many kind and appreciative things to say about Buddhist ideas and practice. This is one of the best books in my library - refreshing, though a little academic at points."},{"Title":"Word by Word Picture Dictionary English/Russian Edition","review":"We are in the process of adopting a 15 year old boy from Russia. While we are learning Russian, I doubt we will know enough to converse with him those first few months. This book is awesome! It has pictures for just about anything you could think of!! And, next to the pictures are both the English and Cyrillic words. For example, there is a page that shows a daily routine of getting up, taking a shower, brushing your teeth, etc. It has pictures for every object in your house. It has food items. Grocery store items. Sports. School activities. It is absolutely wonderful!!

So unless you can read Russian letters and pronounce them, this book is really no help."},{"Title":"Word by Word Picture Dictionary English/Russian Edition","review":"This book is set up for Russian learners, so it is less useful to those of us English readers trying to learn Russian. I bought it as well as the Oxford Picture Dictionary, which is also for Russian learners of English. That book does not have questions at the bottom as this book has, but since they are all in English, it does not help with the Russian at all.

Examples and tips for many of the commands are presented. And then, the price - almost 1/2 of most computer books.

This book fills a need that many Tcl programmers have expressed - an encyclopedia of Tcl commands."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk Programmer's Reference","review":"The Programmer's Reference is a useful reference guide for the user that wants to quickly look up how a function can be used. Dubbed 'man pages on steroids', it is true to the claim, providing the full set of man pages together in alphabetical order, enhanced for better effect. Enhancements include helpful examples and tips for the programmer, as well as caveats to watch out for.All in all, I would recommend this as a good second book. It is easier to refer to when you know more precisely what you want, but is not intended to be a book that you read from cover to cover (although if you did, you'd know all the commands there are in Tcl/Tk). It is written for Tcl/Tk 8.2.Minor nits (that last star) are that I'd like to see even more real world examples, as well as better indication for each command/variable header on whether it is for Tcl or Tk (an icon is used, but it could be improved), whether it is Mac/Win/Unix specific, as well as if it is a command or variable. Having everything in alphabetical order is handy, but these header boxes could be a little more helpful."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk Programmer's Reference","review":"This book fills the niche for a complete collection of TCL/TK man pages. However, I was suprised at the many typos and misordered items that I found unintentionally. There are references in the index to pages beyond the last page in the book. The order of commands is almost alphabetical but not quite exactly so. There are grammatical mistakes. The cover page proudly lampoons that it is covers through version 8.2 while the introduction meekly says that it was not tested on 8.2. I also found it officious that an authors name appears on the book since the book is essentially a digested man page document with notes.

I was forced into consulting this book by a need for information on the Tk geometry managers and configuring various widgets, but got more information from the O'Reilly title 'Perl In A Nutshell', which has a single chapter on Perl/Tk that is of greater use than this entire worthless tome. A waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk Programmer's Reference","review":"Experienced programmers expect this kind of reference: brief but clear explanations of basics, and all the major language features listed alphabetically. It's the \\"sensible shoes\\" of Tcl language guides.Tcl itself is a scripting and integration language, a little like Perl without string processing, and with syntax almost as simple as Forth. That makes it a fair candidate for running way in the innards of complex tool suites. Like other scripting languages, variables are untyped, and available types form a very short list. And, like other interpreted languages, many of its features border on self-modifying code. For example, runtime generation of variable names comes as easily as array subscripting - which it rather resembles, if you're used C-like syntax - and can serve many of the same purposes. I'm using on-the-fly script generation, a crossover of code and data that Lisp lovers will recognize (but without the mathematical elegance).I can't think of an application where Tcl would be my tool of choice, given what's available today. But, I don't always get to choose. If you're thrown in at the deep end and don't have time to learn the language you're programming in, you'll want a reference like this one.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk Programmer's Reference","review":"This is the first book I bought about Tcl/Tk.

Where needed, short and to the point examples will get you going with a command, and &quot;Programmer's Tips&quot; will prevent you going wrong.

He poses this question: What if Mozart had lived to a ripe old age and then found himself mixed up in murder? Actually, his Mozart is Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart. The book opens with the death of George III and Mozart is encouraged by a patron to believe that the upcoming Coronation might just be a splendid opportunity for a new opera.Along the way we meet persons already familiar to devot&eacute;es of the time period: Lord and Lady Hertford, Lord Egremere, Lady Conyngham and more, including an absolutely spot-on interpretation of Prinny, himself, whose estranged wife, Caroline is, of course, coming home to be Queen, and dear Prinny is busy trying to discredit her.It seems that Mozart stayed in England all these years, dut to having once performed for a much younger George III, who generously and misguidedly paid the young artist 50 guineas. Father Leopold Mozart decided there were better possibilities in England than on the Continent, so they stayed. Thus, Mozart's son is now teaching music near Leeds, his daughter lives elsewhere, and lucky sister Nannerl is back in Vienna. (After all, nothing English is nearly as good as anything German or Austrian.) Mozart and his theater manager have a running rivalry with the Italian composer Rossini and several Italian singers, and there are numerous running jokes (or puns) about subjects for the new opera. Mozart leans toward the Merry Wives Of Windsor (think about it a bit); Falstaff, that fat, old rake, or maybe even Don Giovanni or Il Matrimonio Segreto. In between are jokes about the real music (such as The Magic Flute), Masons, and other real or imagined titles.Actually, the only confusing thing to me was the music mentioned. Some titles are accurate, while others are merely a pastiche, and it is sometimes hard to know which is which. The chapter titles are frequently titles of known music by the real Mozart. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud on many occasions. It is a literate and witty murder/mystery, fantasy/Regency era novel, with much to recommend it!"},{"Title":"Dead, Mr Mozart","review":"This is an interesting period piece. Wolfgang Gottleib Mozart is alive and well in 1820 London. (Gottlieb, of course, means the same as Amadeus).\\"Dead, Mr. Mozart\\" is repeated throughout the book, first referring to the demise of George III, then the demise of some of Mozart's music popularity and the murder of a young girl.Mozart eagerly anticipates writing music for George IV's upcoming coronation but gets involved in a series of intrigues within his own opera house company. We meet a lot of the famous personalities of the day and we see the aristocracy with all its idiosyncrasies. We see Prinny, (George IV) the be-rouged, lecherous dandy and his vulgar and rejected wife Caroline. These personality vignettes are well done. The character of Gottlieb Mozart himself as presented in the book is convincing, his chronic indebtedness being a hallmark of his personality as well as his earthiness. and his cheerfulness- and of course, his incomparable talent.The murder mystery involved in the book- who killed a young dresser named Jenny-and why- is not especially interesting nor is the solution a surprise. Mozart, is deeply involved in this caper although he is totally innocent and becomes in essence the book's detective.My feeling about the book is that the 64 year old Mozart as a permanent resident of London just doesn't quite gel. Nevertheless, the novel is original and provides very good atmosphere. You can readily immerse yourself in early nineteenth century London with all its tawdriness and all its glory."},{"Title":"Poems of the Elizabethan Age: An Anthology","review":"I'm so glad that my professor had us read this book from cover to cover.

I quickly identified with the exasperated parents attempting to leave the house when the child wants to get dressed \\"his way,\\" which he considers the right and only way.This is a humorous look at getting dressed through the eyes of a child. It's thought-provoking look at growing up for parents. Our little ones want and need independence. Getting dressed is one area where their choices probably won't be dangerous, only somewhat embarrassing to parents.I enjoy Nicole Hollander's colorful illustrations. They are eye-catching in their simplicity. Children will immediately be drawn to them.Armchair Interviews says: A little lesson for parents: children need to learn.

As a 15 year old girl, reading is not one of my favorite pastimes. When I heard of a book about my idol Rebecca Lobo, I decided maybe I should give reading a try. I finished the story in a total of two days and found myself waking up in the middle of the night wanting to know what was going to happen next. It is an extremely moving book in which I fould that it was very easy to relate to.

Perhaps even on a level with Stuart Gilbert'sJames Joyce's Ulysses.These tapes are a great buy for anyone interested in Joyce."},{"Title":"Wings of Art: Joseph Campbell on James Joyce","review":"Only Campbell could make Joyce seem so accessible, and he was eminently qualified since he spent a good portion of his life studying Joyce. The first 5 minutes are a billiant summary and distillation of a writer who is broader and more universal in his scope than anyone since Shakespeare.

And this is the story of Marian Childs-plain, impoverished, without prospects, yet destined to blossom into a woman of style and substance. Of different worlds, these two indomitable women are inextricably linked through fortune and fate, through tragedy and triumph, through the one man whose ruthless passion will forever alter the course of both their lives.Author of &quot;A Woman of Independent Means&quot; and &quot;Life Sentences&quot;."},{"Title":"The Last Waltz","review":"Romance? There is not much of it in this historical novel.This is a good book, but definitely not as romantically inclined as the title, back cover description and sensual sketch suggests. It is about the life saga of two girls from the teenage years through the twilight years of affluent beautiful Isabel and plain impoverished Marian. They are forever linked together by the death of Marian's brother and their story is told through the eyes of Marian. This lengthy and well detailed saga describes the trials, tribulations and little happiness of these women and the people closely associated with them. The storyline is good and easy to follow but I feel it's rather bleak and generally unhappy, if not outright depressing in some of the scenarios. If I had realized this book is not as romantically inclined and mostly cheery as I prefer to read, I would not have chosen it. Though it is not what I anticipated, it is a five star read."},{"Title":"The Last Waltz","review":"Long, and absorbing all the way! Told by Marian Child, suddenly moved from poverty to riches when her employer dies and leaves her his estate, this historical novel shows in vast detail the complicated lives of the rich in Boston from 1870 to 1900. Men worked. Women did all the rest, from raising the children and overseeing the servants to building status in the upper crust by calling on each other and arranging immense balls--and, sometimes, carrying on love affairs with artists, actors, all sorts of men of their own and lower classes. The central character, Isabelle January, disappointed in an undying love, shows herself determined to outdo all others in becoming the leading lady in society. Dozens of other characters of all sorts populate the pages, and the action moves swiftly throughout. I had only one caveat--we are never told how Marian manages to avoid the financial disasters that leave many of those millionaires destitute. Nonetheless, few novels have caught me the this one did, from the start. I waded through the 398 pages of the first edition as fast as I could, and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Last Waltz","review":"I love this book and have re-read it many times.

Wells and his contemporaries have been relatively well-served by the publishing industry, particularly as their works have entered the public domain - though the interest in such primitive genre work seems to have abated since the 1970s, and this book as well as Castle Books' similar \\"Rivals of H.G. Wells\\" are both long out of print (though easy enough to find here and elsewhere without spending a fortune). This Sam Moskowitz volume is probably the best single introduction to the period that I've seen, though, and I wouldn't hesititate to recommend it to anyone who has read a bit of Wells or Verne and wants to explore further.The first 40 pages or so are taken up by a brief history of the popular magazines of the 1890s and 1900s, in both England where the rage for the \\"scientific romance\\" really seemed to take root first, and in America which was to dominate the field eventually. Illustrated, general-interest magazines like THE STRAND, THE IDLER, PEARSON'S, THE METROPOLITAN and THE ARGOSY provided cheap entertainment that could be afforded by even the lower middle classes from whence young H.G. Wells sprung, and which would given him his start as a writer of fiction, alongside such still-famous names as Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne (in translation) and of course, many others who have not survived in the public consciousness over the past century.Unlike Moskowitz' later \\"sequel\\",Under the Moons of Mars - A History and Anthology of The Scientific Romance in the Munsey Magazines 1912 - 1920, \\"Science Fiction by Gaslight\\" is made up entirely of short stories that are complete in this volume. They are grouped in nine different themes: Catastrophes, Marvellous Inventions, Monsters and Horrors, Future War, Man-Eating Plants, Far-Out Humor, Scientific Crime and Detection, Medical Miracles, and Adventures in Psychology. Authors, in addition to Wells and Verne, include William Hope Hodgson, Fred M. White, Grant Allen, George Griffith and Robert Barr - 26 stories in all, each with a brief biographical sketch of the author preceding it. All in all, a well-chosen, well-researched book that really showcases the breadth of early science fiction as it appeared in the short form. Only a few of the stories may be considered \\"classics\\" - Hodgson's VOICE IN THE NIGHT is one that might qualify - but most are a lot of fun, dated or humorously inaccurate though they might be. Worth hunting down for the specialist, as are most of the author's books."},{"Title":"Science Fiction by Gaslight: A History and Anthology of Science Fiction in the Popular Magazines, 1891-1911 (Classics of Science Fiction)","review":"In matter of fact he did. There are many stories in this anthology that predate &quot;popular&quot; Science Fiction. Most of these stories were published in the &quot;dime&quot; men's magazines of the time. And that time was very short indeed. Just slightly more than ten years between the time people heated their homes with coal and the time people moved to electricity.There is a story by H.G. Wells about an amoured mechanical truck that used camera obscura controlled machine guns to sweep trenches. This story predates The First World War. In this story the Germans win the war.Submarine warfare? It's in there. Astronomical disasters? In there. Geological mishaps? There!This is quite a collection and sure to entertain when you realize that most of these stories were far ahead of their time."},{"Title":"Science Fiction by Gaslight: A History and Anthology of Science Fiction in the Popular Magazines, 1891-1911 (Classics of Science Fiction)","review":"It's been a long time since I read this anthology, but it has always stuck in my mind. Not because the stories were that incredible, but because it proves that there's nothing (much) new under the sun. The stories within contain many of the now famous tropes of SF--pollution, strange beasts, mechanical men, and so. Yet every story here was written before the 20th century!The late Sam Moskowitz was a dedicated archivist of all things SF. If you are a student of the genre, you will enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Point of Impact -","review":"I thought this book gave a very good look into the career of forensics engineering. Mr. Sherman uses good site inspection, deposition and courtroom examples for various accident and equipment failure cases he was involved with through the years. He covers cases ranging from auto accident reconstruction to heavy equipment failures and machine/user accidents. A recommended read for any engineer or technical professional looking into to becoming a forensics expert."},{"Title":"Identity Cards Revisited (Human rights)","review":"A panel of experts from the LSE recently studied the Blair government's proposed Bill to introduce ID cards and concluded that the scheme would cost 18 billion, would be technically unsafe and would also be overly complicated and prescriptive.It could be made compulsory in one fell swoop. \\"Following approval of an order, c. 6 (1) empowers the Secretary of State to order anybody or everybody to register for a card. Although the government has speculated that this clause may not be brought into force for some years, there is no time period established in the Bill. Parliament could approve the order to do so at any time it wishes.\\"The Report sums up, \\"Many of the public interest objectives of the Bill would be more effectively achieved by other means. For example, preventing identity theft may be better addressed by giving individuals greater control over the disclosure of their own personal information, while prevention of terrorism may be more effectively managed through strengthened border patrols and increased presence at borders, or allocating adequate resources for conventional police intelligence work.\\"The technology envisioned for this scheme is, to a large extent, untested and unreliable. No scheme on this scale has been undertaken anywhere in the world. Smaller and less ambitious systems have encountered substantial technological and operational problems that are likely to be amplified in a large-scale, national system. The use of biometrics gives rise to particular concern because this technology has never been used at such a scale. ... A fully integrated national system of this complexity and importance will be technologically precarious and could itself become a target for attacks by terrorists or others.\\"\\"Any system that supports critical security functions must be robust and resilient to malicious attacks. Because of its size and complexity, the identity system would require security measures at a scale that will result in substantially higher implementation and operational costs than has been estimated. The proposed use of the system for a variety of purposes, and access to it from a large number of private and public sector organisations will require unprecedented attention to security.\\"All identity systems carry consequential dangers as well as potential benefits. Depending on the model used, identity systems may create a range of new and unforeseen problems. These include the failure of systems, unforeseen financial costs, increased security threats and unacceptable imposition on citizens. ... The risk of failure in the current proposals is therefore magnified to the point where the scheme should be regarded as a potential danger to the public interest and to the legal rights of individuals.\\""},{"Title":"David: Five Hundred Years","review":"The public was outraged when a few years back an angry thoughtless marauder attacked the magnificent sculpture, Michelangelo's David, destroying one on the great toes. Now there is a well written book that discusses the near tragedy and the manner in which the officials dealt with the damage. It is an important document, especially in an age of terrorism!Author Antonio Paolucci discusses and illustrates (with quite impressive photographs) the status of the sculpture before the cruel attack, the results of the damage, and then the painstaking restoration of the work that not only repaired the damage, but also brought important cosmetic healing to the ravages of time. The results as depicted in the fine photographs are not only beautiful but reassuring to see.Paolucci then turns his attention to a brief but well-written and illustrated biography of Michelangelo and his contemporaries, showing his growth into the finest observer of the human body the world has ever known. This is a beautiful art book, a very interesting read on how creative people can restore works of art, and a concise commentary on the life of the redoubtable Michelangelo. Highly Recommended.

Really. And if you loved those books, you'll love this one. An exquisite love story, a wonderfully-evoked sense of place, and the backdrop of history--they all unfold, gracefully and vividly, with a style you'll want to savor.Paul has taken a true story, that of a crash-landed Japanese aviator on an obscure Hawaiian island on December 7, 1941, and wrought a work of fiction that nevertheless remains consistently real. The characters of Irene and Yoshio, the island's sole Japanese inhabitants, torn between wavering loyalties and obligations, are the emotional heart of the book, but one also meets many memorable characters: A boy named Little Preacher. Alymer Robinson, the outright owner of the island, who has his reasons for keeping the islanders out of the mainstream of 20th Century society. And Nishikaichi, the downed Zero pilot at the center of it all. But the most enthralling character is the island of Ni'ihau itself: a place out of time, which gives EAST WIND, RAIN a timeless air.Highly recommended, particularly for readers in book groups. This is one to read, discuss, and enjoy."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"This is a fabulous idea for a story: a real event, buried in the history of the WW II attack on Pearl Harbor, involving an island and a people that have long been hidden from the rest of the world. Paul's treatment of this event scores on several counts: First, the language is wonderfully evocative, full of powerful descriptions, and entirely void of cliches. Second, her account sheds new light on the genesis of the U.S. policy of Japanese internment -- for it was here that the concept, or its approach, first hatched. And third, she does what every novelist hopes to achieve. She makes you wonder about how individual people really dealt with a huge event. All of which makes the book a true pleasure."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"This is a story set in a magical, distant place -- a small, private island in Hawaii where slow, predictable lives are wrenched one day by the crash of a Japanese Zero and its pilot during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The arrival of this warrior from Japan in this isolated place sets in motion a beautifully written tale of love and loyalty, written by a woman who is in love with words and can wonderfully weave in emotions, breathtaking scenery, history, and action. Absorb yourself in the world Paul has created...!"},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"Paul has written a rich book with a deceptively simple style and plot line. While exploring the intrusion of an outsider on a closed society, the book delves into topics such as racism, technology, paternalism, marital relations, modernity, and tragedy in the classical sense. Because of its richness, East Wind, Rain would make a fine book to incorporate into a high school curriculum; the novel might pair nicely with works such as The Lord of the Flies. The book would also spark great discussions in adult book clubs."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"The story is a new twist on the \\"caught behind enemy lines\\" concept. It could only be believable if it really happened - and it did. Just the idea of it reeks with excitement. The story is historical fiction and well written, but needs more work with an editor to maintain the necessary suspense of the storyline. The middle portion of the book slows the story down to the same pace as life on the remote island. Many pages pass without advancing the main theme of the story. From the first page the reader wants to know, \\"What happens, what happens to the pilot?\\" The ponderous middle section of the book nearly kills the suspense of the story line. Eventually the excitement does return, and again, for the first time since the beginning of the book, I read each word with a yearning for the next. The conclusion does not disappoint; it is not an ending you would likely to have guessed before hand."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"Although the story takes place on a remote Hawaiian island at the beginning of WWII, the subject matter is very topical in todays social climate. The story basically addresses the issue of national allegiance. The interplay between the downed Zero pilot and Yoshiro Harada, an American of Japanese decent, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor is riviting. The reader is drawn into a veritable \\"time warp\\" and experiences the thoughts of the pilot, the Harada family and the Hawaiians as they experience a series of betrayals and miscommunications.This icing on the cake is that this story is based upon an actual event."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"I just finished this book. While the premise was strong, the book was too slow-paced. Paul could have done so much more with almost everything. The character sketches were weak. The reader wasn't allowed to get close to anyone. Everyone was distant, almost a fictional figure rather than appearing real and popping out of the pages. There could have been a couple of characters with their own intimate story weaving a thread through the main distant story, that helped the story move along. Some of the events were true in history, but none of the incidents in the book seemed imminent or made the pages turn. I couldn't understand how a single lone pilot, and such a young and inexperienced one at that, had command of the island and wasn't overpowered by the locals. To add more sympathy to him, there could have been more detail added to his background - perhaps more to the story with the fishmonger's daughter.This was not worth a read at all. I had to finish it because of my book-club, but we had a unanimous verdict on the book."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"A surprisingly good novel based on fact - Dec. 7, 1941 on a small island in Hawaii. I have passed this on to a friend who will appreciate it's culture."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"I ordered this book because we were going to Hawaii and I wanted to read something with local flavor. I had never heard of this incident before and it sounded like it would be interesting. (I also have a Niihau shell lei (necklace) from my mother-in-law, so that added to the interest.)Apparently there is not enough fact to write a true account, but Caroline Paul conjures up a story to fill in the blanks. I was amazed to learn about the continued isolation of the residents of this island TO THIS DAY. THAT was an eye opener! They still are not allowed to have telephones, TVs, radios, or newspapers. There is only solar power. Horses provide transportation as there are no cars either. All this in order to preserve the Hawaiian culture and traditions.There were many ways the story could have been written, but of course, it seems no one knows how it actually went. Since Paul was never able to visit the island and speak with them, it is all conjecture. I don't know if she knows the Hawaiian ways well enough to know whether this is how they might have resolved this issue."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"An anguishing, deep and well-crafted novel that packs lessons and intimations into practically every page. Essays could be written based on ideas and conflicts proffered freely by Paul but sopped-up painfully by the thoughtful reader. Symbols and stub-thoughts abound, evidently worked over and thought over (perhaps fought-over, since Paul may have been associated with the SF writers workshop). If you can stand the lessons (and the beauty), it's a delightful and thoughtful torture.For example, the insidious and hatefuly anti-Japanese prejudice (which today is only an echo of the fear and loathing against \\"orientals\\"), a very tough topic, is drawn out in the conflict of one of its victims for his loyalty to the country that fostered the racists who taunted him vs. his fear of his wife's hectoring and his admiration for the power of his \\"despised\\" ancestral homeland. This issue is one that those who remember might well wish to escape. Today, Taiwanese-Chinese-Americans are torn by admiration for their great ancestral country and their fear of its leadership and certain events -- evinced by reactions to Hu's recent visit.But that's a macro issue; each page has some lesson, well-thought out, such as the conflict between primitive and modern, preservation vs. development, the value of \\"philanthropy\\", the panic and herd-mentality of people in crisis, and literally dozens of others, subtly available to the wary reader.To write an essay on this short, brilliant book would take about three times the space as the book itself, and be less stirring.It's a window not just on historical events, but on the awful lessons from those times for the present ... when, for example, we wonder just how easily people can be manipulated to vote against their own interests (as the \\"welfare\\" states such as Mississippi, which receive more than the \\"donor\\" states such as California, voted to put into power those who pretend to stopping all such federal largesse).Despair, too, when you start to wonder just how gullible and stupid are the masses. The entire sequence of World Wars, including the interregnum and in particular the demarche of Japan, is a macroscopic lesson in massive folly. How even gentle people are maneuvered into hating each other and serving the interests of the powerful."},{"Title":"East Wind, Rain: A Novel","review":"Interesting if read as fiction.

That is certainly true of this book. Consider this brief excerpt from the Afterword in which Fink observes: \\"Acts of terror [e.g. such as those which occurred on September 11th] notwithstanding, economic espionage remains one of the most serious threats to our national security since the Cold War. Therefore, we ought to have seasoned generals leading, and weathered soldiers fighting, the good battles that need to be fought.\\" However, with all due respect to the F.B.I. and to legislation such as the Economic Espionage Act [EEA], \\"...you still need to be your own best defense against espionage with proper internal education, training, and procedures\\" and under no circumstances \\"delegate the crisis management work for your company to the government. It is too important.\\" This brief excerpt helps to explain why this book can be so valuable to decision-makers in global organizations.Recent research studies have dentified issues of greatest concern to senior-level executives, following September 11th. The top five are mail processing (86%), travel (85%), protection of employees (79%), protection of infrastructure (75%), and risk assessment (71%). Obviously, there is widespread and quite legitimate concern about protecting human beings and physical property. However, as Fink eloquently explains, we must also be concerned about -- and take appropriate measures to protect -- information which is as important to the global economy as oxygen is to the human body.As events on September 11th clearly indicate, even a country with resources such as those possessed by the United States cannot totally defend itself and its people against terrorists acts. However, because the U.S.A. remains the world leader in research, development, new technology, products, and trade secrets, organizations within the U.S.A. are high-profile targets and \\"economic espionage spies are still going to come after [them] and that only increases [the] global risk of economic espionage.\\" As previously indicated, Fink's book examines the nature and extent of that potential risk, suggesting all manner of strategies and tactics to anticipate and then prepare for, as well as respond to, economic espionage because it is \\"a business crisis and should be treated as such.\\"Fink asserts that \\"Companies are under attack and at enormous risk every day. from the global threat of economic espionage, but the risk can and should be lowered and managed. Here's how.\\" He organizes his material within two Sections and presents it in 29 interrelated chapters, followed by an Afterword in which he addresses the question, \\"EEA: Bear Trap or Mouse Trap?\\" To explain \\"here's how\\", he uses the largest economic espionage case ever tried in the United States -- Avery Dennison/Four Pillars -- from his vantage point as the lead crisis management expert for Avery Dennison. Fink guides his reader step-by-step through that seminal case, also also citing along the way relevant situations in other companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gillette, Kodak, Lucent Technologies, and MasterCard.Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Obviously decision-makers in global organizations. Also service providers to those organizations (e.g. attorneys, accountants, insurance underwriters, management consultants) as well as officials in governmental agencies who are directly or indirectly involved in economic espionage threats as well as acts. I also highly recommend Fink's previous book, Crisis Management, first published in 1986 but more relevant today than ever before. America is at greatest risk because it has the most worth stealing. Those with \\"sticky fingers\\" know that and so must those whose task it is to deny them."},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"\\"Sticky Fingers\\" is a highly valuable contribution to the ranks of important, must-read business books that sheds much-needed light on the theft of company trade secrets. At a cost to U.S. businesses of more than $250 billion a year, it is no wonder the author calls economic espionage the single biggest business crisis in America today. Every executive and manager should read this book pronto and follow the author's sound advice on protecting their company's trade secrets. My company was a victim of economic espionage and believe me, it hurt! I wish our management had read this book and followed Fink's pragmatic advice on how companies can protect their trade secrets and reduce their risk of economic espionage."},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"It is obvious from reading \\"Sticky Fingers\\" that the author knows his subject, inside and out. The book has been thoroughly researched and well documented with a couple of hundred source notes to back it up, including interviews with former and current Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents, as well as many corporate executives. In addition, the author cites no less than three Avery Dennison attorneys who reviewed the manuscript for accuracy. People who plunk down good money for good books appreciate this kind of substantive research. Curiously, in the face of this rock-solid reporting there emerges a childishly cranky \\"reviewer\\" from Avery Dennison's Pasadena hometown. (Hmmm?) His - or her - bias seems simplistic and obvious. Having followed this particular case and the Avery Dennison company closely for many years, I have come across quite a few embarrassing incidents that the author might have included had he wanted - perhaps some discomfiting snafus involving the company's lawyers missing scheduled court dates, or company lawyers being publicly rebuked by the trial judge for having loose lips, or gaffes by self-doubting senior management and hyper-nervous internal PR flaks. Even though those incidents may have little to do with the important topic of Economic Espionage, it still might be interesting, if not amusing, if they became public one day. This could be a slippery slope for transparent individuals with personal agendas.Like the author's previous book on crisis management, \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is a book that belongs on every business bookshelf. Company executives and managers would be wise to read it and learn how to prevent the theft of their valuable trade secrets...before they wind up as victimized as the hapless Avery Dennison."},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"It is amazing to consider that corporate spies steal more than $250 billion a year from US companies. The writing here is excellent, making for a compelling read as author Fink uses the landmark Avery Dennison/Four Pillars case through out this book as a backdrop for understanding the damage a company spy can cause. After reading Sticky Fingers, I am much more cautious about the information I share outside the company, whether I'm at a tradeshow or in the elevator. This book will make you re-think what you say about your business, and who you share information with either at your company or outside company walls. Whether you're working in a corporate office or have your own company, this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"Have you ever had to decide whether to pick up that juicy Tom Clancy book or that stale, but important business one? Steven Fink splits the difference and solves your problem with this book that is half spy story, half business advice. Sticky Fingers works best as a thriller. As business advice, the book highlights the basic issues for U.S. companies fighting economic espionage, but falls short of serving up a complete playbook. The devil, as always, is in the details, and the specifics of the book&#65533;s real-life cases sketch a more accurate picture of this particular devil than the generalized advice. If economic espionage is the elephant in the corner that your company has been pretending does not exist, we from getAbstract recommend Sticky Fingers as a starting point to finally taking action to protect yourself."},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"Steven Fink, author of the bestselling \\" Crisis Management,\\" has written a truly superb book on economic espionage. Using actual real world examples involving Avery Dennison / Four Pillars, Lucent Technologies, and Eastman Kodak, Fink has crafted a practical and easy-to-read book on how companies should protect their most valuable corporate asset - their trade secrets.In the case involving Avery Dennison (the label and adhesives maker), Fink provides a detailed look at what caused a highly respected scientist at Avery Dennison to sell his company's trade secrets to a foreign competitor, namely Four Pillars of Taiwan. The ensuing court trial makes for interesting reading.Using the example of Eastman Kodak and one of its former employees, Fink again discusses the motivation behind selling one's former employers' trade secrets for personal gain. This human element, which Fink writes about with great ease and clarity, is often overlooked in other books on economic and industrial espionage.The chapter on the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the types of information worth protecting should be 'must reads' for every business manager. I would like to have seen another chapter on methods that companies can use to protect their trade secrets.All in all, a solid book that provides useful information in an easy to read format.Mark Robinson, author of \\"Beyond Competitive Intelligence: The Practice of CounterIntelligence and Trade Secrets Protection.\\""},{"Title":"Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage","review":"This is easily one of the most readable and important business books to hit the shelves in many years. I have followed Fink's work since the publication in the mid-1980's of his first (terrific) business book, CRISIS MANAGEMENT: PLANNING FOR THE INEVITABLE. In this newest work, Fink once again uses his engaging and lively writing style (he is also a novelist) to alert readers to America's newest and biggest business crisis -- the theft of trade secrets. Filled with fascinating case studies of companies that have been &quot;ripped off&quot; and victimized by insiders, disgruntled employees, unscrupulous competitors and even &quot;friendly&quot; foreign governments (such as Japan), the book offers straightforward, savvy practical advice for businesses large and small. In fact, Fink says that all that is necessary for any business to be vulnerable to economic espionage is just to have at least one competitor and/or one employee. He also reminds us that there are other crises besides international terrorism that we can ill afford to ignore. I've already bought a copy of this book for my boss; and my boss has already put the first of several meetings on how our company can better protect itself from ecomonic espionage on the calendar for next week.

The database tables in the back of the book, termed \\"essentially a download of Ted Parker's mind\\" are the essence of this information. For each of the 4000 species from the Rio Grande to Tierra Del Fuego, there are lists of habitats used by every species, and even a table of the indicator bird species for each region.The books makes the really important point: you cannot prioritize saving the birds of the tropics only by species, one bird at a time.

The contents make up a scant 80 pages. Thick, glossy paper quality, which showcases film stills extremely well, and a six-page interview with Kieslowski at the end, but the writing is less than satisfying. Andrew tends to run to extremes - most of the time his &quot;analysis&quot; consists of painstakingly assembled narrative details from the three films (expounded at length over individual synopses of the three films), and when he does take a shot at analysis, he tends to draw grand and general conclusions for which the evidence is found wanting. The author prefers to rhapsodize about the role of chance and destiny in the Trilogy, when an introductory discussion regarding the precise meaning of the *title* and how it is expressed in the film might have seemed more proper. In a sense he can't be blamed for this, since this is his own take on the trilogy and he is free to think whatever he thinks - in fact, he apologizes early on that this tome represents a non-definitive (meaning personal) take on the trilogy from the viewpoint of an &quot;unrepentant admirer&quot;. However, in this sense each and every passionate viewer of Kieslowski could have written his or her own book, with no more and no less merit for publication than Andrew's. In sum, if you are already initiated into Kieslowski, there is nothing in this book that a good second (or third or fourth) viewing of the films will not give you (but to be on par with this author be prepared to hit the&quot;pause&quot; button every five minutes - gotta spot that portrait of Van Den Budenmayer's on the judge's desk!), and if you are a novice, this is not the book to start with. Watch the films again, carefully, and let your mind draw its own conclusions."},{"Title":"The 'Three Colours' Trilogy (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"To comprehend Kieslowski the film-maker is an intellectually arduous task, and those who are interested in how his Polish identity manifested itself in his non-Polish films might make better use of Emma Wilson's 'Memory and Survival: the French Cinema of Krzysztof Kieslowski' (Oxford, 2000). It is fairly correct to say that Geoff Andrew was not interested in that. Publishing his book for the first time in 1998, only two years after Kieslowski's death, Andrew's main purpose was to offer his insight, as a film critic, to Kieslowski's tour-de-force, especially in the light of uneven critical reception of the trilogy.Andrew's fascination with \`Three Colours' definitely makes his book an engaging and illuminating reading. At the same time, this book cannot be passed for yet another summary of the films' plots, simply because it goes well beyond that. It is probably useful to remind oneself of the difference between a plot and a story and of the fact that the story (i.e. what happens) tells relatively little about its author's potential; it is the plot ('how' the story is happening), together with authorial structure and style that does. Taking \`Three Colours: Blue' for example, its story is very simple: a woman who lost her husband and child in a car crash, is trying to rebuild her life. The work begins when we ask, who the woman is, who her husband was, how she may rebuild her life, how she is actually rebuilding it, etc. The fact that all this is told in connection with ideas of liberation and freedom (because the French 'liberte' carries both meanings) adds further complexity to the story.As one knows, most films reviews seldom answer questions like these, simply because they require attention to detail that 500 words do not allow for. This, however, is possible in a book. Andrew painstakingly collects scattered details, to tell us, what sort of character Julie is. He also studies the dead husband, whose character is easy to ignore altogether. We are told early on that Julie's husband was a famous composer, but when I was watching the film I noticed the same point, upon which Andrew remarks in his study: it looks kind of strange that a classical composer so effortlessly produces a marketable piece of music, commemorating the unification of Europe. If anything, it does raise questions as to how serious a composer he is; and a suggestion that he could have been helped in writing his music seems therefore all the more valid. Andrew pays attention to this episode, which in a way is pivotal for Julie's \`awakening'. This very detail, however, continues to elude some critics, despite its overall importance. Without it, Julie's own musical talent is hugely underplayed, whereas the theme of love as liberation and a creative source (but also as a realm of delusion) does not resonate as much, as Kieslowski certainly intended.What Andrew is doing therefore is plucking out these \`elusive' details, in order to show us, how truly genuine were Kieslowski's last films. One may say, of course, that such purpose did not require a book, but one should also admit that most viewers will only pick upon the majority of details, if they sit through the films at least three times. And since we are discussing a film, then the story evidently unravels not only in words, but in frames, colours and sounds, which further complicate its grasping. In the chapter on \`White', Andrew studies the different and often ambiguous use of the white colour, to illustrate how it corresponds with different ideas that Kieslowski communicated in this film. The use of music is central for \`Blue', while \`Red' is visually and intellectually impressive for its camerawork and direction of photography, which does require a viewer to check on their attention. Andrew rightly suggests that \`Red' is the sum total of all three films, which is why it is both so remarkable and so complex.This book is indeed a summary, but of a kind that many films could only wish to have. It is intelligent, fairly easy to read (especially if the reader has seen the films) and helps to systematise Kieslowski's technique and ideas, as they emerged for the last time in his career. As Andrew indicated in the Preface, his was \`an \\"auteurist\\" study', and not an investigation into prices and individuals, let alone into the \\"politics\\" of \`Three Colours'. This is one of the reasons for why he draws continuous parallels between this trilogy and \`Decalogue', as there are many recurrent topics, ideas and even techniques that make \`Three Colours' belong to the realm of ethics, rather than politics. Andrew also specifies that Kieslowski himself was adamant that his understanding of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity must be seen as personal, and not politically infused. What we have, therefore, is an indispensable systematisation of one the greatest works in film history, a gateway for further research into Kieslowski's work, as well as a good example of an in-depth, yet concise, film study."},{"Title":"The 'Three Colours' Trilogy (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"Even at the time of its release (1993-94), Kieslowski's 'Three Colours' trilogy (in which the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity embodied in the French flag are ironically applied to such dilemmas in modern life as grief, communication in a media-saturated culture and post-communist capitalism) was seen as the last gasp of a 'world cinema' auteur tradition that had flourished in the 1950s and 60s, but had become virtually moribund by the 1980s. At the time, however, reviews were mixed: some critics were in raptures at the rare, spiritual power of these films, treasuring their exploration of inner lives, and holding them as a Fine Art stick with which to beat the commercial inanities of modern Hollywood; others decried Kieslowski's rejection of a political cinema, his retreat into a self-indulgent, decorative, bourgeois-currying aesthetic of the individual.Geoff Andrew was, from the start, one of Kieslowski's most ardent acolytes, but his study of the trilogy is wholly inadequate as an analysis of Kieslowski's complex art. Film editor for listings rag Time Out, Andrew doesn't progress beyond the insights offered in original newspaper/magazine reviews, and his prose is littered with the kind of quotable hyperbole designed for snipping from articles and pasting on blurbs and posters: 'an extraordinarily affecting triptych', 'deft black comedy', 'Kieslowski's greatest achievement'. The whole point of this BFI Classics/Modern Classics series was surely to go beyond the platitudes of contemporary opinion, and put the works in some kind of context or framework.Andrew's study is the kind of bland, untheoretical fanzine that used to pass for film criticism in the 60s - the films are treated as simply the poetic inspirations of a great auteur. There is no attempt, for instance, to see how issues such as finance might affect certain aesthetic decisions (casting, location etc.), or what the contributions of other personnel might be. Kieslowski's intellectual and cultural heritage as a Pole, a reader and a film-maker is ignored as if he was a singular genius who emanated from the ether, untouched by environment, circumstance or influence.After a brief sketch of Kieslowski's pre-'Three Colours' career (which is extraordinarily reduced to the level of films anticipating the trilogy, rather than major works in their own right), the 'analyses' of the 3 movies are actually mere synopses, while the 'critical' chapters, charting thematic and formal connections, and links with Kieslowski's previous features, never gets beyond mere listing, never coheres into anything resembling an interpretation. The density of these playful, ambiguous, deeply ironic films is reduced to the trite, touchy-feely Disneyesque message 'Love conquers all'. Worse, the films themselves are discussed as if they were mere screenplays, in terms of plot and character, as if they were books; anyone who has seen a Kieslowski picture will know that these are the least interesting elements (or, at least, that they are undermined by various formal and narrative procedures), and to properly interpet Kieslowski, a detailed, informed account of his style is needed. On the DVDs of the films there are interviews with his editor Jacques Witta, and masterclasses from Kieslowski. These interviews show how profoundly meaning derived not from plot or character, but from complex decisions about editing, timing, rhythm, colour, texture, framing, sound etc., about how material that was shot but didn't work in the editing suite could be abandoned or rearranged. Anyone who wants to gain a greater understanding of these elusive films would do better to skip this book and get the DVDs instead."},{"Title":"The 'Three Colours' Trilogy (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"If anyone has reservations about delving into the &quot;What does it mean...?&quot;, this book is a great safety net, or better yet, a guide.

The book tells the story of Pope John VIII, the purported female Pope who ruled Christendom for a period of two years, five months and four days in the middle of the ninth century. \\"Pope Joan\\" is a comic masterpiece of irreverence towards the medieval Church and the accepted pieties of its revisionist historians. Indeed, insofar as Royidis continued to propagate the legend of Pope Joan, to claim that the work contained only \\"facts and events proved beyond discussion\\", the text itself ingeniously combines history and legend, as well as brilliant wit, to subvert claims of authority. As Lawrence Durrell notes in his Preface to his brilliant English translation and adaptation, \\"the authorities of the Orthodox Church were horrified by what seemed to them to be the impious irony of its author-and no less by the gallery of maggot-ridden church fathers which he described so lovingly.\\" Not suprisingly, Royidis was excommunicated from the Orthodox Church and his book was banned in Greece.The first three parts of \\"Pope Joan\\" tell the story of Joanna prior to her arrival in Rome, before she became an historical personage. Set in the ninth century, the narrative captures the European world in disarray after the death of Charlemagne, captures a time when civilization was tenuous and the Church provided one of the few viable social structures. It is this part of the narrative that is unambiguously fictional, the imagined story of Joanna's life in Germany and then in Greece. After her parents die, Joanna clandestinely enters a monastery where she meets the monk Frumentius and develops a romantic relationship with him. When her true sexual identity is surmised, Joanna and Frumentius flee one monastery and then another, eventually ending up in Greece. Joanna soon becomes tired of her romance and her intellectual brilliance attracts the attention of Church leaders throughout Greece. She leaves Frumentius and departs alone for Rome, where the legend, some say the history, of Pope Joan begins. She becomes a papal secretary renowned for her intellect and, when Pope Leo IV dies, she ascends to the papacy. Pope Joan becomes pregnant and dies after giving birth during a procession through the streets of Rome.While the general outline of the narrative may seem only mildly interesting, the brilliant translation and prose of Lawrence Durrell, together with the biting, irreverent wit of Royidis, make \\"Pope Joan\\" an unsurpassed work of comic genius. A flavor for this wit and style can be found in a short passage describing what ensued after Pope Joan gave birth: \\"Great was the consternation when a premature infant was produced from among the voluminous folds of the papal vestments . . . Some hierarchs who were profoundly devoted to the Holy See sought to save the situation and change horror and disgust to amazement by crying out \`A miracle! A miracle!' They bellowed loudly calling the faithful to kneel and worship. But in vain. Such a miracle was unheard of; and indeed would have been a singular contribution to the annals of Christian thaumaturgy which, while it borrowed many a prodigy from the pagans, had not yet reached the point where it could represent any male saint as pregnant and bringing forth a child.\\"While the apologist position has consistently denied the historicity of Pope Joan, there is at least some suggestion that the legend is indeed a fact. As Durrell suggests in his Preface, one telling point is that Platina includes a biography of Pope John VIII in his \\"Lives of the Popes\\". And no less an authority than The Catholic Encyclopedia states that Platina's \\"Lives of the Popes\\" is \\"a work of no small merit, for it is the first systematic handbook of papal history.\\" Historical disputation aside, however, \\"Pope Joan\\" stands as a brilliant work of comic writing and masterful translation, a masterpiece of Royidis and Durrell."},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"I purchased this book at the same time that I purchased Donna Woolfolk Cross's book.

It's a hilarious, irreverent, bawdy, sacreligious saga at the expense of every prudish, hypocritically pious notion ever spawned in Christian history. It's a scream! I wonder if my neighbors have been disturbed by my uncontrollable howling. As an example, there's the bit where Joan uses the leg bone (sacred relic) of a martyred saint which she and a group of monks are transporting, to fend off the overly-amorous monks during an episode of gluttenous over-indulgence!This very literate debauchery is the work of a genius."},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"Forget the veracity of the events in question...this book is beautifully written, extremely thoughtful, provocative and quite humorous (which is why Mr. Durrell took the time and made the effort to translate it from the Greek) Lawrence Durrell is one of the greatest novelists of the 20th Century English language and he recognized this little book as the jewel that it is."},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"A while back I acquired copies of two books entitled Pope Joan, one translated from the Greek by Lawrence Durrell and one written by Donna Woolfolk Cross. Somehow they have languished for two years on my bookshelf (which ironically is the length of time the good lady was said to have occupied the Papal throne), but I have just finished reading them, not back to back but actually alternating the two so that I started and finished them both within the same period of time.They were vastly different in both writing style and content- though there was a similar kernel within each.The Durrell book, which is a battered and yellowed little paperback, was written in a style that took some adjustment to read. Flowery, cynical, jaded, and very funny once you got used to the effusive flow of words. Apparently the original author of this (in the Greek) was excommunicated for writing it.The Cross book, is well researched, told in the type of historical fiction style more like some of the historical fiction I read as a teen that told the story with some embellishment and some romance, more in modern day parlance. The fact that I found the story a little too pat, is my own fault, not hers. Horrible father, long suffering mother, daughter who shines at everything and would have been the ideal child had she not had ovaries...But Cross's Joan always lands on her feet (well-- except for one time in the flood of the Tiber, when she seems to have landed on her back-- no more or there's a spoiler there.)My dear friend who is a priest would be appalled that I might even consider it to be historically based.

It is well crafted and expertly translated, the final product is rich, dense, and wonderfully funny writing that requires and rewards the full attention of the reader.Don't read this book if you are looking for the history of Pope Joan, you won't find it here - this book is historical fiction, and Royidis weaves the myth - legend - facts - whatever about the story of a female pope into a satirical 9th century romp through Christendom, from England to Athens and finally to Rome. Royidis's backdrop is tribal Europe, Europe before modern science, where Christianity was just another form of supersitition having to compete with all sorts of paganism and witchery for the hearts and minds of the less than faithful.Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular has always had a problem with human sexuality and female sexuality in particular, and Royidis uses the story of Joan to poke all sorts of fun and ribaldry at Catholicism and Christianity - and unctuous hypocritical Catholic and Christian leaders. It is almost like shooting fish in a barrel, but Royidis manages to do it imaginatively each and every time. His observations of the 9th century from the 19th century resonate well here in the 21st, it seems we are as slave to superstition and hypocrisy as our forebearers were.This is a fun to read, funny book, about a bellylaugh per page. I recommend highly!"},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"For many centuries, the tale of the 9th century Pope, John VIII, who was secretly a woman has been passed by word-of-mouth throughout Western Europe's common classes, secretly whispered about by its aristocracy, and derisively discussed in the Catholic Church's hierarchy with contempt and ridicule.The historical facts are these: in the middle of the 9th century, a young woman, Johanna Jutta Gilberta, dressed as a man to be able to enter the classical education schools open only to aristocratic males in Mainz, Germany. Her reputation as an impeccable scholar soon earned her an invitation to study at the foremost school of learning in Athens, where she travelled with her male, secret lover.Once there, she established a standard of excellence in learning that was the talk throughout Greece. She began lecturing and her classes became so popular that several royal, Italian families began sending their sons to be educated at the Athenium by her. Calling herself &quot;John Anglicus&quot;, due to a lengthy stay studying at a monastery in England before arriving in Athens, she received offers from several Roman families to relocate and set up a school in Rome.Accepting the generous offers and accomodation provided, Johanna made a name for herself as the foremost scholar in the Western world. When the papacy became vacant from the death of Leo IV in 855, it was offered to &quot;Joannes Anglicus&quot;. She hesitated solemnly but eventually had to accept.Ruling for 2 years, she became pregnant and in a procession went into labor. The child and act of birth was seen by the attending Cardinals as an act of Satan. Her and the child died on the spot and a marker stood for centuries, symbolized by a woman draped in the papal cloth with a child in her arms. Even the reformist, Martin Luther, mentions in his &quot;Table Talk&quot; that he had seen the very same monument and was dumbfounded how the Church could be so blind to allow it to remain after so many years. The new edition (August 1997) just released of Emmanuel Royadis' book contains a surmised account of how such a preposterous event could have ever happened. By the end of the tale, you will not think it so impossible. Written in the style of a play, Royadis fills in known historical fact with a painter's eye for background and visually detailed scenes. The introduction by one of the English language's foremost artist of words, Lawrence Durrell (&quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;), alone makes the book worth reading.While the tale of &quot;Pope Joan&quot; has been one of the longest and most enduring stories ever to be passed on from one century to the next, it is practically unknown in North America and when brought up, vehemently denied. Thus, be prepared for wide-opened eyes when you relate this tale to someone else.

It's not the type of humor you'd expect about a female pope. It's written in a way that is completely irreverent about religion, gender, and class, is both obscene and grotesque, yet the humor comes from the fact that all these elements are essential to the story. It's like South Park versus Family Guy, where the former derives its humor mainly from the story whereas the latter relies mostly on random tangents for shocks and laughs. The language is so lofty and poetic, yet delivers deep belly laughs. It's for people who love the intricacies of how euphemisms and implication can comment on a situation while describing it. That and it's only about 150 pages, so it's a quick read. All in all, I couldn't put it down, recommend it every chance I get, and hope that this book doesn't get lost over the years."},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"Emmanuel Royidis was indeed a genius.

I'm generally disinclined to believe the legend however, since there hardly seems to be any historical evidence to support it. That said, the legend, as set forth in this book, is a marvelous satire of the Church and its practices during that dark period following the fall of the Roman Empire. The rampant corruption of the clergy and the obsession of the church leadership with secular power and privilege provides ample fodder for this story, which merely extrapolates these weaknesses to one extreme. The historical failings of the Church and its leadership should serve as a cautionary lesson to those modern leaders of the Church who seem to have forgotten that they are also subject to human fallibility, and that humility should be the defining characteristic of their leadership.While the satirical content of this book is entertaining and enlightening, I found the prose to be far to embellished for my taste. The frequent asides and tangential diversions from the core story were distracting. I often found my attention wandering and sometimes I found it easier to just skip ahead to where the author returned to the main story line. Much of this extraneous material felt like padding, even in this rather slim (150 pages) volume."},{"Title":"Pope Joan,","review":"Supposedly a novel, this very dated tome is neither fish nor fowl. It can't seem to decide what it wants to be. A story or a lecture? Serious historical fiction, or a platform for a broad satirical attack on the Catholic Church? If the latter, then be warned: most readers won't find it very funny. Humor ages fast. What's amusing in one era is a great big yawn in another.There's no plot in any modern sense of the word. Joan wanders, picaresque fashion, from one implausible adventure to another, with tedious predictability. Every ten pages or so I had to fight the temptation to put it down, for the story keeps lagging, occasionally coming to a dead halt to allow the author to launch yet another boring and repetitive diatribe against the Church.There's no character development or subtlety. Joan is a difficult character to like, for she seems to have little motivation except an undiscriminating sexuality, which exists primarily as a device to launch her into strained and silly encounters with prelates. The prose is excruciatingly awkward, probably because 1. it was written 150 years ago, and 2. it's been translated from the Greek. For proof of this, just read the passage quoted by one of the Spotlight reviewers above (who cites it to prove that the writing is wonderful!): \\"Such a miracle was unheard of; and indeed would have been a singular contribution to the annals of Christian thaumaturgy which, while it borrowed many a prodigy from the pagans, had not yet reached the point where...\\" etc. etc. Shakespeare, this isn't.

In fact, there was no significant gap between these popes, that is, the often-cited 25 mos did not occur. 'Pope Joan' was the invention of Stephen of Bourbon, a 13th century Dominican friar. At this time in history, friars who espoused poverty were in conflict with the opulence of the papacy. Evidently, what Stephen composed was a piece of anti-papist propaganda. In his version, the mythical female pope had no name, and was elected in about 1100. The version we have today was created by various accretions and mutations, and grew so elaborate that it was even accepted by the Council of Constance in 1415. The story is found in the works of Boccaccio and Petrarch, and in various chronicles, but that does not make it true. Ironically, it was a Calvinist, David Blondel, who debunked the myth in a work of 1647 entitled 'Familiar Enlightenment of the Question: Whether a Woman Had Been Seated on the Papal Throne in Rome'. As always, truth is infinitely more interesting than fiction. In the early tenth century, two women of the house of Theophylact, Theodora and her daughter Marozia, wielded such influence in Rome that they were able to place whomever they pleased on the papal throne. Their exploits are related scandalously by Luitprand of Cremona, whose works have not yet been translated into English.

The world is ruled by vampires -- Attila the Hun and Charlamagne are both vampires who have conquered Western Europe, and their henchmen, including Richard Lionheart, Vlad the Impaler (no great shock, there), and even Pope Alexander are also vampires. Africa is also conquered by vampires, although the Muslims have been resisting the vampiric hordes. The novel's first chapter, set in London, shows the world in uneasy balance, with the vampire aristocracy ruling over a generally pacified yet often unruly human population.That is, until scientist, mechanician, and handsomest man in England, Edmund Cordery, strikes a blow for humans in a devious, vicious manner. His son, Noell, takes up the standard, but instead of leading a mighty army, Noell gets involved in a journey of scientific discovery into the causes of vampirism. Using what may be the world's first microscope, Noell spends much of the book peering through its lenses and speculating on scientific theory.Surprisingly, for a book that has vampires, pirates, seiges, and bizarre religious rites, the book is rather flat. Stableford is clearly more interested in the ideas presented by vampirism than with writing a hair-raising Gothic horror novel or a gripping page-turner, and his writing cannot be said to &quot;crackle&quot; or &quot;leap from the page&quot; -- even his dueling scenes are written in an expository, rote prose. Indeed, the largest section of the book is focused on Noell's time in Africa, where he and his comrades have journeyed to find the legendary birthplace of vampirism. This section is rather tedious, if only because the characters are so exhausted, diseased, and despairing about their circumstances.Ultimately, the final section of the book is set in the modern age, and we meet one of the characters from earlier in the book. Stableford concludes his novel with a very touching, very thoughtful scene involving a vampire and a crippled boy with an unusual link to one of Stableford's heroes.If you're looking for an eerie vampire thriller, pick up King's &quot;'Salem's Lot,&quot; or some other novel. &quot;Empire of Fear&quot; is not your standard beach fare or for staying up late at night to get a good dose of the heeby-jeebies . . . it is a careful, well-researched work regarding the quest for knowledge and a rumination on mortality."},{"Title":"Empire of Fear","review":"I found that The Empire of Fear had a new, unique perspective on vampires.

I will read more of his work. I am hooked!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Empire of Fear","review":"Brian Stableford's The Empire of Fear was a slow, slow book. It took me over a month to read. (Good books can take me as little as a few hours.) Sometimes, while reading the book, I found the words would start to blur and run together, because I was falling asleep. The last author to put me to sleep was Herman Melville, and I was forced to read that for English class. (So if you are fond of Melville, then this book is for you.) I also found that the characters were extremely wooden and lifeless, with the exception of Leilah. And the hero of the story? The most exciting thing he does is look into a microscope. I gave this book a 2 because I would give anyone a 1 just for writing and publishing a book, and I gave him the other 1 for the effort he put into the book. It obviously took a lot of research. However, I think that if Stableford wants to better engage a reader, he should rely more on imagination, and less on research. I felt as if I was reading an old historical text on vampires, as opposed to the horrifying vampire tale that I had expected. Needless to say, I was very dissapointed, and I would only recommend this book to severe insomniacs in need of a quick cure, or people with a deep love for boring english literature."},{"Title":"Human Society in Ethics and Politics","review":"Most Americans would see Lord Russell's work in ethics as viewed from the right. Russell is forthright in his consequentialism harkening all the way back to Bentham in his preferred treatment of criminals almost as irritating entities that merely need correction.From the left, I suppose he would look like a generic J.S. Mill echo chamber but with more data perhaps. He is clearly a British aristocrat which makes his view somewhat biased. Having seldomly seen what it is like among the lower classes who scramble for what they get, Russell tends to underemphasize &quot;the rules of the game,&quot; as a more Hobbesian perspective would indicate.The book is extremely concise, given its breadth and scope. Russell has demonstrated lexical efficiency that is almost shocking, given his other works.If you major in philosophy, or if you have liberal humanist politics, the book is worth the time it takes to read. Just don't expect it to be a &quot;be all, end all&quot; sort of work. In other words, it is not"},{"Title":"Human Society in Ethics and Politics","review":"This book is probably best used as a place to mine some good Bertrand Russell quotes on issues of humankind and the good society, particularly at the end of chapters, where he tends to get up a head of rhetorical steam. It is not a very deep or probing analysis of any particular problem, nor a carefully researched or detailed account; moreso it is the well-intentioned pontifications of an preternaturally rational and brilliant man with an abiding compassion for humankind. It's more \\"Uncle Bertie weighs in on the problems of humanity\\".Some say Russell's heavy lifting is really only done in his works on math and logic, and this is probably true. This book I think would support that claim. Still, there are some pleasant reflections in it for all it's glosses and generalizations."},{"Title":"Wake Up and Smell the Pizza: 40 Tasty Readings for a Super Supreme Life","review":"This is a devotional written for teens - all teens. It's for those who are strong in their faith and looking for encouragement to stay that way and for those whose life is a mess and who are looking for a way out. The authors are in touch with the worries and struggles facing teens today and they communicate in ways that teens will understand.Authors Jedd and Todd Hafer discuss topics that we as parents may cringe at but they give real answers to the real questions and realities of today's teens. They do it in a straight forward, easy to understand way with enough humor thrown in to keep it interesting.Each chapter is short enough to start a small group meeting and to open up a discussion time. Each thoroughly covers an important issue and leads to an exercise on how to incorporate it into and make it work in real life. The Bible verses at the end of each chapter remind the reader that all this practical wisdom comes from and is found in the Bible.When I picked up this book, titled \\"Wake Up and Smell the Pizza,\\" knowing it was for teens, I was prepared to read it for resouce purposes only. However, I hadn't read very far when I discovered that I was really enjoying it. I found myself thinking that I could suggest it for a fun woman's group study. It's for anyone who likes to get into the basics of following Christ, have serious discussions and likes to laugh sometimes too."},{"Title":"Wake Up and Smell the Pizza: 40 Tasty Readings for a Super Supreme Life","review":"This is the best teen devotional I have read -- and I have read a lot of 'em!

Hart's book is profound, sorely needed, and right on. She argues that idolizing children and focusing solely on their self-esteem is not healthy. Clearly they need nurturing, but not to the exclusion of limits, ground rules, and a solid understanding of right and wrong. Parents need to be authority figures. They also, she argues, need to stop obsessing about perfect kids and realize that mistakes can become learning opportunities that help children grow into healthy, well centered adults. And, of course, she argues against falling for the latest 60-seconding parenting tip of the day. Her work helps shift the focus back to parent's proper roles and responsibilities in guiding the character of their children. I taught in a public school part-time for eight years and currently teach martial arts to kids (and adults). I have seen the behavioral problems she refers to over and over again and have seen first hand how her approach really does work. And I use a similar approach with my own kids. This book is well written, compelling, and sorely needed. It's about time someone promulgated this approach. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"It Takes a Parent: How the Culture of Pushover Parenting Is Hurting Our Kids--and What to Do About It","review":"This book should be a household tool. I just read a copy and have to say that Mrs. Hart is preaching to the choir for me and so many other moms. It is difficult to stand up to what everyone else is doing with and for their kids when you are different. The odd part, is that in our hearts, we know we are doing what is best for our children by not falling for the mega advertising and \\"stepford children\\" mentality that everyone else is doing.My twin stepdaughters want everything that they see on TV and in magazines, even hear ads on the radio. Even though their natural mom runs to the mall to get them everything possible \\"BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES,\\" their dad and I do not play this game. It is a terrible struggle, especially when we know that there are other parents and step-parents who want to go along with us but choose not to due to looking like a bad person.There are only a handful of us in their school who do not play by the rules and pressures of today's society and we are constantly being shot down and talked about. It would be much easier to just go with the flow.I am very happy that Mrs.Hart, a syndicated columnist, has taken a stand on this matter and hope that each and every parent will give it up and read the book.It will surely get much negative exposure, \\"How dare someone question the rules of the IN CROWD, and tell parents to act and become the PARENT...\\"It's very brave of her to do so...as well as another syndicated family columnist, Jodie Lynn. In her book, Mommy-CEO, she says similar things and offers similar \\"how to\\" alternatives for parents to be THE PARENTS. Both books are well qualified to be in every household across the GLOBE and should become a tool in each house.For the sake of all children, please buy both books and share them with everyone. If we are to save our children and ourselves, listen to these two authors who know what they see and hear each day from parents and teachers themselves.BRAVO to these two women who are brave enough to come out of the MEDIA world and tell it like it really is!"},{"Title":"It Takes a Parent: How the Culture of Pushover Parenting Is Hurting Our Kids--and What to Do About It","review":"As a 40 year old single man without children, the subjectof raising kids does not, in itself interest me.However, for years I have admired Ms. Hart ability touse and express common sense in getting to the crux ofproblems.

So much of today's conventional wisdom in rasing children is based on horribly flawed studies and poor/biased use of data (As an Auditor/CPA this is something I often deal with)Her chapter in spanking is a minor masterpiece of explaining the almost unbelievably biased interpretation of studies done on raising children.

Once you read this book, you'll never look at \`expert' advice the same way. There are phrases in the book that she overuses, in my opinion, but I just overlooked that knowing she was obviously doing it to reinforce her point.

This frequently takes the form of 'here is what pushover parents are doing' and here is what it makes sense to do. This approach however is what really appeals to her niche audience and if you can excuse her the format of the argument, there is frequently something worth pondering in her message.Three Stars.

A scary fraction of high school graduates are functionally illiterate. If more parents were involved in the education of their children this number would drop. Many of the teenagers involved with gangs, drugs, and sex come from families where the parent didn't parent. Recently I've seen articles about how some parents are basically outsourcing \\"parenthood\\" and having others raise their children.Betsy Hart's book \\"It Take a Parent\\" is a wake up call to parents. She wants them to be more involved, to take ownership for the responsibility of being a parent, and to be a parent. As older, more mature, and hopefully wiser adults, parents need to decide to be in charge of the family. Otherwise, as Betsy says, the children will be in charge.Betsy says that many of the experts in the parenting culture tell parents to be more passive, to let children do what they want, and try to be their children's best friend. Betsy says parents need to be parents. If a child is angry at his parent, oh well, parents need to be focused on the long term. She sees parenting as a rescue mission for the heart of the child. Children are not naturally born with self discipline, wisdom, and charity. Parents need to model these, and to direct children in appropriate ways, giving consequences when children make bad choices.Betsy makes many good points in this book. For example she makes a distinction between personality and character. Personality is largely what comes with the child. A child may be thoughtful, outgoing, energetic, and so on. Parents should not try to change a child's personality. Parents should be working to help develop a child's character. They should teach the child to be honest, hard working, and caring.Another point Betsy makes, several times, is children need to learn they are not the center of the world. Children should learn to work with others, and not to always demand that they get their way. A child who learned to expect the world to revolve around him will be an unhappy adult when he finds the rest of the world pretty much ignores his wishes and desires.Betsy has a full chapter on \\"When did 'No' become a dirty word?\\" Many parenting experts say children need to be happy and content, always. Betsy says it is more important for children to learn to follow rules. It is hard to start enforcing rules when children get older if they never followed rules when they were young.Many books are the kind where it is worth reading once. (Some books aren't even worth reading once.) \\"It Takes a Parent\\" is a book I plan to read again in another six months. There is a lot of useful information and ideas in here on how to be a better parent. If you want to be a better parent give this book a try."},{"Title":"It Takes a Parent: How the Culture of Pushover Parenting Is Hurting Our Kids--and What to Do About It","review":"Once in awhile our newspaper would print a column of Betsy Hart ~~ and sometimes, I would agree with her comments/observations and sometimes, I didn't. When I saw this book in a bookstore, I knew that I had to get it and it was worth every penny of the sale. It is practical and common-sense ~~ which seems to be lacking sometimes among all those \\"experts\\" that write parenting books. It is a honest and forthright book ~~ Ms. Hart made no pretensions to be a psychologist or anything like that ~~ she just shared her observations on parenting and knocked out some of the more popular theories.Kids are more resilient than we adults give them credit for ~~ and sometimes, the word \\"no\\" is more helpful than harmful and their tender psyches are not going to be permanently damaged. What would permanently damage them would be the lack of rules and discipline and expectations. She asked a vital question that stuck with me throughout this book: Which one do you want your child to marry? The one that respects \\"no\\" because she learns that it is a good thing even if it's not always pleasant, or the child who rarely hears \\"no\\" and believes that it's unfair and a violation of his/her rights. Good question. And she asks thoughtful and provoking questions throughout this book. She didn't sugarcoat the answers or her opinions ~~ but she wasn't harsh.It is an interesting book ~~ one that I am glad that I got a chance to read. It also validates some of what my husband and I believe in regards to what we want our children to experience out of life ~~ and what we experienced growing up. Being a parent doesn't mean being your child's best friend ~~ it means looking out for your child's best interest and sometimes, your child won't understand that but you have to persevere through it and hold firm to what you believe in. The world does not revolve around any just one person and it's never too early to learn that lesson.Good parenting book ~~ full of practical advice and interesting tidbits regarding her family life.

She presented many well-documented examples of how today's mostly well-intentioned parenting culture has often led parents away from their traditional role in raising their kids, and how too many well-intentioned but misled parents have too often abdicated their parental leadership responsibilities by blindly relying on the advice of the so-called parenting experts. Hart repeatedly made compelling arguments for parents to assert themselves in ways that they can effectively influence their kids' hearts:\\"Parents cannot determine good outcomes for their children. What we can determine is whether we will persevere to the best of our ability in training and guiding them toward the right end...My wise friends helped me to understand that my mission couldn't just be stopping the backtalk, ending the tantrums, or getting my kids to quit squabbling. My mission was to go much further than that. I had to understand my children's hearts were in danger, from themselves even more than from the world, and I had to be on a rescue mission for those hearts. Understanding that, I'm in a much better position to make use of the experts' advice when it's helpful...I like to say that my goal for my children is heaven, not Harvard. If they go to Harvard on their way to heaven, I suppose that's great. But if I'm so focused on getting them into Harvard that I don't think about the much larger goal of helping their hearts become ready for heaven, then I have failed them. What a tragedy that would be. The parenting culture does not have heaven as its goal for my children...It's parents who aren't intimidated by the parenting culture who will typically be in the best position to be a help to their kids.\\"If you are a confused or hesitant parent because of the parenting culture's experts' (authors, doctors, counselors, etc.) advice conflicting with your parental instincts and experiences, this book can help give you confidence when it comes to making decisions about what is best for your kids. If you are a dedicated parent who enjoys sharing and exploring parental tips and experiences with other dedicated parents, this book will make you smile, laugh, and possibly see your parenting role and responsibility in a whole new context - like it did for me."},{"Title":"It Takes a Parent: How the Culture of Pushover Parenting Is Hurting Our Kids--and What to Do About It","review":"Betsy Hart slices and dices the culture of \\"permissive parenting\\" into small pureed pieces in this book.

The thing I like most, as do most readers is that it doesn't overanalyze things. Our culture and the \\"parenting culture\\" as Hart puts it is SO obsessed with overanalyzing things that are easy to figure out. Hart also has the good sense to realize that finding a balance between something is often the most important thing about not only parenting, but most issues in life. I also like how she puts a lot of emphasis on raising compassionate, kind children with a conscience who give to others. So many parents today forget that their kids have to actually interact with others and have good relationships. Despite these good things I gave this book 4 stars becase it did get a bit reptative and too Christian for my taste towards the end. If someone wants to write a book on raising children in a Christian way that's great, but I would rather not read it. Some things she pulls in dealing with Christianity are simple morals people of all or no faiths have, but after 3 Bible quotes and too much talk about sin, it was enough. I also think that there were a few views on child counselors and experts that she judges too quickly. She must realize that there are good professionals for kids who do care, do have their own kids, and do realize they don't know better than the parents.

And those who don't already know it can hear and think they understand -- but they don't really.In any case, knowing it and understanding it have NOTHING to do with political persuasion.

She is unusual for her time in many ways, and is well known as a translator and author.He is a minor Prussian nobleman, Prince Hermann von P&uuml;ckler-Muskau. eight years older than Sarah, famous as a travel author and park designer and for his hedonistic lifestyle. He is playful, full of vitality, curious about everything around him, enthusiastically reaching for every new experience - and particularly those involving women.Sarah is trapped in a loveless and dutiful marriage to John, an austere legal scholar. While she is translating Hermann's book into English they begin to exchange letters, and despite their differing backgrounds a romance develops. Hermann encourages Sarah to be frank and honest and to indulge her imagination. Their letters become increasingly intimate, and after a few exchanges she is eagerly confiding her innermost thoughts about her life, her disappointment in marriage and her hunger for love and sexual satisfaction. She finds the affection, intimacy and emotional sustenance that is so lacking in her marriage, and pours out her feelings with complete openness - completely counter to the customs of her time, and fraught with the danger of discovery as their letters are carried by German embassy couriers right under her husband's nose.As the erotic tension builds Sarah becomes increasingly desperate to love and be loved &quot;as a woman, passionately&quot;. Her thoughts return constantly to adultery, in spite of her strong feelings of duty towards her husband and daughter.The book is an absorbing journey into the mind of a gifted woman who dared to circumvent the repressive customs of her day. It is based on her recently rediscovered letters, which were hidden away for so long in case of censure but which are now more likely to elicit sympathy rather than condemnation. Its appeal is partly in the sheer unlikeliness of the story, and partly in the passion of the letters - which were meant for his eyes only and then the flames.So did they or didn't they? You'll have to read the book to find out."},{"Title":"Contemplating Adultery : The Secret Life of a Victorian Woman","review":"This is a lovely book that describes the correspondence between Sarah Austin and Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muska, which still remains despite several attempts by well meaning family members on both sides to eradicate it. Now available to the public thanks to a Polish archive, Hamburger has been able to write this wonderful book on Sarah and her marriage to John Austin and her mental love affair with a handsome prince. Entrusted to translate his work, she quickly becomes infatuated with him and writes long, personal letters, which he chooses to keep locked in his desk. She fears being exposed by her writing, but continues to pursue closeness with her prince despite how much in could ruin her marriage. She's leading a double life though, and cannot conceive of hurting her husband or daughter, which, strangely, Puckler decides to honor. And that has been her legacy, a good Victorian housewife, despite such passionate letters. A great read to see behind the official period history."},{"Title":"Reading Yellow Pages for Students and Teachers (Kids' Stuff)","review":"This book is considered so useful that our district administrators have actually purchased it for fourth and fifth grade teachers ( and our budget is as dried out as a Japanese seaweed!)"},{"Title":"Electricity (Build a Course)","review":"We purchased this book since my husband needed it for college.

Should the aristocratic family in decline stick to owning their cherry orchard (representative of the grandiose trappings of Russian aristocracy), or give in to modern commercialization in order to survive? What is the value of tradition, and how many trees should one own? Chekhov will not answer these questions for you, but he poses them in most interesting ways. In addition to wise insights into such fundamental dilemmas, Chekhov also provides a lot of witty banter, and a great slice-of-life view at 19th century Russian high culture. But this is not just a Russian play or a 19th century play; its themes, questions, and prospective answers are relevant for individuals coping with society and history in any place, and at any time."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play. By no means would I considered myself a &quot;literary expert,&quot; but this was very readable and you can pull a lot of the deeper meanings and its context in Russian history by yourself. I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I. While it may be set in the tumultuous period prior to the Russian revolution, the ideas and the discussions this play provokes are timeless.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"As I read this play, my family is in the process of moving a thousand miles away from the farm where I grew up. Though I am so far away from the Russian culture and time of this play, the themes of place, tradition, and inevitable change resonated inside of me, and I am grateful to Chekhov for the way he has handled them.The Cherry Orchard is a play about change, and the symbolism is pretty easy to recognize. What makes it stand apart, I think, from a thousand other plays on the same theme is its wonderful sense of comedy, of smiling sadness. Chekhov all his life insisted it was a comedy. As the Cherry Orchard slips away from the Ranevskys, they seem to smile at its going. As they are unable to change their habits -- still lending money they don't have, still spending extravagantly -- they quietly laugh at their own foolishness. The change comes, and they leave, heartbroken -- but embracing the change at the same time, only feebling struggling against it. One feels saddest, in the end, for Lopakhin, the new owner of the Cherry Orchard. He seems to believe he has bought happiness and friends, but is quickly discovering the emptiness of money and possessions, as no one wants to borrow from him, and no one seems to pay him much heed at all.Chekhov paints with a fine brush, and I appreciate that. There is no thunderstorming, no ranting and raving in this work. There is a fine and subtle, sad and comedic portrayal of a family and a place encountering change. It is a heartbreak with a smile.The translation, though the only one I've read, seems good. It is easy to follow and rich in simple feeling.if you'd like to discuss this play with me, or recommend something i might enjoy, or just chat, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"As much as I enjoy Chekhov, I'm not a big fan of THE CHERRY ORCHARD; it never made much sense to me. However, this adaptation by David Mamet makes the play easier to follow and understand. The play itself is often labeled as a tragedy, but really isn't. As Mamet points out in the introduction to this adaptation, the closest form of drama THE CHERRY ORCHARD's structure resembles is the farce. In fact, if all the characters weren't so depressing, the play would be hilarious. Perhaps that is what Chekhov originally intended, that as we would see the outrageous, pitiful existence of the characters in this play we would laugh at their mopping and folly and strive to make our lives more meaningful. This isn't the best work to introduce one to the genius of Chekhov, but it is a classic and if one can get past all the whining (or to use a more pc term &quot;reminiscing&quot;) it's worth the read."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"Anton chekhov's &quot;the cherry orchard&quot; is a captivating, but somewhat confusing tale of an aristocratic household that comes face to face with adversity. His impressionistic portrayal of characters delivers a power packed package of meaning that both appeals to and appalls every human heart. Through a subtle messages and powerful passages chekhov purveys his sentiments about a world that is tainted by a dark cloud of selfishness. Although the play itself is tragic-like the characters are not tragic. They seem to blindly stumble upon the pages of life accomplishing absolutely nothing. Through checkhov's genius they still remain human, with dreams and fears like the rest of us. It is through these characters that chekhov's beliefs are made known."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"People in my line of work (that is, teachers and critics of literature) seem to be paying more attention to &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; these days, but my money is still on &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; as favorite Chekhov play. Dover's incomparably priced edition lacks a little in the readability of the translation, but it's still a nice version of a powerful piece of work.For me, the real strength of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is its unwillingness to come down propagandistically on one side of any issue. The intellectual and eternal student Trophimof levels a critique against capitalism, but one must bear in mind that it is capitalism that engineers the upward rise of the erstwhile peasant (and now landowner) Lopakhin (and, in the context of this play's being labeled a &quot;comedy,&quot; I think Chekhov codes this rise as a conditionally good thing). Trophimof in fact seems to be granted a great deal of authority by the play, as he complains about the lazy intelligentsia and the useless aristocracy, but, sure enough, not wanting to make things too simple or simplistic, Chekhov has Madame Ranevsky put him in his place. If this is a commentary on turn-of-the-century Russian society and politics (and I think we must read it as such), it is a very balanced, multi-perspectival and complex one.Even the criticism of the play's upper classes--the focus on Gayef's irrational obsession with billiards or Pishtchik's naive assumption that, when he is in the deepest of financial troubles, something will always come along to bail him out--is delicately balanced against the workaholic insensitivity of Lopakhin, who leaves Varya Ranevsky stranded at the play's end and expecting a proposal of marriage from him that is hinted at but never comes. What Chekhov seems to be supporting is not, perhaps, Trophimof's over-intellectualized and propaganda-like insistence on work, or Lopakhin's materialistic actual obsession with work, but maybe a revaluation of the priorities that have led to social divisions and the problematic reactions to them.One crucial translation hitch appears early on, as Gayef passionately addresses a cupboard and praises it for holding, for so many years, wisdom and knowledge and the keys to social betterment. All other translations I have consulted have rendered this &quot;cupboard&quot; as a &quot;bookshelf,&quot; and, to be honest, that makes a lot more sense, in context. Other issues of readability (or the slight lack thereof) in this Dover edition are best seen in comparison to Hingley's imminently readable and enjoyable Oxford UP translation and edition, which, to my mind, remains the standard. This Dover edition's dialogue is occasionally stilted and impenetrable.Still, though, for the price, this copy of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is unbeatable. It's an impressive and provocative play, and even more so when one is reminded of its original context. It's problematic, of course, to pin events to each other and argue for direct influence, but I have a hard time seeing the workers' uprisings in Russia during the winter of 1905-06 as completely unrelated from this play's release in 1904, which set many of these still vital issues into motion in a very productive way."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"Too often, 'The Cherry Orchard' moves dangerously close to that dread thing, the Shavian 'comedy' of ideas. full of facile symbolism, a schematic narrative arc and obvious allegorical characterisation, the play seems to groan under the weight of characters pontificating on grave matters such as social and historical change, the 'idea' of Russia and the rhetoric of freedom and progress.What saves 'Orchard' is the merciful fact that it was written by Chekhov and not Shaw. Whatever his overall conception of the play's weighty themes - the decline of the aristocracy; the new economic power of former serfs etc. - Chekhov is simply incapable of writing mere mouthpieces, and every character, no matter how monstrous, limited, avaricious, delusive or paralysed (in action or mind), is suffused with the kind of life (flawed, egocentric, perhaps, but human) for which he had a unique, sympathetic, though always honestly satirical eye. it is a tough task to make an audience empathise with a group of silly former slave-owners, but death, loss, change, poverty, personal failure and disappointment are things we have all felt, and we would probably be lying if we couldn't find something of ourselves in most of the characters (I, worryingly, found myself most drawn to the snobbish, immature, enndearingly gauche Gaev).There are too many emotionally loaded, privileged and enigmatic moments for characters to be simply straw targets, and the play is shot through with poignant autobiographical resonances (it was Chekhov's last, written when he was terminally ill). In fact, the one character I found thoroughly dislikable is the one who seems to make the most humanitarian sense, the revolutionary student Trophimof; but his tedious, inhuman sermons about work and the future sound too much like the Bolsheviks whose barbaric utopia would be established less than two decades later.Unlike Wilde, say, or Shakespeare, Chekhov rarely reads very well on the page. His deliberately plain speech can seem flat, and the importance of silence, waiting, time passing with an almost painful tangibility is impossible to convey, never mind the rhythms that become so evident in performance, or the use of sound effects and music (American translations seem to me the best, fluid and not fusty; I read Carol Rocamora's this time). This is why actors treasure him - his plays are almost like sketches, giving them unprecedented freedom to create characters from hints and ambiguities.Another difference between Shaw and Chekhov is that the former's plays are theses or theorems, designed to prove points the author is unswervingly convinced of before he's even written a word. Chekhov is rarely sure about anything, and his plays are liberatingly, if perilously, open-ended. Despite the rigid structures he fences them in, his characters always feel as if they have lived before the play and will continue to, no matter how badly, long after it.It should also be remembered that Chekhov called 'Orchard' a comedy: it is full of characters and scenes tottering from tragedy to farce. Charlotta, the tragicomic governess, full of amazing magic tricks and ventriloquism, yet fundamentally isolated and facing a desperately uncertain future, is perhaps emblematic."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"I first came across this play in an old college literature book that belonged to my mother. My only disappointment in reading it was that I discovered it shortly after the play came out in London at The Royal Theatre...boo hoo I missed it...maybe can find a recording.To me this play was all about avoidence. The historical Russian setting was also incorporated well. I do not know much about the time or place so I can't say much about that though.It carried themes such as: the avoidence of properl dealing with finances,the avoidence of dealing with relationships, and the avoidence of dealing with the past.I know little else then Shakespear when it comes to plays, so the way relationships were handled was a notable difference.The love stories are not typical or satisfying because the characters either do not want to admit they are in love or they are in love with the wrong person...or thing (money).The Russian names did make it hard for me to follow the storyline, so I ended up writing and drawing character sketches so I could remember who was who.The ending was as unique as the rest of the play and although I know enjoyed it, I am still unsure about it all.

They are about to sell their famed cherry orchard to pay the mortgage.Through the course of the play, the family finds several options to save the cherry orchard, but they do nothing. The estate is sold to a former serf, who doesn't seem to appreciate the cherry orchard and cuts it down.The tragedy is a symbolic one. The aristocracy tries in vain to maintain its social position, while the new bourgeoisie can't find meaning in their new wealth.Bottom Line: The Cherry Orchard is a fantastic play, both to read or to watch, though parts of it get \\"lost-in-translation\\" from the original Russian audience.For more of my reviews, visit trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"I don't think even a seasoned theatre goer could sit through this play if it were directed a drama.

If I were running this play for production, I would work it as a drama.

No translator is credited for this edition. According to the note at the start of the book, the play was initially presented by the Moscow Art Theatre in 1904.The play takes place on the estate of Madame Ranevsky, the matriarch of an aristocratic Russian family that has fallen on financial hard times. She faces the possible loss of her family's magnificent cherry orchard.The play is populated with interesting characters: Lopakhin, a wealthy neighbor whose father was the serf of Madame Ranevsky's father; Firs, an aged servant who longs for the &quot;old days&quot;; Trophimof, a student with lofty ideas; and more. There is a great deal of conflict among the characters.&quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is about people dealing with very personal conflicts and crises while larger socioeconomic changes are going on around them.

The subtext carries the story and is about how not to deal with existentialist stasis -- a state of being immobilized by the fear of change, and the complexity of the denial that under lay this fear. It is this fear and the symbolism it invokes that makes the play universal in its depiction of human fear, suffering, and inability to address change; for at one time or another, these too have engulfed us all. It is against this backdrop that Chekov's real talent, comes to the fore: his incredible ability to graphically develop characters and analyze them psychologically with a fine-tooth comb.Chekov demonstrates an uncanny ability to draw out the deepest images of personal psychological angst, and is almost comical in his analysis which is always exquisitely sensitive -even of the most serious of issues such as those that beset this wealthy Russian family. The underlying message is that \\"life must go on\\" whether or not we address reality squarely in the face, or allow it to hit us in the \\"behind\\" as we are on the way out the door, as it did Madame Ranyevskaya and her family, as her creditors came to take away all of her possessions, including her cherry orchard from under her.This is quintessentially Chekov; but it needs to be read several times to weave together the text with the subtext.Five stars."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard (Plays for Performance Series)","review":"I recently saw a production of this and I was moved to tears.

Nearly a hundred years later, the characters are just as real, and one can get just as much out of it. And a hundred years later, they still will be. Because certain things never change in humanity.

On the one it is the story of the characters' relationships to each other. Often in Chekhov there is disillusionment and disappointment, misunderstanding and desire unrealized. Often too the characters have ideas and dreams about themselves which simply do not find their justification in the world. But in all this there is always interspersed moments of tenderness and poignancy, of delicate feeling, perceptions of beauty.On another level there are ' major themes'. Here it is of the Old Order passing and the coming of the new. The 'Cherry Orchard' is the symbol of this. And the purchase of it by the former serf Lopahin is the sign of the transition taking place in Russia. The old order people, Ranskanaya her daughters and brother cling to the older world, refuse to sell it out by accepting the offer to build on it dachas, and connect it with the railway line. But in the end the extravagance of Ranskaya is forced to yield, and the 'Cherry Orchard' is cut down.In the final moments of the play the elderly servant Firs, the true symbol of the one raised in the old order and too deeply connected to it, to ever leave it, lies down and seems to pass away.Chekhov's art is an art of sadness and beauty, of cruelty and change , but above all of human character and feeling portrayed in complexity and contradiction- and in a language of poetic compression deep in feeling."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I, too, started reading this series when I was just a kid, sneaking into my mom's \\"secret stash\\" of romance novels she thought she hid from me!

From what I can tell, most of the reviewers have read the series from the beginning and feel the same way I do. I loved \\"This Calder Sky\\" so much in '81 when it came out. And the next couple were good, too. But the last story I liked even a little bit was \\"Calder Pride\\". The three since then have been such disappointments. This book tells the story of Laura Calder, Ty's daughter, Chase's granddaughter. It's pretty bad when you can't even work up any liking for the heroine, let alone the men she's supposed to be \\"torn\\" between. Laura is spoiled and shallow. Although she's said to be beautiful, I had a hard time believing that two men would fall in love with her on the night they meet her. It appears maybe Boone isn't really in love with her, but he wants her for a trophy wife to satisfy his father. I did like Sebastian a little, and I actually thought he was too good for Laura. Dailey continues her alarming trend of killing off beloved characters. By the next book, Chase will probably have died, since he's suddenly in his 80's. (Wasn't he about 22 in 1981?) Although I find it annoying, I do understand the rapid aging of the characters. They do it on soap operas, too. It's the only way to keep the stories going.

(We did, eventually, but all those characters were unfortunately marginalized even then.)Because I had already bought it, I followed this up with \\"Lone Calder Star\\" and liked it much better. I wish I had just skipped Laura's story. I have a suggestion: if Ms. Dailey insists on killing off main characters, I vote for Laura and Tara."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I've always been one of the first to buy Janet Dailey books and have read all of the Calder writings. This in NO way compares to her previous Calder stories, in fact I had to actually make myself finish it. No real point of the story unless we zero in on Laura and her inability to choose which one of the available men to sleep with ... and how soon. It will be a LONG time before I buy another Janet Dailey book -- believe she's lost her touch -- it's time to look at other authors."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"Expecting the great Calder saga that came alive in her first three books, it is so disappointing to see the way Janet Dailey is now writing. I bought her first book over 25 years ago when it was released. This Calder edition has another beloved character killed and not even mentioning some of the family. It's hard to get a close feeling to the new characters because we miss the old ones too much!!!"},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"This was my least favorite of the Calder Series. Laura Calder did not come across as an endearing heroine as did Lorna, Maggie, Cat, and even Jessy. Even her twin brother, Trey, is not thrilled with her overall behavior. I would suspect if Janet Dailey writes a story about Trey, his sister's treatment of men will become an issue for him when he tries to fall in love. The first four or five books in the series were very good and loaded with interesting information about the geographical area in Eastern Montana. I am happy to say, Ms. Dailey's last Calder book \\"Lone Calder Star\\" does come back around."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I purchased Janet Dailey's complete 10 volume Calder Series because of my love of western/ranchland fiction. This, the 7th of the series, diverts the reader completely away from the plains of Montana and centers around the hoidy toidy carryings on of aristocratic Europeans. If I had been interested in this type of novel, there are plenty others out there. There was no need to stray so far from the central story-line of this series. I found myself reading entire chapters then realizing I had no idea of what I had read. This installment was a waste of her time as a writer and my time as a reader."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"The book started out ok and promised to be a smooth read and it was, but I lost my interest in reading it further when it brought me to the part when Laura takes off with Sebastian, whom by the way she meets the same very day, they go for a car ride, after which she gets into a cold fountain naked to get a coin. Notice, that Laura is not a child but a young woman.Laura's character is undeveloped, poor and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book after two chapters."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have read all the Calder series books and didn't even know a new one was out till I happened upon it in a store. I was thrilled. I'll say one thing for this book--it was a fast read and held my attention. I wouldn't call it riveting though, by a long stretch. For one thing not only was the heroine (Laura) spoiled(OK, she owned up to that), but she was not very nice.She slept with one guy, while engaged to another. Also, this habit of Ms. Dailey of killing off a main character or two in the most gruesome fashion possible is getting old and annoying. I don't think one single person since the original couple(Lorna&Benteen) has died a natural or usual death. It's getting redundant. Noone formally notified poor Cat(whom I believe was originally named Catherine, but in the last two installments became a Cathleen)of Logan's death either. It was all about how everyone else was taking it and no scene was described with the news being broken to his widow. It was discussed(telling her), but never played out.I don't know. Let's hope Ms. Dailey goes back and reads her own series as a refresher before undertaking her next Calder entry. I have them all and will keep the set, so I buy each new installment. To someone who hasn't followed along...don't start with this one."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I picked this book up because I was in the library and a little bored, and I had a dim recollection of thinking that Dailey had good characters. As far as 'dim' goes, it was a 5-watt idea.The plot is something like an heiress named Laura is traveling Europe with her father's first wife, Tara and two guys, both \\"sultry,\\" handsome and sexually magnetic, fall in love with her, the night they meet her. What's a girl to do?Why should you never pick this book up? Because Laura's character has no depth--she's not even \\"too perfect\\" she's just too dumb. With her astounding good looks--\\"she knows it\\", her 'charm', her continuous conquests, her stupid jump in the fountain, I literally tossed this book aside in disgust.I'm sorry Dailey. I respect you as an author and am sorry to see you not equalling the potential your earlier books showed. All readers out there, if you're looking for books with good characters and engaging stories.... look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"This was the first Calder book that I have read. I did not even know that there were others. It is a novel that can stand on its own. It was in the 7 day books at the library so, I just grabbed it.First, I do agree with the other reviewers that Laura Calder comes across as shallow and self centered. To be honest if I was beautiful, rich, and manipulative, I am none of these things. SOB!I loved the romance and her description of the passion of Sebastian and Laura. It made me jealous that I could not find a man like Sebastian. However, I am annoyed with Sebastian (being annoyed with ficticious characters not healthy!). He let Laura walk all over him and treat him like dirt. I cannot believe any man in his right mind would tolerate that! I do not care how much a guy is in love that is beyond.Laura's \\"Aunt\\" Tara was very bossy and manipulative. She called Max Rutledge to get Boone to travel to the Triple C. If she loved Laura so much, why didn't she want to see her happy? Or better yet, talk to her first! If everyone dislikes her so much, howcome she is still in the picture at the end? Hmmm... Is this because I missed the other books in the series? Perhaps, but I do not think so.I think the Calders were especially polite to Sebastian considering Laura told them that she did not want him around. Could they be that easy going?What son, referring to Boone, would listen to his father like he does? He is an adult and make his own choices good or bad. If my father ever told me that I had to propose when I knew the person for a short time, I would definitely have something to say about it. After all, it is committment and she is just a prize to his father. Couldn't Laura just say no and be her own women.I do not understand why all of these romance novels have to make women so weak and dependent upon a man. I guess this is why they are romance novels. I gave it 3 stars because the romance part swept me away."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have read all the Calder books up to this one. So far ever book has included one of the main characters or their spouse dying. I really don't like reading books, getting attached to the lead characters and then have them die off. Each book is the same theme. I realize that rich powerful families have enemies but this family just has too many. The character I would like to see killed off is Tara.... how somebody with such heartless manipulations can continue to be included in a family and cause the problems she does is beyond me. I understand being nice to somebody but the trouble that Tara causes from the time she marries Ty, gets divorced from him, he is killed and out of the series and she still is allowed access to the family and the ranch. I don't want to even read this book because it contains Tara. I might skip it and go to the next.It would have been more interesting if the author would have brought the family through the roaring 20's, the depression, WWII and into present time. Its seems we start in the late 1800's and then we aren't really sure of the times the family is living in.

Janet Dailey provides hours of enjoyment, whether reading any of her books for the first time, or re-reading her older titles."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I love Janet Dailey's \\"Calder\\" Series. The stories werevery interesting and intriging to read."},{"Title":"Calder Promise","review":"I have been disappointed in the last several Dailey books in the Calder series, but I think she's back in the saddle with this one.While her tendency to \\"retire\\" her older characters by killing them off willy nilly might be disconcerting, it is a realistic method of making way for the younger generation.The Calder characters in earlier novels had to be tougher, because there was generally some physical or financial risk in their lives. I think it is a legitimate endeavor to see what a Calder heir is like when she has been raised with wealth and privilege and is able to take success for granted, not struggle to achieve it.There are frequently members of any family who, for one reason or another, don't quite fit in with the rest. So we have Laura, who is more than a little spoiled and who values the culture and sophistication in a world larger than the Triple C ranch. She's young, she's beautiful, she's rich; she's also a little wild and unconventional. She's used to having men pursue her, and she enjoys manipulating them to get what she wants.In many ways, this is a coming of age novel, in which the heroine has to decide who she is and what her values are. Will she embrace her Calder legacy, or will she go her own way? Will she get involved in life, or will she merely be a spectator, using her wealth as a buffer? Will she marry the man she has fallen in love with, or will she marry the wealthy man who will provide her with an opulent but probably shallow lifestyle?If you are a longtime Dailey fan, as I am, you already know the answers to these questions. One of Dailey's strengths as a writer is to take imperfect people, present them with problems, and give them the opportunity to grow while they overcome them. She does this very well in this novel, as well as providing strong new characterizations, snappy dialog, and steamy romance.There's more to be seen with the next generation of Calders, and I for one am looking forward to it."},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark (Armed Services edition)","review":"The Cruise of the Snark relays the saga of Jack London's construction, and two-year voyage in a 45-foot sailing ketch from San Francisco to Hawaii, the Marquesas, Tahiti, and the head-hunting Solomon islands.His difficulties in getting the boat built after the 1906 San Fran earthquake are hilarious as he describes the assaults of his contractors and creditors during the construction.After they finally launch the voyage six months late, they manage to find Hawaii through sheer luck, where Jack and his plucky wife, Charmain, learn to surf (remember this is 1907!), visit the leper colony at Molokai and the &quot;House of the Sun&quot; volcanic crater on Maui.Then comes the &quot;impossible traverse&quot; to the Marquesas, which they didn't realize couldn't be done until a week after they'd begun. Continuing on to Tahiti and the savage Solomon islands, Jack and his determined &quot;Snarkites&quot; encounter natives, tribal chieftains, missionaries, and overcome their problems with incredible persistence and naivete as only some of the first white people to enter these areas could possess.Incidentally, the &quot;cook&quot; on this voyage was the famous photographer and world explorer Martin Johnson who was picked to go on his very first adventure by a letter to Jack advertising his thirst for travel. With his wife Osa, he would years later revisit the Solomons for the purpose of photographing cannibalism before embarking on their epic photographic safaris in Africa and Borneo. Jack only mentions Martin in passing during &quot;the Cruise&quot;, perhaps sensing some literary and photographic competition that he would encounter later.This book is a great shelf companion to Martin's &quot;Through the South Seas with Jack London&quot;, upon which he began his great series of travel books. &quot;The Cruise&quot; gives Jack's viewpoint as the sponsor of the trip, and an established literary giant. Whereas Martin's opinions on the racial makeup of the islanders are quite bigoted and reflect the prevailing views of the turn of the century, Jack is more open-minded, and willing to point out the failings of the white race in adapting to these island paradises.&quot;The Cruise&quot; is a great non-fiction book, among few others by London such as &quot;the Abyss&quot; that tell of his adventures and opinions first-hand as they happen. It truly captures his sarcastic yet hopeful perspective of himself and the whole concept of adventure."},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark (Armed Services edition)","review":"If you are travelling to Hawaii or any Polynesian destination, then make this book one of your companions.

Bay being from the Bay area and I truely related to this story and since the Snark was being built by Jack London right before the 1906 quake. It amazed me and invariably he got taken advantage of by the various builders which led to some precarious sailing manuevers since they measured wrong on one side. Which Jack London didn't find out until out at sea. I could picture all the island stops and so enjoyed the old photos that were put into the Snark truly an interesting journey. It was interesting to me hearing of the staph infections were attacking the individuals when the crew would cut themselves and then end up with these sores they knew nothing about and how they had to heal themselves with virtually no medicines on board. This book is a captain's log which he wrote in daily. If your a sailor you'll love it or even if you've been exposed as I have you'll enjoy it, especially if you happen to be from the Bay area. I recommend it as an interesting and enjoyable read though at times I did feel he was just writing to keep his checks coming in to pay for his journey.Sebastopolian Reader"},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark (Armed Services edition)","review":"In 1907 Jack London departed San Francisco for a trip around the world. For this voyage he commissioned the construction of a 45-foot yacht he dubbed the Snark. Taking along his wife Charmian, a small crew, a library of books, and a typewriter, he set off for the South Pacific. Along the way he wrote the series of articles that make up this book.I have read most of Jack London's works, and this is one of my least favorites. Given the subject matter, you'd think this account would be loaded with exciting adventures, but much of the book lacks interest. Essentially it's a series of essays about an aging millionaire and his wife who travel around the world on their yacht. Everywhere they go they're treated like visiting dignitaries. It's a far cry from the gritty, perilous exploits one finds in London's fiction. Many of the chapters concentrate on the mundane, technical aspects of the seafaring life. This detracts from the more worthwhile discussions of the exotic destinations that were visited. There are a few good pieces of travel writing here and there. London learns to surf at Waikiki, visits the leper colony of Molokai, and encounters a prototypical American hippie in Tahiti. In the Marquesas he visits the sight of Herman Melville's Typee, but instead of finding a thriving civilization of noble savages he finds an abandoned jungle sprinkled with a few sickly inhabitants. This letdown is indicative of the book as a whole. In The Cruise of the Snark, the romance of the South Seas proves to be a disappointing illusion.If you happen to be a sailor or a boat enthusiast you may enjoy this book more than the average reader. The text is peppered with sailing jargon, and at times London details his nautical maneuvers to the point of tedium. Resolving to teach himself celestial navigation en route, he devotes a few chapters to his trial and error in this arcane craft, which will bore the tears out of the typical landlubber. Sailing a small craft on the open ocean for months on end is a daring feat, but most likely the greatest peril faced by the travelers on this voyage was the possibility of getting lost in the empty seas due to a mathematical error on the part of the author.The original edition contained over 100 photos London took during the trip. Though he was a skilled photographer, in the printed editions I've seen the images are too small and murkily reproduced to be of much value. These photos are absent from the Kindle edition, but they're no great loss.Jack London wrote many excellent books, both fiction and nonfiction. The Cruise of the Snark is not one of them, and should not be high on your reading list. If you're looking for South Pacific adventure, I would suggest his short story collections On the Makaloa Mat and South Sea Tales."},{"Title":"The cruise of the Snark (Armed Services edition)","review":"I've recently arrived back in the USA from Suva and Nadi in Fiji, one of Jack's stopping points.However, what he describes about the South Pacific is no more.London's South Pacific was affected by European trade and commerce. For one thing, disease, in an era when its prevention was primitive, was rife and the inhabitants of the islands he visited were dropping like flies. Today, of course, the very same network has brought modern medicine and the major health threat to natives in the South Pacific is obesity: the only restaurant on Victoria Parade in Suva, allowed Sunday hours, was McDonald's, while Singh's Curry Shop had to close (I recommend the latter, around the corner from McDonald's on Gordon Street: try the goat curry).London's natives were partly pagan. Today, ordinary people in Oceania are mostly fundamentalist Christian, and, in Suva, there is also a streak of Islam, petering out far to the west of Indonesia but echoing in the afternoon call of the Muezzin in Suva.The fundamentalism means that the yachtsman is well-advised on shore to dress modestly. Of course, London and his wife did this naturally, long ago. I actually saw an Australian man warn a woman in shorts in Suva to put knickers on lest one of the local Methodists or Moslems be offended.But any myth of escape has been so commodified in the South Pacific by tavern owners and tourist companies as to be sour and bitter to the taste.London, while asserting his property rights thoughtlessly at Oakland's wharf, and while assuming he had the right to hire men to work on his boat and judge their hard work in print, also assumed, in the South Pacific, his right to wander at will.Today, as the Rough Guide to Fiji advises the tourist, 85% of the land in Fiji is owned fee simple by chiefs. Sir Arthur Gordon decided not to repeat America's dispossession of the Indians and covenanted with the lads in Fiji in such a way that today, the natives form a land-owning aristocracy.Their fair-mindedness (as on display from Steve Rabuka who backed down from being a military dictator) means that other lads from other mobs have rough civic equality.London was the prototype, however, of the colonialist as rugged individual whose humanity is based on the unconscious deprivation of others' humanity.London was the prototype of the soured Yank who when a lad thought the best of people, without a dime to his name, who now has everything, and thinks the worst of people.London with a grin repeats texts from the hundreds of letters he received from individuals who wanted to sign on to the Snark and so escape their own lives of quiet desparation in an America already unbearable for the average city-dweller. Like him they yearned for a clean-limbed life but unlike London they lacked cash.London essentially uses their texts to pad out a book that was obviously written not from the heart but to raise cash for a silly boat.Any yachtsman knows in his heart of hearts that if the landlubber wants his experience, he has only to stand in a cold shower tearing up 100 dollar bills. The Snark was an expensive lark and, like modern yachts, unconsciously offensive at both its sharp end (where were the natives, giving London gifts and dying like flies) and its blunt end (where were the American laborers whose work London disrespects because it was not finished on his schedule).The South Seas are overrun, today, by people who really ought to be paying more taxes back home. I traveled out there to work at global rates and learned much more about the REAL South Seas than any tourist might, and I'm afraid that Joe Conrad, who also worked for a living, in The Heart of Darkness is more reliable on the tropics than old Jack London.I'm afraid that London saw, what he wanted to see: the Gilded Age struggle of man against man. However, as Hannah Arendt points out in The Origins of Totalitarianism, this defines rather a culture of hatred out of which were form racialist identities. London was for the most part free of any special form of racism but he did believe that Socialism was impossible because Alpha males (like Wolf Larsen) would take what they need.Well, they might, and they do. Nonetheless, in the South Seas and elsewhere, Beta males and women continue some how to achieve more, and of more lasting value, by working in groups. Sir Arthur Gordon is forgotten save in Suva, because unlike Cecil Rhodes he failed to mind his own press-agentry but it appears he did lasting good with his land-tenure scheme.London never learned the limits of his world view and his darkest book, Alcoholic Memories, is a testament to London's limitations.My favorite yachtsman remains good old Tristan Jones, a British sailor who was trained in the Royal Navy and who paid his dues. Tristan would like me arrive back, from the back of beyond, without a dime and go willingly to work while living willingly in a doss-house. Tristan dragged his own boat across the Mato Grosso and talked back to tinpot Fascists in Stroessner's Paraguay.In my experience it is relatively easy to learn the mechanics of a sailing boat but what is hard is endurance, not only of Nature but the Other. London endured Nature but has a tendency to be impatient in print with others, as shown by his insenstive near-mockery of applicants for service on his boat. Jones, on the other hand, mocks only people who deserve it, like customs agents in Paraguay.We lack Tristan Jones' spirit in America with the result that the Third World is overrun with the worst of us, whining yachtsmen and CIA agents and their trophy wives. London I fear was despite his genuine greatness of soul a prototype for the worse that came later."},{"Title":"Timetables of Women's History","review":"Taking the position that women were relegated to secondary status as history was written, the author, who has penned several studies on women in the Middle Ages, seeks to rectify that oversight.Archeological evidence, qualified as somewhat ambiguous, sheds some light on the lives of women in prehistoric times. For instance, 26,000 years ago the portrait of a woman was crafted in ivory. Nearby that discovery was found what might be her grave, apparently the burial was an honored one.The Middle Ages produced some talented artists, often nuns who copied texts and colored the illustrations; 23 female painters lived in Bologna in the 16th and 17th centuries.Prodigious research makes this text both fact-filled and fascinating.

In that regard I suppose it's a fair sampling of postwar Austrian literature, but what I had not expected was that this sampling would be so numbingly boring. As the majority authors represented were born during or soon after WWII, I shouldn't have been so surprised that the war and guilt are recurring themes, even in stories written in the '90s. While understand that the Austrian collaboration (Anschluss) with the Nazis is a scar in the national psyche, I suspect that those with more intimate knowledge of Austria may be able to tease a little more meaning out of the stories than I was able to.Meaning and theme aside, too many of the stories are just flat out boring. I did more or less like Heimito von Doderer's \\"Beneath Black Stars\\", narrated by a Luftwaffe officer. I very much enjoyed Hans Carl Artmann's \\"Blind Chance and Roast Duck\\", which is a brief comic farce about three gentlemen who have gambled their money away. Peter Henisch's \\"Brutal Curiosity\\" appears to be a somewhat autobiographical account of his dying father's experience as a combat photographer in WWII which reads rather well. Gert Jonke's \\"The Bridge\\" comes close to being something quite interesting, and Peter Handke's two page sketches aren't bad. The remainder of the stories utterly failed to connect with me, mostly for stylistic reasons. In many cases the writing seemed incredibly stiff, while in others, experimentation runs amok.I had hoped to emerge from this anthology with a sense of Austria beyond the standard Vienna, Mozart, classical view, with a gritty glimpse into the more real modern Austria. These stories more or less try to do that in a variety of ways, but ultimately fail. Rather than show what's going on now, the authors are more interested in deconstructing myths of the past."},{"Title":"Beneath Black Stars","review":"Deftly edited by Martin Chalmers, Beneath Black Stars is an outstanding selection of original short stories by a number of talented, twentieth century Austrian writers. Many of these stories appear in English for the first time, and subtly express such concerns as alarm over the degree to which Austria collaborated with Nazi leaders during the German occupation, among other dark corners of Austrian culture that are not so often discussed in the land of Mozart, Vienna, and The Blue Danube. A most impressive and compelling literary anthology, Beneath Black Stars is a welcome and highly recommended contribution to Austrian Literature supplemental reading lists and reference collections."},{"Title":"Van Cliburn","review":"I enjoyed Howard Reich's biography of Van Cliburn tremendously and give it &quot;4 stars.&quot; Only the pianist's own autobiography could top it. I found Reich's book to be thoroughly researched and rich in detail. Personally, I appreciated reading about Cliburn's family's history. Van is fiercely Texan and no story about him would be complete without discussing his deep Texas roots.As a lifelong Cliburn devotee, I've read most of what's printed about Mr. Cliburn. Of course, much of the generally known, factual-type statistics can't help but be repeated, but I found a lot of information in Reich's book not found elsewhere.I especially love the many anecdotes in this book, as they illustrate so warmly and so well Van's &quot;small town&quot; Texas childhood (Kilgore) as contrasted with his &quot;artist's life&quot; on the world stage.Two examples: One of Cliburn's closest childhood friends, Lottie Guttry, describes sitting in a Kilgore Baptist church with Van's family one Sunday. She recalls how she and Van watched as an elderly man sneezed some ill-fitting dentures straight out of his mouth...and directly in front of where Van and she stood! She says Van's sense of humor took over and, no matter how hard he tried, he could not stop laughing. Van's parents were NOT amused, however, and Van recalls each parent taking &quot;a piece of his shoulder&quot; and pinching it for all it was worth. He says, tongue-in-cheek, that his parents were &quot;great pinchers.&quot;Van personally tells the story of a disastrous concert scenario where the damper pedals literally dropped off a piano as he began playing the Schumann Concerto. He says he was &quot;just this little kid&quot; in the middle of an on-stage &quot;TRAIN WRECK.&quot; The piano tuner/repairman was summoned but had &quot;left the building&quot; - and a very young Van Cliburn was left to (literally) pick up the pieces. Van recounts how the Prussian conductor announced &quot;the obvious&quot; to the audience (&quot;Laties and gentlemen...ze pedals have DROPPED OFF!&quot;) before erupting off-stage. Fortunately, one of the orchestra members worked as a piano tuner in his spare time and quickly repaired the pedals - and Cliburn went on to play to standing ovations.I think Reich has done an excellent job in locating and interviewing the people who knew Cliburn best - his friends and neighbors from Shreveport, from Kilgore, and his Juilliard classmates. Even when Van was only 19 or so, his peers at Juilliard say they recognized that his genius was something truly special and profound. Reich also describes the rivalries that surfaced among the top piano students at Juilliard during that time. Also Rosina Lhevinne's strong belief in Van, that she never considered any other student but Van to enter the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow - that she firmly believed that he was the only American capable of winning the Gold.Of course, no one will EVER tell the life story of Van Cliburn better than the artist himself. I do hope he writes his memoirs someday. But as wonderful a gift as that would be to his fans all over the world, I doubt Van will actually do so. From what I've read and sense, Mr. Cliburn is a very private person, and a very humble one. I think he is more comfortable having others tell his life story than telling it himself. Fred Astaire had this same type humility. He viewed dancing as &quot;his job.&quot; Cliburn takes an almost evangelical approach in sharing his musical gifts. His mother, Rildia Bee taught him &quot;to be thankful..grateful...not proud.&quot; Indeed, Van has often been quoted as saying he feels he is a &quot;servant&quot; of music, that he wishes to share with others whatever musical gifts God has bestowed upon him. That sort of humility is very rare in the artistic world.I have been an admirer of Mr. Cliburn's all my life and I try to catch his concerts whenever I can. A couple of years ago, I drove to Nashville to watch Maestro Cliburn open the 52nd season there. I purchased a front row ticket for the occasion. When Mr. Cliburn learned that my traveling companion and I had driven several hours from out-of-state to see him play in concert, he said, &quot;You mean you drove ALL that way just to see ME!&quot; He could not have been kinder or more gracious. Shortly after our arrival at our hotel, my friend and I chanced upon Mr. Cliburn while walking through the hotel lobby and, although I think of myself as being fairly sophisticated, I did gasp: &quot;Mr. Cliburn, it's YOU!&quot; And, not missing a beat, Maestro Cliburn leaped to his feet, shook a long index finger at me and playfully shot back, &quot;Yes, it's ME, it's ME!&quot; We all laughed and, for the next 20 minutes or so, my friend and I had the most delightful conversation with one of the music world's most incredible legends. I will never forget it as long as I live - the three of us standing there chatting in a hotel lobby. I was visibly trembling when Mr. Cliburn turned to speak to me - and he took my hand into both of his. His kindness, his compassion go without saying. In Reich's book, he describes his own sense of awe and wonder at meeting his own idols. Knowing he understood, I let my words and emotions tumble forth. He is a wonderful, patient and understanding listener. I told him the joy his music had brought me over the years, how his early recordings introduced me to piano repertoire and inspired me to take piano lessons myself. I told him what an &quot;awful&quot; pianist I was - and he laughed with me about that! I found him totally charming, extremely warm and down-to-earth (very &quot;Texan&quot;). And when I concluded by telling Mr. Cliburn how his poetic, heartfelt interpretations touched my heart more than any other pianist's, he gave me a big hug right there in the lobby and told me how much my words meant to him! I was very moved by his humility, genuineness, and graciousness. Mr. Cliburn impressed me as being very much at peace with himself and with his place in the world.At the conclusion of a recent interview, Cliburn stated that he feels somewhat out of synch in today's modern world, that he best &quot;belongs to the nineteenth century.&quot; The following image is forever seared in my memory... When it came time to say our goodbyes to Mr. Cliburn, my friend said her goodbyes first, then turned and began to walk away. And there I was, standing with the Maestro, just the two of us. I thanked Mr. Cliburn for his generosity and kindness, for indulging my friend and me with his time and company, and told him that I looked forward to watching him in concert the following evening. He stood there, quietly smiling, then brought his hand up over his heart, gave a little bow of his head and softly said, &quot;Thank you, Madame.&quot; I will NEVER forget that moment as long as I live (very &quot;nineteenth century&quot;). But that wasn't the end of it. The following evening, Mr. Cliburn generously played my two encore requests. As he walked off-stage that evening, he slowly raised his arm toward me acknowledging to the audience that the last encore had been 'for me.' I can think of no more touching or beautiful a gift from an artist to his fan than that! Mr. Reich's book is a warm, and honest tribute to a phenomenally gifted, caring and unique artist."},{"Title":"Van Cliburn","review":"The book I purchased arrived on time and I look forward to reading it. Nothing more needs to be said."},{"Title":"Van Cliburn","review":"Maybe it was because I had just finished reading the biographies of Leonard Bernstein, who was a very controversial figure, with lots of flaws and mistakes (the authors were very honest about them and weren't afraid of discussing the conductor's flaws). Compared to Bernstein's dynamic, mischievous life, Van Cliburn in this book looked like a superficial \\"good boy\\" figure.In this book, Cliburn is near perfect, with hardly any mistakes or characteristic flaws, which may be true, but hard to believe. YOu really can't be perfect all the time and be loved by everyone when you're in that kind of position.Also, the book hardly told about Mr. Cliburn's struggles. It seemed that everything went just so smoothly, and he being like an angel without errors, nothing seemed hard or depressing, everyone was charmed by him, no enemies, no conflicts, no battle. I mean there are some hardships the author mentions, but it seems that those hardships also passed by smoothly and Mr. Cliburn coped well without a fuss.The anecdotes were basically quotes from Mr. Cliburn's friends and colleagues and Mr. Cliburn himself, and not really a story style. (praise after praise after praise)Over all, you'll get the idea, through all these praises, that he's a great pianist, and no one can really surpass him in his piano performance and as a person. And you'll get to know him by hearing the words of his friends that he's a very warm, kind-hearted person, which I don't disagree. But you probably won't have a personal \\"experience\\" with him in this book. That's the major flaw. Otherwise, the author did a lot of research and study, and made a real effort with well-wish heart to bring the pianist into light.Very easy read, even for young people, and you'll have no problem turning pages. It's just that, to me, it was superficial."},{"Title":"Van Cliburn","review":"It sometimes astounds me what some reviewers [the Press inclusive mind you] read into a book that simply is not there or is duly imagined because they believe the subject was allegedly rendered as \\"just too perfect\\" although that could signal merely their own lust for \\"Hey! Where is the DIRT?\\" and absent same, well, as I say, suddenly the author is engaging in mere hero-worship of the first chop! So too the common comment, \\"why doesn't Van Cliburn write his own story?\\" which is, truth be told, a valid question but then again what is Van Cliburn supposed to say that isn't already known about him or is he to dig for dirt or demons in a sort of retro mea culpa of sorts for .. for ... for WHAT? Book sales?I mean it 'is' possible for a person to be a national celebrity with a readily recognizable name [the classical piano competition in Fort Worth that bears his name notwithstanding] and 'not' have the seemingly requisite dirt and warts a la mode to go with that celebrity status! On the other hand, absent the \\"focus\\" on dirt for dirt's sake or the profusion of exposed warts and faults, suddenly he becomes \\"too perfect\\" and hence somehow flawed by default. Why is that?Even author Howard Reich, whose writings I admire BTW, gets the bad rap that he allegedly equated the '58 Tchaikovsky competion and Van's win as somehow the fuse for the fall of communism itself. And the alleged hero-worship goes on from there. Say what? Are we reading the same book? I saw the very conjectured words 'may have begun when the Soviets enjoyed their first vicarious taste of Western-style freedom and openness....' and suddenly this and this alone began communism's downfall. Sure. Can I then assume that every competition finalist that receives one of Van Cliburn's famous bear-hugs and \\"Bravo! Bravo! Bravo\\" recitation at TCU or Bass Hall has an instant career de facto made and assured! I think you get my drift.I like Van Cliburn and I think [since I do follow classical piano competitions and remain a staunch defender of their purpose!] much of what he is all about can be heard when he addresses Alexander Kobrin and Davide Cabassi in his home after the 12th Van Cliburn competition [2005] and renders his philosophy on music and the role of the classical interpreter of that music.So too, I am of the view that the continued use of his name for the Fort Worth Van Cliburn international piano competition is hardly a matter of simply being nostalgic or 'the thing to do' but rather what the man represents personally and what he stands for in terms of what he has rendered to his fellow citizens, the nation itself [capped by the Presidential Medal of Freedom] and the world. That's not rhetoric, that is fact and well borne out by the record itself. The name is retained because the name and the man stand for something! Something good and refreshingly wholesome in an era where dirt and the more notable outrages of human behavior somehow become the 'measure' , of exactly 'what' I don't know, yet the absence of same suddenly signals an alleged less than candid accounting. Or, to phrase it another way, the \\"goodie two shoes\\" syndrome or \\"questionable persona\\" and why, well, back to square one, where is the dirt! Where are the warts and flaws as duly magnified and duly focused upon therein.A feeling that the readily available public record has been somehow sanitized solely because talk of such things as 'mother' or 'church' or 'classical music interpretation' with an ardent love for same and the interpreter's responsibility to the public simply isn't what some folks want to hear or in this case read... it's too, well, 'traditional' or 'romantic mongering' so to speak. Ponder that one or those whose every by-word or mantra seems to be \\"sentimentality of the woefully pass&eacute; category ... relics from the classical/romantic era mentality and mind-set\\" with the kicker, \\"like the music it brought forth and which refuses to lay down ... .\\" Good! Then let it be duly defended therein ... along with its subscribers and interpreters! And spokes-persons who still find both merit and value in the traditional concepts.I believe Mr. Reich did not avoid any warts in his book but neither did he make any attempt to sniff and sift for dirt that simply wasn't there and thus place, as some authors do, baseless innuendoes that can in fact increase sales for readers who seem to thrive on that type of thing yet whose 'findings' remain totally bogus upon further investigation. And this too, for a self-professed \\"private guy by nature\\", well, this \\"private guy\\" known as Van Cliburn has certainly done his share of contributions to the common weal as they say, and thensome!As I wrote to Howard Reich, he did 'not' write a eulogy in advance, as it were, but rather a book on a man who in fact has had his down-side life episodes, as we 'all' do BTW, but who has both persevered and achieved. On the 'world' stage actually. Question is, can any detractors make the same claim and back it up! Ahhh! There's the rub, as the man wrote in that play of long ago.Doc Tony"},{"Title":"Van Cliburn","review":"An excellent book in many respects - but not perfect. Mr. Reich gives many interesting little anecdotes from Mr. Cliburn's life, and frequently quotes friends of the pianists, and even Mr. Cliburn himself. In fact, there are so many quotes from Mr. Cliburn that a friend of mine stated that it could practically be an autobiography. I wish Mr. Cliburn WOULD write an autobiography, but just from what I know of him that seems unlikely.At any rate, the book starts off with a rather too detailed geneology, tracing Mr. Cliburn's roots back to somewhere in England, and detailing the career of his great uncle on his mother's side or something like that. But I didn't want to read about his great-uncle on his mother's side - I wanted to read about Mr. Cliburn.Of course, there is plenty about him - quite enough! But there are many unnecessary details - like the names of his judges, people who should have been judges, critics, names of friends of his friends, names of cars his friends drove, etc, etc...Mr. Reich appears to hold the somewhat different opinion that Mr. Cliburn is the epidomy of perfection, and any competition that he entered in which he did not come in first (and those were extremely few!) is decidedly pooh-poohed. Although I think Mr. Cliburn is extremely excellent, myself, (he is my favorite pianist), I would not go so far as to claim he is perfection. (He IS close, though. :) )But the book is certainly far from bad - I mentioned the anecdotes, and for the extreme Cliburnite much of the extra information can be interesting, like the description of the house he currently lives in (it seems to &quot;go on and on,&quot; according to Reich, which is certainly possible. Evidently there is room for six Christmas trees in the family room.), and the fact that he leaves up his Christmas decorations for most of the year, and that he calls himself one of the most sentimental people to ever live. Which is likely - he left up the decorations for his mother's 80th birthday party for, actually, years after it was over.We get to follow him all the way from his early childhood through his years at Julliard (where we discover that he is partial to caviar.) and to his decision to go to Moscow, and to Kruschev's (sp?) liking for him (which Reich thinks had much to do with Communism's downfall much later.{?}), all the way through his popularity to his long intermission, and even to his return to the stage. And the whole thing, the whole way, is jam-packed with information. Some necessary, some merely slightly interesting, some quite monotonous, and some definitely unnecessary. But I enjoyed the book immensely, especially since I received it when I was sick in bed and had nothing to do but read, anyway.I would recommend it for any Cliburn fan - and really, the names of the neighbors down the street and the make of his friends' cars CAN be interesting."},{"Title":"Greek studies;: A series of essays","review":"This book was first published (posthumously; Walter Pater died in 1894) in 1910, the printed version has 219 pages (wordcount: 73204).

To give you an idea of what the essays are like I copy the first two sentences of the first essay:WRITERS on mythology speak habitually of the religion of theGreeks. In thus speaking, they are really using a misleadingexpression, and should speak rather of religions; each race and classof Greeks--the Dorians, the people of the coast, the fishers--havinghad a religion of its own, conceived of the objects that came nearestto it and were most in its thoughts, and the resulting usages andideas never having come to have a precisely harmonised system, afterthe analogy of some other religions.I recommend this book only to people who are very, very intested in Ancient Greek History and don't mind long sentences."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.

Bowditch","review":"One of my favorite books in school and reading it again as an adult made it even better"},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"This is a biographical story of Nathaniel Bowditch, a famous mathematician and navigator, who lived in Salem, Massachusetts, in the late 1700's and early 1800's. Nathaniel, or Nat, is very gifted in mathematics; when he starts school, his schoolmaster punishes him for suspected cheating because Nat's math skills are so far ahead for his age. After the schoolmaster sees that Nat can solve difficult mathematical problems for himself, he not only apologizes to Nat but says that he sees Nat as Harvard material. So Nat dreams of going to Harvard one day.However, misfortune strikes Nat's family. He must leave school when he is about ten years old, and at age twelve he is apprenticed as a bookkeeper in a chandlery for nine years. Part of Nat's soul yearns for the sea faring life his father had until his father lost his ship, but no one thinks Nat could be a sailor because he is physically small; he says himself that he is \\"five feet five, when he stretches.\\" However, Nat does the bookkeeping work well, studying diligently on his own after hours. He teaches himself not only advanced mathematics, but also Latin, French, and other languages.After Nat completes his apprenticeship, he signs on as a supercargo (navigator) on the Henry. He continues the seafaring life, teaching others what he has discovered about navigation and discovering errors in navigation books of the time. He made five major voyages, the fifth as the ship master. During this time, he wrote The American Practical Navigator, which is still used on U.S. naval vessels.This book, the Newbery Award winner for 1956, covers Bowditch's early years - from his early childhood until about his late twenties. It deserved the Newbery because it is well-written for the intended audience - approximately fourth- and fifth-graders. Youngsters learning early American history can see what maritime life was like some two hundred plus years ago, and see how Bowditch showed much resilience to overcome poverty, his size, the elements at sea, and much more to become someone who is still a leader in his field. The line drawings by John O'Hara Cosgrave II add to the flavor of the biography.Purchased at Ships of the Sea Museum in Savannah, Georgia, while visiting there."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch by Jean Lee Latham is a gripping historical fiction account of the life of Nathanial Bowditch, and his writing of The American Practical Navigator.This Newberry Medal winning book is one that we are reading through the Sonlight Curriculum as a \\"read aloud\\" book for my 3rd grader's American History and Literature curriculum.I would recommend this book to anyone who can read at a 5th grade level and up, to get a good feel for life in the United States the first few decades after the Revolution, and for anyone interested in sea voyages, navigation, and self education.The part that amazes me most about Nathanial Bowditch's life isn't his mathmatical genius or his ability to re-write the rules of Navigation to make sailing safer, but his ability to educate himself despite all the odds stacked against him. He is from a poor family. He is indentured for nine years and can't go to school, but he keeps notebooks of everything that he learns, ask questions, teaches himself mathmatics, Latin, French and Spanish, along with navigation.This fictionalized account brings Nat Bowditch to life, and one of the analogies in the story about sailing in life that is carried successfully throughout the novel is about \\"sailing by an ash breeze,\\" which I mentioned in a post a few weeks ago.To sail by an ash breeze meant to pull out oars and make the boat go where you wanted it to go when there wasn't any wind. To sail by an ash breeze in life means to work hard at getting where you want to go, even when everything in life seems to be trying to keep you at a standstill.As a writer, there are many days in which the wind of my ideas has stilled, and I have to pull out my oars and just keep typing.As a home school mom, there are days in which the wind of my excitement for my kids' education stills in the face of criticism, or in the face of a hard math problem day.As a reader, I think this book is an excellent choice for anyone who would like to learn exactly what it means to live life by sailing by an ash breeze.Good Sailing, everyone!"},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.
