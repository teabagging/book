This is an unusual book that deals with the issue of divine religious visitations, stigmata and miracles through the experience of a young girl after her parents divorce. Picoult understands the complicated relationship between parents and their children as deftly illustrated through Mariah White after her marriage disintegrates, and she is caught up in a media circus with her daughter. Picoult tackles a hot button topic with journalistic integrity; but still manages to weave a credible and believable fictional narrative. I look forward to reading her next thought provoking offering."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult is one of the finest authors of our time. This book like all of her books keeps you interested from first to last page. Her research must be time consuming but certainly adds to the essence of her books. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"We read this book for our book club and it generated some very good and insightful discussion. The story, about a seven-year-old girl who speaks to God whom she calls Guard and is in her eyes a woman, suffers the stigmas or physical wounds like the ones Christ bore when he was crucified. The girl's father is an Episcopalian, seemingly in name only, who finds it impossible to be honest with himself or his family, in particular his wife whom he cheats on in their bed on more than one occasion. The first time she caught her husband cheating, Mariah, a non-practicing Jew, is devastated and tries to commit suicide. Her husband quickly railroads her into an institution where she is kept on drugs, even after they discover she is pregnant. But this time, she is stronger and her husband's act of adultery does not shatter her completely and the marriage breaks up. She stays in the home with their daughter, while he hurries off to Vegas to marry his pregnant mistress. Then miracles begin to happen in their daughter's wake and the media and people wanting/needing a miracle camp on Mariah's door step, including an atheist whose TV shows are about debunking religion and miracles. The husband decides to take custody of the daughter, the lawyer bringing up the past to declare Mariah an unfit mother.In the back of the book I read is a section by Ms. Picoult about her writing this book. She wrote Keeping Faith, she states, not to look at religion, but at belief. At how we can be spiritual without being religious and if we would/could entertain another's point of view about God, the world would be a better, safer, more tolerant place.Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the \\"deeper message,\\" but the book was boring. And for 400 pages, it is almost a waste of time. Maybe if the book was half the size I would have somewhat enjoyed it and given it 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"You can read other reviews for the plot.What an awful book.I should have known when I was reading it that something completely outlandish was going to happen toward the end.I didn't even enjoy the book, just kept thinking it could get better."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I NEVER READ ANY OF JODI PICOULT'S BOOKS KEEPING FAITH WAS EXCELLENT AND I WOULD RECOMMOND IT TO ALLI JUST TOOK TWO OF HER OTHERS BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARYGREAT READING"},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by this writer. The subject interested me so I thought I'd give it a shot. I read it in about 4 days. Not great lit I have to say I wasn't really expecting fantastic writing but the story was entertaining enough. Don't think I'll go out of my way to read any more of Picoult's books.

She knows how to bring you into a book and relate. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I have almost every Picoult book and am a huge fan. However, this one is not my favorite. A little far fetched with imaginary friends and a little depressing at times because of the main characters perspective on life. Still a good story, just not very uplifting."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Keeping Faith was my first Jodi Picoult read, and I am hooked on this author. The seven-year-old Faith who begins speaking to \\"Guard\\" and brings her grandmother back to life after a heart attack is a normal child in every way. Her parents have just separated and the strain is threatening to break her mother. But Faith's mother finds herself coping after her daughter's contact with a dying child who is cured brings on a massive assault by the press. In steps Ian Fletcher, an atheist and TV personality who ranges the country visiting and debunking claims of sightings of the Virgin Mary, the face of Jesus on a tree trunk and other such phenomena. He is the first to see Faith one night when she exhibits the stigmata on her hands. It is even more confusing when Faith insists \\"Guard\\" is a woman or, as it dawns on her mother, is God. Faith's father, horrified at the notoriety brought on by the media, files for custody of his daughter. How this mad circus proceeds is the delight of the reader."},{"Title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I love Jodi Piccoult.

She's got a heart of gold, a challenging and endearing set of friends and family, and the dilemma of a lifetime--where does her heart belong? Page Up and buy this immediately! It's terrific."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"While this wasn't a favorite of mine, it had some good points. The theme of evaluating one's life and identifying important decisions and the unconscious motivations behind them was insightfully explored. However, I thought there were inconsistencies in the character development. For example, without spoiling a specific moment, Charlene is devoted to her career yet fails to be thorough on occasion. Some of the decisions of the characters led me to lack the ability to identify with them or sympathize with them. This was one of those books that reminds me of 80s television, with its emphasis on modern lives and high-powered careers. Being a person who values work/life balance, it wasn't for me."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"I enjoy reading Robyn Carr find they are easy reads and always enjoy the story line. Would read again in the future."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"Robyn Carr never disappoints me. Enjoyed the characters and the fact that life can always get a little messy. Good read!"},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"I don't know how some of these reviewers could give this book such a low rating, I just don't see why at all. I guess it's all about each individual's opinion. Me, I loved everything about this story. I guess it's because I know real people, who have had the same types of things happen to them. Sometimes your head is telling you one thing, while your heart is telling you something completely different.I love how things worked out for all the characters in the book. Sometimes in these kinds of situations, a reader tends to dislike a character or two, but for me at least.... not in this story. I think that was because there really wasn't anyone who was spiteful or down right nasty, they were just people who had figured out that they had different wants and needs.Yes, Charlene and Dennis had a lot of things in common. And yes.. they had found each other at a time when they were both feeling lost and all alone, but there were never any real sparks between them at all.Jake and Charlene had plenty of sparks, but Charlene was bothered by his devotion to his work. It's funny in a way, because after their break up she became addicted to her work too. It's also funny that over the 25 years since their divorce, she found the time to fall back into his bed on a pretty regular basis.Their daughter acted so immature and childish, but then she had years of being spoiled by both her parents and her grandmother, so that wasn't too surprising to me. What did surprise me, was how she picked herself up and started to change her ways after her fiance walked out on her that night. She didn't give in to the big pity party like I thought she would either, which was a big surprise to me. I think it took her fiance walking out on her, to make her finally wake up from her fantasy world and take stock in her bad behavior, enough to want to make those changes to better herself.And let's talk about Dennis. I felt so bad for him, because of the way he was being treated by Charlene. That is until he met Agatha. They had the spark and so many other things in common, including losing the people who were once their heart and soul. Neither of them ever thinking they could ever find that kind of love with anyone else, until they found each other. Then I started to root for the two of them all the way. But... I hoped & prayed that he wouldn't decide to go back to Charlene out of guilt.And Jasper (Lois's next door neighbor) was amazing. He had been through 25 years of hell and back, while taking care of his with his bedridden wife. And yet after she died he realized he missed not having anyone to care for, then he spots his next door neighbor, who obviously needed someone to look after her. I think we all need a wonderful, caring person like him in our lives. He saw what was happening with Lois, and never hesitated to step in and take charge.Then there's Pam and Ray who are so attracted to one another, yet the major age difference between the two keep them apart until Pam has a heart to heart talk with her father. Pam's father was absolutely right with his assessment of the situation...... \\"We never know how much time we have left here on earth, so why not spend it with the person who makes us feel so happy & carefree.\\" I have to give him a big pat on the back for that advice alone.Would I recommend this book? You better believe I would, in a heart beat! This book is filled with so many deep emotions, but it has it's moments that it will have you laughing out loud, too."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"Do people really make incredible, drastic changes in their lives? Yes, but Stephanie's about-face in this fluffy piece of chick-lit came across as very contrived. She was a perfect character, other than her one Great Flaw (though under that selfish, lazy exterior was the requisite heart of gold). Charlie was not a likable character, and like everyone else in the book was a two-dimensional representation of a stereotype. The only decent character was Peaches, though her story was a sad one.The story straddled the line between serious drama (dealing with family problems, mental illness, etc) and fun, breezy chick-lit (the slightly forced humor) and came out a mangled mess. To be honest, the story might have been much better (though less my taste) had it taken the more serious route. The plot was there for a much more dramatic book (I'm not sure you could lighten the book enough - what with every character having some weighty issue - to truly fall into the happy-go-lucky category).Too many 'issues' and flat characters bring down this story, and there are far better examples of this genre out there."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"The Wedding Party was a tremendously fun book to read! The story was light hearted and the characters were hard to resist! I found the dialogue fresh and easy to read. A BIG hit in my book! I will definitely seek out more titles by this author. Her writing is a breath of fresh air!"},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"This was a good read, Robyn Carr never disappointed. The plot was a little predictable, but still fun to see how it all turned out."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"I bought this book on my kindle, and all I can really say is that I am glad that I didnt pay full book price for it.

Now forty-five and seeing someone for five years, Charlene appreciates the status quo of having her own home and a significant other in that own home. With her nerves on edge from a couple going through a horrific divorce, her daughter stuns Charlene when she tells her that does not want to end up like her mom, all alone. On top of that flogging, her mom seems to be showing signs of mental instability and her former spouse Jake, who seems to be around a lot, accuses her of not being able to commit. To prove they are wrong she proposes to Dennis and he gladly accepts.However, preparing for the wedding turns disastrous. Denis seems more interested with the wedding planner than Charlene. Stephanie seems into a deeper funk because her mom is marrying before she is. Then there is Jake, who makes it clear that he is he one who should be her groom not Dennis. Can a marriage take much more of a spiral downward than this mess that Charlene wants to escape from before she goes insane.THE WEDDING PARTY is an amusing romantic romp that slowly develops the cast so that the audience understands everyone&#65533;s reactions and actions. Once the characters&#65533; motivations are established, the plot turns into a wild humorous ride down the aisle. Fans of contemporary craziness will want to attend Charlene&#65533;s wedding reception as the story line has several additional subplots augmenting a delightfully funny novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"While I enjoyed Carr's wittiness, I felt that there was just too much going on in this book at once. The insight into each character's life was enjoyable at first, but after a while I began to wonder what the point was. The author begins to delve into Pam's life (Why, though... what, in the long run, does her romantic life bring to Charlene's wedding story?), only to leave her hanging for a while. Then the story read like a hasty game of catch up. This seemed the case also with Stephanie, Charlene's daughter, and her boyfriend, Grant. Grant was given no character at all until the point where he decides to leave Stephanie. Then we're bombarded with him. I would have to say also that, though Carr defines each character's relationship with the others, their interactions seem forced.Carr jumps back and forth between a myriad of characters yet they are never fully developed. Instead, she gives to them all a &quot;everyone is happy now&quot; ending that just doesn't ring true. In fact, much of this book rings false. Dennis is - continuously - described as a rock, steady, trustworthy, etc. But the second Charlene's back is turned he's after Agatha... and completely ignoring Charlene's hour of need.Additionally, the book is repetitive. We spend pages reading of Charlene's &quot;traumatic&quot; childhood in detail, only to have her daughter give a thoroughly parrot-like recap (of her mother's THOUGHTS) to her father later (and the long-lost-father story was too much - let's face it... after a certain period of time, people need to stop whining about their childhood woes and Charlene can't really use a ragabout father as an excuse for being even more self-absorbed than her daughter). We are also told Merrie's life story several times (yet another character with no substantial purpose in the book; her story is convoluted and becomes even more difficult to track - Carr doesn't seem to know where she wants to go with it and it flies completely out of bounds).I was very let down by this book; I had looked forward to reading it and to be honest I couldn't believe how much I disliked Charlene by the end of the book. She not only does NOT get over her controlling nature, nor does she curb it; she uses it on someone else. Truly I found her even more disgustingly self-absorbed than her daughter (why didn't Carr go into THAT aspect of things when discussing, quite unnecessarily, everyone's psyche?).In all, for such a short book (I read it in one sitting) there were just too many characters and subplots at once (the stalking by Fred is completely erroneous here, as is Dennis' sister, Merrie, the woman with the goose, etc. and each lends precisely nothing to the plot which, according to all reviews and the book jacket, is supposed to be about Charlene). For the author to have thrown so much into so few pages served only to dilute the point she was trying to make (kind of like condensing &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;) and considering that no wedding actually gets planned, calling the book &quot;The Wedding Party&quot; is misleading.Glad I only borrowed this one."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"Unlike a couple of these negative reviewers, I actually read the book. From cover to cover. In two days. And Charlene's daughter is named Stephanie. And her boyfriend is a physician's assistant, not a doctor. But maybe I'm just used to reading nice, long books and keeping a variety of characters straight--Carr's special gift. Obviously not a gift shared by some of these reviewers...This might be my favorite Robyn Carr book yet; it's certainly a bit lighter than some of the others (no domestic violence, for one thing). Charlene decides to get married, but to the wrong man. Charlene's mother is losing her mind, and her daughter is a spoiled brat. The men in this book are virtually all heroes; they just need to be matched up with the right women. Which, of course, takes 377 entertaining pages to work out. The only problem with Carr's books is that I keep finishing them!"},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"While this was a good book, I would definitely *not* categorize it as a romantic comedy. So if you are looking for something light and funny, there are plenty of (other) authors to try. I would categorize this book, rather, as an issue-based contemporary romance - sort of women's fiction, if you will.I liked this book. I like Ms. Carr's writing style, it's light, easy to read, and she has the gift of making her characters seem real. But while the writing is light, the issues she explores are not. So this is a hard-to-categorize book - light reading because of the easy-to-read style, but heavy reading because of the many characters and heavy issues that they are dealing with.I found that while I didn't particularly like the heroine, Charlene, I found myself liking her a lot more at the end, when she finally gets all the pieces of her life together and realizes where she went wrong in the way she was living her life, and looking back, says to herself - I know I made a lot of mistakes, but they were inevitable at the time - and I think that that's very, very realistic. Yes, that's real life - most of us haven't figured everything out at twenty (like some Regency heroines seem to do), but rather, we figure things out slowly, bumblingly, just like the heroine did.I happened to have really liked Grant, her daughter Stephanie's boyfriend. I know that we don't get to know him too well, because we don't get to see him too much - but isn't that just the point, isn't that what Stephanie is upset about as well. But I do like the way he's sure of himself, knows where he's going and what he's planning on doing with his life, unlike Stephanie? And Grant is a hero through and through, even to the end - when he said good-bye, it was a classy good-bye (I'll pay your rent until you figure out what you want to do), I thought he was very mature, and I liked him. (By the way, don't you think it's funny the way they keep on insisting what a *wonderful* job they did raising their daughter when it's so obvious she's a little screwed up?)I also really liked Jake - I sometimes felt like shaking Charlene at how she was treating him, isn't it great to have someone so in love with you that he stays around even after the divorce - and she treats him like dirt, and he still loves her...I wouldn't give this book five stars, it wasn't great riveting reading, but on the other hand I did enjoy it, and I really liked the ending, I think it wrapped things up very well. I would even say that the ending bumped up this book from being a three-star pleasant read, to a four star, better than average read."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"I was so excited to read this book that I started reading it as soon as I got it and then began to frown a little, then more, then realized I was frowning so much because the heroine was not only irritating, but she was flaky and cold. I got about 100 pages in and was wondering when it was going to pick up finally and the again realized that the book was 377 pages. It should've been very involved at this point, but all I got was bored and confused.Confused because the jumbled plot was filled with too many people all talking at once and information into their lives when they had nothing to do with the story, or, the 'wedding party'. What party? There was no funny and quirky wedding party with crazy characters that will make me laugh until I ache or touching moments where I sigh and shake my head. Too much insight into the main character Charlene's friend's life, Pam and Charlene's 25 year old daughter Samantha. Also more looks into the lives of a single mother's life whom Charlene is representing in court, a couple that is divorcing, her ex-husband, her elderly mother,her present boyfriend and future husband Dennis-with whom we're supposed to see in the wedding party as the groom, ha!, Dennis's dead wife, his sister...I can go on. My point is, is it too confusing. Too many plot developments that lead nowhere.In short, this story was supposed to be about, and I stress the word 'supposed' because it came nowhere near it; a 45 year old woman who is sucessful at being a family lawyer and is happy with every part of her life, even with the long-term relationship she has with her boyfriend who is a doctor. The problem comes in when her daughter says she doesn't want to end up like her, single and alone and then her mother seems to be losing her mind when she gets lost in a grocery store parking lot and to top things off her ex still loves her and says she can't commit. To fix the problem she decides she wants to marry Dennis,(the doctor boyfriend).This is where we're supposed to have the wedding party, but we don't. The entire book is a mix of her life's setbacks and letdowns and how she hated her father and how he caused her to shrug off relationships. How her fiance is her 'rock' and her staunchest supporter, but he starts an affair with the wedding cordinater. She doesn't seem to care either way. Her spoiled daughter gets way too much time in the book and we were introduced to her boyfriend Grant too late.All in all, we are faced with a flaky 45 year old heroine who is having some sort of mid-life crisis and it definately isn't funny, lol, a spoiled 25 year old daughter who is just as flaky, a quirky ex husband whom we never really understand, a cheating doctor fiance and an elderly mother who keeps upsetting Charlene. I am still waiting for the 'hysterical wedding fiasco' that I was promised on the jacket back... save your money on this one....Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me. He didn't have the gumption to break off his &quot;engagement&quot; before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"If you enjoy ensemble comedy with a wide cast of characters, you will find a lot to appreciate in this riotous book. Charlene, the 45-year-old heroine, finds a host of obstacles in the way when she attempts a long-avoided walk down the aisle with her boyfriend of five years, including: her mom going off the deep end, her daughter angsting about growing old and ending up alone like her mom, her fianc&eacute; hanging out far too much with the wedding planner, and the her sexy ex husband stepping forward with the craziest behavior of all, a demand for another chance.Robyn Carr keeps a lot of balls in the air with this story, but all the colorful characters and their competing needs add excellently to the frenetic pace which is a main source of the book's humor. The various story lines leap and skitter, ultimately feeding into each other for a strong climax. In addition, the romance with Charlene's ex husband is sexy and adds a lot to the humor as well. I also really appreciated encountering a well-lived-in older heroine for a change."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"After her divorce, Charlene Dugan vowed never to marry again. Twenty-five years later, she finds herself asking her man the big question. After all, Dennis is mature and their relationship is comforting and steady. Her daughter, Stephanie, is at a crossroads, her mother's mental health is fading, her career is crazy-busy, and she's spending more time with her irritating ex, Jake, than anyone else. Who wouldn't want to take the plunge? Except things on the surface aren't always what they appear, and the heart has a way of leading you right where you should be.I've been a huge Carr fan for years, and though this wasn't my favorite of hers, I liked it. This felt more like women's fiction to me, and a mature heroine was a nice change. The daughter was irritating, but she saved my opinion of her nicely at the end. Carr described Alzheimer's brilliantly, and this book dug into the psyche to search for what we truly want from life. I was team Jake from the get-go. My kind of hero. A book not to be overlooked."},{"Title":"Wedding Party","review":"I do not think is one of her best books.

It is poorly written with a lot of errors and with no continuity from topic to topic. The descriptions about methods in the book are not useful at all. The book is apparently a verbatim copy of JAVA programming with CORBA. The authors did not even have the respect to the reader to replace the word JAVA by C++, in a number of places the book talks about JAVA. I do not recommend this book at all.

Both are set in the small country Moor setting the sisters grew up in. It was very difficult to get any of their work published at the time as there was some prejudice against serious female writers. Now however their Victorian romances are considered classics and read in many high schools.This volume is nicely leather bound and well made by Long Meadow Press.The first novel by Charlotte Bronte was kind of a slow action type of romantic Victorian writing. What saved the story for me was there were good characters described well and a good plot. Jane Eyre was an orphan, raised by an unloving Aunt and family that was sent to a woman's boarding school. It was very strict, at times poor food and little of it, and cheap non warming cloths. Eventually Jane finds a good teacher/mentor that helps her and she gets a good education, graduates and is a teacher at the school for 2 years. Her mentor leaves and Jane wants to do a little better and gets a job as a Governess/teacher for a small girl not related to a rich master \\"Rochester\\" of the house. Eventually she falls in love with him and on their wedding day finds out he is already legally married to a mad woman/lunatic living in a room at the mansion. Both Jane and Rochester are deeply in love but Jane is heartbroken and leaves penniless ( the master doesn't know she left) and almost starves before accidentally being saved by a small poor church Paster cousin. Originally she doesn't know they and two female cousins are related. Later she inherits 20K pounds ( a fortune in old England) from an old uncle she didn't know she had,and graciously splits it up 4 ways. She finally has a family. There is a huge fire set by the Lunatic/mad women/wife at the old mansion and she dies and the master Rochester is badly disfigured and almost totally blinded.I wont ruin the good ending for you. The novel Jane Eyre was slow going and a laborious read but I enjoyed it. Three cheers for Jane Eyre a woman of good character.. 4 stars. A good novel by Charlotte BronteWuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is also set in Victorian England in a small moor country setting. Wuthering Heights was a big house and there was a smaller house not too far away. Throughout the story there is so much hatred going on. This cousin is marring this cousin. The two heads of families clash and the main character Heathcliff is a brutish clod. Joseph the ancient butler/groundskeeper cant speak regular English and the poor reader is slowed down to understand broken slang English. Heathcliff son is an uneducated clod too. Catherine is a nice girl but for some reason attracted to one of the sickly cousins and marries. Nothing but problems. Head of one household dies as well as her husband. Looks like she is going to \\"educate\\" the brutish son of Heathcliff and marry him later. The jerk Heathcliff has an epiphany and peace before he dies, Just too much hatred and constant boring showing of emotions going back and forth between in laws and Joseph not talking right/ slowing down the reader. Just too slow, boring and excuse the expression too much uninteresting crappola going on. 2 1/2 stars. Boring ZZZZZA combination 3 star book. INMO kind of slow paced. Maybe if you are big into Victorian romances you will like it more."},{"Title":"Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations with Mathematica: An Integrated Multimedia Approach","review":"No matter what you think about differential equations, you just got to have that book. The software that comes with it, is dynamite, and fully adds to Mathematica's Dsolve. Fact is, after you read the book you may understand what Ordinary Differential Equations are all about. &quot;By the way there is nothing ordinary about Differential equations&quot;. These guys really know their stuff. Even better they can really explain it well. The book reads like someone is constantly talking to you or guiding you. The presentation is great. My only problem is that I finally understood the stuff. [ A pleasant one at that] The other fascinating thing about the book is the historical backgound of the mathematicians who contibuted to the discovery of DEs. This makes the book so enjoyable. Read this book and your girlfriend/boygriend will think you are a true inspired genius. However make it fast. They are bound to find out for themselves. This book will be true classic. BTW, you c! ould also look up another great book on DE. Authors are Blanchard, Devaney and Hall. Published by Brooks/Cole. These two books are all you should ever need."},{"Title":"Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations with Mathematica: An Integrated Multimedia Approach","review":"Really good, if not best. It is the resource text as an example for textbooks for the years to come. You learn to work out analytically first and then computing and numerically.

I would have liked that my first ODE textbook would have been like that one. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Tom Brown's School Days","review":"&quot;Tom Brown's School Days&quot;?, That's junenile fiction. That's a kid running down a merry lane in England with a satchel on his back, right? So wrong. How could this classic piece of little literature have escaped my attention? A stunning book about a boy's life in boarding school in mid 19th Century England, it tells it's adolescence tale with all the discipline of a Cub Scout Manual and whimsy of a comic book. Author Hughes frequently stops the action and intercedes on behalf of himself, commenting on the progress of the story as a teacher might. His defense of boys boxing with hard fists and fractured skulls is so socially incorrect it becomes amusing in it's conviction. Maybe skulls were harder then. A good knock-a-round is good for a boy. But school-yard fights aside, this is an adult piece of classic literature with a deeply moral narrative and a devoted sense of well-being. In it's second century of publication, it is a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"Tom Brown's School Days","review":"For the last five generations this has been the book every British parent wanted their sons to read, and Tom Brown is the mold which every parent wanted their sons to fit. He loves his parents. He attends church. He is a good student. He is kind to his juniors and respectful of his seniors. He is a true sportsman, and always plays fair. He is the beloved of his headmaster at Rugby school, Mr. Arnold, and Arnold himself is elevated by his mentorship of young Tom. He has an unbounded future, like Britain herself. Yes, it is an idealistic view of youth, but part of a parent's responsibility is surely to instill idealism, along with everything else.To more effectively enshrine his protagonist in glory, to place in relief his exceptionalism, to show the depravity of his antognist, and to put a human face on the Devil, Hughes also gives us Harry Flashman. While it was Tom's popularity which created the book's commercial success for the last five generations, my guess is that it will be George McDonald Fraser's references to Tom and Arnold, in his series of Flashman books, which will draw the contemporary reader's attention. Harry cheats and lies; he's a bully; he drinks, and is ultimately expelled from Rugby School for drunkeness. Please refer to Fraser's book, \\"Flashman,\\" and the rest of the series of Flashman books to see how young Harry turned out. Not so bad actually. The Victoria Cross, highly respected, and extremely wealthy.Naturally, this is far from Hughes' intent in creating a counterpart to the ideal child, but the existence of such a child as Tom Brown creates a disequilibrium in nature, which requires remedy. The reader will need to decide for himself whether the prototype of good or evil is more compelling. \\"Tom Brown's School Days\\" was a book of idealism for young boys at the turn of the 20th century. \\"Flashman\\" is a book of realism (okay, of humor, too) for the modern rogue at the turn of the 21st. Read both for the clash of perspectives."},{"Title":"Tom Brown's School Days","review":"I am often amazed that this wonderful classic is so often overlooked. The author's style and syntax is pure Victorian, through and through with wonderfully convoluted sentences, and indeed, paragraphs. This work, which takes place during the mid 1800s, circa 1840, is the story of a young man in a English Public School (which, unlike in the U.S. is actually a private school to which only the elite can afford to attend) and his adventures at this school. This of course is a boarding school. While not absolute, this work is obviously autobiographical in nature. When this work is read, the reader must keep in mind when it was written, the society in which it was written and most importantly, the attitude of the society in which it was written. I was first introduced to this work well over forty years ago and have given it several reads since that time. I strongly suspect that many young readers of today may find the syntax difficult at first, but if they press on, there is so much to learn from this book. As another reviewer well pointed out, some of the events addressed here are not what you would call \\"politically correct\\" by our standards to day in this country, but then we must remember when and where it was written. Any student of the history of literature or a student of our language will most likely be fascinated with this work. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Tom Brown's School Days","review":"Really interesting if you've read Harry Potter. It's a precursor for all school adventure books for children.

Grab it!"},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"Clearly there is a market for a book like this--it's just too bad this one is so bad. The writing is good, but the things Mr. Blank writes are so frequently incorrect or oversimplified to the point of meaninglessness.Here are some major issues:- Oversimplification. I suppose that's OK, particularly if this text is aimed at elementary or middle school students, who can't deal as well with the details. In the Introduction, we're told that, among others, &quot;decision-makers&quot;, network administrators, small business owners, and TCP/IP instructors, are the intended audience.- Major misconceptions. For example, UDP and TCP are the two most important transport layer protocols but not the only ones (SCTP, as well as, arguably, TLS and others). Classful IP addresses have been deprecated for years. And so on.- More specific errors of fact. Things like saying that a host is &quot;any device... on a network...&quot; with an IP address--that's wrong. Ditto for claiming the the sender/builder of a packet has to know the destination's hardware address (highlighted as a &quot;Tip&quot;) or that TCP data is chunked into &quot;packets&quot; or that the Internet layer &quot;contains&quot; ARP. And on and on and on.- Condescending layout. Yes, the layout is condescending, with the special symbols placed above every page number to indicate whether or not the current &quot;topic&quot; continues on the next page; the &quot;NOTE&quot;'s spread throughout, letting the reader know what's coming up in the next paragraph; simple-minded end of chapter review questions; and so on.- Minimal content. Two full pages at the start of every chapter for the number, title, and list of chapter topics. Lots and lots of white space within the text, plus huge header fonts, plus two full pages (at least) for review questions at the end of every chapter, plus way too many screenshots of Windows dialog boxes.If you must buy this book, realize that you won't know as much about TCP/IP as you think you do, and be prepared to be corrected if you go on with your networking education."},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"In the past year since I began studying for my Networking certifications I have read dozens of books about computers and networking. Some were childishly simplistic and others were mind numbingly technical. What impressed me about TCP/IP Jumpstart by Andrew G Blank is that it took a relatively complicated subject and broke it down so that it was very understandable and easy to learn from. I was especially impressed by the section on Custom Subnetting. I have seen this topic explained some half dozen ways and have never really got a grasp on it until now. Mr. Blank had a simple and easy to use method of creating custom subnets that was beautifully explained. I finally get it!!! I am confidant that I can do it without having to recreate a complicated chart or do tons of calculations. Another thing that made this book so enjoyable was all of the illustrations the author used to relate the way things worked to real life experiences like mailing a package or a telephone call. It really brought what goes on in the secretive world of computers to life so that I can now picture in my mind what happens when computers communicate. When I pass my Cisco exam I will have TCP/IP Jumpstart by Andrew G. Blank to thank for teaching me to custom subnet."},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"I found TCP/IP JumpStart very helpful on a topic that is new to me. Computer networking field is a new topic that adds dimension to my portfolio. Andrew Blank has a wonderful way of teaching so a novice can understand yet an intermediate doesn't get bored. He brings examples and illustrations to the text enabling you to understand or actually visualize the technology concept. TCP/IP JumpStart brings technology into terms for beginners, also more advanced students can collect new ideas and concepts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is about to take a class or would like to learn about TCP/IP. This is a book that I can highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"I am enjoying this book. It is helping me to brush up on my TCP/IP skills. The writer does a good job to relate the protocol without making it too simple. The only thing I would like is more coverage of subnetting. I am not saying it is not covered well but it would be nice to have more subnetting practice questions. As most people know that is showing up more and more on certification tests"},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"On its back cover, TCP/IP JumpStart promises to demystify &quot;TCP/IP's complex topics&quot; and give budding IT professionals the tools they need to build their careers &quot;on a solid foundation&quot;. Unlike many computer books in print, this one actually delivers.The first few chapters of the book contain exactly what anyone reading this might expect to find in a book about TCP/IP: the nuclear threat history, the OSI and DOD models, the essentials of IP addressing, and so on. These lessons are written in a clear and easy to follow (if unexceptional) way, punctuated by useful illustrations done in the hackneyed style popular in computer books from the mid-to-late 1980s. (This is not meant to be harsh criticism... I've just read way too many computer books). Then, unexpectedly, somewhere around chapter seven, something magical happens.Chapter 8: a discussion of subnet masks that explains the subject as effortlessly as my favorite professor. Chapter 9: a brilliant summary of name resolution. 10, 11, DNS, WINS... I'm starting to like the cartoons... OH, OK, NOW I GET IT! The book ends with an excellent chapter on IPng, which outlines the essentials of 128-bit addressing better than anything I've ever read (I only wish more was said on how proxies and NAT are effectively postponing the inevitable).In summary, anyone considering a career in networking should get a copy of this book, be they a Cisco Academy student or a hardware tech that only gets to bring the sysadmin his coffee. My only complaint (and the reason for my four-star rating) is that there were a few errors in the answers to the review questions; this is an unforgivable sin for any book designed to eliminate the need for classroom instruction.

So, I was very happy!"},{"Title":"TCP/IP Jumpstart: Internet Protocol Basics","review":"When it came to explaining things, I liked the book. I though it did a very good job of making complicated concepts very basic and easy to understand.Unfortunate, what I gained in clarity in the author's analogies was lost when he started to give actual examples with numbers in them.For example, page 161 where he is giving an example on sub net masks. The example starts by stating &quot;10001001101 is the binary representation of 1,102 = 11 bits are needed in the subnet mask.&quot; That is not correct 1,102 = 10001001110. So does that mean since the last bit is zero that only 10 bits are needed? - or do we still need 11 bits? - examples should help clarify the point, not add to the confusion.Another example is on page 97. It gives a formula to figure out the number of available networks in a network class - and using this formula it would mean a Class A network would have 2^7 networks (8 bits minus 1 because the first bit is zero to designate it a Class A) which equals 128. But his summary chart on that same page says 126 - and just a few pages before (page 93) he walks you through an detailed example of how many networks are in a class A, but he gives you an answer of 127. So what is right? 126, 127 or 128?Are you confused, because by the time I was done reading just two chapters I was. Unfortunately, the book is riddled with these inconsistencies. If you are new to TCP IP, have a need to understand network addressing and are only going to get one book, this is not the one."},{"Title":"Dream Saga Volume 1","review":"This manga is about a girl named Yuuki who is destined to become the \\"Legendary Girl\\" and save \\"Nakatsukini\\" (Earth) and \\"Takamagahara\\" (Spiritual World) by going back and forth between dreams. She must also find the other people who will help her fulfill this mission and she also has a crush name Takaomi. The interesting part about this is that people who appear in the real world also appear in the spiritual world as completely different people. Now this premise might sound appealing but the plot is seriously lacking in flow. For instance, many things appear to one way but turn out to be another. The whole manga is based on a Japanese legend, but it seemed like the author changed her mind half way through the series about where she wanted to take the plot. Also the plot moved along too slowly so I felt as if I was stuck in a rut. Also, the author wanted the characters to appear one way, but in the next scene they were in, they were completely different people altogether. For instance: The character of the Souta (one of Yuuki's sidekicks)in the real world was supposed to be a bit quiet and show offish. But in the next volume, he was normal and nice and didn't show off too much. The only character that the author was consistent with was Yuuki's crush, Takaomi. This was my first manga, and while I thought it was the best thing sliced bread back then, now, after reading marvelous mangas such as Fruits Basket or D N Angel, I think this manga showed real lack of effort and talent on part of the author."},{"Title":"Dream Saga Volume 1","review":"I really liked this series it was cute and a tear-jerker in some parts of this last one.

It is an easy read, so it is possible to read the words without getting the most out of the book's depth. I also like how the devotions remind us to pray about those in certain circumstances by leaving three periods ... so we can fill in a name in our private thoughts. It is a short book with only a month's worth devotions, but I suspect I will use it for many months because the truths remain the same.

However, the prayers in this book make a great supplement to anyone's prayer life. They stretch your understanding of just what might be included in a healthy prayer life - one which isn't just self-centered in nature. They are full of reverence for God, recognizing His sovereignty over all things. Some may find the old language style a bit daunting at first, but don't let that stop you from gaining the benefits of this amazing little book."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This is one of the most inspiring and helpful prayer guides I have ever used. I would definitely encourage anyone to buy this book. It helps to begin your day on a brighter, more focused path, and helps to prepare for a review of the day's events and preparation for a night of sleep."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This is a great way to intentionally set aside some time to be with God. The prayers provided are timeless. I'm not one who usually goes for the King James English, but it seems appropriate here. The prayers connect with where I am each day. They help me to slow down and spend focused time with God. I have since bought 3 copies to share with others."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"What a gift it is to find the words that fit, the words that calm or quicken or clear or connect as needed! This is what I receive as I regulary use A Diary of Private Prayer morning and evening."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie was an Anglican theologian (edit: I've been informed that he was actually a Scottish Presbyterian theologian), and evidently not a bad one. But his greatest work was this compilation of prayers. It is arranged into prayers for each morning and evening of 31 days, plus extra prayers for Sundays. The odd-numbered (right-side) pages have the prayers, while the even-numbered pages are empty for your own notes. The prayers are a combination of ancient prayers, various Christian liturgies, Scripture, and Baillie's own writing. It is written in elegant King James English, but it is certainly accessible to anyone who can read.I can't recommend this highly enough for anyone, in any Christian tradition, wanting to grow in prayer. My God-mother gave it to me, and very quickly I was buying copies for my own good friends. Some of them were buying copies for their friends before long as well. I recommend it very enthusiastically. At least give it a try."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This book is a new discovery for me, having received it as a birthday present. I am very moved by the reverent, poetic tone of the prayers. Some are almost liturgical in their grandeur and solemnity. But at the same time it is very accessible--not too lofty.I wish there was a bibliography or footnotes, since some of the passages are Bible quotes, or from ancient Orthodox prayer books. I would like to know more about the author and see another book by his: A Diary of Readings."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie's book is an exceptional work of spiritual literature.

It is refreshing to repeat prayers that are humble, selfless, grace-filled. These prayers are becoming formative for me, and are also becoming close friends. They lead me to embrace Christian holiness and to humbly examine my own egocentricity, confessionally. After Shawchuck and Job's, &quot;A Guide to Prayer&quot;, ADOPP is the book I've given away most. Sure, the language is a little archaic (I'm using old versions of the book. I'm not sure if recent printings have been updated) but it is well worth the investment. Of all the books I&quot;ve given my father over the years, I'm sure this is his favorite, too."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I am delighted to find this book in reprint, as I can now give it as a gift. An old copy had been given to me, and I have found it invaluable in transforming my prayer life.The prayers are beautifully written, poetic and almost liturgical. As I read/pray them, I am sighing, \\"Oh yes!\\", as they put into words thoughts of my heart that I haven't been able to adequately express.The prayers are very specific and challenging. They cause me to examine myself, to confessions which I might otherwise have glided over, to challenge myself in the service of God.I am confident that this book will be a blessing to anyone who uses it."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie's Diary of Private Prayer has been a favorite classic of mine for over 30 years.

The weeds choke and finally kill of the lilies. Yet behold! What is this? A beautiful Lilly among the weeds and grass...A Diary of Private Prayer is not like other &quot;devotionals.&quot; The prayers are honest, thoughtful, and wonderfully lacking in self-consciousness. I do not believe we should go to God with a script. I do believe however that these prayers distill many things which are not commonly considered into a useful form for meditation and for drawing one into a personal relationship with God. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Baillie has the rare ability to put into words the hopes and failings of Christian hearts and lives. I frequently give this book as a gift to friends,and most make it a part of their daily devotion.

The morning prayers invariably aim me in the direction of the kingdom with the reminder of God's steady presence guiding me. The evening prayers help me reflect on the day, \\"clean up\\" any falterings, and prepare me for peaceful slumber. My husband often joins me in these prayers and finds them beneficial as well."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"After reading other books by John Baillie, I was endeared to his Scottish Prayers, based on his Scottish Presbyterian Thelogy. As a gift from a daughter of one outstanding Presbyterian Pastor and Father, I noted the Greek inscription from Luke 18:1, \\"That men ought at all times to pray and not faint.\\"Each Day of Morning and Evening prayer followed the same format:\\"Almighty and eternal God, Thou art hidden from my sight:Thou art beyond the understanding of my mind:Thy thoughts are not as my thoughts:Thy ways are past finding out.\\"This became familiar to me as the Fourth Day for each Month. It was followed by yet a longer version of related Baillie Prayer. In the third place, there was another prose prayer with excerpts from Psalms, such as 17, 36, 57 and 91, In this Fourth Morning Prayer he concluded with a more personal and intimate prayer, beginning: \\"O Thou who alone knowest what lies before me this day, grant that in every hour of it I may stay close to Thee.\\" There lies his wee touch of Scottish Theology.From this first example I always linger over his final sentence:\\"Suggest, direct, control every movement of my mind; for my Lord Christ's sake. Amen.\\"Nearly every day followed this same format with exceptions for the 11th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th Days, he altered both style and paragraphs. Yet that hardly ever affected his sustained interest in my daily Prayers.Another poignant beginning prayer comes on 16th Morning: \\"With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early; for when thy judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the earth world will learn (your) righteousness.\\" Many are longer yet equally intimate...

The prayers are inspiring, revealing and thought provoking.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the editing is dismal at best for the Kindle edition. There are several occurrences of incorrect words and/or spelling that I can usually guess what it should be, but there a couple that I just can't make sense out of. The context is such that I am still able to get the general meaning out of the prayer. Also, there are random indents and font changes that don't make any sense.This would be a 5 star if the editing was a little more thorough."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Just to note that the Kindle version I just purchased is missing the entry for the Morning of the 26th day of the month, and has a typographical error (\\"Thirtiethh\\") on the Thirtieth Day."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Tremendously helpful way to start and end the day. Baillie's prayers are personal, warm-hearted, honest, and deeply penetrating to the soul. He doesn't pull any punches, in terms of the need for ruthless self-examination, confession, and repentance.

They are written with such depth and honesty that I was drawn into them.It is also good to note that this work comes alongside that of C. S. Lewis and Dietrich Bonhoeffer as they confronted the darkness of WWII and Adolph Hitler.The reader may want to track down an out of print book written in 1955 titled \\"A Diary of Readings\\".

Great Book"},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Seems kind of funny to say that a book on prayer is a great read, but \\"A Diary of Private Prayer\\" by John Baillie is that and a whole lot more. I received the book as a gift just over 2 months ago. It has become a treasured tool to guide my prayer life, and even more to grow in my prayer life.Dr. John Baillie from what I can tell was a Scottish theology professor, preacher, and author who had a heart for prayer and a desire to help others grow.In the past 2 months, I've prayed through the book twice. It has morning and evening prayers for 31 days plus one special Sunday morning and evening page.Here's why I like this book:1) It affirms God as the one we come to in prayer, and His agenda trumps my agenda. Praying to God seems obvious, praying God's agenda for most people, not so obvious.2) It recognizes the need to pray for others, not just myself. Not just the people I know, but the people I need to know to pray for -- unnamed faces, but critical issues in the eyes of God -- the poor, the lost, those in need.3) It builds a pattern of prayer day and night that can be built into one's life. I\\"m more morning person, but because it's just a page to pray. I have time. I make time to pray morning and evening.4) It improves my prayer life. I find myself praying these prayers, and saying God that's who I want to be -- one who follows Your will, one who builds his life on Your word.The one potential downside, it is in more of a King James English. Not my cup of tea in prayer, but that too has led me to appreciate the use of language in prayer. In this case, to provide a prayer time that slowly looks at the words and even more learns to listen for Your spirit."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This collection of private prayers has wondrously opened to me the Scripture: Matthew 22:36-38: To get the context of verses 36-38, more verses are quoted in this Message Bible translation:34 When the Pharisees heard how he had bested the Sadducees, they gathered their forces for an assault. 35 One of their religion scholars spoke for them, posing a question they hoped would show him up: 36 \\"Teacher, which command in God's Law is the most important?\\" 37 Jesus said, \\"Love the Lord your God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence.' 38 This is the most important, the first on any list. 39 But there is a second to set alongside it: \\"Love others as well as you love yourself.' 40 These two commands are pegs; everything in God's Law and the Prophets hangs from them.\\"In Baillie's diary, much of the prayer content has to do with confession of sin. I now realize my confession of sin has been unwittingly perfunctory. 1 John 1.9 (KJV) reads: \\"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\" In a sense and until I studied Baillie's Diary of Private Prayer, I have confessed my sins so that I might be forgiven - period.In Baillie's prayers, it seems his sin confessions were a direct outflow of his abounding love for God. Now, when I confess my sins -even as I read the confessions in A Diary of Private Prayer - I consciously realize the \\"First Cause.\\" Now my overriding motivation is an outflow of my love for God and not just a desire to gain forgiveness. I am grateful for that insight."},{"Title":"Great Sand Dunes National Monument (True Books: National Parks)","review":"\\"Great Sand Dunes National Monument,\\" by David Petersen, is part of the \\"A True Book\\" series.

Those who champion governmentallocation of resources fail to consider both the effectiveness of government allocation and the moral questions involved. In the last century, resistance to government intervention, from paper money to economics regulation, was far more pervasive and effective than it is today. Indeed, today's Americans only have a faint understanding of the Constitution and its envisioned restraints on government activity. The Constitution and its philosophical underpinning are rarely taught and understood by most Americans. That is a remarkable change from the time of our nation's founding when a large percentage of Americans were conversant with the ideas of Locke, Cato, Paine and the Federalist Papers.The Declaration of Independence, one of America's most important political documents, contains statements that are today greeted with hostility, or at best, viewed as extremist. The motif of America's inauguration has become too radical to discuss without extreme qualification, and those who want to use it to assail the present political process are labeled 'radicals.' Of course, the liberty-loving American founders also carried this sobriquet. Another characteristic of the modern age is that Americans have become carelessly oblivious to the historical struggle for the vast liberties they enjoy but the preservation of which they now seem to disregard.Dr. Cobin's book is part of the growing literature of case studies legal-philosophical treatises that provide economic analyses of public policy. While many other studies about regulation have been produced, Dr. Cobin has provided a major contribution to local regulatory issues. Building regulation and the modern system of private property rights are areas which are taken for granted by most people. However, this book reveals that there are more than trivial policy defects in our system of private property rights. Dr. Cobin has established that there is a real need to re-examine how private property rights are regulated. In the same way that public choice theory has exploded the notion of altruistic bureaucrats and politicians, who serve the interest of the public to the disregard their private interests, Dr. Cobin's book unmasks local building regulations whose ostensible purposes are to serve the public interest.The results of Dr. Cobin's work lead us into a new dimension of public policy deliberation, i.e., whether government regulations produce more or less safety than that provided through the market 'regulation.' If government regulations reduce the safety and quality of goods or services, then it is in the public interest to revise or eliminate such regulation. Dr. Cobin has also done a commendable job of demonstrating that market provision can produce efficient and effective regulation, even for informational services that are assumed to be public goods. After demonstrating the failings of government regulation and provision of information about quality, Dr. Cobin shows us that markets can do in building and safety regulations what it has done the rare coin and gemstone industries.Dr. Cobin's work goes even further. In addition to suggesting an adequate policy alternative for a failing system of building regulation, he also resurrects an alternate legal philosophy of real property. This system, known as 'allodialism,' is not a novel concept but has deep roots in Western civilization. However, it has been obfuscated over the years in favor of feudalism. It may surprise many readers that the American system of real property, not to mention the rest of the world's is essentially feudalistic. This fact should be repugnant in America where the Founding Fathers sought to abrogate all fetters of tyranny and oppression. An allodial real property system would make private property rights absolute and not subject to any form of coercive taxation or regulation. Subsequently, allodialism would serve to secure rights to property as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence.Hopefully, this study will provide the impetus for scholarship, in both case studies of local regulation and renewed discussion and analysis of allodial property rights. Not only can this book be added to the annals of regulatory studies which support market over government provision, but its philosophical basis can be used in basic disciplines, including law, economics, philosophy, political science and history. Dr. Cobin has made an important contribution to an important public policy area in a novel and frequently overlooked way."},{"Title":"Building Regulation, Market Alternatives, and Allodial Policy","review":"This book provides evidence that the state has failed to provide building safety regulation in the public interest. Useful market alternatives are suggested to replace government regulation. A must read for anyone studying urban regulation or interested in policy applications from free market economics."},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"I'm sorry. With the author's reputation for Reasoning from the Scriptures, I wanted to dig into some real meat and learn from this book. But, I find it does NOT answer the questions raised by intelligent unbelievers. Rhodes seems to pick simple-minded questions IUs don't ask and gives answers to those. Where are the non-contradictory, Bible-only answers to questions like these? If Jesus was truly a flesh-and-blood, historical person, why does the Bible contradict itself about who his grandfather was? Why do believers call the Bible \\"the Word of God\\", when the Bible itself never calls itself that and reserves that term exclusively for Jesus, as in John 1? If the Bible is infallible, why does Matthew, falsely attribute one of his OT prophesies to Zechariah, when it comes from Zephaniah? Why do Matthew and Luke (in Acts) contradict each other 4 different ways in their telling of the story of the death of Judas? If the Bible infallibly relates historical events, why do the 4 gospels contradict each other in over 50 ways when relating the Last Supper, the betrayal in the Garden, the pre-crucifixtion trial events, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the sayings of Jesus and other personages during these events? If our Bible is the infallible and inspired Word of God, how do we justify that claim in the face of the many, many differences between the surviving copies of the NT documents, as copied by the scribes through the centuries (see the writings of Bart D. Ehrman, \\"Misquoting Jesus\\" and \\"The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\\" as only two sources for the actual data), with most of those textual changes being theologically significant? ....Folks, these are the questions for which Rhodes and others do NOT provide answers and which keep unbelievers in the category of unconverted because unconvinced. So, don't think that Rhodes's book will actually arm you to answer the real Objections of Atheists, Agnostics and Skeptics. I'll keep searching."},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"The purpose of this book is not really to convince atheists, agnostics and sceptics to become Christians. Rather, the purpose is to explain to Christians what bad people atheists are. In other words, the books is defensive in character, not offensive. The author often charicatures the atheist position. Often, he starts quoting the Bible as proof, even before he reaches the point where he ostensibly proves the Bible. No well-grounded atheist will be convinced by this book, nor is that the intention. The authors' point is to preach to the choir, hopefully keeping them in check.Going through every argument would be tedious, so I stick to the main methodological flaws in the book.First, Rhodes places heavy emphasis on a kind of philosophical paradoxes, such as \\"The claim that everything is relative is itself absolute and hence self-refuting\\" or \\"The claim that only the empirically verifiable is true cannot be empirically verified itself, and is hence false\\". He even mentions something called \\"the kalam argument\\", apparently a Muslim version of Zeno's Paradox. I'm not a philosopher, so perhaps that's why I am singularly unimpressed! Even if this or that statement is paradoxical according to some criterion of formal logic, so what? Zeno's Paradox isn't taken seriously by anyone. Empirically verifiable claims are still more certain than non-verifiable ones. And if everything is in constant flux (\\"relative\\"), pointing this out \\"absolutely\\" doesn't make it any less true. Perhaps the authors intended audience at some evangelical Bible seminary in Texas are impressed by these arguments. Well, I'm not. Besides, even Ron Rhodes accepts empirical verifiability when it suits his purposes. He attempts to prove the Bible by appeals to archeology and claims that Intelligent Design is...well, empirically verifiable. As for the truth being relative, atheists do *not* say that truth is relative. For instance, atheists are reasonably sure that God doesn't exist, that Darwin was right, and that a Bronze Age document decreeing genocide (a.k.a the Book of Joshua) contradicts modern principles of morality.I already pointed out that the book isn't really intended for an atheist audience, which may explain why some of Rhodes arguments strikes the sceptical reader as very odd. For instance, he asserts that Peter cannot have lied about the Resurrection, since he was trained since childhood in the Ten Commandments, which prohibits false witness! Come again? A sceptic might point out that Peter may have been mistaken, that the Resurrection stories may have been embellished by later tradition, or that he may indeed have been - dare I say it - lying. New religions are founded as we speak, they can be studied by scholars, and often their origins are an amazing melange of subjectively honest spiritual experiences, half-truths due to politic, and out-right lies. Why should we believe that Christianity was any different?But the main problem with the book is that it's methodologically disingenious. In one chapter, Rhodes uses the Big Bang to \\"prove\\" that God exists. BUT IN A FOOTNOTE HE ADMITS OF BEING A YOUNG EARTH CREATIONIST!!! He therefore doesn't believe in the Big Bang himself!!!How can a non-believer in an old universe and the Big Bang nevertheless concoct a chapter using the Big Bang as an apologetic tool? Personal dishonesty may be one explanation, but I think the rabbit hole goes deeper. I come across this problem in other \\"fundamentalist\\" texts as well. A real classic in this field is \\"When Critics Ask\\" by Norman Geisler and Thomas Howe, a book that can be paraphrased thus: \\"The Bible is absolutely free from errors and contradictions, because it says so. If the Bible contradicts modern science, either modern science is wrong, or the Bible has been misunderstood. Either way, the Bible is right. The solution to Bible contradiction X is either Y, or maybe Z, or maybe Y and Z combined. No matter what, the Bible is true. And if we cannot explain away something, just blame it on scribal error. After all, only the original manuscripts were inspired\\". (If you don't believe me, please obtain this book for yourself. It's very funny.)The problem, clearly, is this. Rhodes have already made up his mind about the Bible being inerrant in all its (original?) paragraphs. He reached that conclusion WITHOUT the help of apologetics. Presumably he reached it for some kind of psychological or sociological reasons. Only then, AFTER his conversion, did he started to look around for apologetical arguments. He found the Big Bang here, some philosophical paradoxes there, and decided to use it. In the end, the veracity of each tool, taken by itself, doesn't really matter, since he already \\"knows\\" that the Bible is correct. And this approach is not peculiar to Rhodes himself, but typical of the fundamentalist approach in general. I found it in Norman Geisler, publications by the ICR and Answers in Genesis, etc.But it's precisely this method, this dogmatism, that smacks \\"atheists, agnostics, and sceptics\\" as a very bad answer to their objections.ADDENDUM, 23 MAY 2012I wrote this during my atheist-materialist period. Today I'm more into dualism, deism and such ideas. When I recently looked through Rhodes' book again, I realized that it's *even worse* than indicated in my review. For that reason, the review stays."},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"Im surprized to see that it has such bad reviews.

Rather, it is a basic and at all not comprehensive compendium of popular Christian thought. Rhodes has really no arguments to defend his points. Like many apologetic Christians (and atheists, for that matter) he limits himself to stating the points in a way you would hear at Bible study groups or in Sunday school. The few justifications he has, for example against evolution, are a joke, along the lines of the old creationist mantra, \\"what good is half a wing?\\"I bought this book expecting some sort of philosophical or even theological discourse on \\"the objections of atheists, agnostics, and skeptics,\\" but it's merely a propagandistic book of Christian-like indoctrination (complete with invitation to prayer and 1-800 prayer hotline... yeah) that has no bearing whatsoever on the constructive dialogue that some Christians and some atheists/agnostics/skeptics wish to start with each other.I recommend, instead, \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"A Layman's Introduction to Christian Thought.\\" I disagree with the content of both, but they are at least sound and very well thought-out and written."},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"Rhodes answers objections made by non-believers.

The data is presented clearly in a linear fashion, point by point, so that a Christian apologist will have an arsenal of complementary scientific, logical, and scriptural evidences with which to fight the good fight. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"A straight-forward volume which lists up-to-the-minute challenges and gives answers garnered from Christian scholars, modern research, and the Bible, Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics makes a useful tool for all active Christians. Starting with a look at our beliefs, this volume then presents an overview of atheism, agnosticism, and skepticism. The main section is divided into separate categories of objections. The objections considered range through a wide variety of ideas - evolution vs. intelligent design, absolute morality, the bias of the Gospel writers, how accurately could a book be transmitted faithfully through the centuries, Jesus was only a moral teacher, and many more. All these challenges receive careful, detailed, and fully proven Christian answers. Several charts and lists encourage the reader's understanding. All references are annotated. The footnotes section makes an ample bibliography for further reading. A call to Christian courtesy and a declaration of what it means to believe draw this book to a challenging finish.The author, Ron Rhodes is a prominent Christian writer and speaker, and president of Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries. While obviously erudite, the author's style is readily understandable to the lay person. Of interest to pastors, teachers, debaters, witnessing Christians, parents, high school and college students, and those who work out in the world, Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics belongs on everyone's reference bookshelf, as well as in their briefcase, desk, or car so they can take quick looks at it when and where challenges arise. - Donna Eggett, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Answering the Objections of Atheists, Agnostics, and Skeptics","review":"Despite what the reviewer below said (who didn't even bother commenting on the book, talk about an innappropriate review) this book is good.

I actually showed it to the professor, and she contemplated using this book next semester. :)"},{"Title":"The Perfect Body","review":"Amanda Matetsky has written an engaging, delightful first novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As a lover of mysteries, it has all the elements necessary to keep you intrigued and reading on. The fact that it is very, very funny and a bit risque at the same time just made it that much more fun! The characters are wonderfully fleshed out and unlike many books and movies on the market today, you CARE about them and can't wait to find out what happens to them next. I recommend this entertaining first novel to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, a good laugh... a good read!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Body","review":"I enjoyed this book so much--interesting real characters and lots of humor along with the mystery. Highly recommended read for an afternoon on the couch with a cup of herbal tea."},{"Title":"Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing","review":"A splendid collection of Irish writing from medieval Ireland to today. Poems,plays,political tracts from all the famous and not so famous authors. If you have a favorite, you will find him in these pages. It has given me untold hours of enjoyment. A super gift for those with a love of Irish literature."},{"Title":"Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing","review":"Seamus Deane and Field Day have put together a most remarkable collection of writing, culled from Ireland's rich history of composition.The pieces presented in the three volume initial set includes writings from all the most well-known of Ireland's writers. You have the bigs ones: Joyce, W.B. Yeats, Swift, Shaw, Kavanaugh, Wilde, Stoker, Heaney, and Synge, as well as hundreds of other contributors (including a few Nobel and Pulitzer prize winners). The writings are not just the best non-fiction or fiction, there are letters, plays, editorials, poems, songs, and folk tales, among others. Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" as well as Yeat's \\"The Lake Isle of Inisfree\\" are in my opinion the two best pieces in this collection. \\"Inisfree\\" is heartbreaking in it's lyricism and rhythm, it's just hard to fathom that an individual can write like that.The list of contributing editors is enough to carry a collection all by itself: Seamus Deane, Seamus Heaney, Declan Kiberd, and Terence Brown. It would have been interesting to see what the inimitable Paul Muldoon would have done if he had been asked to edit a section, but Mr. Muldoon still makes a presence with his writing.With more than 4000 pages in the three volumes, the collection will fill many a night and day. There is no other resource that will allow one to own such a varied and beautiful biography of Ireland's writing history."},{"Title":"Simon et le vent d'automne (Simon (French)) (English and French Edition)","review":"I really enjoy reading this book to my daughter, and most importantly my daughter LOVES it. I ended up buying most of the other Simon books by Gilles Tibo based on my satisfaction with this one, but she is absolutely hooked on this one. It is a cute story and an easy read. The pictures are not as bright and colorful as I would have hoped, but my little girl doesn't seem to mind."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"In their first foray into the realm of fiction, Gene Hackman and Daniel Lenihan created &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;, a novel that I believed to be one of the best seafaring novels of recent memory. It made me very eager for future efforts from this tandem. While it has been several years, the wait was well worth it. Their sophomore effort, &quot;Justice for None&quot;, is a dramatic departure from their first work, but is a very enjoyable read.I was frankly quite surprised that Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan would release a novel that is of an entirely different subject and historical era from their first one. It is something that, I believe, most authors have not pulled off well, and in doing so, have alienated much of their fan base. However, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan proved to be the exception to this pattern.&quot;Justice for None&quot; is set in the small Illinois town of Vermilion on the eve of the Great Depression. The story involves Boyd Calvin, a struggling World War I veteran who gets caught up in the murder of his estranged wife, which leads to a pair of runs from justice before a climactic trial to prove his innocence.The Boyd Calvin character is developed very well, and proves to be an interesting focal point for this story. The authors created someone who elicits in the reader an internal conflict. On the one hand, he is a sympathetic character as he struggles with his dark history in the war, the reconciliation with his wife, and his fight against a justice system in which the odds are wholly against him. On the other, he is almost repulsive, as he consistently resists authority and pushes away those who are trying their hardest to help him. This character development works very well, and is somewhat rare to find in these types of stories. It holds your interest and keeps you locked into the plot.The plot itself is also intriguing, though it is perhaps more of a part of a broader view of this pre-Depression, Midwest society. It seems almost underdeveloped in some places, and was less of a driver in advancing the story. Rather, it supplemented the character elements and external events, such as the impending stock market crash, race relations, and small town life. While this would seemingly be a liability, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan made it work. The prose is descriptive yet sparse, which paints a very vivid picture, keeps the reader interested, and also serves to drive the plot at a rapid pace.I also give credit to Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan for the story development. Novels like this usually have a pretty standard ending that the reader knows at the outset. So, there is usually a &quot;surprise&quot; ending, which sometimes works but more often is picked up by the attentive reader well in advance. In &quot;Justice for None&quot;, the authors somehow developed a storyline that was unexpected in terms of how the climactic moment would unfold. Then on top of that, they advanced the story to a wholly satisfying conclusion that had an element of surprise that was also not anticipated. What made the ending so good is that while it was a surprise, it was also rather subdued, which actually served to emphasize the impact even more.So often in reviews - my own included - there is the tendency to rate something in comparison to the authors' previous work. I tried very diligently to avoid doing so here, because of the stark difference between &quot;Justice for None&quot; and &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;. If I were to rate this based on a comparison, I probably would rate this as 4 stars. However, taken as a stand-alone novel - which is more fair and representative of the work - it does merit a rating of a full 5 stars.Once again, the work of Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan has apppealed to me as a reader, and I am once again looking forward to their next work. Hopefully, it will not be as long a wait, but I am eager to find out what they come up with next."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"The atmosphere the authors created swept me back in time to the places and experiences of my youth in Illinois. Justice for None vividly and accurately describes post-World War I Mid-America and combines it with suspense to make a powerful novel. I was totally absorbed by this book and enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"I won't go into the storyline - you can read about that above. Just one thing: Don't listen to the critics. This is truely a good book.I'm very glad I bought it and I'm also sure I'll enjoy a second read. If you like thrillers, adventure stories with solid characters, I suggest you read both the authors' books. All the talk about too many cliches, wobbling storyline - foget about it. Just read it. You won't be disappointed. Promised."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"Having grown up in a small southern Indiana town near the Illinois border, the book evoked strong images of scenes and people I knew in my childhood. The authors managed to avoid the usual stereotypes and gave us a surprise ending, proving their skill at creating characters who seemed like real human beings. Boyd reminded me of some clients I've known who were their own worst enemies, yet a strong sense of justice guided the proceedings despite his character flaws. I also enjoyed the development of the story lines involving WWI and stock market crash from the seldom-seen perspective of middle America."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"I found &quot;Justice for None&quot; to be a very enjoyable read. It crackles with realism--the reader is transported back to the bad old days of the late 1920s, when prosperity was for the few, and hard work and hard luck was the lot of most Americans.Against the backdrop of the looming and imminent Great Depression this story takes place. The protagonist is a World War One hero, who is also a hard-luck case. Rather than being rewarded and recognized for his heroism in Europe, he is scarred by his wartime suffering, and his marriage does not survive the strain. When someone murders his estranged wife, he is the suspect, and then a fugitive.The eventual courtroom scenario, as it plays out in the novel, is the story's climax and also involves the best writing in the novel. Further, it seemed to me (I am a trial attorney) that the authors did an exceptionally good job of showing the reason for some of our procedural safeguards in court that protect defendants. The absence of these safeguards in this 1929 trial work to the very great, and unfair, disadvantage of the protagonist. I thought that the authors did an exceptional job of bringing this out, and the trial has a gritty feel of realism, right down to the incident (no real spoiler here) in which the defense attorney realizes that his client has not been entirely truthful or candid with him. There, as in real life, this is a potentially fatal mistake.The ending surprised me a bit, and the authors do a good job of tying up the loose ends in the story, making for a startling conclusion to a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Justice for None","review":"I received the book within 2 days of placing the order.

While the premise of the story starts with a great childhood fantasy that I think many kids can relate to, the story is told in a kind of mature voice that seems rather un-childlike. I felt that the ending was a litle abrupt or disconnected from the events leading to it; it could have benefitted from a better transition or a few follow up words. As it is, the book is not a good choice for toddlers and kids who mostly enjoy being read TO; it's better for older and more verbal kids who can connect the dots on their own or who can talk about the ending with some adult prompting. I'd recommend it for kids between 5-7, as opposed to the toddler I bought it for."},{"Title":"Peach Heaven","review":"Peach Heaven is a beautiful book based on the rainstorm of Puchon, Korea. This was the day it rained peaches! A powerful monsoon picked the peaches from mountain orchards and quite virtually deposited the fruit in Yangsook's lap. The Yangsook's recollective voice lends a very tender quality to the story. In the author's note we find that peaches are regarded as a very special fruit. The sense of community in the end when everyone helps the farmers with the harvest is a very touching and cherished moment."},{"Title":"Our life with the Rocket: The Maurice Richard story","review":"I actually bought this book in Canada in paperback form, and I am seriously impressed with Roch Carrier's storytelling ability. Having only read The Hockey Sweater, I expected a fantastic story in this book, and it does not disappoint. In Our Life with the Rocket, Carrier writes a biography of Maurice &quot;The Rocket&quot; Richard, one of the greatest hockey players of the last century, or some would say ever, by placing this French-Canadian hero in the context of the province's history. Carrier describes the poverty and hopelessness of the Great Depression in Quebec with vivid detail, telling how young Maurice would run errands for neighbors to earn cash when he wasn't playing street hockey. The hard work Richard put into developing as a hockey player and his career in the NHL, including the famous Richard Riots of the 1954 season, are told with great care. The connection between the Rocket and his legions of Quebecois fans, young and old, is evident. Carrier himself interjects memories of growing up in Quebec worshipping the Rocket, stopping short of completely retelling the autobiographical story related in The Hockey Sweater. He tells how Richard continued to mean a great deal to him as an adult. If the adult reader is a fan of the story of The Hockey Sweater, this book is a perfect companion to it, more fully explaining the significance of Maurice Richard to young French Canadian boys in a time when Quebec had little else to cheer about. I am seriously considering using this in a course I teach."},{"Title":"Our life with the Rocket: The Maurice Richard story","review":"Well, I got half way thru this book and I found myself somewhat disappointed. It started out well enough, and Carrier is a fine writer. But he seems to be following every season individually and chronologically ... and its all the same, and more of the same. Richard broods and attacks his opponents. Carrier throws in the odd factoid or anecdote to validate the section. Life is not fair for the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. They are a little people, but live big through Richard. He must win! Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. Damn the English hockey opponents (Toronto) and the factory bosses and team owners and Campbell. Repeat the same narrative season after season. And the few interesting sociological observations are framed thru the eyes of the young Carrier, so they don't really pack much of a punch anyways. Like I said, I was pretty disappointed, and put the book down. It would have made a great long \\"short story\\" or novella. What a shame ... (I grew up in Montr&eacute;al with the Habs of the 1970s, the Stanley Cup was our inheritance.)"},{"Title":"Raptor Force","review":"Okay this is not grreat literature. It is very quick read. Its story is about getting even at all cost and breaking every constitutional law there is. This plot isn't new and was quite common in the 70's among violent macho liturature. This where the good guys get tired of the bad guys winning because the good guys' hands are tied by the law. Then the good guys step out side the law and become a modern version of the Flying Tigers of WWII. Of course the baddies die and America can sleep in peace. Don't take this seriously, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Think of this a popcorn for the mind. This is the book version of every summer action flick you have ever seen."},{"Title":"Outcaste","review":"I am amazed by the formal daring and inventiveness of this book. It's a must read for anyone interested in great literature, or in gaining insight into traditional India, specifically Kerala, and the intersection of caste, sexuality, and gender.No dry, academic text, nor preachy screed, \\"The Outcaste\\" is a richly layered tale by a master novelist, writing at the top of his stunningly innovative form.I can only imagine how much more amazing it must be to read it in its original Malayalam. This much celebrated author is also a great screenwriter, who has twice won the Best Screenplay award at the annual All-India Awards (the Indian equivalent of the Oscars). As an Indian American filmmaker who had occasion to stay with Matampu Kunjukuttan at his house in Kerala, I can relay that he is as endlessly interesting a personality as he is a writer. I will treasure this work."},{"Title":"Outcaste","review":"The major problem I had while reading this book was that I soon lost track of all the names involved. The fact that most names had at least four syllables didn't help either!But even then, this was a good book. It's about a brahmin sect in southern india where oppressive customs kept women indoors and men in whorehouses all the time. To my amazement (as this is a true story) one woman made a difference -- by playing the system against itself.But that's just the main story. Substories are scattered throughout and there is no shortage of interesting characters. Footnotes (in the edition I read, which is a recent - in other words this book is back in print - English translation) are a rich source of info.But even if all that is of no interest to you, read this for the language. It's not Tagore, but some scenes are very well described, particularly when describing the suffering of the women."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I think what drew me to this book was the idea that someone could actualy go to Antarctica. It had always been such a fantasy place in my mind. Sara Wheeler makes it real, but doesn't take away the magic. It is exciting to experience her sense of energy and adventure to explore the land. Also, her inclusions of history are made interesting by her personal connection and sympathy for the heroic, and often unfortunate, trials of those brave men."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"For many years, I've considered Antarctica my ultimate travel destination. After reading Terra Incognita, I have a craving for the white continent. Sara Wheeler mixes the ingredients of this tasty narrative with the same creativity she employs in her ever-present bread puddings (recipe included). Moldy bits from the diaries of early polar explorers, a pinch of salty scientists, fresh personal perspective, and a dollop of quirky characters, are all served up with a heaping helping of humor that will have you begging for more. On top of that, she mentions my company's most well-known product, Therm-a-Rest, by name on four different occasions."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I once had a discussion with a colleague who said, \\"I've never read a book that actually changed my life. I don't think books can do that.\\" At the time, I disagreed, but couldn't articulate why.Well, this book has been the one that changed my life. It was the first book I read about Antarctica, and it immediately peaked my interest in traveling there. I didn't want to go as a tourist (which is possible, by the way, if you can afford a $6000 cruise....) I wanted to see a science station for myself.Well, it wasn't easy, but three years and SEVERAL job applications later, I've got a job at McMurdo Station (the US's main research station, and the largest one on the continent), and I leave for \\"the Ice\\" in two weeks. So \\"Thanks\\" Sara Wheeler! I owe you one!This book was a pleasure to read because the author so effortlessly blends her experience with the stories of the early explorers. As a fellow, modern, female traveler I could empathize with her desire to get away to an empty, vast place. And her social descriptions are just as interesting. Funny that she is well received everywhere except by her own countrymen at the British base.I definitely recommend it for anyone interested in Antarctica's past or present."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"&quot;Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt&quot;--you can't change your soul by traveling across the ocean. Wheeler quotes this adage and provides some fascinating insights into it from her own perspective, noting that her wanderlust comes from her fear of losing her faith if she lives too long and home and is forced to confront the sad realities of daily life. I feel the same way and had never heard it expressed so beautifully. This is a fine travel book that provides an interesting contrast to recent works on the physical conquest of Antarctica, for this is about the mental conquest of this strange continent. I have read many books about Antarctic exploration but this is the first one that made me want to go myself. I especially appreciated her comments on the disjointed feeling the traveler has when leaving the country she's just visited. Travel literature isn't supposed to be about the country you're visiting (that's what guidbooks are for)--this kind of writing is much more interesting and lasting."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Sara Wheeler relates her months in Antarctica with vivid discription that as an artist I can \\"see\\" her experience. Any one who loves to travel will take this trip with her."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Wheeler combines historical accounts of exploration with her own physical and emotional experiences. I found this book in a library, read it, purchased it and then re-read it. Her accounts of her experiences with scientists and their work are fascinating, and she made me laugh aloud several times. Her account of shared time at a remote site with an artist is an intriguing, interesting 'inside' picture of two artists sharing a unique environment, and contributing to each other's work. Her descriptions of her deeper reactions to the landscape are well done and left me realizing how difficult it must be to write well about such an experience"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I enjoyed Sara's account of her travels mainly due to her wonderful ability to articulate what she had seen and experienced. I do warn future readers that there are a number of these articulations meant for the Antarctic traveler. As I have traveled to Antarctica once in 1995 for science, I feel that &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; held infinitley more flavor. There are a number of references that anyone who has experience the ice will understand and remember with great fondness. Don't get me wrong, I feel this is a good read for anyone, but better if you have already been there. Now, enough criticism. It is a very enjoyable book, and seeing Sara's viewpoint in an all male domain (nearly) was quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Very impressive&quot; Narrow Road to the Deep South.&quot; She shows the parallel process of adjusting to the environment and travelling down inside herself exceptionally well. The humour and lack of pomposity about the process is engaging as is the stealthy accumulation of historical detail on a subjective frame...Wanted to meet her and find out how the process had actually worked on her!"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"A very good, but not great view.I'll admit right up front that I've always wanted to go to Antarctica and this book helped get me a chance to vicariously see it. And it's certainly unique to see it from a woman's perspective. As others have pointed out, it is the fantasy vacation - very few of us could just hop around and freely wander the continent as one would do in Europe. But maybe that's what makes it all the more fun. She obviously did her research before going and that pays off handsomely in her accounts. I felt that I learned about the history of the continent as well as a view of trekking there. So often the books about places like Antarctica have to be adventures stories full of hardship and danger, so it's refreshing to be able to have someone look at it from a different eye.Some of her work is offputting though. She often seemed to be upset that she was treated like an outsider, but then she flits into a camp, goes and does her thing and often sounds like she didn't really kill herself to integrate too. My biggest complaint however is the lack of maps. She talks far too much about places which we as the reader have no idea where they are. So often when reading I would flip to the small maps provided and try to imagine where she is now. Since most of us are newbies when it comes to the area, more points of reference were necessary. Well not necessary but would have improved enjoyment of the adventure.That said, however, the book is a refreshing journey into an unknown area, where you can learn as much about yourself as you do the continent. Sit back in front of a warm fire and dream of the south. It's a fascinating journey."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"In brief, this book is very good and interesting. Ms. Wheeler lived for quite a while (7 months) in the Antarctic, at various sites. Without spending too much time, she describes the history of Antarctic exploration, and the kind of characters it attracts.Most interesting to me was her interest in the individuals she encountered there, and the effect isolation has on them. Some return time after time, which most of us would find puzzling. She explains the hold the continent has on these people.While travelling from camp to camp, run by several nations, she also examined cultural differences, some of which are insightful...the Italian camp seemed especially &quot;human&quot;, for example. And compare the British and American camp atmospheres.By interspersing her reportorial observations with personal comments, she reveals something of herself, but not too much. She does not become overly familiar. Nor does the book dwell too much on the scientific minutiae of the area, as some others do. This is a good book about a very harsh place, written by a very good reporter and observer.I'd very much like to meet this woman. How many books leave one with that feeling about an author?"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I'm not an aficianado of the literature of Antartica. I do, however, have an interest in the place and especially the epics that have taken place there - Scott, Shackleton, etc..I've enjoyed the tales of these epics immensely in my reading.Perhaps this background was a setup for disaster in my reading of Terra Incognita by Sara Wheeler. I hoped to find an account of yet another journey through this strange and remarkable landscape peppered with the history of the place and the unique adaptations necessary for survival there.Indeed, I did find this account in Wheeler's book, except it fell far short of my expectations. Wheeler tends to write as much about her friends she makes along the way as she does about her impressions/travels on the continent. It's all very superficial and without purpose as she wanders from place to place searching for new friends, recent friends, new boyfriend, etc......It seems more a compilation of tidbits and snapshot glimpses of the places and people she encounters than a profound or meaningful exploration of this unique world.The low point of the book for me was Wheeler's arrival on the continent with the members of the British scientific team (about 2/3rds through the book). She breaks down and cries shortly after her arrival. Why the emotional break? Was it the weather? The intensity of the hardship as she chugs beer in each hidden bar along the journey? Or perhaps the suffering through all that trail mix?.....Nope, she cries because people aren't being very nice to her -- just not as chummy as the kiwis and the Americans she discovers.Cherry-Gerrard said we'd accomplish our &quot;winters journeys&quot; as long as all we wished was &quot;a penguin's egg.&quot; Wheeler has no interest in penguin eggs or the passions of discovery that motivated so many of Antarctica's authors. Instead, she wanders the continent seemingly in search of herself.......good luck."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Going to the Southern tip of S.America and wanted to read about the penquins first; but got history lessons in almost every chapter. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I first read this book after checking out a copy from our local library, and was so impressed with the story that I wanted a copy of my own. Sara Wheeler is a fine writer, who uses exhaustive research and incredible word skills to tell her story. My only concern was that I had to keep a dictionary handy to stay with her! I consider it the best read I have had in years, and was most pleased to get my personal copy very quickly from Amazon."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"A complete guide to the Antarctic experience, Sara interweaves anecdotes, history, humour and impressions until you feel as if you have been there with her. She loved her first visit so much that she returned to winter over on the Ice."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Living in a city known for it's balmy and mild climate, I picked up this book because it seemed so different from everything I had been used to. After the first chapter, I became too involved to put it down. While I was not a big fan of Antartica before the read, I soon became one. Miss Wheeler captivated me with her descriptions of this huge blue/white continent. I am unfortunately(?) obsessed now with the south polar region. I have been reading every book I can find about the area, and this would not have happened without Sara Wheeler's beautifully written account of her 7 months stay at the various bases which dot the continent. I highly encourage anyone, whether you are interested in the region or not, to buy this book and sit back for a most enjoyable experience. You will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Antarctica from the perspective of a woman is a unique find. While the book includes excerpts from explorers past, it gives a good picture of what living down there is really like now. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"This is a truly outstanding book woven of three threads. Sara Wheeler, a Brit who got a position as &quot;writer in residence&quot; with the US National Science Foundation, writes achingly beautiful descriptions of the other-worldly scenery of Antarctica. For the first time I understand how such a seemingly inhospitable place &quot;hooks&quot; people. Second, she writes engaging portraits of the &quot;beards&quot;, the scientists who work on the ice. Finally, she weaves into her tale fine sketches on some of the early explorers and adventurers who first caught the excitement of the place. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"If you're only going to read one book about Antarctica, it should be this one. Wheeler knows her Antarctic history, but she also conveys a strong sense of the culture and lives of those living on the continent today. And though the details of day to day life that she describes seem small at first, in the end they add up to a compelling, unforgetable portrait of the highest, driest, windiest place on earth."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Sara Wheeler's account of her Antarctic adventures was a great read. Her portrayal of day to day life, interwoven historical references, beautiful landscape descriptions, and tales of encounters with the myriad of personalities who make their temporary home on the ice, made for a captivating story. It does what all good travel literature should....makes you want to go to this incredible place. Since reading the novel Antartic Navigation a few years back, I have been devouring books about the polar regions. This book put me over the top...a trip to Antartica is now a goal of my own. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Terra Incognita is a delight. Wheeler is witty, charming and interesting, and her descriptions of both her outer and inner journeys in Antarctica are terrific reading. Along with her own experiences, Wheeler reviews the history of antarctic exploration with particular insight into the British character and experience. I still think Scott was a twit, but I understand his mentality a little better now. While Wheeler lacks the passionate introspection of Byrd's _Alone_, her depiction of her winter on the ice gives a sense of the changes such a powerful environment produces on the psyche. _Terra Incognita_ is definitely on the short list of terrific Antarctica books."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Sometimes I think I must have been an Eskimo in a prior life, because I love books about the frozen north. When I came upon this book, subtitled &quot;Travels in Antarctica&quot;, by Sara Wheeler, my imagination was immediately captured as I realized this was a whole new territory for me to explore in my reading experience.Ms. Wheeler is a young British travel writer who spent 7 months in Antarctica in 1995 as a writer-in-residence with the U.S. National Science Foundation. What a great gig!A lot of research went into the writing of this book. And a lot of love. She mixes all the historical details of the early explorations of Shackleton, Amundson and Scott with her own modern and female perspective of the places she goes, the people she meets and the emotional effect all this has on her as she explores the coldest, windiest and driest continent in the world.As Antarctic explorations go, hers has a certain degree of comfort. She is helicoptered around to various bases, and even though there are periods of time that she spends in a tent or igloo or prefab shelter, she has radio contact with the base and always has a supply of food. But this, of course, is what it is like to travel to Antarctica these days, and she is fortunate indeed to have the experience of going there. This is not a tourist destination after all. And virtually everybody there is a scientist of some sort.She describes her experiences well and I loved he sense of humor, especially when describing the differences between the bases manned by different nationalities. The Italians have the best food. The Brits are completely male, bonded in their background of English private schools and given to bawdy toilet humor and practical jokes. And the American staff is approximately 25% female.The book was a slow read, especially the parts which go into detail about the fascinating history, but I didn't mind. Also, the pace of the book tended to remain the same throughout as she traveled from base to base making her observations. The bases might have been isolated, but even in 1995, she was able to get e-mail there.The concluding chapters were the most interesting. Perhaps it is because by then the reader has absorbed all the history and first impressions. During these last chapters, Ms. Wheeler spends several months with an American woman artist in a prefabricated cabin out on the ice. The artist paints. The writer writes. They develop a deep friendship as they prepare meals and grapple with the environment amidst the startling beauty of their surroundings, watching the long polar nights welcome the sun.I was sorry to see the book end because during the time I was reading it, I was transported to a very real part of the world that I will probably never have the opportunity to visit myself. So for all my fellow armchair travelers, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"There have been many, many travel books written, but so few actually remain with you, actually transform you. Terra Incognita is one of those books.No matter how Sara Wheeler got there, her 7-month trip through Antarctica unfolds beautifully between the eccentric and fun &quot;beakers&quot; she meets along the way and the intense splendor of the continent. Because of her mode of travel (spending a few days or weeks here or there, until her final 2-month stay in a shack during her last trip to see the coming of summer), Wheeler most likely got to see more of Antarctica--it's various bases, landscapes, and people--than just about anyone alive.Added to this is a great amount of Antarctic exploration history, which makes the book seem more than just a seven-month journey . . . more like 100 years of attempts to figure out this hypnotic and enigmatic continent; reading it encourages you to do your own further research on this subject. While I do agree that there could have been more maps included, just have a globe or atlas nearby if you want to follow her travels more closely!In my opinion, the downfall of most travel books is that the author focuses too much on him- or herself to the exclusion of everything else. Wheeler does include her thoughts, feelings--how she sees herself changing with each experience. These are never intrusive, however. The only other book that comes to mind with this sort of balance is Matthiesen's The Snow Leopard--another fantastic travel read. This book is quiet but never empty and never dull. Read it and be transported."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"This is a good choice for a predeparture read for people going to Antarctica as tourists. Of course, you can always read Shackleton's, Scott's, Amundsen's and Fienne's accounts of their epic journeys into the unknown, but that'll take you a long time, and you may be a bit distracted by the old-fashioned language therein. For a modern description of what life is like in the Antarctic nowadays, and what goes on in the head of a thirtyish female when she gets to visit (for free) with the scientists down there, you can't do better than this one.The book is part diary of Sara Wheeler as she goes through some sort of change during her visits to Antarctica (three different trips during a seven month period, not one seven month stay as you may be led to believe at first). She's a bit too, hm, spiritual for me, \\"the landscape talked to me\\", to the degree that she suddenly decides to stop drinking alcohol, for no apparent particular reason. She describes her feelings well, although I wasn't really interested in reading about them.The other part (and these two parts are closely intermingled throughout the book) is heaps and heaps of Antarctic history and \\"folklore\\". You get to learn all the basic facts about what happened to the pioneers and discoverers of Antarctica (with a VERY British bias, mind you), which definitely should be of basic interest to people who are going to Antarctica themselves.\\"Travels in Antarctica\\" as a second title is not really fitting. She is not traveling. She is a guest of the American and British Antarctic Survey organisations, and is well taken care of by them, both when it comes to supplying her with equipment and with transportation. It is nothing like what traveling in Antarctica is for someone who pay their way through travel agents.Still; good one, for what it is!"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"After reading the thoroughly enjoyable Travels in a Thin Country, I figured on some entertaining travelogue action in Terra Incognita.Didn't happen.What ever happened to the adventurous Sara Wheeler of the Travels book? After slogging my way up to the middle of the book, my level of interest experienced a whiteout worthy of winter in Antarctica. I realized, as I laid the book momentarily aside, that the reading was getting pretty tedious. A bad sign, usually meaning a book is targeted for the pile heading for the used book store.Most of this book comes across as journalizing that never got the attention of a re-write before heading off to the publisher. The lack of cohesion that should be glueing this narrative together is palpable; this is a narrative devoid of any sustaining \\"pull\\". Terra Incognita is a muddle through a pastiche of the historical events of Antarctica although it is interspersed with some pretty decent reportage of current life at the bottom of the world.Still, there ain't much to redeem the tediousness of this book except Wheeler's wry British humour. But even that's not enough to keep one's attention from freezing to death. Wheeler is encamped with predomitably groups of scientists; as such, this isn't much of a travelogue but rather a logbook of how to hang out with the transients.I think Sara Wheeler is worthy of producing some real decent travel writing; Travels in a Thin Country bears testimony to this. Terra Incognita, however, is a big hiccup; hopefully she will produce a better read the next book that comes our way.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"This is a wonderfully woven tale of travel to Antarctica in the past and present. It's not just Scott and Shackleton, but Seismic Man (a scientist there today), told in an engaging style. Nor is it just about travel to a physical place (albeit the most extreme on earth). Wheeler also describes the inner journey that travelers to Antarctica inevitably make. Antarctica is now on my destination list. But regardless of whether I ever make it there, after reading Terra Incognita, I think I understand the lure of the ice. The maps are good as is the ending recipe for the Antarctic version of Bread-and-Butter Pudding. My only regret is that she didn't include an appendix with the chronology of early Antarctic explorations. Terra Incognita is even better than Travels in a Thin Country, Wheeler's earlier account of travel in Chile."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Having read the reviews of other people I feel moved to add my comments. I have worked in Antarctic science and tourism for ten years, including one continuous period of 39 months on the ice.I was working on one of the \\"Bawdy British\\", \\"Toilet Humour\\" bases when Ms Wheeler came visiting on an all-expenses-paid, freebie holiday that would cost Mr or Mrs Normal more than U$100,000 if he/she tried to repeat the trip. I.E. Forget about it being within the reach of anyone \\"normal\\".(i) We didn't know who she was (ii) We didn't know why she was coming (iii) We hadn't been told we were supposed to \\"entertain her\\" (iV) She arrived at last-call, read \\"last chance to read/write letters, party with \\"outsiders\\" and see others outside nine other winterers for nine months. (v) She didn't attempt to integrateConsequently, nobody took too much notice of her.Despite the slagging that the British Antarctic Survey (that still provides more results/$ than USARP) received, she writes well, albeit dreamily at times. The most interesting point, that many readers might not have noticed is that after trip 1 to Antarctica Sara hadn't really understood what the big white is all about. Only after trip 2, where she gets the chance to spend a few weeks isolated in a caboose does she begin to catch on..."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Extraordinary. Made me laugh and cry at once. Deadpan British humour and intriguing detail coexists along soaringly touching, even mystical, reverie. There is nothing sentimental about Wheeler's love for the Antarctic. This is a real journey told with incredible candour. It's a privilege to have read it.One of Wheeler's cleverest adjectives to describe detailed, jewel-like writing that she admires is &quot;lapidary.&quot; She uses it twice in the book to describe the Antarctic writing of other authors. But HER OWN writing is as jewel-like and detailed in the extreme. What an extraordinary book. It's not like a book at all - it's like a world."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"\\"Terra Incognita\\" is British travel writer Sara Wheeler's report on her two United States Government sponsored stays in Antarctica. It's also an easy introduction into the high and low points of polar exploration and into some of the kinds of current scientific work now being conducted there by men and women from several nations.Author Wheeler's time with the American National Science Foundation's Artists' and Writers' Program was spent during both a sunlit polar summer and during the darkness of an Antarctic winter. She stayed with or visited primarily Americans, British and New Zealanders, and within these communities, colorful characters abounded among visitors and scientific staff alike.The book has the patented insights and observations and the thorough and meticulous research readers have come to expect from Ms. Wheeler in works such as \\"Travels in a Thin Country\\" and in \\"Evia.\\" When staging in New Zealand for her upcoming adventure, she killed some time in an arcade. While there, she noted that one of the table soccer games didn't have teams from say, Brazil and New Zealand but, instead, had Jews and Nazis competing for goals. Later in her story, she mentions Antarctic temperatures, which are often so low as to be incomprehensible to many of us. She helps us understand the reality of such cold when she describes tossing boiling water into the air and watching it freeze before it falls to the ground. Her research on polar explorers is comprehensive enough (and tawdry enough) to include speculation on the possible extra-marital adventures of Robert Falcon Scott's wife.The writing isn't bad. If Sara Wheeler became howling mad, and were committed to languish in some wretched Bedlam, the ravings she smuggled out to her publisher (scribbled on toilet paper squares, no doubt) would be better than much of what does actually find its way into print. Yet, at least to this reviewer, reading \\"Terra Incognita\\" was much like wading through giant cotton balls or, perhaps, snow. There was also the feeling that the author was undergoing an intense spiritual or emotional crisis during the time she spent researching her polar opus. Perhaps this was just her reaction to the frozen immensity of the place and to the darkness of the existential void that surrounded her during the polar winter.Ms. Wheeler says in her introduction that \\"Antarctica was my love affair.\\" She also notes \\"...the reach of the imagination extends far beyond the snow fields.\\" Quixotically, for a travel writer, she says, elsewhere that, \\"the most foreign territory will always lie within.\\"On balance, there's enough good material woven into \\"Terra Incognita\\" for it to rate four stars among Sara Wheeler fans. For the casual reader, the rating might drift toward three stars."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"A young and adventureous female writer describes scientists and technicians in Antarctica. Ms. Wheeler transforms 7-month in science camps into a refreshing exposition of people and places. Ms. Wheeler is not of the touchy-feely kind. At a fast clip she instead surprises with delightful stories of encounters with a different breed of people in a different land. &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; is not all ice but also mountains and deserts and abundant life. As a scientist I felt at times described like a caged animal on display. She pokes fun of subjects and self that the feeble may not always like. Her book made me laugh and smile often. It still does.The people in Ms. Wheeler's book reminded me of companions that I lived with in close quarters working on Arctic research vessels. She succeeds very well to reveal the essence of men and women who live science. With humor and gripping commentary she depicts the human side of science. This is also new travel writing at its very best since Bruce Chatwin stopped writing. As Ms. Wheeler's first book on travels in Chile, &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; reflects a healthy thirst for life and wanderlust."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Sara Wheeler's journey to Antarctica began as a side trip. While researching a book on Chile, she flew to its southernmost point, King George Island, off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.&quot;Standing on the edge of the ice field in a wind strong enough to lean on, squinting in the buttery light, it was as if I were seeing the earth for the very first time,&quot; she writes. &quot;I felt less homeless than I have ever felt anywhere, and I knew immediately that I had to return.&quot;&quot;Terra Incognita&quot; is the story of that return. It offers a fascinating snapshot of modern day scientists who are expanding the frontiers of polar research in Antarctica, framed within an engaging and well-researched history of human adventure on this most inhospitable of continents.Wheeler's book is filled with fascinating characters, their portraits sketched with affection and humor: the scientists, flyboys and dreamers she meets in field stations and camps; legendary explorers such as Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton, whose lives are vividly rendered through excerpts from their writings; and ultimately, the great landscape itself.&quot;The landscape drew my thoughts away from worldly things, away from the thousand mechanical details of my outward life,&quot; Wheeler writes of the spiritual aspects of her Antarctic sojourn. &quot;I had found the place where, loosed from my cultural moorings, I could find the space to look for the higher power, whatever it was, that loomed over the snow fields.&quot;By sharing her own responses to the landscape, as well as describing how other people have responded to Antarctica as a place and an idea throughout history, Wheeler has crafted a highly personal book that also educates the reader about the continent's history, geography and climate.I would recommend this book to any reader interested in nature, science, or history, who wants to take &quot;the last great journey&quot; with an engaging and funny guide."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"The book goes on and on about Scott and guys who went to the Antarctic about a zillion years ago. The author continually says bad things about everyone she meets, then tells how they all loved her and threw parties for her. She marginalizes or even ignores the work of the people she meets. I read the book to learn about Antarctica, not about her. Having read the book, I know more about her and no more about Antarctica than I did before I read the book. Forget this book; don't bother reading it unless you're one of Sara's &quot;friends&quot; (be careful of the back-stabbing)."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"This is an account of travels within Sara Wheeler's mind, while her body just happened to be in Antarctica at the time. You will enjoy this book if you accept it as literature with frosty landscapes in the background.You will dislike this book if you want to learn anything at all about the place ... it will still be largely incognita when you have finished reading.Wheeler is part of the stereotype of female travel writers who are obsessed with the effect places and people have upon themselves; compare males who minutely describe the scenes and processes of travel.Antarctica seems to have an effect on its visitors which Wheeler adequately conveys. But you won't learn anything at all about why people work there, or what they have discovered."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Fittingly, Ms. Wheeler seems enraptured by the splendour of great white south. Most who have been to the Arctic or Antarctic has suffered the same fate. However she seems a bit full of herself at times, and this distracts noticably from the book. There were times when I thought to myself that she was in Antarctica for social reasons (to &quot;party&quot;!) rather than to discover the essence of the place.Still, if you can ignore the aren't-I-great parts, it makes for a good read."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"Sara Wheeler's Terra Incognita, copy write 1996, 351 pages, is an amazing book about a woman and her travels in Antarctica.Sara Wheeler was the first female to travel south to Antarctica. The book describes all her experiences during her 7-month expedition. The book really relates to biology because of the animals she encounters, and the harsh climate caused by the environment. In the beginning of the book Wheeler very accurately describes the territory to really get you into. I found myself going on-line and finding more information because she left me hanging. She also went into some detail of previous expeditions and other explorer's adventures. And during the whole book she was offering a ton of information and giving unbelievable details that I would never had thought to write down, such as that temperature. During her stay, I got the vibe that Ms. Wheeler was treated as an outsider, yet that did not stop her from making unbelievable observations. She was a very good reporter considering the conditions. She related to a completely new environment of &quot;natives.&quot;I learned a lot from the book that I never knew about Antarctica and life there. For example I never knew that you had to go to the tip of South America before you could leave. Or how many steps there were in getting to the &quot;station&quot;. I also learned that living in Antarctica is not just snow and cold, it is mountains, ice, there really is no one there.

Buy it..."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"As a lover of all things glacial (with Antarctica holding a particularly special place in my heart), I was thrilled to come across this book in my local library. The book promised to deliver an enjoyable blend of history, science and culture in an entertaining travelogue format. Sadly, I soon found myself disappointed. By the time I was halfway through, I was struggling to make progress through what should have been an engaging read.Wheeler suffers for the most part from a lack of direction. Her \\"travels\\" consist of spur-of-the-moment helicopter rides to various locations on the ice that fail to be distinguishable after the fourth or fifth trip. Indeed, at times the book reads more like segments of a blog interspersed haphazardly with snippets of polar exploration history or the odd fact about glacial ice or penguins. This is further muddled with somewhat contrived musings on American culture (they're all depicted like they're ex-cowboys from Texas), or anomalous personal asides that try to be meaningful but come across as undeveloped filler material.Individual chapters have no particular structure or purpose, and so the finished product feels a bit like slogging along through the variations of the same thing: funny anecdote, helicopter ride, historical bit, description of another station's toilet facilities or the food they eat, personal aside. After several chapters of this jumpy, disjointed writing style, following the narrative stops being fun and feels more like work. This is unfortunate; Wheeler's writing isn't necessarily poor, but seems to suffer from a bad editing job and a lack of planning.The anecdotes are amusing, the history fascinating, but when it comes to the science and the researchers themselves Wheeler largely fails to make a case for their relevance. Instead, they come across as slightly eccentric guinea pigs with odd-but-quaint obsessions. Still, perhaps the book's greatest crime is that she largely fails to capture the beauty and utter wildness of this last frontier on Earth, and in the end I felt no closer to Antarctica than when I first picked up the book.~ Jacquelyn Gill"},{"Title":"Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica","review":"I love this book and so should everyone else! I first read it about four years ago and the longing it left in me to visit this amazing white place was tremendous - so much so that I am now studying with the intent of working in the Antarctic. You can't ask for much more out of a book. I seriously recommend it to anyone, literally anyone as you can't go wrong with it. The style of writing Sara Wheeler uses is just so informative and interesting but in such a way that you don't realise you're learning and absorbing all this information about the other side of the world but believe me you are!

One written particularly because a desperate publisher made a phone call, or mailed a letter with a check to an author with the words: \\"It's time to write another one, Shirley...\\" and the author hurled herself to write, without a plan, without ideas and the only thing that came out was a dull diary filled with self pity, anti-Americanism, sexism and generally criticism... Well, this is one of those books and I truly feel sorry for the trees that have to die annually to satisfy the erroneous marketing projections of underpaid book editors in the current cost-cutting environment (especially after the advent of Print-on-Demand) in order to deliver such hideous and mind numbing gems. Yet I am also grateful. I'm grateful for these sacrifices because they serve to carry a message to the reader, which he or she can carry to you the broader audience. That message is - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK AND THIS AUTHOR.In terms of content - well, there is no story here. This is simply a tedious account of a lonely woman who spent someone else's money to visit Antarctica and record her daily experiences. What kind of experiences, you wonder?The kind that go like this\\"\\"...we took off over the frozen sound toward the Transantarctics...\\"\\"...we could see individual birds waddling about with stones in their beaks...\\"\\"...Later that day we landed at the snout of the Mawson Glacier for a picnic...\\"\\"...so we all had our own few feet of privacy. It was hot and dark inside...\\"\\"...and later we saw all their small yellow tents pitched in the distance...\\"and go on and on and on...Occasionally the author makes references to Scott's, Shackleton's and other expeditions, but in no way enough to stir imagination or interest.

However, in playing up the idea that Pentecostalism may be little more than a Christian &quot;mask&quot; over indigenous spiritualities, I think he may have played into the hands of religious right fundamentalists who attack a charismatic christianity as heretical and into the hands of intellectual universalists who don't wish to see a distinct contribution from the Christian Pentecostal movement as a unique form of religious spirituality. Cox writes with the ease and clarity of a novelist, but the story is more fiction than fact. He could site actual examples of Pentecostalism in Africa, for instance, rather than making the eurocentric generalization that all African Christianity, or indigenous churches there, are just another form of Pentecostalism. Very little attention is given to the interpretive issues in Pentecostalism (oneness vs trinity, wesleyan sanctification vs keswick baptistic) nor is adequate attention given to the continuing distinction among class and race in the American movement. That someone from Kirkus Reviews could have actually have read the book and still view the Azusa Street Revival as a meeting of poor black domestic workers shows that the ecumenical and ethnic diversity of that early 20th century movement still have not been made crystal clear."},{"Title":"Fire From Heaven: The Rise Of Pentecostal Spirituality And The Reshaping Of Religion In The Twenty-first Century","review":"Professor Cox has, indeed, contributed to the ever-widening area of Pentecostal/charismatic studies with &quot;FIRE FROM HEAVEN.&quot; His breadth of experience, reflected in the book, is to be admired; but it wasn't wide enough. As a life-long Pentecostal, I could identify with only a few parts of his &quot;experience&quot; and have wondered why the &quot;main-line&quot; denominations weren't included more than they actually were. Why did Cox not visit Times Square Church, or the Brooklyn Tabernacle, or any number of other biblically-sound congregations, and see what effective Pentecostal churches are all about? After reading, and re-reading the book, I felt that I was getting a treatise on the &quot;fringe&quot; elements of Pentecostalism, and not the &quot;mainstream.&quot; It is worthy of being read...but not very balanced,in the light of world-wide Pentecostalism."},{"Title":"Fire From Heaven: The Rise Of Pentecostal Spirituality And The Reshaping Of Religion In The Twenty-first Century","review":"Harvey Cox, the former head of Harvard Divinity School, does some magnificent work giving insight to pentecostalism and putting it into context with information I have not seen elsewhere. He traveled the world speaking to academics and attending services on almost every continent. He pushed his ten page list of citations to the back to make it more accessible to the non-academic and provides a fourteen page index.He successfully explains the unique hidden power wielded by women in pentecostal churches in Latin America and the intricate historical relationship between American fundamentalists and pentecostals. He also does well describing the neo-pentecostal and how all three fit into the Religious Right's political agenda. The history he provides on the degeneration into gender bias is well researched. But his best work is exposing the American pentecostal automatic acceptance of government policies that permitted despots to \\"disappear\\" pentecostals. These pentecostals were in essence delivered up by their own sisters and brothers in America.But there are at least two serious errors in this work such that it must be read with caution. He continues that Anglo-centric myth that pentecostalism took off in 1906 on Azusa Street in Los Angeles from which it spread to the world. And he totally misrepresents pentecostalism in Africa - particularly Zimbabwe.In a 1996 article in Church History, Joe Creech mines one of the earliest histories of of Azusa St (Bartleman, 1925[1980] Bridge Publishing) to show that the historical and theological biases of the time are responsible for the current assumption of The Myth.{This is a correction to my original review - thanks to Nelson Banuchi, May 2008.} Had Cox followed this lead, he would have learned that Fire(s) had started in India in 1860, Korea in 1903, and another one in India in 1905 before Azusa missionaries had reached the continent. There are many instances of the Fire appearing in various locales untouched by pentecostal missionaries - such as the Ivory Coast and parts of China. Accepting the murky history of pentecostalism in favor of the Azusa myth is disappointing in a scholar with such a great reputation.His interpretation of pentecostalism in Africa is also a disappointment.In Zimbabwe the author witnesses several different services and common to them was the confession of sins against the earth \\"...These include any activities that lead to soil erosion, fouling the water supply, or chopping down trees without replacing them.\\" This awareness in African communities certainly pre-dates the current Christian Anglo wakeup to proper stewardship of the earth. Here the author slips into the stereotypical view of African Christians as essentially primitive by connecting this ecological awareness to \\"the throbbing universe of African primal religion.\\"Cox basically views pentecostal African Christianity as syncretistic even using drumming and dancing as evidence instead of seeing it as a common indigenous practice incorporated into the church. This is in spite of mentioning in the same sentence the command from the Psalms to praise God with timbrel and lyre and then describing King David dancing at the ark. One needs to add that King David was known to even dance unclothed in public - and not to God's displeasure according to the same Psalms.Of one of the African pentecostal church founders mentioned, John Maranke is lumped in with other leaders and is exalted as a Mandela type figure leading Zimbabwe to independence. But his church \\"The Maranke Vapostori\\", founded in 1932 is considered by common African pentecostals to be un-orthodox in both origin and current practice. This is one example of where African Pentecostals appear to have the spiritual and intellectual wherewithal to distinguish syncretism from indigenous practices - but Cox fails to acknowledge this.This is likely caused in part by Cox's almost exclusive reliance on historiography written by the educated - a method that is now being challenged as the sole method of retrieving history. Oral historiography, deconstruction of myths and other methods are considered necessary to more accurately capture a complete history - if such a thing is possible."},{"Title":"Fire From Heaven: The Rise Of Pentecostal Spirituality And The Reshaping Of Religion In The Twenty-first Century","review":"This book is an odd mixture of personal narrative and some history. This may be an important point, since from a research perspective its practically useless. On the flip side, this makes the book an easy, smooth read.

Will you kindly replace the former review by the following one which I have corrected?I highly value this book mainly for three reasons. First this is the first and only significant research on the Pentecostal spirituality so far published. Based on his own &quot;field work&quot; method, the author both encourages and warns concerning the future of the spiritual movement. Secondly he is keenly aware that the movement has potential power to overcome racial discrimination (at least in its origin). Thirdly as myself one of the tongue-speaking people in Japan, I agree with the author who envisages this spiritual movement will eventually develop into various types of Christianity and will enrich the general trend of world religions."},{"Title":"Fire From Heaven: The Rise Of Pentecostal Spirituality And The Reshaping Of Religion In The Twenty-first Century","review":"So with the end of slavery in the U.S.A., most black Christians set up their own churches, and later some of these churches gave birth to the massive Pentecostal movement, which deeply influenced many white churches and swept over much of the world. Cox traces this growing movement down the decades and over several continents. He deals in stories of seemingly ordinary people who caught a passion for breaking down walls between hearts. Many of these are women, such Lucy Farrow, Marie Burgess, Florence Crawford, Maria Woodworth-Etter, or Aimee Semple McPherson, who walked out of a church which could not respect her gifts, and built her independent Church of the Four Square Gospel in the 1920s, which had over 25,000 affiliated churches in 74 countries by the 1990s.The movement Cox describes is different in spirit than fundamentalism. Though it is subject to corrupt leaders or cheap commercialization, it is also full of local heroes like evangelical politician Benedita da Silva, who stresses Jesus' promise to the slum dwellers of Rio de Janeiro: \\"Imagine, we will do greater things than he did\\". (p. 166) In all, Cox gives a report which is properly respectful for the power and magnitude of popular religion, made down home in local people's hearts.-author of Correcting Jesus"},{"Title":"Fire From Heaven: The Rise Of Pentecostal Spirituality And The Reshaping Of Religion In The Twenty-first Century","review":"What is the source of the enormous appeal of pentecostalism? When William Penn founded Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, the Quakers were an ecstatic sect. Pentecostalism is the experiential brand of Christianity. It may account for one in four Christians. It proliferates in gigantic cities. It is a kind of ecumenical movement. Pentecostalism, the Azusa Street revival, arose among the disenfranchised. Religions struggle with order and chaos. The Azusa Street revival lasted for three years. William Joseph Seymour had no formal education. In Houston he saw a woman speaking in tongues. He was introduced to Charles Fox Parham. Seymour was invited to settle in Los Angeles to preach by Julia Hutchins.Los Angeles was cosmopolitan and had a high tolerance for spiritual innovators. The congregation of the Azusa Street revival was interracial. A rival group organized the Assemblies of God. The Church of God in Christ became a pentecostal denomination. A conference at Cleveland, Tenn., caused another group, Church of God, to become pentecostal. Mainline churches disliked the pentecostals and fundamentalists loathed them. In the disputes it was a case of the spirit versus the letter. The movement did not gain adherents between the wars, but rose up again following World War II.While a college student, the author attended a service at the New Order of the Latter Rain. Speaking in tongues has a theological purpose. Speaking in tongues is taken as evidence of spiritual baptism. Speaking in tongues is an example of ecstatic utterance. Aimee Semple McPherson drew on popular culture in the work of her International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, (Jesus as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming King). Pentecostals believe in direct revelation through vision. Testimonies are a kind of folklore. Women are the principal carriers of pentecostalism. The author is taken with the parallel development of jazz, he plays the saxophone, and pentecostalism. Both depend upon heartfelt enthusiasm.In South America the pentecostals tell people they need to change and can change. Some followers are political activists. Pentecostalism counteracts the anomie produced by rapid urbanization. It supplies coherence and a new set of rules for living. The faith forbids drunkenness, carousing, infidelity. Despotism in the leadership of some of the groups in South America should be of concern. On the other hand, some groups practice democracy. Pentecostalism is paradoxical.Attendance at the traditional churches in Europe is low, but pilgrimages to sites associated with apparitions and other mysteries have increased. Sicily has a large number of pentecostals. Pentecostalism in Korea incorporates many elements of shamanism. Many of the independent African churches are pentecostal. Indigenous churches insist the gifts of the spirit are still available."},{"Title":"The further adventures of Jimmie Dale","review":"A giant literary work. Superior to Shakespeare.

Many years ago, Wallace MacCaffrey, teaching Modern European History at Haverford College, said this about the intellectual revolution of the 17th century: \\"Medieval life rested on two bases: religious authority, which rested on ultimate revelation, to which was added the authority of the church.....By the late Middle Ages the intellectual tradition had broadened. There was no organized attempt on the part of the church to check this movement....Differences between Christian thought and Greek thought were not too well pointed up. By the end of the 15th century there was a psychological contempt for the institution of the church, although no explosion as such had taken place. Rather, a loss of confidence gradually set in.....\\"After the Reformation, there was an opportunity for new ideas. Also there were many new ideas about religion itself.....not limiting the discussion to Christianity... Instead of revelation there came to be a body of knowledge that squared with human experience. By the end of the 17th century a new recovery of confidence had set in....Newtonian physics became the Gospel of the Enlightenment.....There even became a science of man....\\"This introductory statement by Wallace MacCaffrey might put Basil Willey's magnificent book in perspective. Willey writes in great detail about the upsetting of the concept of the ancient and medieval three-story universe, replacing it with a new confidence in nature and a new confidence in religion and literature to express realities beyond nature. Surprisingly, the 17th century worked out a synthesis, so that religion and science were not really antagonistic, sparring enemies, but partners in discovering, and discussing, Truth in its many manifestations. John Milton, \\"Paradise Lost\\" is perhaps the epitome of what had happened. It was even considered to have surpassed ancient literature in splendor and insight. Also, Willey discusses the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes, Rene Descartes, John Locke, and others as he enables the reader to come to grips with the revolutions occurring in Western thought.This is an extremely helpful read.....I bought another copy from Amazon to replace my original copy ---by now battered and worn from all its use in the past 58 years....

After 3 psychiatric hospitalizations and ending up in a nursing home, I gave him this book to read while in physical rehab in the nursing home. Around Thanksgiving (also his 72nd birthday) he called and said \\"I have saved some money and this book changed my life. I want you to order me 40 of these because I have decided that this is a ministry for me...a purpose. I have a list of 40 people I want to give a book because I think they can benefit\\". He worked for years as a chemical dependency counselor and worked in the prison system. I now am charged with finding more books....I mean a lot...because he wants to go back into prisons and give these books to prisoners because he says the message is one for everyman as the book is easily read and people can identify with the spiritual messages when organized religion may be too threatening.

Remember, I said \\"like\\" a fictional manual; don't worry, it's not written in a textbook format or littered with lists of do's and do not's in the world of high school popularity. It's a story that's told from Samantha's point of view about her transition from a teenage insult aficionado into a political candidate, perfect prom date, and queen of the SAT. Is it a love story? Yes, but not just boy meets girl. You will find several boy meet girl mini-plots; however, the true love story is the one about self-love.Samantha's character was written in a manner that led me on a mixed emotional trail. I liked her, didn't like her, wanted to smack her, wanted to hug her, and in the end - I wanted to be her.This is contemporary fiction at its best and I loved the way Janette used subtle as well as in-your-face humor to flavor this story. Wait until you read the part about the drooling cat that goes on a date with Samantha - it's one of those laugh out loud and kind of snort chapters.If you've ever been an underdog, known a cheerleader, wanted to be class president, or just wanted to be someone that other people liked, this is the perfect read.

Since being in the position of head cheerleader won't help her get into a good collage, she decides to run for student body president. She thinks that this will help her a lot. She decides she will try to get other people to vote for her by not insulting them. When she \\"becomes\\" nicer, her friend, Logan, she ends up in a bet with him. She can't take two weeks without insulting someone, or that's what he thinks. In the campaign, she is running against intelligent Amy Stock and the popular, but strange Rick Debrock. During all of this campaigning, Samantha makes new friends, becomes enemies with the old, and learns about the characters in people. She also learns that there are other people in the world besides her and everything is not about her.I liked this book because it talks about a life of a teenager. It tells how she deals with her problem. Normally, I like books that have a little romance and realistic fiction in it. This book kept me \\"hooked\\" onto the book. Even though you knew what was going to happen, it was still exiting.\\"Samantha, you can't walk into a room of six people without insulting five of them.\\" Logan said this and this motivated Samantha to take Logan's bet. Samantha decided to only change her attitude for only the campaign. While she is campaigning, she realizes that people would like her more if she were nicer to them and if she wouldn't insult them.\\"You've changed, Samantha, and so have I. I think it's a good change, don't you?\\" I think this quote is important because it shows that Samantha has grown up from being stuck up to being nice, friendly, and kind. This shows that she has matured a lot.My favorite part of this book was the times when Samantha was about to insult someone, but Logan was always around somewhere waiting for her to insult someone. It was thrilling to see if Samantha would win the bet and whether she would be \\"able to live\\" without insulting people."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"This is a very very good book. I would have to say this is my favorite book. This story starts out as Samantha gets her SAT scores, and they turn out not so good. She recieves a very low score on the tests. In order to get into a good college she has to get some more credits. A class election comes up, and Samantha decides to run for the class president. Logan sees how much Samantha and her friends criticize everyone, so he makes a bet with Sam. Samantha has to go two weeks without criticizing someone or she will have to go out with a very unpopular guy named Doug, and if Samantha wins, Logan has to take Sam on a date of her choice. Little does Logan know, that Sam istrying her hardest to win the bet so she can go to prom with her crush Logan. Will Samantha or Logan win the bet?Ever since I read the back of this book, it caught my attention. In this book you will find out everything that happens in a teen's life. This book includes everything from boys to school. I like this book because it taught me a lot how I shouldn't talk about other people, because it really hurts their feelings. It also taught me to not judge a person by how they look or who they hang out with, and that the only thing that counts it what is on the inside. This book inspired me, will it inpire you?"},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"This book was a very fun book. The book is written in first person and the author Janette Rallison, really gets into the mind of teenage girl such as myself.

All's Fair in Love, War and High Schoolia a hilarious book! Samantha is a popular girl who gets into a bet with her ex-boyfriend Logan about not insulting anyone for 2 weeks, which she really doesn't want to lose beacause if she loses, she has to go out with a guy who Quote: \\"and he let out a cross between a yodel and a gorilla being strangled.\\". Quote: \\"Samantha, you couldn't walk into a room of 6 people without insulting 5 of them.\\" As they say, All's Fair in Love, War and High School."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"Jannette Rallison's \\"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School\\" lives up to its title, and rises above the usual predictable teen romance. Head cheerleader Samantha Taylor has the looks to attract just about any guy, but can't hold onto any of them beyond six weeks. Seems Samantha has a problem...she can't bite her tongue, and her acid insults have driven away boyfriends, best friends, you name it. When she scores a composite 810 on the SAT, it rocks her perfect world. Determined to go to college, rather than flip burgers for a living, she decides to run for class president. Samantha is a completely believable character, and it is fun to watch her change her shallow self little by little. I didn't want the book to end!"},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"\\"All's Fair in Love,war, and High School\\" is a wonderful book!It all starts out when Samantha gets a low SAT score. She figured that her scores were to low to get into a good college, so she decides to run for class president hoping that it would look good in her colledge applications, after Logan said that he got accepted into one of thecolleges because he had \\"leadership qualities.\\"When Samantha told Logan that she was deciding to run for president and needed someone to help her make the campiens, Logan laughs and says,\\" Samantha, you can't walk into a room of six people withoutinsulting five of them.\\" So Samantha makes a bet with Logan that shecould go a week without insulting anyone, but it turns out to be harderthan it seems.This book is a wonderful book, I recommend it to people who enjoya good novel. It deals with clique programs and if you try really hard,you might be able to achieve what you want.I think \\"All's Fair in Love,War,and Highschool\\" is a book that many people can relate to.-C.P."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"(All's Fair in Love, War, and High School)By Janette RallisonN.LeePeriod threeA teenage-level book for girls called All's Fair in Love, War, and High School is about a girl named Samantha. This teenager wants to run as class president, but there is a bet. Her friend, Logan, bet she would insult anyone for two weeks or else she would go to the prom with Doug, someone she doesn't really like. There are some problems on the way like someone wanting to cheat in the election, and Samantha worrying about her social life. Can she handle it?There are some things I like about the book. Samantha is around my age but a little older. This book is more about a typical teenager life which includes voting, dating, friends, and of course boys. Learning how a teenager would react to certain events and knowing how a girl feels like jealously, anger, guilty, and excited can be really interesting if you are more like me. If you are a person who likes to read about proms, how girls usually think about guys in the future, and teenage life, then this is a perfect book.On the other hand, there were some things I disliked. I really don't know what life is like when fifteen or sixteen years old and that was what I was looking for. The author paid a lot of attention on running for president. There were not very many characters to meet and the kids I had read about were just a few of Samantha's friends, Logan, Doug, and Josh. This author wrote too much about Samantha. The book doesn't really give many details about how school works. I would rather know what my life in the future will be like as a teenager.My favorite and least favorite parts are related to choosing a boyfriend and cheating. My favorite event in the story was in the prom, she chose to be with Logan instead of her crush, Josh, because Samantha likes Logan for who he is. I dislike the part when someone cheated by putting out flyers about her test score. She was so in embarrassed and very angry, and I would fell that way, too. The book had many things I liked and disliked and also very good and bad events, too. This was what I thought about the book."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"I read this book a week ago. I loved it! I'm 14 and I'll be a freshman next year. Samantha, the junior in high school girl in the book, had it pretty hard in the very beggining. Even throughout the book she was so unlucky things just kept disagreeing with her. The author also turns things around in the end and even though things don't necessarily end up her way, she makes new friends and finds out that some of her bad thoughts that she had about people were completely wrong.I hope that when I'm a freshman, I don't have it nearly as bad as she did. I would recommend this book to kids in middle school and freshmen. Even though some of it is repeditive, some parts are more interesting than not."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"She's brash, self-centered, totally hot, and completely obsessed with the implosion of her universe because of what she thinks others think of her. Therein lies the heart of this story. Would Samantha be so hypercritical of everyone else if she realized her potential to be so extraordinary? As Rallison writes it, so Samantha realizes it, but not without a few bittersweet lessons along the way.This is the story of a girl who, despite a high self concept, suddenly realizes she is typical and even a lesser mortal than many of her peers. She discovers she isn't as smart as she thought she was when she takes the SAT and scores miserably low. Then, to top it all off, college entrance applications seem to demand a higher profile and lofty character traits that Samantha is conviced she has mastered. The problem is that she has no real proof of her expert qualities other than her cheerleading. So she enters the student council elections in a campaign to prove she has the right stuff, and to polish off her resume. So what if she has to reveal a little trash on her opponents? A little gossip couldn't hurt much could it? Samantha's strategy isn't without flaws.I loved Samantha's personality. She is exactly the kind of girl I secretly admire, but go out of my way to avoid. She is confident, a trait that is appealing in many characters. Samantha's confidence is daring and sophisticated though, making her almost clandestine in pride.Samantha is also obsessed. Her ego drives her to chide an exboyfriend, and belittle a potential best friend. Soon she discovers that her ego is self inflated and learns that she must let the air out every once in a while if she expects to be accepted by the populus.Samantha is sincere. In fact, her brutal honesty about companions as well as opponents constitutes her real flaw. She is so honest and sincere that her ability to freely gossip almost spoils her only true friends and threatens to destroy her image and reputation. She frantically struggles to recover from her own undoing. Fortunately in the end, the bitter pill she must swallow leaves her character sweeter and more loveable than when we first meet her on page one.I really loved this book. I have only read it once, but enjoyed it enough to read it again. Actually, with so many books in my To Be Read Pile, I will probably keep this for a while before I read it again. I will however pick up a copy of any of Rallison's other books. She did a fantastic job here, and I thirst for more."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"At first I was a bit put off by the title, All's Fair in Love, War, and High School. Although it's clever, i immediately labeled it as a shallow teen book without substance (sorry). but it completely surprised me! i couldnt seem to stop reading and i finished it in one sitting...the plot was good, if predictable (but in a way that made it completely satisfying in the end) and i love how the main character, Samantha, changes from the shallow, critical, but ultimately well-intentioned popular girl that she was in the beginning. and the romance was perfectly executed.Anyway, the story is about a junior in high school named samantha who just finds out she bombed the SAT, is dumped by her boyfriend, and decides to run for class president (to look good on her high sschool transcript). she makes a bet with this guy she works with (and dated in 8th grade),logan, that she could survive two weeks without insulting anyone. the course of the story is basically about those two weeks and lots of events surrounding it. i would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"All&#65533;s Fair In Love,War, and High SchoolBy Janette RallisonISBN: 0802788742Walker & Co., 2003, 183 pp, $11.87Samantha Taylor is the very image of perfection. She&#65533;s smart, pretty, talented, and nice to everyone she sees. NOT! In fact, Samantha is the very opposite. Though she is pretty, she got an 810 on the SAT&#65533;s, criticizes almost everyone who walks by her, and the only two things she is good at is seducing guys, and being head cheerleader. \\"Everyone who&#65533;s hung out with Samantha knows that she can&#65533;t go into a room with six people without insulting five of them.\\"So her ex-boyfriend Logan places a bet that she can&#65533;t go two weeks without insulting someone. So she now has the burden of that bet on her shoulders. The hot brother of her mean and snotty, rival, Elise is coming back from college, her friend betrays her, and on top of all that, she&#65533;s running for school president to put &#65533;Leadership&#65533; on her college application.&#65533;All&#65533;s Fair In Love, War, And High school&#65533; is a story filled with responsibility, popularity, and determination. Almost every girl can relate to the main character, and has had experiences like Samantha&#65533;s happen to them. I could relate to this book very well. It is a story that is guaranteed to reel you in and never let you stop turning the pages. The book is written in first person and the author Janette Rallison, really gets into the mind of teenage girl such as myself. This book has comedy, romance, and the thoughts of teenage girl Samantha Taylor."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"Have you ever felt like the cheerleader always had it all, she was beautiful, smart and got any guy she wanted? Well this story will prove that theory wrong. This is about cheerleader Samantha who bombs her SAT's, then decides to run for class president so she could have something worthy on her college application, all while trying to snag a prom date!I love how Janette Rallison can bring the reader to right in to the story so you actually feel like you're back in high school all over again. I never cared for high school that much and this story just reminded me of that! I hated the way Samantha and her friends talked badly about everybody but I loved how Rallison used this story to draw attention to bullying and by giving us an ending to love! She has a gift for writing clean, fun, and inspirational books for teens but there are just so good that an adult like me can really enjoy them. I love to read her books to cheer me up and give me a laugh."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"On the outside, it seems like Samantha has it all: She's on the cheerleading squad, she's popular, has a cute boyfriend ready to take her to prom, and her acid tongue makes her queen bee in her clique. All that comes crashing down in the first few chapters as first Samantha's boyfriend dumps her and then she gets back her horrible SAT scores. With a dateless prom and a college-less future looming on the horizon, Samantha determines the only thing she can do to salvage the situation is find a new boyfriend (her former friend's ex looks appealing) and run for student body president (looks good on college applications). As if this weren't enough of a challenge, Samantha's cute co-worker Logan ups the ante by betting that she can't go two weeks without insulting anyone.What follows is a hilarious, cringe-inducing romp through those two weeks as Samantha struggles to meet her goals and ends up learning more about herself than she bargained for. Despite her bossiness and cruel one-liners, Samantha is a likeable character. Though she is mean, you get the impression that she doesn't actually intended to be cruel. Whereas many mean girls in books seem to thrive on hurting others, Samantha seems to relish honesty and simply doesn't consider the feelings of others. As she ponders her situation, she begins to realize where she'd been going wrong and seems to be genuinely sorry for her behavior. Samantha is a very different character by the end of the book.The cover, title, and description of this book all led me to think this was going to be light and funny romance. It is exactly that, but it is also more. Rallison makes good points and hits on important issues of self-esteem, trust, friendship, and dating without ever coming across as preachy. Ultimately, this is a feel good book that I whole-heartedly recommend."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"I am a junior high teacher who tries not to censor the books I put in my classroom too much. But when one comes along, like All's Fair in Love, War, and High School, that doesn't have to be censored, I am so thrilled! Rallison weaves a believable, engaging story about popular, but shallow Samantha, as she copes with different problems and grows as a person. Teen girls will relate to Samantha's constant juggling act of school, boys, friends, family, and social events. Also, Samantha realizes that her friendships basically consist of cutting others down. She copes with her friends ostracizing her as she tries to change this. Rallison keeps the whole thing funny and light-hearted while hitting on some important ideas of self-esteem, and actually keeping the content of the story PG! I highly recommend it! My junior high girls are loving it, too!"},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"This is one of my favorite stories by Janette Rallison. I reread it almost every year. I'm not sure why the character Samantha calls to me but I really enjoy her trials. You think, she's popular and a cheerleader so she must have it all, so why do I care about her? But you do care about her and want her to succeed. She bombs the SAT and the only way to make it to college is to \\"beef up\\" her resume and run for student body president. I love the bet she makes with Logan that she wont say anything bad about people for two weeks. (That is really hard to do, have you tried it?) She is not perfect and makes a fool of herself plenty. But you appreciate her trying to better herself and in the end you want only great things for her. Samantha struggles with who her true friends are; finding true love isn't where you'd think; and doing the right thing is harder than it seems."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"While I've long been out of high school, this book brought it all back. Samantha is likeable, and it's fun watching her grow and change through the book as she struggles to go 2 weeks without insulting anyone. There is lots of humor and a sweet romance, what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"I am a huge fan of Janette Rallison, and this book did not disappoint me. The story wasn't anything overly special, just a girl trying to win the class presidency while not insulting anyone for two weeks, but Rallison's writing was catchy and witty. I was instantly pulled in and loved all the characters. I loved the personal journey that the main character goes on throughout the story."},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love, War, and High School","review":"I remember reading this book when I was in middle school. And I remember thinking how this is probably going to be another book about a cheerleader who is so use to getting anything she wants and when she doesn't get what she wants, all hell breaks loose. Well, I was kind of right. And I was kind of wrong. Samantha is not your typical rah-rah, perky cheerleader. She is the perfect blend of sugar and spice and everything nice. She discovers that her ego is getting in her way. The author did a fantastic job telling a story and getting kids to realize that not everything centers around them."},{"Title":"History of English Speaking People","review":"I have read and interviewed 86 authors (of every genre possible) for our Library radio station WYPL here in Memphis since the inception of our 'Book Talk' program in 1993. Unfortunately it was never my good fortune to know or talk to Prime Minister Churchill. I first read \\"The History of The English Speaking Peoples\\" as a young man shortly after WWII. The physical reading of this monumental work is an excercise in sheer pleasure as you are dealing with not only a word merchant without peer but one of the greatest intellects of the twentieth century. If you want to see your English Language used at its most agreeable consonance, but straight to the point like a rapier, then understand that Churchill is probably the best example we have had since the Bard. Churchill hadn't the time to do the background research for the four volumes so his staff did it for him. They gave him their notes daily and this amazing man dictated every word to his secretary. If you write, as I do, you understand this MO as a nearly impossible feat -- and in view of the quality of his thougthts and his writing -- a stupendous task. Originally a set of four (and very expensive now if you were fortunate enough to find them) they have now been combined into one large book which you still have trouble finding. I bought this one for my nephew as a result of a conversation he and I had had about the 'package' of 'rights' that each of us here in the United States enjoys as (we think) our entitlement. In the first three hundred pages alone Mr. Churchill traces back, in lucid, electric prose, the history of British Common law for nearly two thousand years and shows us how that protective mantel was drawn over us thread by thread, piece by piece and step by step. The rest of the book is full of the cultural protein of the politics of time -- but I warn you, you must be careful reading this work. Mr. Churchill is addictive and he has about twenty thousand other pages out there just as meaty.

I was hoping for more information about how unit experience affects performance, why certain units cannot effectively battle other units (like Verunan war ships vs. Sky Knights), and other fine points of strategy and game design.The book does include strategy pointers for multi-player campaigns and computer opponents; and the book is very well-written, laid out, and easy-to-read.

McMahon, M.S.Electronic Publishing SpecialistAmerican Mathematical SocietyAs we plunge deeper into the era of electronic resources, librarians and information professionals are increasingly faced with new technologies and a growing sophistication among users. An ever expanding body of research in the field of Library Science is aimed at reviewing the usefulness of emerging technologies, deciding how best to employ these new products and determining the contours of user behavior.This book presents in monographic form, articles that appeared in issue number sixty of The Reference Librarian. The work is divided into four sections: Use and Users: Some Theories; Internet: Organization and Searching; Geographic Information Systems; and Managing Electronic Resources.Palmquist's and Kim's article comprise the book's first chapter on user behavior. This article reviews cognitive models of users and discusses methodologies for examining information seeking behaviors (5). The article's section on cognitive modeling will be interesting to those developing interfaces for software or web sites.The second chapter deals with the Internet and leads with Hsieh-Yee's article. The author presents a study designed to measure the effectiveness of eight major search engines. This investigation called for products to retrieve relevant answers to twenty-one reference questions and five subject area questions (27). The author presents strengths and weaknesses of each product. The study draws conclusions about the effectiveness of search engine use in reference and calls for further research on the topic. Palmquist and Sokoll add depth to this section with their fascinating article on the arrangement and organization of the Internet. The authors examine some techniques for mapping the content found on the Internet (49). The article also discusses the Self Organizing Mapping (SOM) technique and points to sites that employ this tool. Hsieh-Yee's second offering for this book rounds out this chapter with a continuation of her previous study on search engines.Chapter three reviews Geographic Information Systems, their implications and challenges for libraries. Yu discusses the concepts and functions of GIS and compares the use of GIS with library map collections (87). The article describes areas where GIS can assist in decision making such as in the case of predicting consequences under certain conditions like floods or population growth (91).The final chapter addresses management of electronic resources. Papandrea explores the complexities electronic technologies bring to reference services. The article introduces the Competing Values Framework of organizational effectiveness and reviews its implications for reference management (112). The book closes with an article by Subramanian reviewing academic user attitudes towards the format of indexes and other library materials. The article explores these \\"preconceived views\\" and their impact on the delivery of reference services (127).This book pulls together disparate materials that discuss technologies and user behaviors that impact libraries. While each article provides the reader with insight into developing technological trends, the book does suffer from several problems. The editor presents the reader with an uninspiring and uninformative introduction that does nothing to whet the readers appetite for the work. In reading about issues that impact the delivery of library services, the reader expects the editor to provide a detailed accounting of the articles to follow and information about their importance.The work would also have benefited from a more narrowly defined focus with deeper coverage of the selected topics. The chapter on user behavior points out a tremendous potential for future research. In fact, each article in this book represents an interesting topic that warrants deeper analysis. As a journal issue, the diversity of these works adds value to the literature. As a monograph, the work is too unfocused and its content far too shallow...."},{"Title":"MCSD: Visual Basic 6 Distributed Applications Study Guide","review":"This book has too many obvious errors.

Volume 3","review":"This is a perfect example why I'm not too keen on collected essay style works - they are typically cumbersome, poorly managed & arranged and bob and sway more than a roller coaster at Disney World. I love Paramahansa Yogananda, without any equivocation, I think he was as close to God as one can get and still be in body (same for Ammachi) but - this book of collected talks was as discursive as never I have seen from this Master. Usually when Sri Yogananda speaks through the pen, he has my rapt attention, I hang on every word. Not so with this book, in fact I even feel asleep during one sitting!!Mind you this was not a bad book, it is just not what I have come to expect from my beloved Sri Yogananda. A word of caution: if you are new to Paramahansaji's works, this is not, in my opinion a good place to start. 3 stars today."},{"Title":"Journey to Self-Realization - Collected Talks and Essays.

Volume 3","review":"This is part of an anthology of collected talks by the beloved Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, which includes, The Divine Romance, Man's Eternal Quest and Journey to Self-Realization. They are beyond review. They are what I keep in my own nightstand and what I open during times of trouble. They are what I travel with and what I share with others when authentic spiritual guidance is sought.These timeless teachings are practical, but wholly genuine. Dear Paramahansa Yogananda is forthright, but loving. He is is eloquent but charming. His grace comes to life in the pages of all three of these treasures. The reader will get out of it what he came for; for any plight, the casual reader can blindly open up to any page and find solace, or encouragement to drop the self-sabotaging bad habits that keep us from the peace and joy we have a right to; the true seeker, whose genuine yearning of the heart will have brought him to these teachings, will find the way to Self-Realization.

Volume 3","review":"There can never be an meaningful summary of such an expansive collection of spiritual talks. &quot;Journey&quot; has 44 chapters, but truly hundreds of topics are covered, elucidating the complex puzzles of spiritual and material realms as they interact. Practical guidance for beginners and advanced students alike intermingle with revelatory explanations of the working of the Cosmos and of its Creator. The ordering is not that of an encyclopedia because it is a collection of talks given for different reasons on different occasions - the ordering may well be called divine.An intellectual may scoff at the idea of divine illumination of any speaker, but monastics who used to accompany Yogananda on his lecture circuits have described how the process expressed itself. Given a particular topic for the day's presentation, Yogananda's introduction would usually begin logically enough; but throughout the lecture seemingly unrelated issues would usually pop up, commence a digression, be tied back in with the main theme, and the main theme resume. Afterwards, the monastic would not infrequently hear from audience members how they thought that they came to hear about the title-subject of the talk but were astonished to hear needed comforting/guiding paragraphs inserted that addressed some unspoken distress or dilemma in their lives.If you are open to seeing how the Divine can work in your life, just hold your question or need in mind for a few moments; then, in good faith, open the volume at seeming random and read a few pages. There is such wisdom and attunement with the Creator in these pages that it is scarcely possible not to benefit. If you try this experiment and can't see that there is a relation to what you think is your need... please be patient: meditate and still the mind from its anxieties; the relevance of the yoga master's inspiration will almost always become clear. If you come from a skeptical or scientific-linear background such as mine, it may take some time to ask with real, sincere surrender of the heart (not an attitude encouraged in our materialist/intellectualist culture). But with developing relaxation, concentration, and the gradual opening of the heart one can learn to... ASK. And will as a result... RECEIVE.May I share a few samples of the wise comfort from this volume?&quot;I believe you can destroy any karma you want to. ... God as the master of this universe has no karma; if you KNOW that you are one with God, there can be no karma for you.&quot; (p. 232)&quot;In reacting to life, most people either say, 'Praise the Lord,' or urge us to be afraid of Him... I think this is very foolish. What can you say to God that will be praise? He is not moved by flattery ...it will not make any difference to Him. But it will make a difference in you. Praise Him - or better still, LOVE Him - and you will feel better.&quot; (p. 39)&quot;Even when you do not have the opportunity to meditate long or deeply, always think that you are working for God. When your mind can remain anchored in Him, you will not suffer any more; no amount of disease or illness will be able to touch you inwardly.&quot; (p. 37)Perhaps it will be helpful for the new reader to be reassured that although Yogananda often talks about the immense benefits to be reaped once you have mastered spiritual pinnacles (e.g., from above examples: &quot;if you know that you are one with God&quot; or &quot;love Him&quot; or &quot;When your mind can remain anchored in Him&quot;), you don't have to wait until you reach mastership to get benefits. Although my experience does not allow me yet to confirm the blessings that come with full &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;anchoring&quot; -- I can testify that the more I practice and move toward these ideals, the greater the blessings I receive. From the methods that Yogananda offers in these talks and in his other publications I have RECEIVED far more than I dared ASK for. I wish the same for you."},{"Title":"Journey to Self-Realization - Collected Talks and Essays. Volume 3","review":"This is the last book of Yogananda's trilogy.

They are very user-friendly for everyone. I know the head of the Self-Realiaztion Fellowship's Publishing Department. Brahmachari Fred. He's a wonderful gent. But I hope he doesn't get angry at me. If you are new to Yogananda's teachings, go it slow with this book. Take it in &quot;nibbles&quot;. The first book is the softest. It aims at LIVING. The second is a bet harder. It aims at DEATH. This one aims directly at YOU! No punches are pulled. It's like the preliminary book to becoming a Self-Realizationist. Yogananda socks it to you. There. I said it. He is telling you what to do in order to get to God. It is interesting reading. I think it just might scare off some people who have not read and studied the other two books. Even in dietetics, he gets rough here. Same thing really. Just more detailed and descriptive. Much more direct. Beyond direct. If you have never read Yogananda's works, start with &quot;Man's Eternal Quest&quot;. This book, &quot;Journey to Self- Realization&quot; is my favorite.

And those who worked loyally and sincerely with this Master gained great spiritual growth, and every other good thing that the Master represented.The training was such that one can see the great differences in all disciples trained by him, they are never copies of, but had their individual potentials beautifully enhanced.The master's life shows us what Jesus Christ was really like and the means to become as they are.In cults one must loose individuality, creativity, & personal possessions are all given to the evangelist cult founder.In The tradition of yoga that Yogananda perpetuated, dealings with others were fair and reasonable, he taught not as an overlord but by example and compassion.Which one experiences just reading his inspiring spiritual expressions of love and life and the way.The results speak for themselves.

(I've since acquired a hardcover version privately published by the family of the late author.)It holds up amazingly well, considering it's over fifty years old. If anything, the trivializing of the political process and the credulous nature of the voting public is worse now.The protagonist is a wily adman contriving to get his well-meaning doltish candidate elected instead of the oppsing dimwit candidate. The ingenious plot careens through twists and turns and gaffes of the candidate, whose fate ultimately depends on one brilliant dyspeptic and dipsomaniac copywriter.There are differences now. No ad agency has handled a presidential campaign for over forty years, partly because they'd irritate half their employees, but also because they might have to wait a long time to get paid.Moreover, these days political campaigns are so infested by consultants, pollsters, advisors, and assorted pettifoggers that it's almost impossible to get any single-minded or intelligent campaign approved.The late Hal Riney's \\"bear\\" commercial for Reagan in 1984 was the last celebrated commercial ever done for a candidate.

Noyed is the third volume in the \\"Alphabet Friends\\" series, which devotes one 24-page volume to each letter of the alphabet. The idea is to give beginning readers a fun way of mastering letter recognition by telling an entertaining story highlighting a single letter. In \\"Carmen and the Letter C\\" we meet a young girl who lives in a cabin out in the country where there are a lot of things that start with the letter \\"c.\\" Throughout the book words with the featured letter are highlighted, with miniature color illustrations above important words in the text (rebus drawings of city, corn, cows, etc.), and color photographs. The goal is for these read-to books to become stories that younger children can read for themselves and this simple, solid approach should help big time.The first thing young readers learn is the difference between the capital letter \\"C\\" and the lowercase letter \\"c.\\" Children are also introduced to the two different sounds made by the letter \\"c,\\" both the hard sound in the word \\"cat\\" and the soft sound like in the word \\"city.\\" After the story, in which Carmen's cousin from the city comes to visit the cabin in the country, there are Fun Facts and a calf, corn, and cows. Young readers will also find suggestions for books on those same topics appropriate to their reading level. Because the letter \\"c\\" is not highlighted every time it appears in a word, young readers will be able to look through \\"Carmen and the Letter C\\" to find other examples. In doing so, they should learn to be able to read this book for themselves."},{"Title":"Feasts of the Old Testament: Their Historic, Christian and Prophetic Significance (Creation Worldview Ministries, Study Guide)","review":"This so-called doctor (his degree is from an unaccredited bible school) takes Jewish rituals and attempts to interpret them in a Christian perspective. However, he skews and misappropriates Jewish material to make it appear that is supports a Christian worldview, and a fundamentalist one at that. Pathetic and insensitive and just the sort of tripe one sees all-too-often among pseudo-preachers of this ilk. He'd do better to get educated about Judaism and read the Talmud--even better yet, he ought to leave Judaism alone and let the Rabbis do the interpreting in the light of their own faith."},{"Title":"A+ Certification Test Yourself Practice Exams","review":"On the plus side, there are 1,052 questions in the text. They're also harder then the actual A+ exam questions, in that they use the 'choose all that apply' multiple choice format. You really need to know your stuff to do well on these questions.On the minus side, the answers are often plain flat Wrong! And this is compounded by explanations that have obviously been dreamt up on the spot by the authors, who apparently would prefer to resort to BS and bafflegab then pause to look up the correct answer. An example: the questions insist that the location of an IDE drive on the cable is crucial to determining whether or not a drive is a slave or master, while the master/slave/carrier select pins are not important. In fact, the M/S/CS pins are all important, and the location of the hard drive on an IDE cable has no bearing on whether its a master or slave. (Only floppies are arranged in this manner). Another example: the book insists that SRAM (static ram) uses less power then DRAM (dynamic ram), because SRAM contains 6 capacitors which need to be charged much less frequently. In fact, SRAM contains 6 transistors, and NO capacitors. Although horribly expensive, it is unbelievably fast, which is why SRAM is used in L1 and L2 caching. That is the primary advantage of SRAM. Yet, the book would have you believe that the primary use for SRAM is in low power applications.These were only two examples, drawn from the first 72. I expect that there are many more.Nonetheless, you CAN profit from this book. The way to do it is answer all the questions. When the book agrees with you, you're right; when you don't know the answer to a question, well, you've targetted an area you need to study more thoroughly; and when the book disagrees with you, check your sources, make sure you're right, and curse those authors and publishers who allow such misleading material to reach the trusting public.Under NO circumstances should you use this book as a study guide; under NO circumstances should you trust these answers.

Though my trip was a little shorter in length and a lot shorter in duration, I can definitely identify with Heat-Moon's efforts at self-discovery on the back roads of America. The most interesting aspect of this book is Heat-Moon's use of his Indian heritage and frame of mind while interpreting the various persons and regional cultures he comes across. Christians may object to his criticisms of certain religious tenets, especially when he freeloads off some devout Christians for food and lodging a few times during the trip. Also beware of Heat-Moon's habit of quoting Walt Whitman practically every five pages, while he spends far too much space on certain people and places. But otherwise we have a highly compelling travelogue of the backwaters and isolated small town denizens of unknown America, as well as many insights into the soul of the writer, and possibly the reader if he/she is so inclined. Also, the journey described took place back in 1978, and while certain descriptions and narratives are outdated, Heat-Moon was already lamenting the disintegration of America's small town charm by the fast-food/convenience subculture, which was just getting started at that time. Little did he know how much worse it would get! This book, along with the works of Kerouac and Steinbeck, belongs with the great American roadtrip classics."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least Heat Moon may be one of the greatest writers of our time.

The events that caused him to put his usual life on hold, and take up this oddyssey, will strike a responsive chord for many readers who have ever wanted to stop the world and step back in time.His experiences, the people he meets, the conversations they enjoy, make for an extraordinary insight into America.His writing sings in the way that the old story tellers did...weaving a web that captures and captivates you until you finish the book. And then you don't stop until you've read all of his books! (Wish he'd write some more).

Each year since, re-reading Blue Highways melts away the hibernation chill of winter by rekindled the fire of wanderlust and the need to eat some &quot;ho-made pie&quot; at a four-calendar cafe. My own &quot;blue highway&quot; pinacle was a memorable lunch with my college roommate during a two-lane cross-country trip where we found ourselves in a booth in a diner named Grandma's where the menu was what Grandma told us she had cooked for the day and we knew we had hit blue highway heaven when she scolded my friend, smacked his hand with a big wooden spoon and told him he couldn't have both potatoes and macaroni and cheese, that he had to eat a vegetable or she wouldn't let him have any pie for dessert. I caught her winking at the trucker at the counter, and he said that even though he hated vegetables himself, he had eaten them there every day for 20 years because Grandma's pies were worth it. He was right.Here's how Blue Highways reveals the secret to eating well on the road: &quot;There is one almost infallible way to find honest food at just prices in blue-highway America: count the wall calendars in a cafe.No calendar: Same as an interstate pit stop. One Calendar: Preprocessed food assembled in New Jersey. Two calendars: Only if fish trophies present. Three calendars: Can't miss on the farm-boy breakfasts. Four calendars: Try the ho-made pie too. Five calendars: Keep it under your hat, or they'll franchise.One time I found a six-calendar cafe in the Ozarks, which served fried chicken, peach pie, and chocolate malts, that left me searching for another ever since. I've never seen a seven-calendar place. But old-time travelers - road men in a day when cars had running boards and lunchroom windows said AIR COOLED in blue letters with icicles dripping from the tops - those travelers have told me the golden legends of seven-calendar cafes.&quot;No maps are needed to travel Blue Highways. Just make sure you eat your veggies and don't make Grandma smack you with that big wooden spoon of hers and enjoy your pie."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways is referred to by many as a \\"cult classic\\". If so, it's a shame this book is not better known. It is 1978 and William Least Heat-Moon is 38 years old. Upon the near-simultaneous loss of his college teaching job and his marriage, he needs to get out of town, to leave places of sadness, futility and routine, to clear his mind and renew his soul. William leaves Missouri driving a '75 Econoline that he also intends to live in for the next several months; the truck has been named \\"Ghost Dancing\\". He has determined that he will drive only the blue highways, the old map color for single-lane rural highways and county roads, the roads that lead to all the small places in America, lost and forgotten by time, faded in economic or historic significance. He will travel and look around and listen, meet new people and learn new things and new ways of thinking. Most of all he will think, taking an inward journey as well.Born of English-Irish and Osage ancestry, William Least Heat-Moon also has an Anglo name. He writes, \\"I have other names: Buck, once a slur...also Bill Trogdon.\\" He explains his Osage identity humbly: \\"My father calls himself Heat Moon, my elder brother Little Heat-Moon. I, coming last, am therefore Least. It has been a long lesson of a name to learn.\\" With that we begin.Experts categorize this book as \\"travel literature\\". It is a travel book, for William does travel 13,000 miles across the United States and briefly through Ontario. He describes places, converses with people, learns or reviews history. As may be expected, the places are common and strange, mundane and magical. Some are pleasing and peaceful; others evoke indignance in William, unpleasantness and judgment. Most of the people are kind, some of them are wise. Some are alive with vitality and hope, others ghosts or near ghosts. But they are all human still, and in some way each is a gift. And that's what makes Blue Highways worthwhile: it is also a philosophy book, filled with the humanity of the author and the people to whom he gives voice. He is old enough to understand and appreciate the people and places he encounters, young enough to feel wonder and room to grow.Two special voices live within William Least Heat-Moon's head and heart: Walt Whitman and Black Elk. Whitman, the poet traveler who has seen it all before, rides along to chuckle occasionally or illuminate an experience or thought. Black Elk offers gentle guidance and comfort; he is a steady hand.It is inevitable that William Least Heat-Moon makes his way home. And it is not surprising that along the way he discovers that he can - that he has - \\"remade\\" himself. Blue Highways is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"In Blue Highways, we get to share in William Least Heat-Moon's journey across America in a trip taken about 20 years ago. The trip was brought about by the demise of his marriage and the loss of his job. In an effort to reconnect with himself and his fellow Americans, Heat-Moon embarks on a journey without a schedule or destination. He seeks to just go, meet people, and see what happens. And here is the real strength of this book: Heat-Moon does an incredible job of capturing the essence of the people he encounters along the way. By sticking to the back roads (blue highways), he meets average, ordinary people and isn't shy about striking up conversations with them. As he discovers, people are pretty much the same anywhere: most like to talk about themselves, many have an interesting story or two, and everyone's looking to connect with someone/something.I found this book to be quite an enjoyable journey. Even though sections of it are somewhat dated, the essence of the trip still rings true. For someone looking for a humorous travel narrative similar to Bill Bryson, you may need to keep looking. While there are humorous sections to this story, this tends to be much more introspective than anything Bryson writes.I guess ultimately this book will appeal to those of us who would love to be able just to pack up the car, fill the gas tank, and take off wherever the road may lead. I know I had my atlas next to me as I read this and traced virtually his entire journey on my map. What I wouldn't give to be able to do a 25-year follow-up and see what has changed (or what hasn't!). This is a great book to get your imagination going!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"In search of the real America, or in need of escape, the author sets out to circle the country in a van, staying only on the state and local roads - the one's that appear blue on his maps. This is the record of what he saw on his trip, from the deep South to the Pacific Northwest, fishermen to farmers, through forests, snowstorms, deserts, and beaches.This novel was deeply personal, and it reflected a feeling I have had in my life to explore the world by experiencing it first hand, not by reading about it in the book. However, sometimes the author seems overly sentimental, bemoaning the loss of regional distinctiveness and lambasting the homogenization of America while not always acknowledging that sometimes changes happen for the better. America has always been a country of change, and he realizes that change is always accompanied by a little bit of pain.As he travels, the philosophizing is not overly explicit. Neither are his personal problems, which are alluded to but not expounded upon. Instead, he lets the people he meets and his experiences with them speak for themselves. Unfortunately, there is nothing very cohesive about the stories, no incentive to get to the end except to see the author's cycle completed. Perhaps a second reading would allow me to pay more attention to the author's personal struggle, but even so, the stories are basically independent, with only the underlying theme of coping with change to tie them together. Perhaps that was the authors' struggle all along."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I purchased this book at a point in my life where I was desiring escape, and the travelogue genre was obviously appealing.I have read it twice, and am reading it again, and cannot even hope to convey the warmth this book will give you. No matter what point you are at in your life, buy this book, you will not regret it.The author experiences a slice of life that we all wish we could, and his knowledge of the history of his route is astounding, and never presented in an intimidating fashion. He presents the people he meets as they are, and both he and us come away the better for it. Appreciating the simple pleasures in life is underrated, and this book cannot be overrated."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This was a very well written account that displayed the desire to seek out and experience. When tumultuous times occur in a person's life, the enlightened choose a way to positively confront it. Heat-Moon customized his van and made it a great travel &amp; living space to experience the people and places of America. Possessing a Doctorate, he wrote in a nice, simple, down-home style. He also spent a lot of time with nice, simple, down-home people across parts of the country most of us miss. Many of the conversations with the folks he'd encountered made me realize how we, in general, perceive the world and society, and how we like to give our &quot;ten cents&quot; (opinions) from time to time. After completing his journey with Ghost Dancing he worked on the book, while doing some laborious work. This was an insightful look at the real America most of us miss."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways by William Least Heat-Moon is a wonderfully written recollection of a cross-country adventure taken by the author. Armed only with his van (ghost dancing), his &quot;desperate sense of isolation&quot; and longing to leave his present situation, he sets out across the country traveling only on rural state and county roads, which are marked in blue on his old atlas (5). Heat-Moon describes an America, which travelers rarely see from the many interstates that now crisscross the country. His detailed account of the journey, and the many people he interacts with gives the reader insight into the character of the American people. He meets people of various backgrounds and culture, learning something from each, and describes the passing landscape painting a picture as clear as if the reader was sitting in the passengers seat. His journey begins and ends in his home state of Missouri, taking him in a circular path around the country. This circular journey &quot;represents the direction of natural forces&quot;, according to the Plains Indians (418). With each new route, and each new town Heat-Moon is able to capture the essence of the America not yet commercialized. He meets Bob Androit, who is restoring a nineteenth century log cabin. Heat-Moon envied the fact that Androit was &quot;rebuilding a past he could see and smell, one he could shape with his hands&quot; (14). He also meets Bill Hammond and his wife Rosemary, who are building a boat the author spied from the road. &quot;You'll walk off before I get tired of talking boats&quot; was Hammond's response once he realized Heat-Moon wanted to talk about the boat. Through the people he meets, the author gets a feel for the changes in character, attitude, and dialect, as he moves across the country and is able to present this well on paper. When asked where he is headed next by storeowner J.T. Watts, the author responds, &quot;I don't know&quot; to which Watts adds, &quot;cain't get lost then&quot; (35). This book is loaded with dialogue, which is the fabric of the journey, for without the stories of the characters he meets the book is simply a description of the changing landscape and the roads he travels. Heat-Moon's conversations with the many people he interacted with were not degrading and pompous, but were informative and witty. The author's ability to weave comedy and light hearted jabs into conversation with locals added a great deal to the readability of the book. He describes a gas station attendant as &quot;a surly fellow who could have raised mushrooms in the organic decay of his front teeth&quot; (243). Humorous reoccurring themes carry throughout the novel such as his rating system for diners in which the number of calendars hanging about determines the quality of the diner, and the newspaper headlines he envisions when in certain situations such as &quot;Drifter Blown Away In Bar&quot; during an evening spent in a Dime box, Texas bar (267). Heat-Moon is mostly a listener and an observer who lets the people tell their stories. Throughout the book are photographs of the people who Heat-Moon has had the most engaging conversations with. This adds reality to the journey, and is a reminder that these are real people, with true stories. Recounting his journey Heat-Moon says &quot; In my own country, I had gone out, had met, had shared. I had stood witness&quot; (406). Heat-Moon is able to recount his journey in such a creative way and take the reader with him."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"It was not an easy journey and it's not a quick read, but the interviews are great. Makes you wish you could spend more time with the people he meets. If you read the book a while ago, pick it up and read the May, 1999 Afterword. I bet you'll re-read the whole book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. It has taken me forever to read, and not because I was just savoring it. It's not a particularly long book, I could just only stand to read so much of it at a time. Least Heat Moon tells interesting stories and meets some fabulous people in this journey, but he tends to be long-winded.After losing his wife and his job, and figuring he has nothing holding him back, William Least Heat Moon turns his van into a somewhat camper and decides to just drive. As a unique point of his roadtrip, he doesn't take the more common roads and highways, but instead what he calls the \\"Blue Highways\\". Those roads that are in an old atlas marked in blue and not commonly used for travel anymore. He starts out in MO and makes a trek to the eastern shore, from there he heads south, and then West, eventually making a complete circle around the United States and ending back in MO. He enjoys most of his travels, although, like some of the other travel books I've read, he didn't have all pleasant experiences in the South. While he encounters racism in different parts of the United States, most of the ones he writes about are in this region.He meets some very interesting people and his stories of them were some of my favorite parts of the book. The shipbuilder, who over the years has been building his own boat for him and his wife to live on once its complete. The barber who gave him one of the best haircuts of his life. The traveling \\"missionary\\" who liked to hitchhike and was headed towards South America by way of Montana. There are several other characters, but these were the main ones that stood out to me. He also, thoughtfully, includes pictures of these individuals so we can picture who he's talking to.The other parts of the book are more of a \\"poetic\\" description of his feelings and what he is learning from this trip. This isn't a bad thing to have in a book really. But he tends to ramble on a bit in these sections and to me they weren't as relevant at times as I would have liked. I found myself losing interest when confronted with several of these chapters at a time and it probably explains why it took me so long to read this book.Least Heat Moon is a good writer. Everything is clear and richly descriptive. He just seems to like his words so much that he can't be as concise as most writers. When he's writing about other people he's excellent. Writing about himself is just a whole different style for him.I liked a good half of the book I would say. It's always interesting to read travelogues and I especially like it when author's focus on what they are seeing and who they are meeting, rather than their thoughts on how the trip is changing their life. In this book, I got half of each. I would recommend reading it, as he does have some interesting accounts in the book.Blue HighwaysCopyright 1983411 pages + map and afterwordReview by M. Reynard 2010"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways will encourage you to spend at least part of any extended road trip on the smaller, older roads, those routes printed in blue on state highway maps, hence the title. You may well be amazed at the sights to be seen, the history to be painlessly learned and fascinating people to be met by simply taking an exit off the interstate for an hour or so. This is my third copy, it will replace the one currently held together with rubberbands in the map compartment of my car. It serves as both travel guide and a great passenger seat read in any vehicle!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Critics have called it \\"a trip that must be taken\\", \\"a splendid book\\", and \\"a true delight on every page\\". Adjectives, verbs, nouns: these are the parts of speech and the speech of parts that Least Heat-Moon has shaped into the most exciting and widely read travel log of our time: Blue Highways. What are blue highways exactly? As explained on page one of the book that bears their name, blue highways are those little roads on a map, colored in blue, that are only there \\"because some cartographer had a blank space to fill\\". You can find them all over America, each one more interesting than the next, each one with its own little story to tell.The fact that Least Heat-Moon has done this: completed a whole year of adventure traveling these roads, roads forgotten by everyone else in the known universe except by those who live there, is in itself a remarkable thing. The wonder goes further, however, because not only did Least Heat-Moon travel these roads, he wrote about them, and more specifically, he wrote about the people who lived on them. The idea of grabbing at the wind like this, and allowing it and your instinct alone to tell you where to go is a somehow satisfying concept. Isn't it though? Don't all humans, at some point in their lives, have the urge to get up and get away; to travel; to let the road less traveled pull them into the distance; to seek out the blue highways of the world? I think so, which is what makes Blue Highways such an intriguing book.People are always hungry for new ideas, new observations, a new sense of direction in our sometimes senseless and oftentimes rather directionless society. They want to read about how people live in Nameless, Tennessee, what they do for a living in Whynot, Mississippi, and how the folks in Why, Arizona ever got the notion to name their town \\"Why\\". The allure of Blue Highways is strong, and the highways themselves will never lose their enchantment as long as there are people like William Least Heat-Moon who care enough to go looking for them.Why I dropped a star: The best parts of the novel are when Least Heat-Moon is coversing with and meeting new people in his travels. He is always searching for cafes, bars, taverns: whatever he can find where the natives might hang out. But in the sometimes long stretches between towns and accquantainces, the story's tone takes on a very lonely edge to it. Not that it's depressing, just slightly slow as far as \\"plot\\" goes. I loved the book; it was interesting- every bit- but some of those transition chapters were a bit difficult to traverse."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"In William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways, he tells his personal experience of his travels across the country. He feels his life is turned upside down and he needs to escape it. Taking his van, Ghost Dancing, for the ride, he has the adventure of a lifetime. He comes to points in his journey where life is more exciting than others, and places where the wind never blows. Overall, he meets several people on his way across the country and stays in several towns. He learns the variety of ways god is believed in, the history of flying, and the way that's several of the towns he visits was started. If you like to read about other peoples travels, than I suggest this book to you. It will be hard to find at a local library, but it can be found. The author goes into detail on several different points and is very organized. He tells the story just as it seemed to happen and doesn't confuse the reader one bit. This story is very educational and leaves the reader with the want to travel the country, as did the author of this book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I first read Least Heat-Moon's book in the mid 1980s after returning from spending two years living in the United States. There is no other book that more evokes a conception of America than this work. It is America!Since reading Least Heat-Moon, I have delved into Kerouac (On the Road) and Steinbeck (Travels with Charley) but none of these books remotely compares with the imagery of Blue Highways. Indeed, just tapping the keys for this review makes me unsettled, wishing that I too could just travel those back roads soon along America's blue highways."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Over a decade ago, I read this book in college. The other day, while cleaning out the cellar, I stumbled upon this book, and guess what? I'm reading it again!! William Least Heat Moon does what every person only dreams. He sees America. Not the America filled with tourist traps, but the America filled with heart.

I have kept a copy nearby (bedside table, car) for 15 years and often open it to any page and begin reading when I want to center my thoughts, or lower my blood pressure.

The 7,000 mile backroads journey tells us about economic changes, working class views, regional character and culture, placenames, cafes, bars, geology, native American history and views, American history and one individual's level-headed view of life and people.The book is well-researched and well-written. It provides a sense of movement without being formulaic or boring. It shifts across many perspectives and topics. It is diverse without being random. The author is self-aware and exploring without being self-absorbed. He shares and comments but lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions.The book is engaging and colorful, but raises serious questions about how we live our lives. More than a travel guide or autobiography, it is a rare work of art delivering value on many levels."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is an excellent journal of a troubled man's attempt to try to figure out who he is by taking a solitary journey to meet real people and see real places in this country.

McGuane). After he loses his job and his marriage falls apart, Least Heat-Moon hits the road for a 3 month odyssey around the country (makes sense to me!). He equips his van for sleeping and cooking, takes 400 bucks and two books (Leaves of Grass & Black Elk Speaks) with him, and heads out for some clarity. His only agenda is to stay off the Interstates and seek out an America that is/has rapidly faded away.This book has some faint echoes of \\"Travels with Charley\\" and \\"On the Road\\"; yet the philosophical musings and colorful character profiles in these pages sets it far apart from any other similar travel book.Least Heat-Moon's wit is lean and engaging; his honest depictions of the people & places he encounters; and the manifold keen observations as he's driving down the back roads of this country, are the meat & potatoes of this wonderful book. He writes well and metaphorically; this is a good mix of the poetic & the philosophical.The voice of the storyteller is this man's gift to the rest of us. This is one of those first books that blows out of nowhere, grabbing you and not letting go until the last page has been digested. Least Heat-Moon's poetic descriptions of the landscapes he drives through mixed with the interior terrain he muses his way through blend together very well.This book registers very high on the reading enjoyment meter.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Having come from Heat-Moon's neck of the woods (Columbia, Mo.), I find it interesting that the best work of journalism to come from my alma mater is not from the much-prided &quot;J&quot; school, but from an English department faculty member.Heat-Moon takes an &quot;On The Road&quot; idea and turns it into something completely fresh and throroughly enjoyable. He has poured countless hours of research about where his travels took him, so ultimately, a reader can feel like he or she's been to the same place. That's power in writing.The journey was a noble one, and Heat-Moon blends politics, journalism, theology and history into a narrative that is at times touching, other times poignant, but always interesting. Reading this book 20 pages at a time during lunch breaks made for a great trip in my mind. And though now 20 years old, many of the things Heat-Moon touched upon are ever-pressing issues in our society today. If it's not timeless, the book is darn close.It much deserves the five stars I gave it, and it's a book I'll read again next year, this time armed with a pen so I can underline passages and make notes in the margins -- it's that useful and enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"After reading this book about a man's journey across our country, my husband and I were inspired to set out on our own across the U.S. journey and had only two rules: 1) No main highways and 2) we could see anything within a fifty mile radius of whichever &quot;blue&quot; highway we chose. It is in large part due to William least Heat-Moon that we were able to make our journey so memorable. We, too, wanted to pleasure in the people of this great country; the ordinary folks who are the heart of the nation and the reason for this nation.

At least let's hope so..."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I was forced to read this book as part of my english gifted and talented class. It was the slowest, longest, worst written book ever! The best part of the book was the end. It ended! Finally, a long book about nothing. I will NEVER read this book again and I DON'T encourage anyone else to read this. PLEASE save yourselves the boredom and stupidity that comes from this book. This guy has nothing better to do than go around in little boondocks in the US and force people to have conversations with him. It's irritating. It's boring. Please do yourselves some good and read cool books like Les Miserables, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, A tale of Two Cities, and other classics."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"(Make that star rating up there NEGATIVE 5 stars) I can't believe I'm actually taking the time to write this for such an awful book, but I read all of the other reviews here and I can't understand why everyone thinks this book is so incredible. I thought it was the most uninteresting, torturous book I have ever read. If this book is any indication of what Heat-Moon's personality and his English classes were like, I understand why he was laid off (and why his wife cheated on him!). 400-something pages of grueling, thick, unconnected text ruined my entire summer and destroyed any previous desire that I might have had to travel cross-country. I would not recommend this book to anyone; I think it should be destroyed."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways is proof that innocence can still be found within the borders of America, and its path is streaked in blue lines on your maps. Next time the nightly news gets you down, read an excerpt or two from this book, and you will be reassured that not only did a better time exist in America, but can perhaps still be found in the places to which Least-Heat Moon ventured. In Blue Highways, you will meet people who offer their beds, dinner tables and wisdom without expecting anything in return, you will meet Least-heat Moon's desire to find himself through the benevolence and experiences of other people, you will meet life in America they way it really was, the way it really is. Open this book, take the trip Least-heat moon took, you won't just meet other people, you will meet yourself."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Heat-Moon has done what many of us have only thought of doing--travel a large portion of the USA by road with no set agenda or time pressure. He shows a knack for seeking out interesting people who *are* the United States; many colours, many religions, many interests. Having lived for seven years in one of the towns he passed through and knowing the people he spoke with--and his account of them is quite believable--I'm inclined to believe as well that he represented the rest of the people and places honestly.I send copies of this book to penpals in other countries, as one of the easiest ways to explain my country's character."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"It took me two and half months two finish, but I enjoyed reading Blue Highways (for the most part). William Least Heat-Moon has a strong storyteller's voice (sometimes a little too strong) and his experiences in small town, backroad, no-name America are foreign enough to be interesting. I have a better idea of the history and the diversity of America from his regurgitation of local anecdotes, but I think if I lived in a blue-highways small town, I would be bored reading. In places, the narrative is self-concious and over-dramatic, like he's trying to describe a bowl of spaghetti to someone who has never tasted it -- spaghetti's my favorite food, but I have to be sitting over a bowl to appreciate it's greatness. Plus, I would have liked him to describe more of his feelings and talked less about road conditions. The feelings he did describe were so grounded in anti-urban ideology and strong I AM MAN convictions that I didn't relate to half of the book. Blue Highways alienated me as a city-dweller and as a woman, but I did enjoy the Whitman quotes and the parts about the monk, the hitchhiker evangelist, Selma Alabama, and the towns I've driven through myself (SHELBY, MT!)."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Heat-Moon lost his job in the late 70's while already separated from his wife. He had hit something close to rock bottom, and so immediately took off from the school that let him go and started on his journey of \`blue highways'. He just seemed to fall into the idea that it would be neat to travel around the country and see what is going on. I'm sure he was looking to find himself in the process.Blue highways are back-roads that used to be represented on maps as blue. He would go into towns like Why, Why Not, No Name, and talk to the folks there to see what was going on, what their lives were like, what they thought, and see what they were about. He was surprisingly able to get people to reveal themselves and to open up to him. I saw him interviewed about the book recently on the book channel, and saw him as unassuming, and a good listener. I doubt if he could have done this book otherwise.The book turned out to be very interesting at times, and a bit dragged-out at other times. I enjoyed the interviews more than anything else, but he often went into too much detail for me in describing the places he went to, the history, and the journey there.Some of the stories could be a modern paraphrasing of the Old Testament book of Ecclesiaties, where Solomon poetically describes the futility of life without God. No matter how great the pleasures or accomplishments, Solomon found that \\"all is vanity\\", and this book had some of that tone. There was that kind of undertone of loss in a lot of the interviews. People were disappointed that things in their community or personal lives had not turned out better. At the same time, it impressed me how specialized people are according to the region they live in, and simply according to themselves. (He must have had a recorder for some of the longer conversations that went on for several pages.) Peoples' personalities differed a lot depending on whether they were from a fishing area, a farm, a small city, the \\"pines\\", or wherever.He made it clear early on that he hated Christianity, partly because of the way Native Americans were treated by people calling themselves Christians. Nonetheless, the only person he \`liked very much' was a Seventh Day Adventist that he picked up as a hitchhiker in the last quarter of the book. He was a very interesting and upbeat character who had some very strange ideas, even for those of us who are Christian. He was my favorite character in the book.All in all, it was a good book that could have been just a little more concise."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"A little over twenty-five years ago William Trogden, who took the name of his Native American ancestors and called himself William Least Heat Moon, set out on a journey across America in what was basically the ancestor of the modern SUV, a small truck which he named Ghost Dancing.Initially he did this because he had lost his job and his wife in the space of a month, but his journey turned into much more than just an attempt to forget. It became a classic search for and journey into the heart of the country.This is not a trip into the weirdness of America, although Least Heat Moon encounters plenty of strange sites and people on his journey. It is more of a trip into the heart and soul of the country - figuratively as well as literally. There have been many books written over the years about people leaving home to find America, but even after twenty-five years this is still one of the best such books ever written.My only complaint is that he quotes Walt Whitman a little too much. I can understand his references to Black Elk, given his background and ancestry, but his overuse of Whitman is a bit jarring at times. But if you work around the Whitman quotes you will love your journey across America's blue highways with William Least Heat Moon."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"If you stop to think about it, this book and those like it really aren't about anything - just a person driving around the country because his relationship wasn't going well and he didn't have anything else to do. But for those of us who love to travel, doing it in person or vicariously through the words of a good travel writer is equally enjoyable, and Moon's anecdotes and experiences - the take he has on humanity - is ample reward for accompanying him on his wanderings."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Reading this book, made me want to get out and travel the Blue Highways myself, and I did. The book talks of traveling along unremarkable highways to unremarkable places, yet meeting remarkable Americans. The man found himself without a job, and other calamities in his life, yet decided to take a remarkable journey by himself. It's a good book to read and if you have the least liking to travel, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I absolutely loved this book from start to finish. Least Heat-Moon took all the backroads (except for a short distance on the interstate) around the country and spent many a page writing about the small-town diners along the way and the people inside them. The graphic descriptions of the landscape and the people combined make this book not just a travelogue but a piece of Americana of the late 1970s. This is one of my top-ten books of American travel.Least Heat-Moon is very descriptive of his characters. You can close your eyes and have a vision of the person described in the book, from the color of the shirt to the way the hair lies on the head. I'm sure the late-night note-taking every night was exhausting to write such a detailed journey of himself, his countryfolk and the countryside."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I heard Least Heat-Moon on NPR pitching River-Horse. To be honest, his name stuck in my head more than the interview. I ran across Blue Highways in a discount book store and said &quot;What the hey, for $4.00...&quot;The $4.00 was definitly well spent. I liked this book much more than I thought I would. Look, John Steinbeck is my favorite author but I remember trudging through Travels With Charlie back in high school. I was expecting the same reaction to Blue Highways. Nope, I enjoyed it much more. I suspect it's because I'm 20, no, make that 24 years older and the slower, insightful pace is more to my liking now. Maybe not. I guess I'll have to make another trip with John and the dog to find out."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I loved this book! And while I largely agree with the other customers reviewing this book, what differentiates this book from other &quot;journey&quot; books is Heat Moon's poetic prose.This author loves the language, and liberally uses simile and metaphor throughout. I have read and re-read this book many times, enjoying the way the author puts sentences together.Example (Pt 7 Ch 7) &quot;In a hotel room at the geographical center of North America, a neon sign blinking red through the cold curtains, I lay quietly like a small idea in a vacant mind.&quot;Or, from Pt 5, Ch 4: &quot;Dirty and hard, the morning light could have been old concrete.&quot; That resonates with me, because I can picture in my mind just what that morning light looks like -- and that's the crux of why I love this book: the visual imagery created from his language."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and I still have the original copy that I read back then. I just loved this book. In fact, I did a similar trip to Moon's, on a much smaller scale, and I even named my van &quot;Ghostdancing&quot; after his. It is a fun book and one in which the reader feels privileged to get a peek inside his spiritual journey. It is deeper than it first appears. I was touched by it."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I like both travel books and memoirs, well-written ones at least. Furthermore, I love long-distance driving (I find it therapeutic), and for years I have fantasized about taking an extended road trip around the United States. Thus, I am predisposed to liking BLUE HIGHWAYS. Alas, actually reading it proved to be somewhat of a slog. And this was my second attempt. My first was 25 years ago, shortly after buying the book (third printing of the hardback first edition); I managed to read only half of it back then. I now have more time for reading, so this time I made it through the book from cover to cover, although it took me two months of off-and-on reading.To my mind, BLUE HIGHWAYS is an okay but not special book (3.3 stars if such fine gradations were permitted). Hence, I am mildly puzzled that so many people have regarded it to be some sort of classic. The book does contain many vignettes or verbal snapshots of interesting out-of-the-way places and people, the sorts almost never spot-lighted by the mainstream media. Moreover, nostalgia for a simpler, less crowded, and perhaps more honorable America certainly is operative. And there are a few truly lyrical passages. But at other times, too many times, the book becomes tedious; occasionally Least-Heat Moon is a tad mean-spirited; often his philosophy is somewhat too sophomoric or New Age, at least for my taste; and in the main the writing itself is not especially inspired or distinguished. My guess is that what really moves many of those who profess to love it is the underlying context of the book -- being able to walk away from an unsatisfactory relationship, put conventional life on hold, and aimlessly roam about the U.S. with complete freedom to respond affirmatively to and explore further those people, places, and situations one likes, while quickly and easily leaving behind, without explanations or recriminations, those one doesn't like or has become tired of."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I finished Blue Highways approximately 2 weeks ago.Never having even heard of William Least Heat-Moon before, I purchased this book based on Amazon recommendations. My only reference point was that I enjoy travel books.Initially I was a little backed off by the sheer length, and I wondered if the author would be able to hold my attention. It was, therefore, with trepidation that I dipped into Blue Highways.I needn't have been concerned. Yes, the book was long (and occasionally I had to re-read a handful of really detailed paragraphs), but William Least Heat-Moon was able to transport me to many of the tiny towns he visited, and I could feel the often intense discomfort of living for a season in his trusted Goast Dancing. I have true respect for this gentleman! The photographs were a wonderful addition and it was nice to put faces to names.I agree that on occasion he was maybe a little overly critical of &quot;modern&quot; life, as some other reviewers have noted, but his opinion is simply own. I didn't feel he was trying to sway the reader; he was stating facts that he felt were significant, and let the reader digest them and form an opinion of his/her own.In short, I would thoroughly recommend this book. The writing is clever, witty and detailed, and reading Blue Highways will take you on a fascinating journey. I have River Horse ready and waiting as well as PrairyErth!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"\\"When the mystical young Black Elk went to the summit of Harney Peak to see the shape of things, he looked down on the great unifying hoop of peoples,\\" William Least Heat-Moon writes during the Southern leg of his road trip around the United States described in \\"Blue Highways\\". \\"I looked down and saw fragments.\\"Readers of \\"Blue Highways\\" see fragments, too. Fragments of land; Heat-Moon recounting details from his trek across the United States and back again, first from down south, then from up north. Fragments of prose, small chapters being the rule. Fragments of style, him alternating between Walt Whitman and Walter Cronkite in singing the land and then reporting on it. And fragments of people, those he meets and those he finds inside himself, the latter being an array of white and Indian ancestors who collectively make him something of the loyal outsider, expecting the worst in others yet quick to seek and report on their inner light.\\"Blue Highways\\" casts a sometimes sad eye on the American experience, circa 1977, when Heat-Moon made his circuit. Some reviewers here call it dour, and it is in parts, but what struck me about the book again and again was the tensile strength of people Heat-Moon came across throughout the country.\\"American history is parking lots,\\" he is told. By staying off the main roads and traveling the byways, Heat-Moon tries to disprove this, and succeeds by discovering and documenting how our history lives on, in old people with surprisingly young ideas, poor people who are unreservedly generous, and a half-deranged hitchhiking evangelist who clues Heat-Moon on a vision of greater happiness through service to others.It's only natural there was a gap of five years between the time Heat-Moon made his trip and the book's 1982 publication. The depth of detail offered here, of the ecospheres of everything from a Louisiana bayou to a New Mexican desert, and the rich, individualized histories of so many towns, suggest less a human narrator than a vacuum cleaner of knowledge unless one allows for the fact Heat-Moon buttressed up his initial notes with long supplemental research. But, oh, the majesty of the end result.I really liked the glimpses Heat-Moon gives of himself, unhappily trying to shake off the end of an unstable marriage by pushing himself away from home, coming to doubt time and again the wisdom of his rash action. But, after much soul-searching and a few blind alleys, he comes to find solace in the people he meets.\\"Some people sit around and wait for the world to poke them,\\" notes an old Maryland woman. \\"Well, you have to keep the challenges coming on. Make them up if necessary.\\"The reader finds something, too, a realization America still can renew the human spirit, by reminding us, in the beauty of her land, the freedom of her ways, and the endurance of her people, that life while not easy offers great things in the littlest moments.The denseness of Heat-Moon's prose almost demands repeat readings, but the richness and variety of his style amply rewards them. \\"Blue Highways\\" is an American journey worth taking again and again."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book entered my life in 1988 when I happened to mention to a literate friend that I planned to quit my job and tour America. She recommended this book as good reading and sure enough I found Blue Highways to be the perfect outline for my own journey.I hit the road in the spring of 1989 in a '69 VW Camper and followed Bill's philosophy to take the smallest roads possible. My God! I can still remember poking along the Louisiana Bayou's on Hwy 82 like it was yesterday. Traveling along the backroads at a slow and easy pace is the only real way to see America.Whenever I need to reconnect with what was the best two months of my life I pull out Blue Highways and my own trip journal. While I agree with the author that much has changed, and not for the better, even more of what is best of America is still waiting to be discovered."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"If you love to travel, then this is a good read for you. Heat-Moon gets us off the busy roads of life into the real America and allows us to see the great diversity of people who make up our wonderful country. His encounters with people make this a delightful story as he travels around the U.S. and takes time to sit down and let the folks talk. His re-telling of these stories is the strong point of the book. When he gets involved in history or background of areas, I found it a bit dull. I think this book really gives credibility to the old saying of St.Augustine: &quot;The whole world is a book. Those who do not travel read only one page.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways tells an inner story as captivating as the external wanderlust it records. Heat-Moon sets out from Missouri and circles the country meeting commonfolk, providing commentary, and bringing the less traveled road to life. All too often life forces us into warp speed where we fail to notice the ordinary. With Heat-Moon's closer inspection, we see the ordinary as interesting and an experience worth having. The author makes this journey under a personal cloud due to a failing relationship. His admissions are honest, his emotional battles thought provoking, and the philosophy with which he girds this effort well worth rumination. I may not share all of this man's political leanings, but, nevertheless, I respect him immensely as an author. His sincere gratitude to his readers is palpable and his down-to-earth persona refreshing. Read this and Heat-Moon's two other efforts, River Horse and Prairy Erth. You'll be very happy that you did."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Meaningful, and filled with metaphor, this book is a poignant look at a man standing outside of himself and coping with memory. Each person he writes about on his journey is made to stand out whether good, evil or indifferent. His love and respect for history is obvious--whether it be about the Pony Express (orphans preferred) or how Wolf Point, Montana got its name. He writes with a wry sense of humor, and with out any heavy hand. I've reread passages of this book for over a decade, and for me sums up what the true essence of being &quot;on the road&quot; is about. It is a journal as powerful as a Ken Burns documentary"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I first read this book about 8 years ago, and recently read it again. The second read was more enjoyable than the first. This is a witty, thorough and refreshing story of a man who turns some bad times into the time of his life, at least from the reader's perspective. The author takes us on his tour of the backroads (a.k.a. blue highways) of America as he searches for the next stage of his life. Anyone that doesn't enjoy some aspect of this book better check to see if they have a heart. This story should appeal to everyone's desire at one point in their life to just drop everything, get away from the world, and go see America, and perhaps find themselves in the process. In the case of the book's author, that choice was made for him. This story should appeal to everyone, from the high school graduate, to the college student, to the yuppie, to the hippie, to the middle-ager, and to the empty-nester. It will give you a refreshing breath of how great a place America really is, and it left me wanting to pack my bags. The book even gives you maps of the author's journey should you want to do just that"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book was written by the author after he had experienced personal and professional losses. His position as an English teacher was eliminated. He decided to travel across the country staying on the \\"blue\\" highways and avoiding the super highways. This resulted in a fascinating narrative of his experiences in small towns reflecting the culture, introducing us to people and their stories. He discovers prejudices still active in parts of the south, rural towns that are struggling to survive. Most interesting to me were his conversations with local people and bartenders and waiters and cowboys. His description of the experiences of various Native American tribes and the impact on their lives reflects his knowledge and experience. His own adventures and sometimes near catastrophes add humor and suspense. Very good book. A classic!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"An introspective story of discovery and affirmation regarding the fabric of America. I first read this book in my teens.

One of my favorites and well deserving a place on my personal 5 foot shelf of classics."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is a great travalogue of personal discovery. By far his best work. I feel it is one of the best travelogues out there."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I expected a vivid travelogue, one with interesting historical asides and recondite facts about the places visited. I didn't expect Heat-Moon's poetic facility with language or intellectual depth, called upon occasionally but not insistently, nor the emotional arc of the book as a whole, which seems, against all odds, to have a structure, a beginning, middle and satisfying end. The author has written other books, but there is so much obvious love and care in this one that it reads like his magnum opus. Written in the 70s, it wears well even into the twenty-first century and is sure to become a classic."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I can't add much to the well-deserved heap of glowing reviews for this American classic, except to say I had forgotten how great a book this is (I had first read it during college) until I listened to the unabridged &quot;book on tape&quot; version of it during a recent road trip. A wonderful series of observational vignettes of the rich human theater that is America."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I often harbor the fantasy of taking off, no plans, no real goals, just the American expanse to explore. I think it takes a lot of courage to actually do it. Heat-Moon's story is beautiful. It is simple and real. He shares his feelings as his journey progresses. He also meets some real characters! I think every person is unique and eccentric in there own way and Heat-Moon recreates these people extremely well. If you are a closet wanderer... read this book, it will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Quite a magical book. The author is not a speed seeker intent on racing his way around the back roads of America, he follows a spiritual journey. The glue which holds together this book are the many remarkable characters the author happens upon. His reflections and accounts have a quietly moving, philosophical quality. I have found myself travelling through the same parts of the America with his obervations lodged in my memory and it is all the more remarkable for it! Unlike many other road books, he injects humor and color into even the most dull parts of journey. It's a book written with a great deal of care and craft - not your average tour guide. Some have said that the book ranks with &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, I would agree with that."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least Heat-Moon captures in this book the essence of life, to live it fully.

I don't believe the rating system has enough stars to rate Blue Highways. I've read many stories that I enjoyed but none of them touched me in such a real way as this one did. This wonderful author made you feel like a passenger on his journey and I laughed and cried right along with him. Without leaving my chair, I discovered things about America and its people that both delighted and shamed me. My hardcover edition will always hold the proudest spot on my bookshelf and its message will live inside me everyday of my life. How lucky we are that this author wrote this book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This author speaks to the yearning in many of us to \\"hit the road\\" and not only see what our amazing country is all about, but also to see what we're all about. It's typical in some ways: snapshots of various odd and lovely and not-so-lovely places along America's disappearing back roads. We not only see these places vividly, but also meet the lively and unusual people the author encounters. I don't know if such a journey is possible these days. It seems like we're running out of blue highways and that franchise eateries and stores are taking over even the out-of-the-way places. The book makes me want to hurry up, to buy that truck and put a mattress in the back -- before it's too late. Well-written, entertaining, thought-provoking: this is a timeless book about a timeless journey."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"If you're into traveling along the back roads of America, definately pick up this book. But certainly do not read it unless you are in high enough spirits that the author's continuous depression and disappointment won't get you down - not too much, anyway. Yes, he lost his job and his wife - and that's what prompted his little foray around the country to find America and find himself, but it almost seems like he deliberately set out to find the most miserable people and places in the entire land. They say misery loves company - and Least Heat-Moon sure found plenty of company every bit as miserable and depressed as he was.I had kinda hoped for a recounting of places that were fun, exciting, interesting, and a discovery of what's GOOD about America, but to Least Heat-Moon, there is nothing good about it, and he damned sure wants you to know just how bad everything is.The only reason I gave it any stars at all is that the journey, in and of itself, is interesting. But all the lamenting had me wondering if by the time he got done writing he'd just plunge his truck off a cliff and get it over with already."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways. I loved this book. A journey around the small town's in America."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Least Heat Moon's descriptions of America's people and places are densely atmospheric and wonderfully true to life. Without a doubt, they're the best part of the book. If only they were the only part of the book... His nostalgic (melancholy?) brooding and dreary introspection are not what I expected from this &quot;Journey into America.&quot; I am not against bias; I did not take the trip-- but it would have been a lot more enjoyable without the clutter and weight of the author's personal baggage. I enjoyed reading about the folks and forgotten spots he visited along the way, but suggest that the title and publisher copy be changed to reflect his depressed inner journey if it's all part of the long, boring trip."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I've read a lot of travel and \\"road\\" books over the last two years, after having completed my own \\"cross country\\" road trip one summer... So not only do I have personal experience out there on this kind of trip, but I've read pretty extensively on the subject (fiction and non-fiction). And, this book came highly recommended (???) on here and I had heard about it several places, so I REALLY wanted to like it! But unfortunately, this book does NOT measure up to all the other \\"road\\" books and travelogues. I found myself skipping/skimming VERY quickly through many, many sections (especially many of the conversations and his own brooding). I found several interesting stories, road/place descriptions, and insights - but I only made it about 1/2 through this book until I just couldn't keep going anymore. I am a person who truly appreciates the road and good writing about the road, but this is not it. I couldn't put my finger on it, but some of the stories were just plain boring and some too long-winded... and except for a few notable conversations/people, I was not interested in the people he met... This \\"journey into America\\" does not measure up to other books in this category. I have no idea if the last half of the book is better than the first, maybe it is but I doubt it after reading some other reviews. I give it two stars for some interesting insights and descriptions but don't waste your time.

I enjoyed many parts of this book and I recommend it to fellow adventurers.However, I kept getting the feeling that Mr. Heat-Moon was condescending.His snide remarks about religion and faith made me wonder what he was doing freeloading off of a monastery.It seems pointless to me to try to understand people without understanding their personal beliefs and how central they are to these &quot;colorful&quot;characters. He doesn't seem to GET what several of the people are saying, and does cringe-worthy things like telling people in an old southern white saloon in Selma Alabama, he's here to &quot;See how the Blacks are doing.&quot;All in all though, everybody should do something like discovering your own backyard, and keep off the beaten track."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Took a tour of America with a chip on his shoulder.

I started to read it when it first came out, in the 80s, and again recently, and I just didn't enjoy it. It reminds me of PBS specials where some Harvard-educated musicologist ventures into the swamplands to interview old bluesmen, and tell us all the deep socio-economic underpinnings of the lyrics. Forget it. It's just the blues - it's meant to be felt in your bones, not theorized about. &quot;Blue Highways&quot; gave me the same feeling. W.L.H.Moon comes off as self-centered and condescending; he seems to secretly pity those he meets, even as he wants us to chuckle knowingly at them. There are plenty of American travelogues written by people who actually live there. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Not at all as interesting as I hoped it would be. The back roads of USA should be able to offer a much more colourful and interesting web than this."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"WLHM, although a decent writer, attempts to cross the brooding beat writers of a generation ago with Charles Kuralt. Moon fails miserably. There are some some passages of note, but mostly this work is brooding and pseudo-introspective and at times unfairly insulting to the people of whom he writes. As an English major and English teacher and a teacher of Appalachian literature, culture, history and traditions, I cannot recommend this work with any enthusiasm at all."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I GOT HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND IT NO LONGER HELD MY INTEREST. WHAT I WANTED TO GET FROM THIS BOOK WAS MORE LOCAL DISCRIPTION OF THE PLACES VISITED AND NOT THE GOINGS ON ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING THE WHOLE TIME. I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE 'BLUE HIGHWAYS' AND THE TOWNS BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE THE TRIPS MYSELF. IT LEFT ME FEELING THAT THE SOUTH WAS AND STILL IS AN AWFUL PLACE TO LIVE."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways by William Least Heat-Moon is a marvellous book about his &quot;journey into America&quot; in search of his identity. He travels on small byways (marked in blue on the maps)which manifest the true spirit of America, rather than the bleak outlook presented by unbroken interstate highways. Consequently, the reader experiences a spark of wanderlust, and wants to meet that innocent America which never distrusts strangers.Starting out on a low key (after he loses both his wife and his job) in his van named &quot;Ghost Dancing,&quot; Heat-Moon begins to enjoy his journey from the South to the Pacific North-West when he talks to numerous people about their lives. His knack to make others talk to him is worth noting.The colorful use of language and parallel structures makes the reader feel as though he/she was sitting beside Heat-Moon and having fun. I likened it to a Star Wars ride I had at Disneyland. The reader relishes the wonderful flavor of the book when we meet enigmatic people such as Bob Androit who is building a log cabin and Bill Hammond who is building a boat. The spirit of Individualism stands out as we note numerous things which are characteristic of a particular state such as the blue grass of Kentucky and its well-bred horses.The book is astonishing due to the fact that we don't read about &quot;created characters.&quot; Genuine people living in rural locales talk to us through Heat-Moon. The inclusion of their photographs makes it even more interesting.This journey through America reminded me of my journey on life's highways and brought back many memories. I hope it does for everyone else too."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Like many I first read this work over twenty years ago. I admit that I reread if every few years. Not only is it a wonderful travel book, which at first glance, it is just that, a travel book, but it is much more. It is a search for a missing part of a man's life, one, I truely hope the author found. It is very well written. The author has a wonderful command of the language, and is a wonderful story teller. This is truely one of the few classics which came out of that era. I had to laugh, and sort of cry at the same time when I read a recent, previous review here were the young man claimed he was apprently forced (good for his teacher) to read this book for a English Gifted and Talented Class in High School. He hated it. I guess everone has their own cup of tea, but in my work I do run into a number of contemporary (gifted High School English children who pretty well know it all) folks in these classes...that is where the crying part comes in...I truely am worried about us. Be that as it may, if you want to bite into a great read, a timeless read, and come away,I think, a better person, then I highly recommend this one..Warning though..you will actually be forced to think while reading this one."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways is like a mug of hot coffee on a chilly morning. It is warm, reassuring, and thoroughly optimistic. A sense of freedom, of curious exploration, and of serendipity dominates this book. Blue Highways weaves stories of everyday people, living far from the coasts and major metropolitan areas on which we too often focus. The people tell their stories, and Least Heat-Moon listens. There are some great stories about the journey, and driving, and things like that, but really, the book is about the people he meets. The photographs are a wonderful bonus.Refreshingly, and despite (or perhaps because of?) his own education, Least Heat-Moon does not brand these people as hicks or hillbillies, and he does not call their towns dumps or make jokes about inbreeding. He has respect for his subject -- which is always the mark of a great nonfiction writer. If you've ever dreamed about having more time to talk to that person you saw in a small town somewhere.... this is the book for you.There is a bit of Garrison Keillor in Least Heat-Moon: the gentle folksy manner of a highly educated person who has small-town roots, and a sense of humor that is sometimes teasing, but never vicious. The downside of this is that some readers may find the narrative style, and what passes for a plot, to be boring and monotonous. Nothing &quot;exciting&quot; happens in the book if you're looking for Hollywood-style explosions, car chases, or sex scenes. But if you enjoy looking at undiscovered places, and talking to regular people, well, there's hardly anything more exciting than Blue Highways."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I didn't read the whole book when it first came out (some passages were familiar from, I think, Atlantic Monthly) which was 1982. I picked it up recently and got hooked by the magical prose. This man can write. I turned down pages and marked passages at first but then it became all turned down pages and marked passages. It describes a jouney around the United States, sticking to back roads and small towns. He emphasizes his native American Osage heritage and the has an anti-materialist philosophy full of yearning for older simpler times. Sometimes his antipathy to people who commit the crimes of being middle-aged or well-dressed or living in new houses seems overdone.(I wear a necktie myself sometimes and live in a New York suburb). He likes people to be old and poor and deeprooted in their environment, slightly eccentric, and passionately following some craft or traditional trade.On the whole his nostalgia for the good old days of 20 years previously has worn quite well. It's odd to realize that the book itself is now 20 years old."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"BLUE HIGHWAYS . . .These are the 1st words of the book. And they are granted one whole page.&quot;On the old highway maps of America, the main routes were red and the back roads blue. Now even the colors are changing. But in those brevities just before dawn and a little after dusk - times neither day nor night - the old roads return to the sky some of its color. Then, in truth, they carry a mysterious cast of blue, and that's the time when the pull of the blue highway is strongest, when the open road is a beckoning, a strangeness, a place where a man can lose himself.&quot;I bought BH as quickly as I could after having read its review in NYT Book Review back in 1982. I bought a cofee, sat in a plush chair, cracked the binding and opened the book to this page. I read these words. I stopped, but my eyes remained fixed. I read these words again. Again. And, again. I could not turn the page.Suddenly, I was back in the early 60's when I was an engineering student with an Austin Healy. I remembered sitting at the top of a hill somewhere in the country just as the night's darkness was forced aside by the morning's early light.I read the opening paragraph again. Again. And, again. I could not turn the page. That was all I could read. It took years before I could read the book.I attempted to explain this experience to my friends but received little more than a supportive and patronizing smile. I bought copies of BH for a half-dozen friends and asked them to read the book and tell me what happened to them. Only one guy, a bother under the skin, seemed to 'understand.'I have read BH since . . . at least a half-dozen times. It pulls me back still like a . . . well, a Blue Highway.If the words in the 1st paragraph make your eyes grow glassy, silence your world, and stir your heart then buy Blue Highways. If the words didn't, then, uh . . .."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Heat Moon lost his wife and his job, and his reaction was to go for a drive around America. His intent was not to search for meaning in time of personal crisis but to see what was out there. Blue Highways is his document of his three month journey. Writing in clear and powerful prose, Heat Moon has managed to present the individual character of the varied regions of the United States, as well as the personalities of the men and women he encountered. Through them, and sometimes through their interactions with their environment, he shows an imbalance between being modern and being human. I've read this book three times, and I am set to read it again. The power of the prose to reveal character brings me back to it time after time. I've always been struck by the author's ability to get so many strangers to tell him their hopes and dreams. This is an engaging and a great book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"From Walk Across America, to Travels With Charley to Worldwalk I'm always drawn to the loner out on the open road kind of stories. This one comes down somewhere between walk across america and zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It's definitely the lazy man's way to see america, but it still has the angle in the title of \\"blue highways\\". That is to say he focuses on the pre-interstate routes for getting around. It allows for a little more depth than oh say, flying over, but certainly nothing like Peter Jenkins got from walking across the country, or even Steinbeck staying in trailer parks. Heat-Moon is more introverted and introspective than the above authors, so the strength of the book comes more from his quiet philosophical observations about off the beaten path America. I just give it 4 stars, but it either would need to be a little better literature or failing that, to have a little more vibrant human interaction to capture 5 stars for me. Still, it's an easy read, and more than worth the effort."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"A generation ago writer William Least Heat-Moon, getting away from the tangles of his own changing life, bravely undertook a road trip that crossed the quiet places of the American landscape, and on his journey he met a number of wonderfully unique men and women, all people of depth and individuality, and he learned their stories. Describing in this slow-paced, pure-spirited book a disappearing aspect of (rural) America most of us will never know or even be aware of, this writer crafted a non-fiction classic that is both a time capsule and a recounting of a modern-day human-centered pilgrimage of growth. The lesson Least Heat-Moon learned that sticks out above all in my mind is how he found time and again that it is the people who possess the least in their lives who are also the most generous and welcoming. An inspiring, interesting, moving sort of book about a time much longer ago than a mere quarter-century, and about places that most likely have already given way to change. I read this book in college and have found it unforgettable."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I first listened to this book (unabridged with Frank Mueller) several years ago, enjoying it thoroughly then on cassettes. This title was available as a one-file download for mp3 players from my library, so I re-read it. This time, I appreciated Mr. LHM's way with words even more. The writing is downright brilliant.Others have complained that he is depressing, gloomy, etc. It's a 10,000 mile trip - if you want someone who's consistently upbeat, go read \\"Pollyanna\\"! For the most part, the author seems to like the folks he meets, appreciates the scenery, and gives interesting historical asides to the places along his route. A negative? All that detail makes a long book seem even longer. At Portland, OR he makes his one stopover in a city; it's also the point where he starts heading back east again. One might consider putting the book aside there, and picking up a short read of a totally different nature, before coming back for the return journey."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I first read this book in 1984 and found it \\"slowly captivating\\". It is not a book that will suck you in with wild wit, amazing narrative, or dramatic prose. Its beauty is kind of an everyman's beauty.It is a likeable book because so many of us have thought about just pulling out of the driveway and never looking back. Finding those backroads and driving 'til they end - just to see what's out there. Well the author did that and I think many readers are a little envious that he did it, and curious about what he found.And what he found was as much about himself as the rest of America. I re-read the book in 2004 as sort of a 20th anniversary tribute of my first reading. The book still speaks to me. It still tells a quietly great story."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Mr. Moon's unforgetable journey to the off the beaten pathsof America. He captures the soul of our nation as it use tobe. Here are desciptions of the people that one rarelyhears or reads about. If you want to learn about whatmakes this country great...read Blue Highways. It willgive you inspiration to journey to the off-beat roads ofAmerica."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I have written many reviews for Amazon.com. Blue Highways is the only book to which I've given five stars. I would recommend it to anyone.Blue Highways is William Least Heat-Moon's account of his 1978 low-budget car ride across America. Heat-Moon's reporting reminds me a lot of Charles Kuralt's On the Road reports for CBS News. Heat-Moon has a talent for engaging strangers on the road and bringing out the best in them.What separates Blue Highways from so many other travel books? There are a variety of factors. Heat-Moon is a good writer. He understands pacing - and does not allow the story to bog down. He is, overwhelmingly, positive about the people and places that he encounters. Heat-Moon took pictures of many of the people he met and I think that those pictures add much to the book.More so than the above factors, however, I think that Heat-Moon's philosophical bent adds a lot to the book. Blue Highways is not just an account of a trip; in meeting these people and engaging them, Heat-Moon wants to help answer some of the big questions about why we are here and what it means to live a good life. While no one can answer those questions once and for all, Heat-Moon provides some great food for thought.As several reviewers have pointed out, Heat-Moon's 1978 descriptions of the USA are now poignant due to the changes in our society. Sadly, many of the older people he encountered must now be dead. Many of Heat-Moon's other observations are just as valid today as they were in 1978. Specifically, he laments the increasingly-homogeneous American culture, materialism, careerism, and many other problems.I first read Blue Highways in 1993. I reread it this summer (2008). It lost nothing on the second reading. If you like travel writing and are at all philosophical, this book will \\"speak\\" to you on so many different levels. Don't pass this one up; it's that rare, wonderful book that makes reading all of the mediocre books worthwhile."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is the kind of trvel/spiritualaty book that I read over and over - a few pages at a time - to get a glimpse of America and a spoonful of spirituality at the same time. Moon did something every American should do - travel the country and talk with our countrymen. His reflections on his findings are why I keep going back."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"When Least Heat-Moon lost his job shortly after losing his wife, he hit the road in a truck, modified to have basic space for sleeping and cooking. He decided to travel around the United States while staying off the interstate highways (the \\"red highways\\"). Instead, he would explore the blue highways on the map, without a definite plan but looking for odd place names and interesting people.Least Heat-Moon has a great nose for the pockets of America left behind by \\"progress,\\" and a real fondness for the people who live there. Whether in rural Kentucky, a black neighborhood in Birmingham, an island in Chesapeake Bay or a middle-of-nowhere town in West Texas, he makes friends and gets people talking.Sociologically, he gives us a wonderful snapshot of America in the 1970s. As a denizen of these forgotten corners myself, I can say that many of them are now gone - but not all, thank goodness. As a writer he is an insightful observer of character, but one who lets each character speak for herself.Least Heat-Moon does not quite turn his observational powers on himself and his journey. He tosses a few breadcrumbs, and he finds some meaning for himself that gets revealed at the end - though there were enough clues that I got it in New Mexico. His unwillingness to do too much self-revelation makes this book more sociological and not enough of a memoir. The journey does not quite transform the traveler. As the subtitle suggests, it's a journey into America but not into himself."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Maybe I am too stingy, as it seems I give fewer stars than people who liked the book less.It is a nice, solid journey through America. Better than Travels with Charley, but not up to Calvin Trillin (to name two authors whom this author seems to feel he is in competition with).I was a bit put off the book by the reviewers who wrote about \\"two books\\" -- his inner journey vs. the actual one; these reviewers pretty much did not enjoy his sufferings, and I was nervous about a self-absorbed whine-fest. Actually, it is nowhere near as dramatic as the reviews suggest. The book is a fine balance of the author's internal struggles and his travels; never did I get the feeling that one was out of place or too dominant.The book is not stunning, and has less insight than it promises. However, it is intelligent, interesting, and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I did enjoy Mr Least Heat Moon's book, but I don't think it is for everyone. If you are not a fan of the travelogue genre of books, this might be kind of boring and long-winded. Blue Highways is a good title, because it describes Mr Least Heat Moon's journey through the backroads of America (shown as blue lines on certain maps) and also the somber tone of the book. Mr. LHM is just coming off the breakup of his relationship with the \\"Cherokee\\" and seems very depressed. He outfits a van and goes cruising through America for a few months. There are interesting and not-so-interesting people and places along the way and I give kudos to Mr. LHM for including both. The fact that he includes times when he was bored did help to make me feel like I was on the journey with him, experiencing its ups and downs. As other reviewers have noted, he does not speak deeply about his own feelings and emotions, and at some points I did wish he would open up a little more about what he was experiencing on this trip. There are some really good points in the book, including when he meets a team of hang gliders and an eccentric wandering missionary in one of the northern states. I can honestly say I learned a lot from reading this book about all kinds of things: history, fishing, culture, food, etc. I guess that is what Mr LHM really wanted us to take from his journey. To provide an account of backroads America at a certain point in time, and not focus too much on himself, why he undertook what he did and what he got out of it. I'd say there is some bias in favor of the blue-collar, skilled American and against what he seems to see as encroaching materialism, suburbanization and urbanization of rural America. I think the reader can decide how he/she feels about that.I feel the strength of this book is as a historical account of America in the late 1970s. If you enjoy cultural and historical studies, not just of those in political power or of wars and such, this is the book for you. If you enjoy learning about how people live around the world or in the USA, you'll learn much. It doesn't read like a novel and has few if any thrilling moments. Overall I'd like to thank Mr. LHM for taking us along on his trip."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways is my favorite book and William Least Heat Moon is my favorite author. Need I say more? His trek around the country, in Blue Highways, is so fascinating. The most unfriendly people he met on his way live twenty miles from where I grew up!!!! If you get to Kewaunee, Wisconsin, though, be sure to go to this bakery because the kolaches are phenomenal. You will absolutely enjoy this book and it's a great summer read."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I paid full price for \\"Blue Highways\\" at Harvard Book Store and I don't regret it for one minute.I picked it up based on reviews I had read elsewhere. I didn't even think of Amazon when I went to look at it at the bookstore. I was just curious. It intrigued me immediately.This simply may be one of the best books (of any genre) I have read in a very long time.I'm not going to ramble on; there are 127 other reviews that you can read, but if you are thinking about this book -- and I suppose that's why you are here -- I would buy this book. It is simply outstanding."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book is informative and relaxing. It can be read a few pages at a time for those who do not have long periods of free time. The author has a refreshing viewpoint on what makes an area special."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Just two pages into this work, Chapter 3 begins: \\"A PLEDGE: I give this chapter to myself. When done with it, I will shut up about that topic.\\" On first reading this, I marveled at the approach, which Heat-Moon holds throughout. Making only passing references to a failed marriage and lost job (no more than one line), he humbly directs his energy toward observing his surroundings. There's some charm in his self-effacing humor; for example, driving through the Great Plains, he notes that \\"boredom lies only with the traveler's limited perception and his failure to explore deeply enough. After a while, I found my perception limited.\\"That's the way to write travel journalism- tell a story about the world outside, the people and places you encounter. However, in retrospect, I wish he had looked inward more- despite flashes of genius that occasionally crop up like specks of gold dust panned from a stream, there really is no narrative thread that holds this work together from start to finish. He admits this: \\"When you're traveling, you are what you are right there and then. People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.\\" And so, despite the enjoyable insight and stories, it's easy to put this down for days at a time and not feel like you're missing anything.But those flashes of genius reflect some truisms of solo travel so memorable I had to write them down. For instance, near the end of the book he notes that \\"By seeing both the futility in trying to relive the old life and the danger in trying to obliterate it, man can gain the capacity to make anew. His very form depends not on repetition but upon variation from old patterns.\\"Befitting of Heat-Moon's style, these truisms are just as likely to come directly from the mouths of his subjects on the road, rather than from his own reflections. A monk tells him, \\"if you don't do what you want when you're young, you'll never do it.\\" Another subject recalls that \\"Descartes believed traveling is like conversing with men of other centuries.\\""},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is the second time reading this book. Loved it the first time. Like it pretty well this time although I don't remember a thing from the first read 20 some years ago.

Up there with Steinbeck's 'Travels with Charlie'. I've read it ten times over the past twenty years."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I've been a lot of the places the author writes about, stayed in some of them. So yeah, I know people can come away from the same place with different views about it.But reading Blue Highways was an interesting exercise in being on the other end of prejudice, not to mention hearing a lot of cs (that's like hs except for chipmunks) along with misinformation about some areas. We are all entitled to our opinions, sure, but when writing a book maybe you need to phrase them with a little more thought, or your reader begins to think this book might be a waste of time.Supposedly driving on a long journey to nowhere was going to assist in possibly reconciling problems with Least Heat Moon's marriage and his mind, but I think the latter was already closed before he got in his van. He has some strange ideas about some of the locations, apparently based on one conversation with a resident, usually in a tavern, a restaurant, etc. He quotes the same authors until I want to scream (Walt Whitman and Black Elk each wrote some good stuff, but they should not be allowed to form base reading matter for anyone), and although I finished it, I am not at all sure I'd buy another book of his. It is not a road book or a personal philosophy book, it hangs up somewhere South of both."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways is a narrative guide about traveling the back roads of America. William Least Heat-Moon does a good job telling us about the roads traveled and the people he meets. You just want to read on and see who's around the next corner, and what tails they have to share.

I'm sure he is asking himself these questions every day along with, WHY DID I COME THIS WAY???"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book is a joy in discovering the people and places along the backroads of America.

It's introspective, it's delightful, and it makes you feel as though you're traveling with him, HIGHLY recommended!!"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"\\"A rule of the blue road: Be careful going in search of an adventure - it's ridiculously easy to find.\\"And so William Least Heat-Moon's travels across America begin. When his wife leaves him, the professor from Columbia, Missouri decides to pack his van Ghost Dancing, and make a trek across the United States. His rule is to travel the back roads and avoid highways. He searches out to find the true America, but in the process also finds himself. It's a thrilling ride through the forgotten states, woods, and rivers and into the beating heart of America. In a time of so much political rhetoric about what the \\"true America\\" represents, Heat-Moon finds a group of people who are strong, resilient, and fiercely independent.At times the prose becomes a bit dull with pages of historical references and religious tie-ins, but then there are gems such as this that leap from the page. This description is about a mother in Texas:\\"She longed for the true journey of an Odysseus or Ishmael or Gulliver or even a Dorothy of Kansas, wherein passage through space and time becomes only a metaphor of a movement through the interior of being. A true journey, no matter how long the travel takes, has no end.\\"When Heat-Moon travels from the rural Midwest, to the slums of Louisiana, and then up to the East Coast elite, the journey becomes a gospel of America, and its writer, a prophet. There have been other books from de Tocquevile to Kerouac that have gone searching for America, but this one is done with such finesse, and provides profound insights into America and the writer. It's fitting that Heat-Moon decided to pack Whitman's Leaves of Grass in toe. They both sing America.Highly recommended for those interested in the off the beaten path America. As Heat-Moon says, \\"What is the blue highway anyway but an opportunity to poke at the unseen and a hoping the unseen will poke back?\\""},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least Heat Moon lost his wife and lost his job, so he packed what was left of his life into a minivan, and drove rural America searching for stability. Though he does not mention the name, in essence he tried to find Mayberry, the mythical small town where nothing seems to change, the people are happy, and any strife is superficial enough to be resolved by the end of a half-hour TV episode.He didn't find it. Like Miniver Cheevy, he was born too late.In small town after small town, he was told that he had arrived a couple of decades too late. Half the time, the old timers would tell him that the town had grown too big, and had lost its former charm. The other half of the time, they would tell him that the town had shrunk too small, and lost its former vitality. No place had stayed the same. There was no Mayberry.We can only hope that Least Heat Moon eventually found his Mayberry, at least in his own mind, if not in some small town."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read.

This book I think is for the drifter, dreamer, and story-teller in all of us. I really felt like I was in Bill's shoes and that I could envision many of the situations/scenarios that he was in. At first I thought it was going to be too drawn out. But Moon does a wonderful job of carrying you from place to place on his journey and each stop is new and exciting. If you traveled any of the places he visits, it makes it even more compelling. I love his mix of Native American insight and down to earth vision. It's the part of America you don't read about in the morning paper. I give this journey 5+ stars! Thanks Bill for taking the time to share a memorable adventure."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Just finished this book and thoroughly enjoyed it.Have read several others by E.W.Teale,Steinbeck,Twain,R.T.Peterson,L.McMurtry,P.Dunne,K.Kaufmann and in my opinion this was up there with the best of them.Although I must admit, I found the first half of the book more interesting than the second.This may have been because the people in the areas were more colorful or perhaps the author was tiring a bit.Recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"My copy sat, almost untouched for 17 years. I asked myself, Was it just a poor man's Travels With Charlie? A penchant for cute town names? I started in the middle \\"West by Northwest\\" Oregon to Montana. Couldn't put it down. Found out how good this book really is, and then read the beginning, which is even better because it covers racism in the deep south and, earlier, Moon's honoring a long lost (grand)father's grave.Least Heat Moon is pretty consistent in avoiding the more commercial establishments when he sets down to eat or drink. He is more interested in getting to know and writing about unique and special people along the way: Holliston, a hang glider in the west. An evangelist hitchhiker across Montana. A runaway girl in Wisconsin.Moon's friend Chisholm, with whom he builds a stone retaining wall, stating \\"the wall would be there until other men came, and, with effort, moved it,\\" is metaphoric for the theme of the trip. Moon sees walls that don't last and walls moved by men.As Moon recounts joining three men who fish the Atlantic, it becomes clear his is a book about a time gone by, or about to. Moon captures an increasingly ethereal aspect of America that many of us will never see or know. Aspects of America that took guts and sweat to make happen, others that put us through the wringer. There will be years before they disappear, but only.An Italian family in Michigan who no longer can make a living farming specialty foods. A family of maple syrup tappers whose geneology is recounted. I think of old National Geographics. Then there's Miz Alice, retired teacher, living on a Maryland island who points to another island and says it \\"has a couple hundred years before it disappears.\\" Much but not all is corporate vs family, red highways (interstates and the like) vs. blue highways (the roads Moon takes). It is also history, like what Lewis and Clark saw, only more recent (but now long ago)."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least-Heat Moon, in an extraordinary first published book, reveals a journey taken far away from the &quot;interstates&quot; of the human experience. In the near-forgotten places and continental corners he passes through, life manages to persist in ways that it does not in the change-racked &quot;fast lane&quot; so many of us are swept into. Nearly two decades have passed and the book is no less relevant in what it says about modernity: In the chain-store franchise 90s, places increasingly appear like every other place, and local color and richness fades--or is bulldozed--into history.Artistically, BLUE HIGHWAYS is a feast. Least-Heat Moon's poetic descriptions of landscape and mindscape are equalled only by his marvelous ability to capture the varied dialects of America. When reading some of the language aloud, I actually succeeded in sounding like a Texan or coast fisherman . . . much more so than if I had ever made the attempt on my own.Like any good travelogue, BLUE HIGHWAYS endures, not only for the above reasons, but also for the honest look the author takes at himself and where his life is going--universal questions. And though there are no universal answers, I think this journey deserves the large audience that has embraced it and, by so doing, perhaps have asked themselves the same questions."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"William Least Heat-Moon takes his wonderful prose on a slow trip across the back roads of America, and along the way we get to meet folks in small-town America. Heat-Moon's journey was precipitated by the double whammy of learning he'd lost both his job and his wife at just about the same time, and he figured, as he felt he'd also lost a sense of direction for his life, that perhaps travel, reflection, and writing might cure what ailed him.Some have said the book, now almost 30 years old, is dated - and of course it is. But what makes it even more interesting nowadays is, reading it, you can kind of track the process of how America got from what it was then to what it is now. It's a bit scary."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Although I'm only about half-way through this book, I doubt I'll ever finish it. As with some of the other Least Heat Moon books, he jumps between a wonderful ability to describe places, historic settings, and living people with what comes across has an almost immature political view that somehow all economic developement is tinged with evil and ugliness, although he has no problem with cruising the country over roads in an automobile, and through canals in a motorized boat. While I can't quite get a handle on it, there is something missing in his hand-wringing, that smacks more of someone who will forever only see what he wants to see, and of huge ego. If you're leanings are green party and whiny, you'll love this book. For others, it may prove just a bit too much like reading a college newpaper editorial."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is a brilliantly funny book, but frankly I recommend the reading on audio tape because Keith Szarabajka (the gruffly stick-his-finger-in-the-fan Mickey Kostmayer of The Equalizer) makes it even better. His sexy, gravelly voice, is the perfect foil for Least Heath-Moon's utterly droll stroll through the forgotten highways across the US. The wit is incisive, about his personal life and the small towns and villages the blue highways(the roads mark in blue on US maps). These were once the main arteries of the US highways system, but are the 'Norman Bates' now forgotten restaurants, motels and quirky little people that refuse to give up their way of life."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book had been on my \\"to read\\" list for some time--fairly low, because travelogues are not usually my cup of tea. But after seeing the very excellent interview with the engaging Mr. Least Heat-Moon on BookTV last weekend, it hurtled to the top. Having just finished it, I can do nothing but give the author props for a very funny, insightful (and at times, even moving) chronicle of modern America, as seen from the backroads.What is most astonishing about this book is that every observation, every encounter, every description rings honest. Any number of writers could have tackled this assignment, using it as an opportunity for silly or sentimental navel-gazing. Mr. LH-M keeps it real. He lets the people speak for themselves. He provides enough details about his own life and personal crises to establish himself as an interesting (and interested) narrator, but he never loses sight of the country around him. He provides vivid descriptions of the ever-changing scenery but does not get bogged down in adjective-overdrive. Those he interviews are a fascinating mix of the poor and middle and upper-middle class: thinkers and philosophers and laborers and \\"just plain folks\\" who live in places most of us will never visit. Though Mr. LH-M is a restless wanderer and does not remain in any locale long, he does not miss interesting side-opportunities that present themselves. He learns about hang-gliding in Washington, syruping in New Hampshire, joins a fishing crew for a day off the coast of Maine, and along the way hears tales of small-town America and of the gradual movement (which has grown only faster in the last 25 years) towards sweeping most of America into the net of suburban sprawl. This book provides good evidence why the trend should be resisted.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Calling it a \\"travelogue\\" is an injustice in many ways, because it fails to capture the deeply human aspect of the author's chronicle. Buy and read this book. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Those who enjoy travel, either for pleasure or at work (probably both), will likely appreciate what's presented in this book. Many who travel ceaselessly are troubled, and Mr. Moon addresses that, in a most thoughtful fashion, as well as presenting excellent descriptions of specific places. How he manages to meet so many interesting people on a single journey amazes, but I'm an engineer.This book is best appreciated while driving through one of the described areas and listening to an audio version. I've become accustomed to listening to the book every year as I drive around the West. Mr. Moon's politics tend left (which mine don't), but it's easy to overlook while his excellent prose is digested.Enjoy.May 2007 Addendum: Since I wrote the review I've listened to the book a couple more times, the unabridged version, which I've since learned is no longer available. My local library has (or had last summer) the full multi-cassette deal, but it's apparently now a collector's item.While the prose is well done (IMHO), the person who reads it is at least as good. Listening to this unabridged book read in a wonderfully mellifluous voice has become a rite of summer for me. I don't know if anyone else reading this has access to those old cassettes, but if you do, listen.I think I need to copy the library's copy this year. I tried to buy one here, but it wasn't available (months on a wait list) & now isn't even offered."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"i finished reading this book last night,after taking it little by little, the past month...some books are not easy, this one is a labyrith and like a woman demands your complete attention...when i finished, i felt as if i had finished the journey with Moon, met the characters and saw the wide open spaces, and walked away knowing that there was more to america than atm machines, golden arches, and cell phones... although this book was written almost twenty years ago, it would not feel out of place in 2000; so much of this country has become skyscrapered, MTV'd and dot-commed...i smiled everytime Moon talked about looking for a Resteraunt with 5 calenders because you knew he was going to get a great meal...he uses pop culture references for clever, even comic effect, it is through his words, that he's telling us that he is taking more than a journey, that he has become don quixote, trying perhaps to bring back the lost america that can only be found in small towns... the fact that he made this trip in a van with very little money and sheer guts tells you about the wonder of the human spirit...this book is unsentimental...many times throughout the story, Moon himself wondered if the journey was worth continuing, and yet he continued, knowing that by travelling on the roads he would discover his true self... a traveller carries no compass; the only direction he follows is the one that lies within his heart...the traveller knows that its not about reaching the destination, its the journeythe journey is everything..."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I read this book in the fall of my senior year in high school. To put it simply, it changed my life. William Least Heat Moon's outlook on life, his curiousity about everyday folk, it just blew me away. When my father and I went to visit colleges, we'd stop at restaurants and see how many wall calendars they had. The book showed how life isn't about rushing the whole time, making a ton of money, success in life is not dictated by these things. On the contrary, appreciate what's right in front of you. I'm a sophomore in college now, I still don't have the answers to the world, nobody really does, but I thank Blue Highways for instilling in me a curiousity and drive to enjoy the finer, simpler things in life."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"A very enjoyable book which takes the reader along the lesser traveled roads across the US.

William Least Heat Moon tells stories of the people he meets on his trip through America traveling the \\"blue roads,\\" the small back roads. It's easy to fall in love with this nation and its people by reading the little vignettes put forth by Least Heat Moon. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This book of travels is fascinating because the author takes his subject from an angle that we are not used to. He decides to tour America using only the blue highways, those highways that are not Interstates nor even US highways. So he gets away from the motoring crowd and discovers another America, an America that lives in some tradition, in some order that is based on stable connections with nature and with social communities. He also tries to discover America and its history by meeting people and exploring local history, the history of small villages or cities and their citizens. His history is more story than history but it is very human and deeply fed with a culture that the franchised facade we know everyday may us think it has completely disappeared, or even that it has never existed. This constant delving into the deeper layers of our reality is giving us some energy to resist the franchising process and to look for men and women who have made this country and are still giving this country some tasty flesh and thrilling energy. We are glad to understand that America really is what we hope it is, a deeply human and humane culture and not only the fast-running and media-superficial Internet glasswindow that hides the back-shop and the men who work behind the wings.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I've been traveling off and on for the past 33 years.

The first time I read this book, it took me places I've never been before. It's a well-written traveler's tale.

Since reading this book, I compare every new read to it. Nothing has ever stacked up to this. Heat-Moon brings us from Columbia, MO, where his whole life is collapsing before his eyes, all the way around the country, and back again to Columbia, with a new interest in his life, new insight and wisdom. He has no perminant companions, gets called racial names, finds a bug in his car he befriends (for a short while), and cares for a hitch-hiking preacher. This book is literally breathtaking."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager and it gave a lot of respect for &quot;rural&quot; America and its values.

Every high school in America should make reading this book a requirement."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"To label the book is to dilute the experience. This is direct experience without the overlay of being something else. I'll tell you this -- I turn to the book every night. There are only two other authors, and one's specific book that compare in terms of genuine 'road' experience: All of Carl Carmer's nonfiction, (I have not read his novels), and Alex Shoumatoff's, \\"Florida Ramble,\\" (I am devoted to the latter book, and I have not given his other work a chance).I find it erroneous to compare Blue Highways to Kerouac's \\"On the Road.\\" It is far truer than a \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\\"Perhaps it is simply that my own experience on the blue roads - I should say - the voice of the author and the voices he reports are what I experienced - and that, 20 years past. But, that, too, seems to add a layer of pretentiousness that neither exists in the author's experience, nor in my own.Ending this with the most altruistic and cliche truth: the writing teaches how to live where you are. I am grateful."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Thank you, William Least Heat Moon, for this book. I am American, but grew up and live in Germany. This book taought me more about the country of my birth than anything else. A tender, caring, beautiful tale of travel, of people, life and land."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Blue Highways is as much an introspective study as it is a road book. Least Heat-Moon takes the reader across country as he tries to figure out his life and where it's going. The people he encounters and the places he eats and even the weather he drives through can make many of us recall moments and places in our own lives, especially for those of us who are older. The nostalgia for the past is especially strong when comparing towns that still had no fast food restaurants. Local cafes and diners lend a uniqueness to a place and help keep all towns from seeming the same.While reading the book, I felt as if I was returning to a time I experienced. Although there was an overlying sense of loss, it was still fun to visit the older times and places, and I looked forward to picking up the story each time. However, after finishing the book, I did experience a greater sense of sadness and loss. Still there is joy in many of the encounters, and curiosity about the differences among places and people.In the end, this is not the most joyous read, but it is a pleasure to read. I recommend Least Heat-Moon's tale of travels, especially to those who remember."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"Heat Moon was one of the first to do it... and his journal-like style gives a real sense of authenticity to his work.

Nameless, Tennessee is the best bit in the book. I promise you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"After seeing Mr. Least Heat Moon on Book TV, I was anxious to continue experiencing America with this very interesting man. \\"Blue Highways\\" starts out as a wonderful adventure of travel and meeting interesting people, but I think the author should have confined his travels to the South. After some delightful tales of characters he met while traveling through the southern states, Mr. Least Heat Moon then begins to relate his rather depressing personal philosophy about the degradation of American culture. The personal encounters that make the beginning of the book so interesting seem to fade away in his despair. They pick up again when he finally returns to the east coast, but by then his personal philosophy is so heavy in his writing that it is no longer enjoyable. I realize he was going through some tough personal challenges, but he didn't seem to recover. I would expect after rewriting his manuscript some nine times he would have found more hope. Or was his purpose to bring us down to his level of hopelessness? It is surprising to me that this book has been so popular through the years; I guess people want to feel bad."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, and one of the few I've read more than once. It not only captures a midlife \\"crisis\\"-inspired journey (inwardly and physically) of one man wandering across the blue highways of America, it guides us through an America not many get to see. Certainly, few have (or take) the time the author had to wander the back roads leisurely because interstates lure us in with the promise to, ostensibly, make the most of our cherished American road trips by getting \\"there\\" as fast as we can to maximize our thin slivers of vacation.Moon eschews speed for experience, and his willingness to engage locals is refreshing, as is his courage to stand firm in the face of some not-so-friendly folks he meets. He is endlessly curious and not afraid to head down a back road, even if he doesn't know where it leads. In the age of GPS-equipped phones and in-car navigation systems, it's hard to imagine many make trips like this anymore.Finally, as it is set in the late 1970's, post-Watergate, pre-Reagan revolution, and long before deep societal fear of the \\"other\\" spawned by 9/11, as well as the large-scale divisiveness and misery of the Great Recession, the book has the feel of an America that seems even farther away than the three decades that have passed since its publishing. It truly has the taste, look and feel of a completely different place, and perhaps that's part of the reason for its appeal.This book is a highly intriguing and well-written personal and historical journey that is truly a joy to read."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"While the text of this book was well written, perhaps poetic at times, the reader is likely to become bored by the &quot;plot&quot; after 100 pages. The main character (the author) is the only character who the reader follows through the text; he is the only character the reader is allowed to see change and grow. While it is interesting enough to watch him, one might desire something more."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"When I first started to read Blue Highways, I was expecting a travelogue but quickly realized that it was the story of man in search of what life is all about and how different people see and cope with life. The travel was interesting and so were the people he met along the way. However he wishes to give the impression that he is of the people but writes like he is way above them. At times I felt that I needed to read the book with a dictionary beside me. I would have liked him to come to some conclusions about his life by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","review":"My husband always wants to arrive fast so we always take the super highways. I felt like there was someone else out there who is bored with the super highways. I appreciated what the author discovered along the way. Not everyone thought there was a new south. I enjoyed his experience in the backwoods area of Tennesee. Progress was coming even if they didn't want it. I especially loved the author's descriptive phrases-his crowning glory.

They do in this book (and at its companion website, www.standupgirl.com). From thousands of letters from young women around the world detailing abortion experiences Becky has distilled some common lessons. These are presented in chapters on exploring the various options a pregnant woman has, how to talk to parents and boyfriends, and what to expect in a pregnancy. In so doing she exposes the fallacy of \\"choice\\" as young women actually experience it, how pressured they usually find themselves to abort by the men in their lives and by their mothers. She also helps the reader see past the panic of the moment and the joy that the future can hold. This is a rare book, one anyone interested in abortion, teen pregnancy, fetal development, or the micro-sociology of abortion will find captivating."},{"Title":"Standup Girl: Take Charge of Your Unexpected Pregnancy","review":"I have not read this book but I am very familiar with the Standup Girl web site, and it is 100% anti-abortion. While I respect the right of the authors and the women who tell their stories in the book to be anti-abortion and even to try and persuade the rest of us against abortion, I think that the title 'Take Charge of Your Unexpected Pregnancy' might be misleading to some. If you are looking for a book that respects all your options - abortion, adoption and parenting - and your right to make your own decision, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This book is a look at real people at the turn of the 20th century.

The relationship between Father and Little Britches is humbling to read, honestly.

A superb story of love, family, hard work and survival."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker that read it as a chld(she's now in her 50s) I purchased it for my 11 year old son. I gotinto reading it during a family vacation in Yellowstone and found myself unable to put it down as I read chapters to my sons. It is a gripping story of making the best of what you have, while doing the right and honest thing. It's as readable as it was decades ago. Read it yourself and share the story and values with your children or grandchildren."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This is a series that is great for boys and girls.

She is hard on books!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I read this book multiple times as a boy and absolutely loved it. I wished I could like like Ralph did. As a father, I have read it to some of my boys and am now reading it to our youngest ones. It is truly a classic with valuable life lessons, colorful adventures, and touching moments. It just doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I am ordering Little Britches today with the utmost excitement. When I was in 5th grade in the 60's, my teacher read it to us every afternoon. I have never forgotten how it kept everyone's attention. You could have heard a pin drop. When my kids were little, I looked for this series in bookstores with no luck.Now I have grandkids and my search was renewed. Thank heaven for computers and Amazon!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"If you loved Laura Ingalls Wilder, then this is like the boys version of Little House on the Prairie. If not, then try this and you might like it better. I am buying copies for all the pre-teens boys that I know.The story is well-written and engaging, and I also like it for the historical glimpse into the character of our ancestors in the early 20th century.I was amazed at the hard work and ingenuity required to eke out an existence as a farmer/rancher on the Colorado plains.And don't stop at this book: there are several more that continue to trace Ralph Moody through childhood into his teens, and even into young adulthood."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I loved this book. It reminds me a bit of the Little House on the Prairie series but the main character is a boy. The story is full and rich. It is positive and uplifting. It nourishes the soul. I read it to my 7 year old when she is scared and can't sleep...it comforts her and makes her feel safe. It is feeled with family values, hard work, and mistakes of children. It is a treasure and belongs on every home bookshelf."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"By the time he was 22, Ralph Moody had lived more adventures than most of us will know in several lifetimes. Ralph's adventures are, I think, even greater because he came West (1906) at a time when the West was wide open for opportunity: the days of open range had ended about 20 years earlier and places like Colorado had been sufficiently settled so as to provide basic services (and safety), but there were not as yet so many people as to saturate the market. Small fortunes cold be made and lost as fast as an industrious young man could think them up and carry them out!But more than that, Ralph Moody simply had a determination and confidence and aptitude that enabled and motivated him to go out and make his own fortune and adventure in the world. So on one level, the entire Little Britches series (all eight books) is a testament to what a person can do if he takes life by the reins (pun only partially intended). Yes, life was hard, but Ralph never let circumstances discourage him. And he had an amazing father and mother who provided him with a rock-solid moral and spiritual foundation in addition to a unwavering work ethic.This was an era when there was no income tax, and a man could pretty much keep whatever income he could generate, by hook or by crook (or by \\"crooked\\"--but not Ralph!). So if the Moody kids collected coal that fell off the trains, they could sell it to their neighbors and make enough money for a widow to survive--and neither the IRS nor Social Services had a problem!But on a more basic level, Ralph Moody simply had a fantastic gift for telling a story that is engaging, unique, suspenseful, poignant, informative, delightful. It seems clear that Ralph kept a fairly detailed diary from his early years (although the only verification that I've found of this assumption is Ralph's own reference to \\"going off to write in my journal\\" when he lived in Maine). His ability to recreate events that happened years earlier, and his ability to describe them so wonderfully, speak to a lifetime of observing and writing about the world around him from an early age.Alas, I have not been able to find any satisfying information about \\"the rest of the story\\" about Ralph Moody outside of his eight books. We know he worked for Procter & Gamble in California and had a long marriage with three children. The National Little Britches Rodeo Association was started in Littleton after this book was published in 1950, although, incredibly, the rodeo association does not credit Ralph Moody on its own website (not that I could find)!For anyone who has a love of the West--or rural life in general--in the twilight of the era before WWI, and who loves good writing about an amazing life, I implore you to get and read all eight books in this series!PS--One little note: the subtitle \\"Father and I Were Ranchers\\" may lead you to guess that this is a story of a cattle rancher. In fact, farms of that day were generally referred to as \\"ranches\\" even though the primary function was growing crops, not cattle."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Because I was in the middle of another book when this arrived in my mail box, I had no intention of reading it immediately. However, after casually reading the first couple of chapters I found myself constantly feeling drawn back to the book while I went about my day. Suffice it to say, the other book was put down for a couple of days, while I indulged myself in Little Britches.At its most basic level, this story is about a poor family trying to make a go of ranching in Colorado back around the turn of the 20th century. Pretty basic right, so what is so compelling about it? For me, it is the simplicity. The matter-of-fact narration. Its example of good character without being preachy. The continuous pickles Ralph Moody gets himself into as he struggles to find the self-discipline that goes along with good character. Its understated humour and sometimes painful honesty. The growth of a young boy as he eagerly takes on the responsibilities and challenges of a man.Perhaps the only two things I didn't like about the book, is that there is a small amount of bad language and there were a couple of unexpected twists to the story that I didn't particularly appreciate but accept as necessary nonetheless as the book is autobiographical.I found this book to be soul-enlarging and completely engaging. It's a true classic in that you walk away a better person after reading it. I can't wait to share it with my childen. As for myself - I'm back for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Little Britches is a fantastic book. It takes the reader back to early 1900 Colorado and a family who loved each other and worked very hard as they struggle to build their ranch. This is the first book in a series and once you start reading you won't want to stop. Ralph (Little Britches) learns a lot of life's lessons the hard way. His father's parenting skills gently lead Ralph to make the right choices. There are horses, cowboys, and a water rights fued that provide excitement as well as many warm family moments."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This book, like the Little House books, gives a true look at what life was like in the past. I was amazed at what such a seemingly young boy was able to do. Kids really did grow up a lot faster then.The story tells about farming, raising cattle, cowboys (real cowboys), making do, being neighborly, dealing with not-so-neighborly people, taking responsibility for your actions, and so much more.The author tells a story that is believeable and satisfying. This is a great read-to-yourself or read-aloud. Please note there is some 'cowboy language' but nothing horrible and you can easily substitute other words in their place."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Oh I am speechless. This is a book full of grace, character, This is the writers real life boyhood and apparently thought he could make a good book out of it. Boy was he right!

Speechless!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"My 6th grade teacher read this book aloud, and I couldn't wait to start reading it to my own students someday. I can't think of a better book for teaching core values and strength of character that doesn't preach, (not to mention Colorado state history and autobiography for you teachers out there). You will laugh &amp; cry through all the trials of family survival out west and the timeless tribulations of growing up and being the new kid at school.I read this to all my fourth grade classes, making sure that the last reading had absolutely no absences from dental appts etc. and every year it was voted by my students as the best loved read aloud of the year.This is one of those rare true stories that will help your family/class bond together and which you'll want to read over and over. My wish is that every teacher/parent will share this gem with their kids. It truly is a classic - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Ralph Moody's account of his boyhood days in Littleton, Colorado is an inspiring story of courage and pluck. Ralph, aka as Little Britches, has some hard lessons to learn, but is given quite a bit of freedom to do so by his father. The elder Moody is the quintessential father everyone wishes they had. Together they make an unbeatable team. This is the first in a series of seven books. I highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"My fifth grade daughter and I are completely captivated with Ralph Moody.This story of the struggles of a family moving to a ranch in Colorado at the turn of the century made us laugh and cry and long to know more.It teaches so much about life in America before there was any &quot;safety net.&quot; Young Ralph had to be the hardest working lad in the area, but he had adventures and made friends anyone would envy.We were most struck by the way the family supported each other both materially and emotionally.Through their overwhelming struggles, they became strong and compassionate.We can't wait to read his other books!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"In response to PA review: I asked my students what they thought about Ralph's spankings. They said that the ones Ralph received did not injure him in any way and helped him learn. My 6th graders thought the content warning was completely out of line.

Don't know how to compare the book, almost like a boy Laura Ingalls, but different."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This book gave great insight into what being a parent really means. Life is not easy. This book shows that responsibility, trust, patience, love, and honesty are required. It gives great examples to show how to use everyday life as a teaching tool for your children as well as for yourself. The lessons contained in this book, if applied, could change the way you look at yourself, your children, and life in general."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"If a classroom full of students with BEHAVIOR problems can sit through this book without incident, you can imagine how compelling this story is.Little Britches is the first book in an autobiographical series. Ralph Moody (aka Little Britches) tells us about his family's move from the East and their struggles and triumphs as they scrape a living from a ranch in Colorado. Ralph is 9 years old, with an older sister and several younger siblings. The book is much more than a chronology of interesting and exciting events-- much more. It is rich in the values of honesty, family unity, ingenuity, and the pride of doing a task well.There are many strong messages about building character -- earning trust, earning respect, and giving a man a good day's work. Ralph's wonderfully wise father is his primary teacher regarding the building of Ralph's \\"character house\\", but along the way Ralph meets other memorable men -- \\"Hi\\" the cowboy was our favorite. Ralph gets in several predicaments, doesn't always make the right choice, but takes to heart his father's wise counsel.This book is a true treasure. I would recommend it for ages 5 and up as a read aloud. 10 and up to be read alone. A great read for adults too -- a \\"can't miss\\" present. Don't hesitate -- put it in your library and then share the gift of this wonderful author."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Little Britches is one the best books we have ever read! It has sparked a number of conversations with my young sons about character and wise choices. This morning I even pulled it out to read a quote from it after they had disobeyed me about something! The quote is something Ralph's father says to him after he (Ralph) has lied: \\"If (a man) tells lies to be able to do the things he shouldn't do but wants to, his character will soon become a ruin. A man with a ruined character is a shame on the face of the earth.\\"I highly recommend this book BUT please be aware that it does contain cursing! Fortunately, we are reading this aloud, so I can skip over objectionable words, but in all the reviews I have read (on Amazon and elsewhere), no one has mentioned this. Am I the only one who objects to my elementary-school aged children reading curse words?Anyway, wonderful book, HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"In 1987 while living in Haines,Alaska;I asked the librarian for a good book. I wanted something like Little House on the Prairie kind of story. She handed me Little Britches. I took it home and read the most wonderful adventure of a boy, growing up and learning lessons in life. It touched my heart so deeply I felt I knew him. I returned to the library after I had finished reading the book and asked if he had written any other's. The library owned one other book by Ralph Moody and that was Man of the Family. It was checked out,and not due in for two weeks. I put in a request and waited anxiously. When I finally was able to read it, it was just as wonderful as the first. To my delight Mr. Moody had written many books of his childhood. I have six children who love me to read these stories to them. Of all the books I have ever read, I must say by far that Ralph Moody's Little Britches is my all time favorite book."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I've read the Little House on the Prairie and Anne of Green Gables series and this beats the lunch money out of both those series! I'm in my mid-twenties and read this aloud with my parents who are in their mid-sixties and we couldn't put it down! We'd read together late into the night, and steal it away to read ahead on our own whenever we could. Little Britches is tough, brave, and hilarious! Ralph Moody has written in a wonderfully straightforward manner of the joys and tragedies of a life lived with dignity, honor, and especially humor. \\"Father\\" teaches so simply and beautifully the way to love and raise children. His family becomes so real that you feel like you're saying goodbye to your best friend when the book ends. I laughed and cried and practically wet my pants because I couldn't bear to take a break in the middle of the chapter. I'll read this one over and over. It's something that grows into you and is impossible for you to grow out of.P.S. DO NOT read this series out of order."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Little Britches is the sort of book that you wish could be made available to every man, woman and child in today's mixed up world. It is wonderfully inspirational and would go a long way toward making you think about what is really important in life and how you ought to go about being the best kind of human being that you could be. I have re-read the entire Little Britches series for the last 20-plus years and just recently ordered the entire set from Amazon.com. I am thrilled to think that they are still in print and I look forward to many years of enjoyable re-reading of them again. Do yourself a favor and buy Ralph Moody's books. He had tremendous insight about life and living. He would undoubtedly be the kind of man we'd all like to know, be friends with, have as a dad, husband, brother etc. You'll love his books. You'll laugh and cry and be transported back into a wonderful time of life.

I didnt know any other books from this author existed until a couple of years ago, when I ran accross the entire box set. my whole family has enjoyed them; both as read aloud books for the younger kids but as quiet reading for the older ones as well as my wife and I. I read the entire series at least once a year, and they never fail to bring a warm feeling to my heart, as well as a close feeling of family ties and kinship to the rural way of life. If the kids of today cared half as much for the well being of the family as Ralph Moody did for his, this would be a much better world to live in"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"When his New England family is obliged to move out to frontier Colorado at the Turn of the Century, Ralph Moody quickly delights in the western lifestyle. But before the 8-year-old boy can start taming horses and herding cows, he has many hard lessons to learn himself along the difficult road of life, in order to build the walls of his \\"character house.\\"The Moodys rent land and a rundown shack on the flatlands outside of Denver, but they must struggle for economic and physical survival in a never-ending series of battles against Nature, the Gold Panic, accidents, his father's weak lungs and the vicious water hogs at the head of Bear Creek. Ralph's own impetuosity and sneakiness land him in trouble, often requiring his parents' ingenuity and patience in meting out deserved, but character-buildihng, punishment. The seemingly incorrigible boy is a source of both pride and despair to his hard-working, honest parents, who strive to prevent their offspring from losing their gentlemanly upbringing in the wild Colorado boonies.Ralph must come of age in the family's first three and years as Westerners. He meets an old Indian named Two Dog with whom he establishes an immediate and lasting, though rarely verbal, friendship. He confesses his \\"crime\\" to the tall, tough Sheriff of Fort Logan, though he never tells Mothers that he did so in a saloon! He idolizes a friendly cowboy named Hi Beckman, who teaches him invaluable lessons about training horses and cows, plus stunt riding and even how to shoot a gun.But it is Ralph's relationship with his adored Father which proves the core of this heartwarming story. Father doesn't say much, but he provides his son with serious advice for a healthy, decent life. Being promoted to Partner by his father is a great joy to Ralph, who at 11 and was accepted as a man in many ways. LITTLE BRITCHES-Ralph's nicknamed given by his cowboy mentor-is a a wonderful, warm, and interesting story, for kids of all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I read this book after my 9-year old finished it for school. The lessons and values that Ralph Moody learned growing up are so good and true-even if sometimes they were learned the hard way. Mr. Moody's book teaches wonderful values like responsibility, respect, honesty, hard work, and committment and support of the family. The part I liked best was the relationship that Ralph had with his father. This world would be a much brighter place to live in if every son had a father like Ralph's. I think a dad reading this to his kids would teach lessons they all would remember."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I'm 10 yeas old.

After that, they were hooked, and we have continued to read the rest of the series. The values of hard work and honesty are present throughout, which makes this a wonderful teaching tool. My children have acted out scenes from the story because the lively adventures of the Moody children are irrestistible.

My ten year old daughter enjoyed the stories and the family immensely. But the life lessons on how to grow up to be a man of character are incredible. The father is full of wisdom that is passed to us through the books pages.

I read it many years ago when I was in school and wanted to read it again. It is a great book that I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"If I could give 10 stars to this book I would! I read Little Britches to my children ages 6 & 8 last year and we are now on the 7th book in the series (of 8 books). Little Britches (book 1) is still by far my favorite, but they are all wonderful. While we enjoyed Little House on the Prairie, I would say these rank even higher and they are especially good for boys (although my daughter and I love them just as much as my son). As a young man, Ralph Moody made himself a promise that he would save [...] by the time he was 50 years old and would write a book. This is the book he began on the eve of his 50th birthday. Ralph is 8 years old in this first book, in 1906 and his family has just moved west to help his father's tuberculosis (he's a \\"lunger\\" as the book says). They spend three years struggling to make a go of ranching and Ralph learns most of his lessons the hard way. His father, Charles, is a huge influence on Ralph. He is a patient, resourceful, upright man who is devoted to his family and to teaching his son to be a man of character. The book is never preachy however. All of the lessons are demonstrated but not outright told. My children get it though, even at their young ages! Even though the father is only in the first book, his presence is felt throughout the whole series in the lessons that Ralph learned from him (\\"always give a man a full day's work for a day's wage.\\")After reading it aloud to my kids, I purchased it on CD, read by Cameron BeireleFather and I Were Ranchers (The Little Britches Series Book 1) [UNABRIDGED] and they have worn it out listening to it in their rooms. Mr. Beirele does an excellent job doing the voices (book 6 six is a little different but still not bad). We now have all the books in print and audio CD (except book 8 which is seems you have to get as an MP3 download). My absolute favorites are the first 4 (Little Britches: Man of the Family (The Little Britches Series) [UNABRIDGED]The Home Ranch (Bison Book)andMary Emma & Company (Bison Book). The Fields of Home turns out good, but his crotchety old grandfather just about drove me crazy. Shaking the Nickel Bush is probably the least favorite. Ralph has a \\"buddy\\" named Lonnie that is a lazy leech and I kept preaching for Ralph to dump him through the whole book. When he is finally rid of him, he finds all of his savings is gone too. That one might be better read than listened to because the Lonnie character is grating and Mr. Beirele suddenly can't get situated on a voice for Ralph and it changes throughout the CD.I think these books should be required reading in every home in America. We need more everyday heros to emulate. Ralph was a dutiful, devoted son who was not afraid to write about the dumb things he did as well as the smart ones. Just be aware there is some \\"cowboy language\\" in most of the books. That's how I described it to my children and they understood - we are not cowboys. It is certainly mild by today's standards but still bears mentioning. The family is a family of faith and that is more impressionable than the language. Just d**n and h*ll is all I remember hearing.Some other Moody favorites areCome on Seabiscuit!;Stagecoach West; andKit Carson and the Wild Frontier."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I first read this book in 1956 shortly after it was published. This is probably my favorite book of all time and I am a voracious reader. I own several first editions of Mr Moody's books including an autographed copy of this one.This book is must reading for families as it teaches the values that made this Country what it is. Hard work. Self Reliance. Honesty. Honor.This book and the books in this series helped form the value system that stays with me to this day and served me throughout a successful career in commercial construction and in raising a family of my own.I am now buying copies for my grandkids as they get to the age that they will understand the lessons contained in Mr Moody's books."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Ralph Moody, similar to the style of Laura Ingalls Wilder, wrote a series of books about his life dating back to 1906. His first book, Little Britches, starts when he is eight years old and his family moves from New Hampshire to Colorado to start life on a ranch out west. His father's health isn't so great, so fresh air and wide open spaces was what the doctor ordered. They arrive to find things not quite as they were lead to believe. But, through hard work and ingenuity they find a way to make things work, for a little while. Ralph never really knew his father before then, but with Ralph the closest thing to another man to rely on his father started working with him and teaching things he would need to know to grow up and \\"build a house of character\\". Between these lessons, and some others he learns the hard way, Ralph grows and talks about his experiences out west at the turn of the century.I found myself enjoying this book quite a lot as it reminded me almost of a \\"boys\\" version of the Little House on the Prairie. I don't remember quite so much ethics being instilled in that series as there is in Little Britches. Ralph Moody talks about his father's lessons and writes some very strong themes about character and about morality about hard work and ethics and about what it takes to be a man that is respected.His writing was simple and straight forward and very refreshing. It was very clean reading, and easy and simple for a ten-year-old to read and enjoy. The humor was also very well done, either in droll remembrances or occasionally in the dialog, some of it designed to go over eight-year-old Ralph's head, and some of it designed to go over a child reader's head as well to the parent over their shoulder. There is also some swearing, but it is mild and placed in a negative light.I enjoyed reading about the variety of colorful characters introduced, from the Native American Two Dog to the Cowboy Hi. The situations and troubles he gets himself in and out of will be at once familiar to a school age child (fights at school, chores at home and interfering siblings) and potentially foreign (meeting the sheriff in a saloon, learning how to trick ride a horse, working as a cow hand on a ranch). Familiar enough to learn from, interesting enough to keep their attention.I would definitely recommend this book and the series that follows to any young kids that might already be interested in similar books, such as the Little House on the Prairie series. It has some good strong messages and is some easy, clean reading that you can enjoy at any age."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Little Britches is a warm entertaining book, at the same time showing how a family used their God given ingenuity to provide for themselves with dignity.Children love this book , imagining themselves doing the things Ralph did,trick riding or working as a cowboy on a ranch.The book made its appearance in 1950. It is as fresh today as it was then. Father had TB. Cousin Phil painted a bright picture of ranch life not far from Denver, Colorado.He implied making a living would be easy and the dry climate would make a new man out of Father. They put hope in his word. Sold their home and everything in it. When they got to the so called ranch,it was a discouraging mess,just a three room cottage hauled out from Denver. Most of the windows were broken and the chimney broken off. Father thought he could make it livable so he and eight year old Ralph got to work.The following spring when Ralph and his Mother were planting their vegetable garden a group of cowboys came by. Ralph liked the one named Hi immediately but his Mother didn't. He let Ralph ride his horse and showed him trick riding and knowing her son that scared her.That summer Ralph got a job herding cows on horse back. Alone he figures out how to do trick riding and practices until he can do it well but of course he doesn't tell his Mother.He unintentionally traps a pheasant. Shooting a pheasant is illegal in Colorado. Although it was an accident his Father makes him ride to town to show it to the sheriff. He found the sheriff in the Last Chance Saloon. Slowly he went in threw the swinging doors. The bar tender bellowed, \\"Who do you want to see?\\" Ralph answered. The bar tender pointed to the biggest man Ralph had ever seen.Ralph had many exciting and sometimes dangerous adventures like tornadoes and the time he broke nine toes. He became a cowboy and earned a man's wage. There were water fights and shootings. This is a great true story and brings enjoyment to everyone who reads or hears it."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"My daughter called me tonight from a bookstore and asked about a book for my 7 yr old grandson. I told her without reservation, get him a copy of Little Britches. I read it nearly 60 years ago and this book still stands out in my mind as one of the best I've ever read. As so many other reviewers have said, it is all about character building and a boy learning how to become a man. Another thing that makes it so compelling is that it does its job without bad language or behavior. When I began looking in Amazon for a copy for him a lot of the anecdotes started coming back.I think this speaks well for a book read as a child that long ago.Get it for your children!

His unique story-telling voice is authentic and appealing, drawing both young and old in. The emotions conveyed throughout these pages are compelling--surprisingly so since it's told from a young boy's perspective.The account begins in 1906, and Ralph's family has just moved from the East Coast to a Colorado ranch in hopes of improving Ralph's father's health. Using both the risks and the excitement of their new ranching lifestyle, Ralph's father teaches his eight-year-old son the weighty principals of integrity, courage, and upright character.\\"A man's character is like his house. If he tears boards off his house and burns them to keep himself warm and comfortable, his house soon becomes a ruin. If he tells lies to be able to do the things he shouldn't do but wants to, his character will soon become a ruin. A man with a ruined character is a shame on the face of the earth,\\" his father explains.Ralph and his family encounter a variety of exciting events during their first few years in Colorado: tornados, school fights, rodeos, auctions, personal tragedies, roundups, and trick riding, to name a few. Each new experience increases the father-son bond and puts Ralph one step closer to manhood. But don't let me deceive you into assuming this book is all seriousness; there are plenty of hearty laughs to be had along the way!While Ralph's story may be especially appreciated by those with a soft spot for cowboys, it is also sure to be thoroughly enjoyed by practically anyone who loves family or has been a child once himself. The tenderness, joys, humor, and heartaches conveyed within Father and I Were Ranchers are universal experiences that we can all, at least to a certain extent, relate to. And I raise an skeptical eyebrow toward anyone who won't admit to shedding genuine tears by the end of this, the first book in the Little Britches series. Though not without its flaws, Father and I Were Ranchers provides excellent springboards for discussion on many important life issues.This one is definitely worth owning. It's also an excellent audio book.

What a beautiful story it was! There are two things the uninitiated might want to know: One, Moody is writing from his childhood. When he revealed what people said, and they used colorful, adult language, he puts it in the book. Because I was the one reading it, I said, \\"blip,\\" and my children knew it involved bad language. Ralph's family didn't talk that way, but some neighbors and work associates did, so when they said it, it was in the book.The other thing you will want to know is that this book leaves you wanting more. It is the beginning of a series, and my children would love it, I think, if I never read them anything but the sequels until the series is finished. We are midway through the second book now.I highly recommend it. As a mother, knowing the language is there, I would still permit my children to read it themselves. It is the kind of thing that we wouldn't say, but might hear on television. There may have been one time with something stronger than that, but I'm not certain about that. Otherwise, it involved things you can't shelter them from in the real world."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"This is a wonderful look into how life was...

Great character lessons about growing up, responsibility, honesty, etc. And Ralph Moody is a great story teller."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"It is 1906, and eight-year-old Ralph Moody's family is getting ready to move. They live in East Rochester, NH, and Ralph's father Charles works in the woolen mills, but it isn't good for his lungs. Cousin Phil who lives in Denver, CO, visits and convinces Father that ranching in Colorado would be better for his health. So Father, Mother, Grace, Muriel, Philip, Hal, and Ralph rent a ranch on the Fort Logan-Morrison road, near Littleton, CO, not far from Denver. This autobiographical book chronicles their first year which involves settling on the ranch, planting crops, raising animals, meeting neighbors, going to school, experiencing a huge wind storm, and fighting over irrigation rights. Ralph, who becomes known as \\"Little Britches,\\" learns how to be a cowboy and even participates in a rodeo, but will the ranch be successful? Will the family even survive?This series of books has long been recommended by homeschoolers as the \\"Little House for Boys.\\" First, there are some negatives, one of which is language issues. One catalogue says, \\"Be aware, however, that there is some inappropriate language used - no doubt in keeping with the actual verbiage of rugged cowboys and characters of the time.\\" Another catalogue says, \\"an excellent read-aloud selection (which will allow you to filter out the smattering of \`cuss' words that occur, and which Moody himself wasn't allowed to use as a lad).\\" And still another catalogue says, \\"A customer pointed out that there are a few undesirable words used to watch out for.\\" Also, several who have read the entire series have noted that the later books, especially after Ralph goes to live with his grandfather in The Fields of Home, are not as good as the earlier ones which detail his childhood because they are more \\"dark\\" with lots of bad attitudes which are displayed over and over.However, there are also some strong positives. Little Britches is rich in the values of family unity, honesty, inventiveness, earning others' trust, and satisfaction in a job well done. And there is great emphasis on character development. Ralph gets in several predicaments and doesn't always make the right choice, but he learns to do better by heeding his father's wise advice, who said, \\"Any man who says the world owes him a living is dishonest. The same God that made you and me made this earth. And He planned it so that it would yield every single thing that the people on it need. But He was careful to plan it so that it would only yield up its wealth in exchange for the labor of man. Any man who tries to share in that wealth without contributing the work of his brain or his hands is dishonest.\\" The seven sequels are Man of the Family, The Home Ranch, Mary Emma and Company, The Fields of Home, Shaking the Nickel Bush, The Dry Divide, and Horse of a Different Color."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I read this to my children when they were young, and am now reading it to my grandson.

That would have been back in the 60's. It truly is a book that changed my life.I'm now reading this book to my youngest child. He's a 10 year old boy who, like Ralph, has just moved from the city to rural life on a farm.I MUST recommend this book to dads to read with their young sons. Ralph is so honest as he relates his struggles to reach maturity, to earn the respect of his peers and to live up to the steady and loving example of his father. My son begs me to read more of this story every night.An earlier comment on this book mentions occasional curse words. Please don't let this put you off. The language is common on TV and movies. The other men in the book speak as men often do. But the example of Ralph's father, a man who never loses control of himself and never swears within ear-shot of his own children provides a valuable example and counter point. There is a level of strong male kindness and maturity in this story sadly lacking in literature today. And it's a thrilling read.When I was 10, the book made me want to be Ralph. As I read it now, it makes me want to be as wise and understanding as Charlie (the dad). I still can't read the chapter, \\"Father and I Become Partners\\" Without being moved by the story of a father lifting his son up to manhood.In short, Ralph delivers a pleasingly paced narrative with a keen ear for language, a sharp eye for details of farm life and horsemanship and a clear honest memory of a boys'life at the turn of the 20th Century.Read this book. It has lived in me for years and has now earned a special place in my farm library."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"Ralph Moody has just turned eight when he and his family--father and mother, eleven-year-old sister Grace, and younger sibs Muriel Joy (five), Philip (three and a half), and Hal (going on two)--move to Colorado early in 1907 to settle on a rented \\"ranch\\" (more of a farm than anything). Ralph's father Charlie, though reared on a farm in Maine, has worked for years in a New Hampshire woollen mill and suffers from lung trouble, and Cousin Phil, a mining-stock booster in Denver, manages to persuade reluctant Mother that in Colorado his health can be restored in a year and he \\"can make as much money as he'd make here...in a lifetime.\\" As you might expect of a stock booster, Cousin Phil's predictions fall somewhat short of the reality--it may be the 20th Century, but life outside the cities isn't too different from what it was 30 or 40 years earlier: indoor toilets are unknown, and cowboys still carry six-guns as they ride the range. But the Moodys make the best of it. Father turns out to be a creative manager who swaps livestock shrewdly and trades work for the goods the family needs (one of my favorite scenes involves the moving entire of a disused bunkhouse, bigger than the whole three-room house that comes with their rented land, to create bedrooms for the children and a bigger kitchen), and a perceptive parent who teaches the lessons of character in a quiet, understandable way--and realizes that boys shouldn't be turned into Lord Fauntleroys or expected to always \\"turn the other cheek.\\" Though the family sees barely $100 in cash in a year, they manage to eat well, send the children to school, enjoy good books and accumulate an impressive menagerie of domestic animals, and Ralph falls in love with the West (a love that will later be expressed in a long list of books about it, including several sequels to this one). There are moments of thrills (the windstorm that nearly destroys their house and forces them to crawl to shelter in a nearby gulch), joy (picnics in the mountains, Christmas feasts), quiet family togetherness (Mother reading aloud in the evenings), humor (like the fight between Jerry Alder and the Denver man while Ralph and his father are helping a neighbor with his threshing), and even danger (Father's participation in a battle over the neighborhood irrigation ditch, which culminates in what may be the first recorded attempt at a drive-by shooting), besides an assemblage of unforgettable characters--Fred Aultland, the rancher next door, who drives around at full speed in a buckboard drawn by two mettlesome bays, and his mother and sister; Hi, the cowboy, who becomes Ralph's idol (one of the best sequences in the book shows them breaking in a new young horse, the twin of Hi's own blue roan, and training the two in a precision trick-riding routine that takes first place at the annual rodeo), Mr. Thompson who claims to have known Kit Carson and his partner the Blackfoot Indian Two Dog who can gentle the wildest horse and cure the sickest, and of course Cousin Phil--and Father. Through their four years in Colorado, until Charlie dies of pneumonia, Ralph comes to know his father as he never did before, and to love and respect him for his ethics, his skills, his gentleness and firmness, and his understanding of the human condition. And in the end he emerges ready to become, at 12, the \\"man of the family.\\" This is a book for families to enjoy and young and old to read independently, a book that shows something of the reality of pioneering and would fit splendidly into a homeschooling curriculum. No American should fail to read it."},{"Title":"Little Britches","review":"I have read Little Britches and its sequel, Man of the Family to my 6th grade history students and to my 4th grade students for five years now.

We may even focus on ancient history and how Greek and Roman democracy are celebrated without focusing on the fact that such societies had a built-in slave system. Then again, today's western societies are free and democratic and are celebrated as such, but you had better not state that a large sector of the population within any one of those free and democratic states is enslaved to international finance. But slavery of that kind is always attributed and explaind with reference to personal failings.Amelia Phillips Aremia manages to break this stereotypical way of viewing complex human interactions by focusing on McDonogh's personal written record and, of course, on the \`worn, stained, and brittle yellowish pages curled at the corners' of his old leather-bound Bible. Add to that the patriotism of the Federalist kind that Donogh's father inculcated his son with and the stage is set for a tense and productive journey through life. Early impressions included the boy sitting on his father's broad shoulders and standing under an elm tree watching George Washington \`take the oath of office as the first president of the United States'.During the late 18th century, before the \`French Revolution' and before the US War of Independence, the political climate in the colonies was well informed by a \`transplanted Britisher', Professor Emerson Forsyth, the headmaster of young John Donogh's school. Forsyth predicted that the young German genius, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel, would influence future political theorists.There is another episode at school that young John survives - the proverbial fight begun by an older boy, which John won, but then concluded the episode without accepting the extended hand held out to him by the older boy, Billy. John's father severely admonishes his son for this because \\"Hate is the mark of a little man, and an expensive luxury. God teaches us that we must forgive if we wish to earn His forgiveness.\\" John and Billy become friends.A subtle rivalry developed over Maria and John won out, for a while, until the young woman, Maria, with her family travelled to Liverpool, England. Billy was also on that trip. Later John receives a letter from Maria, posted from Birmingham, wherein she still expressed her love for John, though now she was already married to Billy! And, like many individuals who lose their first love, John began to acquire the necessary knowledge needed to build a mercantile empire. Later, during his own time in Liverpool, John recalled his father's lesson, and so he sent the couple a wedding present.What follows is a detailed personal account of John developing his empire, and being a pious man, rumour had it that John had God on his side. French and Spanish Catholicism and English Protestantism co-existed in the young French colony as traders plied their wares from the New World to the Old World. Then in July 1803 Napoleon sold Louisiana to the US for $15 m. something the Federalists objected to because it was believed the foreign-speaking Roman Catholics could not be absorbed and thus would threaten the developing democratic way of life within the USA nation. Sounds familiar, doesn't it.The author continues in this vein, making indirect comparisons with today's prevailing US social fabric. It is such insights that humanise and universalise the American dream of old, of how the pioneering spirit enables individuals, at considerable personal sacrifices, to rise above their station in life.The young bachelor John McDonogh grows older as his business flourishes and his social calendar keeps him busy. He becomes a fine art and furniture collector but separation from his parents living in Baltimore, especially from his mother, did cause some grief for which he compensated by inviting his younger brother to stay with him at New Orleans. Yet that, too, reverberates into the usual family tensions most readers who have brothers and sisters would be familiar with.By Chapter Six the European battlefield was dominated by Napoleon, which reflected its effects in trade with the new world. In 1808 the foreign slave trade was abolished, and \\"Professional slave traders ...and prosperous dabblers in slave traffic-among them John McDonogh Junior-now had to turn to the eastern seaboard for new stocks of black laborers\\".Add to that a personal tragedy, the death of his mother while he suffered another severe attack of malaria, McDonogh's faith carried him through more tough personal crises - his father's dying a year later.In 1810 Donogh worried about his Florida holdings because armed American settlers planned a coup to capture Baton Rouge, which succeeded, and Congress approved it by incorporating West Florida into the Orleans territory, later to become Louisiana.Donogh's humane attitude to summary judgments when escaped slaves are caught did not endear him to the locals who had no time for legal niceties. Likewise he felt for the Creole planters, but then he had also developed a reputation: \\"His ruthless oppression of debtors and gentle acts of charity presented a perplexing dichotomy to his critics...\\". And still John soldiered on by enabling his slaves to have time for themselves on Sundays to study the Bible, and giving them his name by permitting them to call themselves McDonogh, and supporting any moves to enable slaves to buy their freedom - then to re-settle in Liberia.When his young sweetheart Maria returns he realized he had never stopped loving her, while she went on to have a family:\\"...None of John's friends, both old and new, could remember when they had seen him so happy, or look so young. He was actually handsome again. Before the evening ended, everyone expected momentarily, to hear a marriage announcement.\\"Unfortunately, for Maria, \\"With John, always so wrapped up in his own doings, there would have been much confusion and bitter selfishness...John never mentioned her after she returned to Baltimore\\".- and then John McDonogh Junior died of cholera. The message in this book is multi-layered where personal and public aspects of John McDonogh's life are effectively interwoven, and they speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Reproductive Biology and Early Life History of Fishes in the Ohio River Drainage, Vol. 4: Percidae - Perch, Pikeperch, and Darters","review":"This monumental seven volume work covers the early life of most of the fishes in the Ohio River Basin. This is volume 4 and covers the percidae family. This includes fish such as the perch, pikeperch and darters that are found not only in the Ohio but throughout much of the rest of the United States.The book concentrates on the early life of the fish, which is distinctly different from the life of the adult fish. This provides invaluable information for anyone interested in protecting the spawning grounds or habitat of the fish.This is a very large book, it reports on extensive research on these fish including drawings, measurements, distinguishing characteristics, and more.

The others were (in order of my preference) &quot;Your Memory : How It Works &amp; How to Improve It&quot; by Kenneth Higbee, &quot;The Memory Book&quot; by Lorayne and Lucas, Buzan's &quot;Use You Perfect Memory&quot;, &quot;How to Develop a Superpower Memory&quot; also by Lorayne and finally Kevin Trudeau's &quot;Mega-Memory&quot;.The techniques are organized a little differently from most books and he separates them into minor and major systems. The minor systems are the simple pegging systems, which associate the numbers 1-10 (or letters A-Z) with what you want to rememeber.The major system is usually called the phonetic system or numbers to letters. It is a phonetic substitution for numbers that let you turn a number into letters and words. Most memory books also include this system.Of course, all of the books have chapters on remembering names from faces, the most common memory trouble that people have. They all give the same suggestions with little variation and all of them work very well.Overall, I liked Buzan, but thought Higbee's book was much better. If you only want the techniques and don't care about background and research results, this book is as good as any (Lorayne and Lucas's &quot;The Memory Book&quot; is very comparable to this one). If you want more depth and information, I suggest &quot;Your Memory&quot; by Ken Higbee, which is a much more complete reference to memnonics and memory in general."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"&quot;Use Your Perfect Memory&quot; is one of a whole slew of brainpower books written by Tony Buzan. All these books repeat material found in other books, to a greater or lesser degree...he recycles the same information over and over and over again, and his various books are, it seems, often little more than an expansion upon a core idea presented elsewhere.Be that as it may, the information and techniques he presents are generally fairly sound. I have yet to buy one of his books and to feel ripped off having done so...which is not something I can say about all the brainpower (or accelerated learning) books I've bought. One thing I like about Buzan's books is that they don't promise the sky, which SOOOOOO many other books in this genre do.This books presents 5 simple memory enhancement techniques, devices that can be used to memorize relatively short lists of information (under 20, generally). There is also a &quot;Master System&quot; which can be used to memorize 1,000 or more pieces of information. (Annoyingly, if you want to further develop this system, Buzan refers you to one of his other books--in fact, he refers you to his other books througout.) The systems can be modified to accomodate different types of information, and for different purposes. There is instruction on remember names and face, phone numbers, poems, dramatic parts, and exam information.Does it work? Actually, yes. There is nothing groundbreaking here, and nothing magical, but with minimal practice, you will enjoy noticeable results. I haven't used the Master System, so I cannot comment from experience on it, but the principles that it uses are the same as those used in the &quot;smaller&quot; systems, so there is no reason it shouldn't work. This stuff does take an effort, though, and in some cases it is probably better simply to *write* a list, rather than spend the time committing it to memory using even a minor system."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"After 4000+ seizures &amp; brain surgery, my memory had fallen into the impaired range.

It has done wonders for me."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"I've always been partial to the works of Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas in the field of memory, but this one is every bit as high quality. I like to call it \\"just like it only different.\\"Lorayne and Lucas' books contain the link, substitute words, and mnemonic systems for changing numbers to words. Buzan does this also, and in some places has more detailed information. He even gives the numbers from 100-1000 with substitute name suggestions for all of them. Especially valuable is chapter 11 entitled \\"Your memory's rhythms\\" in which he shows a time unit maximum recall graph.He also refers to left/right brain theories, which some people agree with and others don't. However, I believe that whatever your theory of right/left brain, you will still be greatly helped by using the visual suggestions he gives. It certainly does help the reader use the whole brain.As with all techniques, memory training requires effort. Studying is always a lot of work regardless of IQ and/or mental discipline. But books like this one make the process a lot more enjoyable, and I can truthfully say that the money I spent on it was more than worth it."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"I was a frustrated fifth grader when I read this book.

A wealth of new information has been learned about the brain since 1991. Personally I would recommend Kenneth L. Higbee's \\"Your Memory: How it Works and How to Improve it.\\" Not only is Higbee's book more thorough in discussing mnemonic techniques, he also delivers memory improvement from a more realistic and practical perspective."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"Memory improvement is completely within anyone's control and does not require abnormal brain power. Use Your Perfect Memory discusses many of the memory peg systems that can permit anyone willing to practice the ability to produce astounding retention. Tony Buzan has produced many books on improving memory, and in this book he has covered all his memory peg techniques as well as some history on the evolution of memory.Buzan makes it clear that powerful memory has little to do with brain capacity and everything to do with skill, practice, and technique. One only needs to spend thirty minutes practicing even one of his memory peg techniques to see the realization of this theory. These techniques will leave you with the ability (if you commit and practice) to retain unbelievable amounts of information that is considered very abnormal by most.I rate this book moderately because although it is useful and practical, it is not on par with most memory books in terms of the presentation of the material. Buzan's efforts in this book are geared to providing as many techniques as possible to permit one to discover an individual system that matches their preferences. Buzan writes in so much depth on each technique that the material is unnecessarily repetitive. Any capable reader will grasp the process quickly after reading the first memory peg system and easily identify the similarities among all systems thereafter, making much of the content excessive.I highly recommend Buzan as an author on memory improvement and have rated one of his other books very high, but I recommend passing on this book and seeking out some of his newer material."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"well done.A good use of money.Think i will improve my grade but contains the same info as harry lorayne's book the memory book.wonder who is the original source."},{"Title":"Use Your Perfect Memory","review":"Easy techniques that appear to be somewhat child-minded, nonetheless, they remain effective.

This is one of the more substantial books. The book has many contributors but is edited with a unified vocabulary. The editors were involved in the design of SGML and XML. The main purpose of the book is to evangelize XML. Why XML will take over the world or at least the world wide web. How SGML already keeps the airlines flying. Watch out for SGML when you read about crash investigations.There are some technical details in the book. It explains that a comment between &lt;!-- and --&gt; must not contain -- inside. It explains how to imbed scripts in XML between &lt;![CDATA[ and ]]&gt;. It explains that imbedded script must not contain ]]&gt;. It notices that this sequence could easily occur in JavaScript: a[b[2]]&gt;0.I think that these observations call for the redesign of the language, not for evangelizing it. A markup language designed for embedding scripts should have a user defined termination sequence like 'here document' in programming languages for working programmers. It should also have comments that could be nested. It should have more flexible ways to define string literals, like Perl.

As it stands, this book is a mere collection of &quot;case studies&quot; which in fact constitute little more than uncritical advertisement for the makers of fairly expensive products (all of which running on a popular proprietary operating system; some products running on competing platforms get a brief glimpse, but in no way as detailed as the above-mentionned). Why one is expected to pay dearly for such information is beyond me (although I did, by mail order... which further explains my frustration and disappointment). There is also the fact that the actual factual information there is (a very thin portion of the whole) is often presented in a rather infantile way which annoys more than it informs. Much more factual and useful information is readily available on the net.It would not be so bad if Goldfarb's book wasn't so expensive. This further adds to the unpleasant impression that this book is an attempt at cashing in fast on the xml craze.Any newcomer to xml will be MUCH better served with Bradley's book: very informative, factual, helpful and to the point."},{"Title":"The XML Handbook (3rd Edition)","review":"As a software developer and product designer, I was looking for a book on XML that could quickly give me an understanding of how XML works to allow me to ponder how I may apply it. I'm still looking. After a reasonably promising start (though a little too cute and rah-rah), there is a series of chapters that read like bad magazine articles geared toward managers. After a bit of puzzlement, I realized I needed to skip 400 pages ahead to get back to the explanation of how XML works! And in that section there are too many forward references to make reading comfortable. I have just ordered a second XML book. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"The XML Handbook (3rd Edition)","review":"The order of the chapters in this book is IMHO wrong - I think the XML-specification should be at the beginning and all of these sponsored chapters (30 (!)) full of advertisment for several products and companies should follow it.

Personally i skipped the following 20 chapters and read the last 10 chapters - these are really good."},{"Title":"The XML Handbook (3rd Edition)","review":"One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend. The authors sold corporate sponsorship of chapters and let each company write an chapter-length ad. Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos, but in a technical book? It's one thing to have ads in things where the cost is largely underwritten by the ads (like magazines), but its quite another to find 25% of a full-priced book filled with ads. Buying this book will only help to standardize this practice.

These chapters teach you the technical specifics of XML, DTD's, XSL, XPath, XPointer, XLink, and Schemas. A pretty fine introduction if you ask me. 5 stars for pages 720 thru 950. 0 stars for the rest of the book, and shame on the authors for subjecting their paying customers to such a glut of material.I'm tempted to take a set of tree-trimmers and chop off the first 720 pages.

If you are looking for a solid introduction to XML please don't buy this book. Its like learning to ride a bike by building your own bike out of paper. The author enjoys including bad jokes and then making you read footnotes explaining the joke. The author also devotes many pages on the exact use of terms. Most of the time an explanation of terminology is useful, however the author convolutes each definition with his own jokes and exhaustive list of misuses that you are often more confused after reading the definition. Sometimes the author will say &quot;This term should only be used to describe &lt;a&gt; and not &lt;b,c,d&gt; but we will still use it for &lt;b,c,d&gt; if the context fits. This is very confusing. Also, the author does not seem to think examples are important. The first 100 pages contain almost no examples. Often, XML concepts are illustrated with juveniles cartoon pictures and described with equally juvenile metaphors designed to be amusing instead of instructive. The author does not make it clear which concepts are essential and which elements are less important and throws them all together so you are forced to read 100 pages in order to glean 20 pages of useful material. If I was reading a book on how to ride a bike I would like to know where to put my feet and how to pedal. I don't care why the wheels shouldn't be called tires or who invented the first bicycle lock. In summary: This book has few examples in the early chapters. The content is mashed together. The content is confusing. It is filled with terrible jokes and annoying useless footnotes. This book is in DIRE need of an editor. The authors make a big deal of how they are experts in the field. Perhaps their importance in the XML field let them get away with light editing. Its a shame since the result is a terrible waste of a reference book. I would recommend the NUTSHELL series if they have one for XML. NUTSHELL books are usually concise, well edited, extremely informative, make excellent reference books, and are light on corny jokes."},{"Title":"The XML Handbook (3rd Edition)","review":"Although this book isn't very comprehensive in the turtorial part, it provides very solid foundations on the XML theories and practices.

I thought &quot;The XML Handbook&quot; would be something similar.The book contains, roughly, 100 pages of introduction to XML; 250 pages of tutorials on XML and its subcultures; and almost 600 pages of corporate presentations, of varying quality, on various aspects of XML application and implementation.The introduction and tutorials, although good, didn't have the depth I was looking for.The corporate bit addresses a very broad range of interesting issues, with varying levels of detail, but never enough to &quot;solve the problem&quot;.So for me, the signal-to-noise ratio was pretty low.Let me give an example of a major gap in the book's coverage: I had hoped to gain much more insight into the relative merits of using attributes as against using element content; but I finished the book no wiser than when I started (other than having seen some examples where I disagreed with the approach taken).The CD-ROMs didn't add much value, either: the web has moved on very rapidly.To add to my disappointment, the production of the book is not of a high standard.- The rendering of low-level headings leaves a lot to be desired (Ex: I looked at 33.2.2.6.4 on page 480 for fully 30 seconds before understanding that it was a heading). So does that of block quotes, which appear to run on to the following paragraph.- Many footnotes on a left-hand page with callouts on the previous page make reading a chore (Ex: fn #2 on pp 59 and 60). There is a general disdain for any attempt to keep figures on the same left-right page pair as their references.- It might have been less irritating, too, to use a single numbering space for all Figures, Examples, Tables, and Spec Excerpts, rather than obliging the reader to work out the sometimes subtle difference between &quot;Example 8-1&quot; and &quot;Figure 8-1&quot;.This book, I understand from the Preface, was itself prepared using XML. Unfortunately, good markup for publishing is of little use without excellent rendering. I got a strong impression of unseemly haste to get the book out before getting the rendering up to scratch. So readability was badly crippled (unlike The SGML Handbook).One last damn. So far, I've read the book just once. Although I'm kind to books, the cover is already dog-eared and de-laminating. It probably doesn't matter, because, in contrast to &quot;The SGML Handbook&quot;, reading this book a second time won't add anything. That's another reason I think it wrong to call it a Handbook.More in sorrow than in anger, then: two stars for Dr. Goldfarb, zero for Prentice-Hall."},{"Title":"The XML Handbook (3rd Edition)","review":"There are far better books, that cost less, are more concise andreveal a lot more about XML and the impact it is starting to have onsociety.

The authors develop the notion of why the web needs XML. After these appetizers, they give you a tiny taste of XML (syntax), XSL (style), and XLL (linking). And then they start cooking!

Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, \\"The Seance\\" and \\"The Letter Writer\\" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form."},{"Title":"THE SEANCE AND OTHER STORIES","review":"Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"},{"Title":"THE SEANCE AND OTHER STORIES","review":"&#34;The Seance&#34; is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them.

I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant."},{"Title":"THE SEANCE AND OTHER STORIES","review":"THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of \\"Yanda\\" is a provincial prostitute, while \\"Zeitl and Rickel\\" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a \\"take a book, leave a book\\" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate.

Born in Poland in 1936 he made his first book when he was only 8-years-old. It was a gift for his father. Due to the war his family left Poland and eventually settled in England where he would attend Kings College. It seems that his interest in stage design developed while he was there.Since his college days he has worked in publicity, advertising, and done stage designs for The Royal Ballet and Disneyland, Paris. Here, in America, we probably know him best for his amazing paper art. His pop-up books don't just spring forward, but swirl as in an octopus busily doing dishes or soar as in three geese flying across a mantel. Youngsters will be delighted to find this and so very much more in Haunted House.This is a place where ghosts hide under the stairwell and a portrait of La Gio Conda watches with the touch of a tab. Refrigerator doors swing open to reveal a very Muenster-like kitchen, while King Kong holds forth in the living room.Each double page is an amazing array of spooky sights just waiting for young fingers to release them.

Many of the pictures are funny, with things like a black cat in the toilet--the bathroom scene is one of my two favorites, in fact, with a fantastically silly buglike alien with peppermint lips bursting through the wall and an alligator in the tub. Although nothing is particularly frightening for most, parents will want to exercise a bit of judgement if their children are very sensitive--there's no blood, but there is a skeleton in the closet and a ghost hovering over a bed. If my child were prone to fears I would definitely skip this one. But most kids will love it, and, like Sesame Street, adults will find a few details put in only for them--the bookshelf, for example, has books labelled \\"Poe\\", \\"Bosch\\" and \\"Von Dani\\" with the remaining letters of that last name off the page--recognise it? (Hint: There's a spaceship on the same page!)We were given this book for my son probably 16 years ago. My daughter also enjoyed it as a child and in fact was just studying the pop-up techniques for her high school design technology class. Our original copy has held up well after all the years and all the loving, which speaks volumes for its construction--kudos to \\"paper engineer Tor Lokvig\\"!

Here, I learned much about SQL Server that I didn't know before, so with this book, you not only test your knowledge; you also learn while you do it.More than one author has contributed to this book, and it's my impression that the section(s) on the design test are more thoroughly worked out than the ones on the administration test.My only real gripe with this book is that some questions (most in the administration section) seem to have erronous answers, but it's not many.This book will not teach you SQL Server, but if you know the product already, this book can help you prepare for the test(s)."},{"Title":"MCDBA SQL Server 7 Test Yourself Practice Exams (Exams 70-028 & 70-029)","review":"The key to books like this one is understanding their limitations. The book does not claim to teach everything to pass the two exams it covers - it is simply a collection of practice questions and exams. And, to this end, it is a great book.For those with a strong understanding of the material (designing and implementing databases in SQL Server 7, and administering SQL Server 7), the book is excellent in giving you a feel for the topics to be covered in the final exam. It certainly helps you highlight areas of weakness which you need to address.In many ways, I like the style of the book, in that it does not really assist those trying to become paper MCDBAs (ie. with the certification, but without any practical knowledge), since it has a certain level of assumed knowledge.There are (in my opinion) some errors, but they seemed to be few and far between. Overall, a fine resource."},{"Title":"MCDBA SQL Server 7 Test Yourself Practice Exams (Exams 70-028 & 70-029)","review":"I thought that this books was wonderful, between this book and the transcenders I fell very prepared for these tests.

For the most part, this book accomplishes that (hence 3 stars). It does, however, have many subtle errors so you need to check each answer you get wrong with an authoritative resource, like SQL Server Books Online. For example, is says to upgrade SQL 6.5 to SQL 7.0 the SQL 6.5 system needs SP4 - which is incorrect, it needs SP3. Lots of little mistakes like that. By all means, use this book as a resource, but NEVER as your ONLY one.

I used it and had tons of notes in the margins. There were several small errors that I identified on my own. Yet not one question from this book was on either of these two exams that I took and passed.The value was to get practice. You have to practice multiple choice questions and you need the largest sample set you can get. Of course, this book provided sufficiently detailed answers to the questions. But it is as if Microsoft has its exam-creating staff find the gaps from this very book to create their questions.In the end, this book took tons of my quality time and gave me a dubious return. But there may have been an intangible benefit. It's likely that the practice itself got me thinking about how I would design the exam and anticipate even more questions. This may have helped me when I passed the exams.Finally, I've never experienced such a big exam prep book filled with nothing but practice questions that ended up being so far off the mark with regard to the real exams.

Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; a mathematical model, now called the Turing mashine. Why not two-level quantum systems? The thought was long in coming: From Bohr and Heisenberg to Feynman! The bright idea finally arrived, and with vengeance. An model for computation based on two-level quantum systems was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman and D. Deutsch. Then another wait: It wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the mid 1990ties that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the math community. The 'unbreakable' codes might be breakable afterall! The fact that Shor founda polynomial factoring algorithm naturally shook up the encryption community as well; and for obvious reasons. New elements of thinking in the quantum realm, and not partof the classical frame of mind, include the basics of quantum theory: superposition of (quantum) states, uncertainty, and(quantum) coherence. Although these concepts are at the foundation of quantum theory, they make a drastic change in the whole theoretical framework for computation: Now when one passes from the classical notion of bit-registers tothat of qubit-registers, the laws of quantum mechanics take over; and exclude the traditional cloning principle of error correction. Something different must take its place: A new theory! Mathematical physicist and computer scientists must revisit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates(unitary matrices), theconcept of switching-networks from computer science changes drastically. It introduces new challenges, and new truely exciting opportunities. It is not easy for authors who break with tradition to make everyone happy;-- this is especially so in a new field,--one which has grabbed headlines, and one whichis at the same time interdisiplinary. -- This intriguing book covers several of the appropriate areas of physics (quantum theory, (some) experiment...), of artificial intelligence, of philosophy, of computer science (the mathematical physics side of the subject), and of math (operators in Hilbert space, and the theory of algorithms). In my opinion, the author did a great job. The level of the book is suitable for grad students in math, in CS, and in physics: It could perhaps have used some more worked examples and exercises. (Fortunately they can be found in other books on quantum computation, such as the Nielsen-Chuang book.) This book is timeless,-- and I expect it will also be popular ten years from now."},{"Title":"Information Theory and Quantum Physics : Physical Foundations for Understanding the Conscious Process (Texts and Monographs in Physics)","review":"The author provides a wide-ranging and general treatment of information theory, with much of it from a broad understanding of the universe in terms of statistical physics and thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, special and general relativity, and even a few nods to the unification of these ideas within the context of string theory. This treatment is mathematically intensive and accessible to those who have, at the very least, taken graduate level courses in quantum mechanics. The author begins with a treatment of Shannon entropy in which he shows it to be equivalent to the information to be gained. He addresses many aspects of modern physics in order to provide an understanding of the systems in which information may be imbedded, including those involving particle spin. Information in the animal and human brain is also considered; in this case in terms of the diffusion of calcium ions through neural pathways and cell membranes.The author's wide ranging interest in quantum issues appear to have its origin, at least in part, to the fact that his Ph.D. adviser at University of Edinburgh was Max Born. Though Born, he also came to know many of the other great men who laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.This 6\\" x 9\\" book is fairly short, requiring only 209 pages to address all of physics, with pages 210-244 at the end of the book devoted to the appendices and bibliography.

Moses had two wives, Tharbis (an Ethiopian Princess and a Cushite) and Zipporah (a Midianite). His marriage to Tharbis after a military victory over the Ethiopians indicates Moses did have a previous career as a high ranking Egyptain General prior to going into exile. Something a former Hebrew slave would not have been allowed to do. He was also circumcised at a lodge on his way back to Egypt after 40 years in exile. This also indicates he was not of Hebrew parentage.

Michel Desmarquet is taken by extra-terrestials to the planet Thiaoouba on a mission to bring the people of earth the truth, told to Michel by Thao, a 9feet tall human looking hermaphrodite being. Along the Journey Michel and his ET friends station their craft over the planet Aremo X3 as its probes take samples from the planet to measure the nuclear radiation from the planet. Many of the people there appear to be deformed human beings as a result of radiation from nuclear war. The ETs are also known to lend a helping hand as they save the inhabitants of Aremo X3 from total annihilation from hundreds of mutated size ants (about medium dog size) with their sampler probe.At which time Michel remarks, 'they must take you to be gods' since the inhabitants reemerge from their shelters and bow down to the sampler probe. Michel is also taken to a parellel universe where time is suspended. And Michel wonders at men women and animals he sees that are perhaps 30,000 or 50,000 or more year old. Thao tells Michel \\"they are all here by accident\\" through a warp by such places as the Bermuda Triangle and other less well known places. And death only occurs by suicide and accident because their is no aging with suspended time...Later, Michel is educated on the various mysteries of earth's history, such as the first people on earth the bakaratinians, lemuria(mu) and atlantis, the creation of existence by THE SPIRIT.....He arrives on the planet Thiaoouba and is quite surprised because of his expectation to have the red carpet rolled out and greeted by a crowd of Human ET beings as he come off the ship, however, nothing of that sort ensues. Michel is instructed to wear a fitted mask to protect him from the intoxication of the colors of the planet...Michel is continously amazed by what the planet entails, he calls it the golden planet. Here, he is taking to meet 7 masters and educated on the four forces that created existence as well as the higher selves that lead back to THE SPIRIT...Later, Michel is instructed to drink a special Elixir that seperates his physical and astral body and takes him back to the time of Mu/Atlantis to see first hand experience of their civilization...here, Michel notes the description of the people, the building of the pyramids through levitation and what appears to him as flying saucers....Later, Michel learns the reason he was chosen is because he is one of few earthlings that have lived 81 lives on earth and other planets. And so, is one of the most spiritually developed people on planet earth. He is shown all previous 81 lives in which he describes a few of them in the book...Michel meets a being named Arki from another planet of the same 1st category of earth. By this time Michel has learned of the 9 different categories of planets in creation and Earth being of the 1st...the lowest category and Thiaoouba of the 9th.............Michel is enlightened on probably the greatest mystery to men on earth, THE BIBLE and many events that is told from this book as well as the mystery of JESUS THE CHRIST.The greatest thing I have ever read...I was on the edge of my seat when the book was building up to the mystery of THE CHRIST. I don't need physical material proof, the proof is in the feeling as i read through it....

Hmmm. Titles can be misleading because this book was anything but light and entertaining. However, I've never been disappointed by one of duMaurier's books and was determined to read it.After the first couple of chapters,I was hooked. The book actually tells two stories, one of which takes place in the 20th century and the other in the 14th. Although the names of people, homes, and places seemed foreign and \\"old\\" (Tywardreath) to me, I found myself becoming so involved with Dick, Vita, Mrs. Collins, Magnus, Roger, and Isolda that I found myself reading \\"just one more chapter\\" before putting the novel down...for a while at least. Would Vita and the boys be a hindrance to Dick as he continued as Magnus's guinea pig? Would the family move to New York? Would Roger profess his love to Isolda?I was impressed with duMaurier's knowledge of the life and times of 14th century England and her ability to weave such an interesting story along beside one occurring over 600 years later.

Based on Release 4.0, Featuring Free Demo Exam Similar to CTC Exam&quot;. This is the cover of the book I received. So it may be a good book for IT Managers, etc. To a functional consultant, this is almost useless. On the technical side it almost looks like the SAP R/3 System Administration book from SYBEX with ASAP procedures."},{"Title":"SAP R/3 Implementation With ASAP : The Official SAP Guide","review":"I got this book based on a recommendation of an associate who liked the way it laid out the implementation of a complex software suite. I am not a SAP R/3 specialist, but am an IS/IT consultant who develops and implements service level management solutions and also manages projects of the complexity and scope of an R/3 implementation. Moreover, I have been providing consulting services to a company that does specialize in R/3 integration, so reading this book became important for a number of professional reasons.Things I most like: the book is an easy read and is laid out in a sequence that allows you to fully understand the issues and factors, and tasks and deliverables required to implement R/3 using SAP's ASAP approach. I loved the clear illustrations and the sequencing of tasks. I had no problem understanding this book even though I had never implemented (or even supported R/3). I saw numerous parallels between the R/3 implementation requirements and those of past projects in which I had participated. When I was in the mainframe world a book this complete and clearly laid out would have been worth its weight in gold. In fact, the clarity and information contained in the book is much better than anything I have read or used in *any* environment.I found none of the major shortcomings pointed out by previous reviewers. I think the book addresses security in the detail called for because this implementation aspect is tailored to each enterprise and no single book can possibly cover it in detail. I also found the information presented on two levels: one for technical staff and the other for business process owners, both groups will be playing a big role in any implementation. Perhaps if the business and technical information were segmented in the book it would be more accessible to both groups; however, it would also break the flow of the book. I personally like it the way it is. I do agree that the CD ROM contains material that has nothing top do with the book's topic.Overall, I learned a lot about SAP R/3 ASAP implementation and general issues and factors for any large-scale application implementation from this book. The author did an excellent job of structuring the book to correspond to project phases and stages, and the well designed illustrations greatly aided the text. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going to be involved in an R/3 ASAP implementation, or who needs a good model for planning the implementation of any complex enterprise application suite. It earns 5 stars from my point of view."},{"Title":"SAP R/3 Implementation With ASAP : The Official SAP Guide","review":"This is a high-level view of an R/3 ASAP implementation. It is too light for detailed planning, but does cover the implementation process sufficiently for project managers and implementation team members new to the SAP R/3 environment.Strengths: The author does an excellent job of explaining the R/3 environment and the ASAP implementation approach. Each chapter contains useful advice, and the way the information is presented will make the development of a work breakdown structure and project plan a fairly straightforward task. It is clearly written and well illustrated, and provides complete coverage of the implementation, albeit at a high level. I like the fact that post implementation requirements are addressed, which is something that is unfortunately not considered until too late in a project.Weaknesses: This book begs for checklists, an example work breakdown structure and end-to-end project plan. I did not like the superficial way security planning was addressed - the information provided in the chapter devoted to that topic is so generic as to be useless. Since the book is aimed at guiding architects, administrators and technical members of the implementation project team the accompanying CD ROM lent no value to the book because sample test questions for SAP certification have nothing to do with an ASAP implementation. The CD ROM's storage could have been put to much better use had checklists, project plan templates and other ASAP deliverables been provided instead.Overall this book is not as valuable to its intended audience as it is for project planners and managers. It can be used as a valuable reference for developing an RFI or RFP for an ASAP implementation. It can also be effectively used as a training guide to prepare an IS/IT department for an implementation because it does give a complete picture of what needs to be done, and to an extent, why. It merits 3.5 stars in my opinion, but I'll give it the benefit of 4 instead of 3, which are my only rating choices."},{"Title":"Tea and Taste: The Visual Language of Tea","review":"\\"Tea & Taste- The Visual Language Of Tea\\", by Tania M. Buckrell Pos is an amazing book to add to your collection! The author gives us an interesting history of tea, and shows how it helped to shape British society. This informative and well-written book also includes many beautiful color images. I would highly recommend \\"Tea & Taste- The Visual Language Of Tea\\"."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This autobiography is not a good place to start if you are interested in Zappa. His writting is great, but he does not go into detail about his distography and does not talk about how his music really works. Yes, he goes into his creative process, but in general terms.If you are looking for a song by song analysis, Ben Watson's Negative Dialectics of Poddle Play is by far the better book, and for a narrative on Zappa's life, Zappa, by Barry Miles, is a good bet.However, buy this book if you already like and know Zappa. It is great to read his writting and some of his insights are well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"As a guitarist and very amateur composer, someone like Frank Zappa was someone I had always admired on multiple levels. As a guitarist, he was never what you would call &quot;overly gifted&quot;. His solos were madcap forays into his own influences, and he could hit it really big sometimes, and sometimes he could be rather choppy and noisy. But that's OK, Frank never touted himself as a virtuoso or even a premier kind of soloist. He had fun with it, he did it with gusto and panache and I was always entertained by what he did. As a composer, he ranks up there with Copeland in my opinion.This book is not a big hoorah about how culturally important he was and still is, or anything pretentious and high falutin. He was a very normal man with a grasp of the absurd, a very vivid imagination and a firm hold on reality that few other people have. This book is about the MAN and his views on the world. I think he wanted people to really understand that he's not this weirdo genius that other people tried to make him into, but a normal man who writes (brilliant) music and has very intelligent views of the world around him.His political views virtually mirror my own (very Libertarian) and his stories of the old rock and roll days are amusing. But I loved the fact that, despite all of the weirdness around him, he retained a very grounded view of himself and the world. His caustic wit and acute observations of things he came into contact with are, in my view, utterly brilliant and shows the man for what he was. A true genius and a very nice man who didn't like a lot of what he saw in this world, especially the political powers-that-be in the US.I still miss him greatly, and this is a great book because you get to see him as he wanted to be seen and, in my opinion, how he really was. I'd recommend it to anyone, anywhere at any time. It was such a loss for everyone in the world when we lost Frank Zappa. Besides the music he left behind, this book is an incredibly humble view of a great man."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"i had to read &quot;the real frank zappa book&quot; for school, but it certainly wasnt an inconvience. i grew up on frank zappa, having a father as a zappa nut. so i had an inkling of an idea as to what he was all about. a great look into zappa's life, although my dad tells me there is some controversy as to what is true, even in an autobiography. i suppose it's hard to find a credible source on such a wild guy, eh? but anyhow...an extremely good book. quite a jolly laugh, too..."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book was my introduction to Frank. I mean, I knew who he was and had heard one or two of his songs, but that's it. Reading this book gave me a good overview of the guy. It covers everything from his upbringing to music to parenting and everything else. I especially enjoyed reading his ideas on composition. After finishing this book, I feel like I have a better idea of where to start album-wise and which of the other Zappa books I want to read next."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I bought this book sometime in the mid 90's on a whim. All I had heard from Zappa at the time was a cassette of his Apostrophe album that I don't even remember how I got. I read this in one sitting and it made an impression on me for being one of the funniest and most honest books I'd ever read. I let a musician friend of mine borrow it and I never saw it again.I've recently been listening to a lot of Zappa's music and the urge to read this book again struck me. I figure for ten bucks, I don't mind buying a book again that I remember loving so much.I should say that knowledge of Zappa's vast discography certainly helps in appreciating this book, as I enjoyed it more the second time, but I don't think it's required. There will be references that a non-fan won't understand, but the language and the stories that he tells here make it worth reading for anyone who is interested in music. If you are a musician, this is required reading. The middle chapter called \\"All about Music\\" is a brutal, vicious, hilarious attack on the art form that paid Frank's bills (and sometimes didn't) for most of his life. That chapter alone makes this book priceless in my mind, but the whole thing is good. His perspective on life and the world was unique. His style of storytelling reminds me a bit of Kurt Vonnegut in the way that he uses non sequiturs and tangents to paint an overall picture of the point he's getting at.The last section of the book is mostly about his family life and his views on politics, and a lot of the political stuff may seem dated on the surface, but all I had to do was replace the names and pretty much all of it still rang true to me.I don't really know how to review a book like this except to say that I was never bored, and I guarantee I won't be letting it out of my possession again. It's absolutely one of my favorite books. It's charming, funny, and even if some of it isn't necessarily true, it's honest. Does that make sense?Zappa fans have already read it. All musicians should read it. Mostly, I recommend it to people who like to laugh."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Having read \\"The Real Frank Zappa Book,\\" I came away with a much deeper understanding of FZ's approach to composition, music, and art. FZ's work has many, many layers of complexity. One must listen to some of his songs many times to pick up on these many layers. FZ applies the following quote to his music: \\"A large mass of any material will 'balance' a smaller, denser mass of any material, according to the length of the gizmo it's dangling on, and the 'balance point' chosen to facilitate the danglement.\\" This is just one of many quotes from The Real Frank Zappa Book that helped me comprehend and appreciate his music on a deeper level. FZ was a true genius. He died way too young. But he left behind a treasure trove of art for fans to explore for centuries to come. This book is a \\"must have\\" for any true fan of Frank Zappa."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"While browsing the amazon.com site, I came across this book by accident. After reading an excerpt, I knew I had to buy it. It made me laugh out loud. Before now, I had never really known the 'real' Frank Zappa. All I did know was that I never liked his music and he had given his children odd names.This book is filled with self-deprecating humor and gives a personal account of how he became famous, or infamous. \\"The Real Frank Zappa Book\\" is very amusing and gives an inside look into this very complex man's life."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"My copy of this book has been around the block a few times, with wear and tear, but I knew this when I bought it, so am not complaining. Considering it's subject matter is Frank Zappa, it is kind of appropo, in it's own little way.Frank would approve, no doubt, as he, too, always sought to be just a little rough around the edges, too, and told it as it was. The gov. didn't like it, but that just made it all the much better. Frank, we miss ya, just like we miss George Carlin."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Nobody cuts right to the chase like Frank. lol Reading this book felt to me like sitting down and having a conversation with the man. His approach to music and business was unique to say the least and this book reveals alot of the mindset and insights into how that came to be. I would recommend reading this to those pursuing a career in the music biz. Some of the writing is unique to Frank's period in the industry but alot of it still applies today and probably always will. Great book, get it, read it, laugh and enjoy."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I love Frank Zappa, and I dig his sense of humor.

I can only compare the effect this book had on me to the effect Nietzsche's works had on my father. To this day, his 30+ year old copy sits on his nightstand. It's pages are torn, dog-earred and covered with highlighted passages. This is how profound I find Frank's ideas. And it's entertaining too."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Bought the hard cover when first released. Read it at one sitting.

THE MOTHER OF ALL ZAPPA BOOKS."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I have always held that common sense is lacking inAmerica. Frank Zappa has proven it in his social commentary of societyin general in &quot;The Real Frank Zappa Book.&quot; From his attacks on extremetism (look at any televangelist, or Tipper Gore's PMRC)to the dangers of breasts and what makes the nipple so evil as not to be shown on television, and his more personal stories (like how his son Dweezil got his name) and the earlier days of the Mothers of Invention, this book is a fantastic look at an extremely intelligent, unappreciated man who unfortunately died way before his time. If only he could've been persuaded to run for public office!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"It has everything every zappa fan wants to know about this amazing man, it is true that sometimes the book tends to get too political but I am sure some people will apreciate the fact that they can even get to know how would Zappa would've been if he got elected to be president XD.It shows us the musiscian, political, personal, and overall personality of this great character."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I find Zappa a fascinating character. Here you have an individual who wanted to be very individual and extreemly inquisitive in his younger years, then generally went against most norms. I found too many areas of the book to be interesting, but I found the chapter on his working relationship with various orchestras very enlightening. Here you have in raw form the work and the frustrations involved in getting a piece of music written then attempted to be performed and recorded. His frustrations eventually led to him having his own record label and managing his own creative outlet. Although I would have liked to give this five stars, I just couldn't agree with everything he said. Zappa is fascinating. It also makes me feel at ease that there were those who went against the norms."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Great Book by a great man. Easy read...funny..insightful. Best Rock & Roll book ever written. Read about his music, friends, family, and his political wars. If you've never heard Zappa buy these CDs: Sheik Yerboti, Joes Garage Acts 1 & 2, Mothers of Invention Live at the Fillmore East 1972, Apostrophe, and Strickly for Commercial for you little guys"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"In reading the other reviews, they do not mention the bazaar life that frank Zappa lived. These bazar stories are very exiting! Keep in mind that Frank did not take drugs. In this book, one band member wanted to kick Frank Zappa out of the band because he did not take drugs. Associate the word bazaar with &quot;exiting.&quot;"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"At the risk of causing offence by comparing this tome to the other &quot;Good Book&quot;, I would like to make it clear how good this book is at offering advice on life. Everything from solving societies ills in a practical manner to raising kids in a loving and open environment.One of the books other strengths is its humour; even the non-Zappa nuts who have borrowed this book from me have enjoyed the relaxed and enjoyable writing style.I have read this book so many times now that it is falling apart, and needs to be replaced. It is always the first in the suitcase, come holiday time!One of the most amusing topics in the book is Frank's less than successful inventions. One of which was the idea of somehow digitising music and sending it down the telephone line. So, not only did he invent the gatefold sleeve and the concept album, he also conceived MP3.com over 10 years before it happened!A truly remarkable man whos presence is greatly missed. The other one book that everone should own."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I got this book as a Christmas gift several years ago. Prior to that event, I had tried to get into Zappa's music, but just couldn't for some reason. The only album I liked was 1969's 'Hot Rats' (which I also highly recommend).Well I was pretty bored most of the time at my job at the time, so I took the habit of reading books in my cubicle (covered up of course by technical documents in the very rare case that somebody actually came in to bother me). The Real Frank Zappa book eventually came to the top of my queue, so I casually dove in, not expecting anything.Well contrary to my expectations, I found the book so entertaining and witty that I blew through it entirely in half of a workday. I have since re-read it several times, and every time is a delight. I somehow find that it made me able to relate to the man in a lot of ways (one superficial example is the fact that I was working on the very same Army base in which he grew up and mentioned a few times in the book).After reading it the first time, I was much more prepared to consume his music. I was spurred on by the stories in the book and how his music related via his clever notion of 'conceptual continuity' (a unique idea he created that links ALL of his works together in a single, bizarre string of pure genius). So I promptly obtained access to his entire large volume of work (exceptional in its scope, considering the composer unfortunately died at the young age of 53) and voraciously devoured it.To this day it remains my favorite book, much as Zappa remains my favorite musician/artist/activist/wizard/person of all time. I'm always finding and appreciating new nuances that I discover in his vast body of work. But I guess the music discussion is more appropriate for another review or two...So in short, even if you don't like his music, his life story is an amazing and entertaining read. It's short, well-written, and will turn you on to this genius who had so much to say about everything and was WAY ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book was a great buy for me, a longtime fan of Zappa who wanted to know the real story of his life and opinions. Frank presents his story with easy to read, concise chapters, that will open your eyes, and help dispell many of the tall tales that surround this musical genius. My only 'gripe' would be that it left me asking for more...The book ends rather abruptly, as if there could have been a better summary of his ideas/ideals. Perhaps a retrospectus by his family will someday give us more insight into his thought process, and the meanings behind his lyrics, song titles, and ideas that were behind his great music. Still a great read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"All of the answers you wanted to your questions about Zappa are here!If you like Zappa's music and humor, I HIGHLY recommend reading his autobiography \\"The Real Frank Zappa Book\\". You'll get the real story behind all the ridiculous urban legends you heard about this man.I guarantee you will be laughing your backside off before page 3. I recall the first time I picked this up on a display at a Walden's books. I randomly turned to a page and started to read. It was all about how to deal with militant Islamic jihadiis. I was laughing so hard I was doubled over, convulsing and had tears in my eyes. The store clerks probably thought I was having a stroke.*Learn about what Zappa really likes to eat and what he thought of the food at a Fayetteville North Carolina Holiday Inn buffet.*Read about how his kids used to raid his studio fridge so he inevitably didn't get to eat that stuff he really liked.*Become enlightened to learn that \\"coffee and cigarettes are food\\" (no wonder this man died so young)*Discover the secret ingredients of the \\"Burnt Weenie Sandwich\\" and how to make your very own burnt weenie sandwich.*Uncover the horrible, disgusting historical facts about those New Yorkers who were willing to climb and writhe around on stage and \\"Call Any Vegetable\\".*Revel in the outrageous details of life in that rental home up in Laurel Canyon.*Find out who the weird chick is peering up out of the crypt on Hot Rats.*Discover why Zappa hated England and the Queen.*Get the sordid biological facts about Kenny's little creatures and his disgusting bedroom window.*Find out how a young Zappa nearly blew his \\"nuts\\" off with a jar of ping-pong ball filings and a book of matchesZappa is lovably irreverant from page one all the way to the end. There's lots of interesting pictures including a 3 year-old Zappa in shorts with a cap gun. By the time I finished this book I found myself wondering how someone so incredibly brilliant could also be so stupid and ignorant with respect to basic nutrition and health. In some ways I'm sort of angry he did not take better care of himself and we were robbed of his brilliance at far too young of an age. We really needed Zappa throughout the \\"W\\" years."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"In this illuminating book, Frank Zappa shares his life, advice on child-rearing, tour stories, etc.However, the most amazing revelation is contained in the chapter entitled, \\"Failures\\". In this chapter, Zappa details various ideas that he had proposed to venture capital companies. The most astounding of these is the idea to digitize music, and have it available to be transferred via high-speed phone lines to the consumer. Keep in mind that this book was written in 1988, and he explains that this proposal was prepared in 1982, before the invention and widespread popularity of the Compact Disc! He knew, twenty years before the fact, that purchasing music at a store, on media was an outdated process.Regardless of how you feel about Zappa's music, this shows his absolute genius. He foresaw digital music, the transfer of digital music, the use of telephone lines to transmit this music.Brilliant"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I just finished reading this book. I really wanted to give it five stars, but the book got slow in some places. It's a must-have for any Zappa fan. And a good read for anyone with an interest in music or composing (that's right, I said composing! -- Zappa wrote and directed several symphonic pieces).Here's a few of the things you'll get if you read this book:* Insight into the mind of a legend.* A look at what Zappa did musically and on stage* Insight to what it was like to live in the Zappa household* Stories from his \\"early days\\" before he was famousAnd alot more.If you like Zappa, read the book.If you like popular music, read the book.If you are a composer, read the book.If you are Pat Robertson, well, maybe you shouldn't read the book."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I was never a huge Zappa fan growing up. His music was incredible, but his lyrics were stupid, so I thought then. I started to pay attention to him when the rock and roll trials happened during the 1980's. He skewered the PMRC during both the hearings and late night news talk shows. It was this reason I decided to read his book. What came out of the book was a very thoughtful man who looked on his life with a great deal of humor. He writes about his early childhood along with the early years of the Mothers of Invention. The various stories of life on the road with the hanger-ons is truly hysterical.This book is not about his music per se, but how he views the world. His decriptions of his version of the rock and roll hearings and the meanings behind them may seem a bit dated today, however they were certainly very important at the time. Zappa also explores his views on marriage and children. What comes across is a man who is very devoted to his loved ones and is actually very ordinary despite the insanity that seemed to surround him with the music world. His section on &quot;What Frank Eats&quot; is truly one of my favorite parts of the book.My only complaint with the book is that he does not spend enough time on his later work, which I think is a true shame and he does not do analysis of his music. As you read his book you will left thinking that he would think this portion would be a waste of time. This is a wonderful book and is highley reccommended."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Very funny book, frank gives his views on music, beer, rock journalism, televangelists, his own politics('practical conservatism'). You have the biographical stuff when he was a kid, which is very funny (especially the explosives stuff). You then get a history of the original mothers, the freak scene and that stuff. There's a hilarious chapter on frank's dirty lyrics (drool brittania) with some priceless quotes from a court case. Frank talks about his kids a bit, and what he likes to eat. There's some interesting stuff on music,orchestra problems, and music technology. Then Frank talks about more political stuff in the last third of the book. This is hit and miss, alot of this is stuff which was current at the time of writing but it hasn't aged well. (And it isn't that interesting in any case). The pmrc stuff is good, also the televangelism. Non zappa fans can read this and enjoy it, and fz fans definitely need to read this!! Thank you"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I believe this book is out of print and seemed a little difficult to buy, but I found a great copy on Amazon...The book, taken from voice recordings Frank made, then edited into print form, IS Frank speaking to us. And what an amazing story is told. And what an amazing man he is. I guess \\"was\\" would be more correct as he has passed on, but by leaving such a legacy of music, that is so interesting, so varied, typically so good, Frank still \\"is\\". His political rants and humor are timeless and probably no one alive in his time, had a better understanding of the coming digital revolution than Frank. Hardly any musician, ever, held such an audience of fans, politicians, and other musicians on a world stage. This book truly takes you behind the scenes and helps allow us to better understand why Frank did what he did and how he got that way.Buy some of his music, hear why he was one of the great composers of the 20th Century, hear why he could play guitar as well as almost any man alive. I just hope he continues, albeit very slowly, to receive the fame he justly deserves. Frank Zappa was indeed a genius."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"It is not unusual for either writers or composers to draw upon their own life and experiences for material. What is unusual is learning from the artist directly the source of his or her inspiration. And in this volume, the reader learns of some of the personal connections Frank Zappa's material has with his life experiences.Zappa reveals through the re-telling of his life how an experience in jail eventually found itself lyrically represented in his music 13 years later. His antagonism toward organized religion in general and evangelicals in particular becomes understood when he describes how he accepted an invitation once to attend a tent service. His description of what the lyrics \\"mean\\" in \\"200 Motels\\" to a British court are both hysterical and extraordinary. And his brief, but very enlightening descriptions of certain musical themes that recur throughout his music was fascinating as well and gave my ear new interest in many of his compositions.The casual fan of Frank Zappa can learn a lot about the man and his music by reading this book. But so can the hardcore fan as well. As others have written, you cannot know the man entirely through solely listening to his music. And the fact that so few composers set out to produce an autobiography in such an organized manner elevates the importance of the work."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Frank Zappa lived his life and pursued his musical career and expressed his political views with a great passion for freedom.

Laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Learning all the history Frank Zappa and the Mothers went through was outstanding. The last chapter got a little preachy, but I never stopped laughing throughout the entire book. I'd think anyone that wants to know not only the \\"how\\" it was done, but some of the experiences along the way, are priceless to hear about."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Read this book and find out. An initial foray into his music wasn't enough for me. I had to find out about him (i actually stumbled across the book in a bargain book store! Shame on them!) The book isn't very detailed, but it does provide a bonafide look into the composer's life through personal anecdotes and recollections. Zappa's very well spoken and brilliant in his arguments, especially in the later chapters where he skewers the Reagan administration and the PMRC. If you are a Zappa fan you must have this book. I'm devouring his music because of it.....If you are starting out listening to Zappa, I recommend &quot;Apostrophe&quot; and &quot;Overnite Sensation&quot;. &quot;Joe's Garage&quot; and &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; are also incredible."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book is FUNNY, INTERESTING, AND INTELLIGENT. However, the online material on the internet web sites such as interviews, articles written by and about Frank Zappa available at SAINT ALFONZO PANCAKE PAGE, and the WAY COOL ZONE (found by Yahoo search engines) contain MUCH BETTER AND MORE information than this book. The book is NOT necessary for any fan who has read already the INTERNET ONLINE STUFF which is about 500 8.5x11 pages if printed out on paper. In a nutshell, save your money, don't buy this book, but instead read the fantastic and sensational ASCII texts online ... on the Internet. Just use a search engine and you';ll be WAY better off than the book."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Though I've been a casual but appreciative listener of Zappa for a long time, over the last year I've finally REALIZED the genius. And with the voracious reading of this book, I've discovered that he is my mentor... I'm talking T H E mentor. In the realm of &quot;cutting to the chase&quot;, Mr. Zappa was King Machete!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"THE BOOK IS SO GOOD &amp; I THINK EVERYONE WILL LOVE IT LIKE ME."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I wish this book went more into why studios took a risk on him, how he persuaded his band to switch from being a typical bar band into the strangest group of the 60s, and more of the history of his groups, but I can't complain too much. This is a fascinating, funny, and incredibly smart book from one of the most talented musicians of all time."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I think anyone who likes Frank Zappa enough to actually purchase a book about him pretty much knows what they're getting into with his autobiography. It's a no-holds-barred, matter-of-fact account of his views on music, the general public, and life as he saw it. It encompasses most of his career -- he puts it all right out there: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Did I mention it's frequently hilarious? It's a little distracting at times (he writes with large and small font, bold face and italics, constantly interspersed in order for the reader to know beyond a shadow of doubt where his speaking emphasis should be) but definitely an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"If you are a Zappa fan or not, you must read this book. It is only 14 dollars list price, and If you can't buy it, go to a library and read it. If you read with an open mind, [or even if you don't] it will change the way you look at certain things. A real gateway to logical living. For the music fan, there is PLENTY to keep you busy with, FZ had one of the most unique musical styles of the 20th Century and is viciously underrated. Listen to his less popular stuff and you will know what I mean. For the non music fans (is there such a things?) FZ and MR. Occhiogrosso put toghther a simple logical text that is a must read."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Frank's recollection of the sixties and his early career will have you laughing out loud. His British problems will have you longing for the next chapter and his political views will make you believe (if already don't know) that FZ was a genius and one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. I wish he had lived long enough to run for political office, because I'm sure he would have. He would have made a great leader.So don't ponder the significance of short-person behavior in pedal-depressed panchromatic resonance and other highly ambient domains, just get the book and enjoy."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone. You don't even have to be a Zappa fan to enjoy this! The book isn't just a simple autobiography. Frank also gives plenty of his philosophy on politics and religion. This is without a doubt the most entertaining book I have ever read. Reading this book made me love Frank even more!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Underappreciated, misunderstood to a fault, unfairly pigeonholed. That's Frank. So is funny, intelligent, honest and innovative. Wonderful essays on various and sundry subjects, including why radio sucks, why serial compostion is a dead-end, what you can do to raise extraordinary kids, and finally why Fundamentalist Christians and Republicans should never be taken seriously, let alone allowed to reproduce. This book inspires me to find the courage to cultivate my own muse, to live my life on my own terms and to tell people who would interfere exactly where they can go. Would that any other book be capable of accomplishing the same."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I'm a sixteen year old zappa fan, which is probably a rarity. I wasn't around in his hayday, but this book gave me some insight on the greatest satirist and musician (in my honest opinion) ever. Before this all I knew about him was what I'd read off some old records in the basement. 'Hey, whats this funny lookin Freak Out! record?' I also saw a strange man on TV playing a bicycle once.Also on Amazon.com is '200 Motels', frank zappas movie, which I just bought."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Zappa has built quite a reputation for being weird and opinionated, and this book can only add to it. While this is far from a thorough biography of his life, his opinions on variegated issues are eloquated and comprehensive. Throughout the book the level of humor is weighty enough to roll you laughingly onto the floor at least every other page. The personal stories Zappa sees fit to share are only the most amusing (or perhaps just amusingly worded) of his life -- leaving the text free from unnecessary and tiresome factoids. Pay special attention to the Unconventional Technique of capitalizing certain words to lend emphasis and imply Conspiracy (it just adds to the merriment). Of particular interest is the section on Zappa's crusade against music censorship. I could continue to sing the praises of this book as a an enlivening read indefinately........"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This is a terrific book. Zappa is nothing if not an individual, and the story of what he went through to stay that way in the music business is inspiring, in an extremely weird sort of way. His devotion to his family (particularly his wife) and his determination to stay true to his beliefs is rare in a rock musician, I think, and a lesson for everyone. The best part is his description of his fight against the Parents Musical Resource Council, and particularly his testimony. People like Zappa are why the First Amendment was invented, and why it still matters. Warning: he is not a writer. He's a musician, and so his writing relies a lot on exclamation points, italics and bold type. This gets old after a while. This is a minor objection, though -- he's truly an inspiration, and this book is well worth buying and reading."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"The only biography on Zappa, authorized by himself, is a truly great book to read. It is crammed with knife-sharp and humorous personal thoughts and comments on various areas. For instance there are quite funny comparisons on the music &quot;industry&quot; of the era belonging to composers of traditional classical music as well as the music industry people living now encounter. Also, Frank Zappa describes his beliefs in different questions, such as religion and governmental policies. He wanted to make it clear that he acccepted that other people may have different opinions than him, but also that he did not accept that people impose their beliefs on others.Read it, if you want to!!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"By way of dissing Zappa's famous appearance before Congress to argue against warning labels on records, conservative columnist Don Feder derisively refers to Frank Zappa as a \\"rock creature\\" and makes fun of him for naming his daughter Moon Unit. (You'll find these remarks in _A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America_. Feder is usually better than this.)But the fact is that Zappa was a genuine homegrown American original, a musical genius, and a thoroughly subversive Enemy Of The State. And whatever one thinks of their names, the rest of us should have children like Zappa's. (They're all grown up now, of course, but Moon was a highly poised young lady even at the age of thirteen. I don't remember seeing any of Feder's kids on talk shows when _they_ were teenagers.)Love or hate his music; agree or disagree that his sometimes-acerbic social commentary often went over the line into sheer pornography. If you want to meet the man himself, this book is the only one you need to read.It's all in his own words, as told to Peter Occhiogrosso. The style will be recognizable to anyone who has ever read the liner notes on a Zappa album. And the content is part autobiography, part correction of underground-rock-grapevine misconceptions, part almost-libertarian political activism, part musing on the nature of musical composition.A handful of highlights, chosen from among many: He proposes that music could be digitally downloaded, an idea whose time apparently hadn't come when Zappa first thought of it. The chapter on his \\"pornography trial\\" in the UK is hilarious, not least because it includes selections from the actual transcripts. And if you want to know _why_ his kids turned out so well-spoken and mature at such early ages, check out his advice on childrearing.By the way, Zappa did not do drugs, no matter how many well-meaning imbeciles tell you otherwise. On the contrary, he was one of a handful of anti-drug crusaders in the music industry, and one of an even smaller handful who wasn't a recovering addict himself. Reality is better than drugs anyway, and Zappa knew it.His untimely death from prostate cancer left a gaping hole; he was irreplaceable. But thank goodness for this book."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This is not casual reading, summer reading, something you just pick up. It's an inside account for the fact- and tidbit-hungry FZ fan-atic, for those FZ-crazed psychos who have to know more than you do about one of rock's ultimate musical geniuses. This book is written for the Zappa fan by FZ himself, and as such it is an essential addition to an FZ fan's collection. If you've listened to your FZ albums to the point where you know the songs' lyrics, have heard/read some of the rumors and legends, and wish to expand &quot;your mythology&quot; and &quot;conceptual continuity,&quot; you're ready.FZ's music leads the way, as it should, and you'll either love it or hate it pretty quickly. Reading up on FZ before you start listening to his recordings isn't going to help you, and more likely would serve to confuse. This being said, this book is best for the FZ listener who has made the critical personal decision to become an FZ fan, and who wants to educate himself/herself a little bit more about the man who makes the noises come out of the speaker.And this book is the best place to start. As an (assisted) autobiography, this is the real deal, the observations, memories, and facts directly from the source. FZ says himself in the introduction, &quot;...I do not think of my life as amazing in any sense--however, the opportunity to say stuff in print about tangential subjects is appealing.&quot; The countless FZ web pages and fanzines contain all of the information contained in this book and then some, but this is the best place to start your FZ education. FZ's dedication of the book to &quot;Gail, the kids, Stephen Hawking and Ko-Ko&quot; (the 'talking' gorilla) provide the very first indication that the reader is in for a better glimpse of FZ than you can get from listening to the sonic eccentricity of &quot;Billy The Mountain&quot; or &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh.&quot;The format is essentially chronological, but wide open, free flowing, with quick jumps to new subjects as diverse as &quot;Jazz: The Music of Unemployment&quot; and &quot;How To Raise Unbelievable Children.&quot; There are lists, poetry, instructions, lyrics, interview snippets, letters, transcripts of congressional testimony, tables, photos, and wonderful illustrations. The illustrations are fine, detailed and punctuating the text well, done by the mysterious hieroglyph-signature artist whose name escapes me. What is surprising is that FZ couldn't get longtime FZ album cover artist Cal Schenkel to contribute his talents to the book.The book is a great investment, a fine addition to an eclectic library, and a wonderful repeat read."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"We get some of everything with this one.It gives us a feel for his personality and speaking style. Italics, underlining, and boldface are used liberally; I could hear his voice as I read.It gives us a nice collection of anecdotes from various stages of Zappa's career, from his high school years up through the orchestral work with the LSO - even a couple of tales from the 1988 'Best Band You Never Heard'. If you like these, you will wish there were more, though.It gives us what has to be the best general description of a composer's work ever ('wiggling air molecules, changing over time'). That chapter alone is worth the cost of the book, if you are at all interested in music or art.We also get the political Zappa, some lyrics, the Zappa home life, and even a bit of What Frank Eats (whatever the kids don't, apparently).The only thing we don't get (and this is why I wish he'd lived another 30 years) is some detailed analysis of his compositions. We get a couple of places where he is discussing musical theory and practice from a technical perspective (chord progressions that cannot occur in doowop, or why jazz drummers are not normally appropriate in a Zappa band), there is no music printed in the book to help the interested reader follow along. Certainly I can't fault the book for this, but, man, it would have been nice if he'd written one like that.If you are a student of music, a budding composer, artist, or just think Frank freaks folks out, this is for you."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"According to many you'll either hate Frank Zappa's music or love it. Well, as a fan for more than thirty years and being very familiar with the vast spectrum that is his output I love a great deal but not all of his music and although I can't say that I hate any of it, the word love is certainly not my universal response. Now what about the man himself, it's difficult to be clear having never met him personally so I've tried to gain some insight from reading about him. And let's not forget this probably applies to the majority of biographies about anyone. On the other hand autobiographers apparently know their subject quite well. Hmm!?On the whole I'm glad I have my own copy of The Real Frank Zappa Book. My main problem with the book is that it is not all about him. Now I know you can gain a great deal of insight about a person if you listen attentively while they rant about their favourite dislikes - in particular political dislikes - but it's not the most enjoyable way to get to know someone.It's very easy to divide the book into two sections. As a book by Frank Zappa about Frank Zappa I really enjoyed the first 14 chapters where I laughed and cried about the more immediate aspects of his life. Chapter 15 onwards is essentially a political treatise and although I am very interested in reading his opinion, I neither laughed nor cried I just became depressed about what no doubt depressed him and led him to spend a great deal of his waking time over night when he felt he couldn't hear the \\"scurrying\\" outside. Now, you might say, those rants are just as illuminating about the man as more personal anecdotes but I don't think it required that much to get the point across in the context of a book that is ostensibly about him.It would be nice to have a book of his memoirs and a book of his political persona as separate entities. Before anyone accuses me of spoiling the discovery of these things for themselves I'm writing this review in response to the experience of buying a fairly weighty book by the man himself, then very much enjoying the overall vein of the first 14 chapters and finally not ever getting that feeling back for the remainder of the book. I wish I had known that in advance - naive perhaps. If they were separate I would read them both with different expectations and appreciate them for distinct reasons. The first half spans his moods the second half is pretty much monomoodic.In the first half he seems fairly honest about himself. He admits to foibles that many a person with the same foibles wouldn't admit to even quietly in passing let alone in print. He gives interesting background that clarifies his aims in composing in general and the music business in particular. I could read this part many times and wish there was much more writing by him in this vain - I got the feeling that he was leaving quite a bit out and I don't mean as an intentional omission, he probably just didn't have the time. Let's put it to a vote. Which Zappa Album would you sacrifice in order to have more personal memoirs? Personally - none of them - even the ones I'm not 100% sure about, he was after all primarily a composer and not a writer. Hopefully good biographers will fill in the gaps at a future date. The second half requires a stronger disposition and I need to be in a pretty unshakeable mood to confront the ugly reality he saw in the world around him. Yes he could be quite witty about it but it's still depressing and his own frustration with it all is very apparent.Over all I would say you should buy this book if you have more than a passing interest in Frank Zappa, but there are according to rumours, good biographies out there. I can't recommend any just yet but when I have continued my research further I shall post reviews in the appropriate places."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"As Frank explains in his introduction \\"An autobiography is usually written by somebody who thinks his life is truly amazing. I do not think of my life as amazing in any sense - however, the opportunity to say stuff in print about tangential subjects is appealing.\\" So what we get here is part autobiography and part social commentary, both serving to reveal the true genius of this most unique of American composers.What the reader will find is an incredibly amusing look at the life and times of Frank, his family, various band members and groupies, along with his extraordinary insight into the ugly mischief of politicians, businessmen, and religious fanatics who plague his existence. His commentary on those latter subjects is just as relevant today as it was when the book was published in 1988.For those who are not aware of the astonishing creativity of this man, consider that in his chapter on \\"Failure\\" he includes a proposal he pitched to Rothschild Venture Capital in the early 1980's for a system that is virtually identical to iTunes. This was almost 20 years before such a system came into being!I am not overstating the case when I say that this book will enrich your life."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book has it all! It's a bio, it contains dirty rock tour stories, it contains Zappa's own views on a variety of topics, including, but not limited to, family values, guitar playing, drugs, American society, religion, politics and whatnot. For the reader familiar with Zappa's lyrics, you'll feel right at home. It's written in the same manner as his songs, in a personal style so his own that you hear his voice saying the words as you read them. I love it. I've read it five times already and will read it many more. Invaluable."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"The Real Frank Zappa Book is great. It captures the humor found in his music, explains some of the concepts that keep popping up, provides a neat look at rock history, and has some scathing commentary about the reality behind the PMRC and rock censorship. Even if you don't listen to his music, read Zappa's book!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Working at a library has almost no perks. I shelve the travel section so there isn't much stimulation in the way of brain waves(then again, my job is pretty tedious to begin with). However, one day while wondering through a friend's section I found a gem. I found The Real Frank Zappa Book. When their were breaks in my work, I would grab this book and read it feverously. Even with my increasing respect and love for Zappa's work, I still found this a great book. It packs a sharp wit, biting comentary, and overal, is just a good quick read.The book covers Zappa's origin, his early musical influences, the tough times of M.O.I.(Mothers of Invention), insight as to his musical creation process, and even a indepth look into his battle with the well-known PMRC. The great thing is even with all this retrospect, the man never loses his sense of humor. Sometimes slapstick, sometimes satire, always truthful.Anyone interested in the man that was Zappa, I highly recommend this book. Those who are interested in becoming a musician, I also recomend this book(his musical insight is very inspiring). In fact, I recomend this book to all. Its just a shame he died before his time. Zappa was a true inovator of music. There will never be another Frank Zappa."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"We start with Zappa's rather sarcastic yet opinionated introduction in which he claims that he never reads. That claim may be misinterpreted by a few, yet I took it as a stab of sarcasm at those who never bother to, preferring to keep their mind on what's on TV at the time. From that point, it's a short read to the first chapter, which opens with a quote from a Baltimore Sun interview in which Zappa observes: &quot;I never set out to be weird. It was always other people who called me weird&quot;. The first chapter is a brief recollection of his childhood years, in which he describes in detail why his birth certificate lists his first name as Frank rather than Francis and his early interests in science. In the second chapter, he talks about developing a love for music (Rock, Jazz and Classical especially Stravinsky) and his first attempts at bands.It continues that way through the first half of the book. We get chapters on his various bands through the years up until 1988 (when this book was written), his association with Lenny Bruce, his formation of The Mothers Of Invention, Various tour stories, a treatise on why he doesn't like Great Britain and a chapter devoted to his own dad.The second half of the book shifts gears totally and moves away from the memoir side to the polemical side. We get chapters in which Zappa comments on marriage, the failed drug war, the PMRC, Reagan, Republicans, the religious right, Big government, high taxes and so on.What's interesting about the polemical second half of the book is that while a lot of the events that much of it was written in response to are now history, so many of the rants about them are still on target. From the opening of his Church and State chapter: &quot;A lot of the mongos in the TV religion industry claim to be conservative. But are in fact the US equivalent of the Mongos blowing the shlt out of the Middle East&quot;.In the chapter titled &quot;Practical Conservatism&quot;, Zappa makes a strong case for the Libertarian point of view and offers up a good skewering of so-called anti big government Republicans. I also highly recommend reading the chapter entitled &quot;Porn Wars&quot; in which Zappa details his battle with the PMRC. Highly essential reading, especially in the recent puritanical crackdown by the FCC on people such as Howard Stern.The final two chapters in the book feature Zappa showing off some of his more outrageous ideas that never really came to fruition (IE: A Football Opera) and the last one allows him to get in a few more digs at certain political targets as well as offering some advice to the readers (IE: Vote!).The Real Frank Zappa book is an interesting read overall. I liked both halves of it equally. But some of the not so politically minded readers will prefer the first half. Puritanical types are advised not to read the second half, as it will doubtlessly infuriate you. Pick up a copy! Another unconventional Amazon quick-pick I heartily recommend is THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez -- just wonderful!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I have read this book three times and have enjoyed it each time. Frank is missed not just because of his incredible musical talent, but his biting satire type sense of humor.The man was a genious though. I have no doubt about that. He also saw things 20 years ago that we didn't. Doesn't anyone who's read this book realize that Frank predicted downloading music 20 years before Napster or the Internet? He thought it would be done through cable TV. It was the same principle!If anyone really wants to know and try to understand the man behind the music. This is the best Zappa book of all."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book but, if you are looking for details and insight from \\"the man himself\\" re: Frank Zappa's extensive body of recorded works, then you will be sorely dissapointed.The first chunk of the book is mostly about his childhood and the last half or so is devoted to barbed essays on a miscellany of dis-jointed topics such as politics, raising a family, inventions that Zappa couldn't get funded, etc. In the middle you get a smattering of chronology describing the formation and first few years run of the original Mothers of Invention... Zappa's musical exploits through the 70's and 80's is nearly completely ignored!!, ...Instead of devoting numerous pages to tedious diatribes concerning the PMRC Music Labelling initiative, (which now seems like a historical \\"non-issue\\"), I would have far preferred to have read an album-by-album review by Zappa offering insight into each of the tracks and any related anecdotes behind their creation."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"It has to be interesting.

So glad I got it for him! He's read it several times already!!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Frank Zappa, in his book, based on stories recorded by him on magnetic tapes - because he did not consider himself a writer - with which Peter Quatrocchi wrote the book of Franky, Frank is the same as presented in concerts in his way of saying or sing things. FZ exposes his living trajectory through his life as a musician, in love - entranced - for the works by Igor Stravinsky, Edgar Varese and Anton Webern as composers. Caustic humor, satire, social. FZ shows how in music he filled a gap, which seemed impassable, between vanguard classical music, and rock, jazz, blues and all other genres of popular music and how he had to break the mold for his style or genre began to permeate the new generations. I recommend listening FZ's music extensively in parallel to reading the book. Although this work is not limited to describe his music and not intended to be an analysis of it, it also addresses a criticism of the society of all his time and extensible to the current, revealing its double face and its different social topics. It contains a lot of texture and vision, and all interwoven with his musical thinking. His political vision, even if he is liberal - FZ defines himself (don't laugh) as one of a \\" practical conservatism\\" - is very realistic, especially in these times when the torment of taxes increase is causing harsh criticism against the political class. Finally, it is important to highlight that many works of FZ were directed by conductors of the stature of Pierre Boulez (Ensemble Intercontemporain), Peter Rundel (Ensemble Modern). It is definitely a great read."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I didn't know much about Frank Zappa or about his music.

His own words, as told to his interviewer. There is a method to his madness. I am too young to have seen Frank live, although I've seen his son Dweezil many times on the Zappa Plays Zappa tours -- it is interesting to read his thoughts on many topics -- sometimes serious, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, always entertaining."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Although some complained about the lack of information on his music catalogue, this book gives an all-over perspective of Frank Zappa that is entertaining. I was laughing a lot of the time while I was reading this-Zappa was a genius!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Somewhere in this book, Frank mentioned that he's a huge fan of coffee and cigarettes. This book proves it. It reads far less like a coherent chronicle of his life than a five-hour, stimulant-fueled, stream-of consciousness rant about a number of topics apparently irking Frank that day. The unfortunate result is an unfocused, dated train wreck, where we are \\"treated\\" to such groundbreaking insights as Televangelists are Bad, Reagan was Conservative, the War on Drugs is Ineffective and the PMRC is a Joke. Thanks.Now, I don't blame Frank; he was just being honest. I instead focus my exasperation on the \\"editor\\" of this disaster, who should have immediately recognized that most of this book would be completely irrelevant the minute it hit the press. What's more, since anyone with a basic background in journalism would instantly know that most of Frank's diatribes were based almost entirely on conjecture, hearsay and dubious conspiracy theories, it should have been obvious that a full half of this book is complete crap.The result is that not only is the last half of this book unreadable, but also that a wonderful opportunity for a first-hand account of a fascinating story was forever lost. I mean, here's a guy who, I believe, has released almost 100 albums, has produced some of history's most groundbreaking rock music, and became a virtuoso guitarist and respected composer with no formal musical training-where's that story? Instead, we suffer through 50 pages of Frank watching charismatic preachers from Texas on TV, describing point by excruciating point what's happening on the screen.If the person overseeing this mess would have had the slightest hint of a spine and reeled this thing in, we might have had a truly insightful glimpse into what made this enigmatic genius tick. Instead, we learn that Frank would like to see Apartheid abolished. Oh wait, that happened 15 years ago. A wasted opportunity."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"This book is a very interesting read, from the political cartoons that begin each chapter, to the doodlings in the margins. The book starts off with a basic history of the man himself, and progresses on into anecdotes from the road and assorted rather hilarious stories from Zappa's life. Being Frank Zappa this makes for an incredibly ridiculous, and almost fantastical series of chapters. the books previous momentum tails off toward the last third of the book as Zappa launches into numerous tirades about the Reagan administration and Cold War, which are by now terribly outdated. However, buried in this criticism is an entertaining account of the proceedings of the Senate hearings involving the Parent's Music Research Center. Overall this is a good read, although flawed, but even Zappa's beration of Reagan translates to the present, and it is easy to think of what Zappa considers of today's society."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"The Real Frank Zappa book is a modern day masterpiece. The Zappa experience, or the point by point aspects of \\"who might this man be who makes music and sings of how the clouds are really cheap, the way he's seen em' through the ports, of which there is a half a dozen on the base of his resorts. You wouldn't think he'd have too many, since he never cared for sports. But he's never really lonely in his Excentrifugal Forz,\\" is carefully and specifically discussed here by the adept and forward-thinking composer himself, with just a bit of assistance from vigilant co-author Peter Occhiogrosso.I strongly suggest that you purchase this book for your personal collection.

Much more than if the books are someone else's. Books unavoidably become a part of your extended family. In any event, this I do swear: Buy this book, and it will provide you with years of literary enjoyment. Its combination of fantastic road stories, political commentary and philosophically sharp wit will make it a favorite son within your personal literary family. Just as with Frank Zappa's musical catalog, this book should be treated as genuine kith and kin, and afforded an affectionate intimacy that eradicates any unbending propriety. As a borrowed book is like some sort of red-headed step-child who must be beaten and/or treated with stiff correctness, (or at least with a certain unsympathetic formality), this book should belong to you as true family, and given a loving home with the care and respect it deserves.In fact, the so-called \\"Book-family\\" has some distinct advantages over living friends and family. You can enjoy the company of the most admirable and truly intelligent individuals in the history of the world whenever you care to. Just as the distinguished dead are beyond our bodily reach, likewise the distinguished living are usually just as unreachable. Perchance they are asleep, uninterested, watching TV, or, in the case of my cousin Bernie, just stupid. (Just try reaching your husband while he is watching Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, or your wife during the Lifetime Movie of the Week, and you have that picture.)The Real Frank Zappa Book is for use, not for show. Besides, you should own no book that you are afraid to place on the dining room table, wide open and face down, or to mark up with your favorite crayon. (You should always mark your favorite passages in books, so that in later years it will be like visiting a deep forest where you once blazed your own trail. You then have the gratification of going over your old stomping grounds, and recalling both the overall cerebral landscape and your own preceding self. Additionally, your future generations will get a general idea of your likes, dislikes, and overall interests in this mysterious forest of your contemplations.) If that's not a damn good analogy I don't know what is.Remember, (and this is a most precious gift), in your personal library you can at any moment have a discourse with, or pick the brains of, individuals the likes of Edgar Allan Poe, Thomas Harris, William Shakespeare, Robert E. Howard, Michael Crichton, Plato, Pluto, Mark Twain (who was also know as MC Six Feet), Allan W. Eckert, Charles Dickens, or, more importantly to our current purpose, Mr. Frank Zappa. And there is no doubt that in books you experience Frank, and indeed all these learned men, at their very finest. They have \\"laid themselves out\\" for you, as it were, and they have done their categorical best to entertain you, guide you, inform you, uplift you and make a favorable impression upon your life. You are as indispensable to them as peanut butter is to jelly; as Bruce Willis is to his youthful ward Dick Grayson, as ants are to an anteater, or as ear lobes are to earrings, (or vice-versa)... only instead of seeing these great men protectively masked as we see our present acquaintances, you look into their inner-most thoughts and their most intimate soul. Read more Zappa, my dear friends."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"Very little historical information; instead, mostly dated rants, opinions, and ah, yes, information about what Frank ate for dinner, if that strikes your fancy.It was somewhat interesting, however, to read Frank's reasoning concerning the whole PMRC/Tipper Gore/censorship thing, that it was being used to draw attention from other legislation that was much more evil."},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"The only difference between the &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;humor&quot; that Frank Zappa and &quot;Red&quot; Auerbach put out is that Auerbach knows that his routine IS a routine. Frank Zappa just knew what he knew. Whoopee!"},{"Title":"Real Frank Zappa Book","review":"I spent 20 years of my life in Sicily and I know Sicilian genealogy and nobody in the 20th century had a genealogy like Zappa's (including Zappa). Early in the book he claims his father was of Greek-Arab background but Sicilian by birth. What the hell does that mean? When exactly did Zap's dad's ancestors come from Greece to Sicily? 2500 years ago maybe? Yes 2500 years ago. That's the time the Greeks were colonizing Sicily 750-500BC. And exactly how were Zap's ancestors arabic? What Arab land did they hail from. Syria? Saudia Arabia? Jordan? And when? 1000 years ago or more? By the AD 1000's the Normans had the Muslims of Sicily under Christian control and over the next couple of centuries the Islamic folks were nearly completely expelled frpom the island. Or maybe Zap's father is referring to the Carthaginian occupation of the island (also in the BC era!). And there's more. According to Zappa his ancestors on his mom's side go back to France! Yeah like any French folks would really want to move to that poor starving Sicilian island (or even Naples). He elaborates very little on all this and it looks to me like these are nothing more than totally unsubstantiated family legends containing not a kernel of truth. It appears Zappa's dad was well-educated and knew Sicilian history and in an effort to distance himself from the mafia, in the eyes of Americans around him, created these fanastic stories that he was of recent Greek-Arab origin. And to make the family seem classy claimed his wife was of French origin. Old Mr. Zappa probably feeling that claiming himself to be all three was too farfetched. On another note, I remind you all this book was written by someone else alongside Zappa and the words in it may not be the musician's all the time. Some parts of this book look rather fictional indeed."},{"Title":"The IT Survival Guide","review":"While this book did not go into the depth that is needed in most issues, it brought to focus many of those topics that the IT professional should dig deeper into.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 3)","review":"If you go into this book, or any part of the series expecting more than a lighthearted (simple and silly) storyline aimed for kids somewhere around 6-8 years old, you will be disappointed. My review is sort of a mashup of the first 3 books since together they are almost the same length as a regular novel, and that was as far as I could read without feeling the urge to remove them my digital library. They are also all done by the same two authors, Paul Davids and Hollace Davids so the 'feel' is much the same throughout. I am going to do my best not to hate on this series, but I will give quite a few examples why this was the worst set of books I have read in years. I think the authors knowledge of the Star Wars universe consists of having watched the original trilogy once when it was first in theaters over 30 years ago, and then by brushing up by quickly flipping through an abridged Star Wars dictionary for a few characters names and places.Many of the main characters like Luke and Han just feel like different people with the same name. They do and say things that are out of character. In the second book, after finding the lost city of the Jedi, Han exclaims &#34;My Correlian buddies are not going to believe this&#34;. This makes no sense. Han never had many friends and seing as how the author knows Han is from Corellia, makes assumptions. In the movies and in many of the books, Han had few friends, and the ones he did were made after he joined the Alliance, or were known by first name, like Luke, or Lando. He never had so many friends that they were known as his buddies. Second, Han is also not the type of character to just brag about everything he does. If he is that type of person, it would be about a specific accomplishment, like say, helping the alliance twice blow up the Death Star. Even if he had all these miscellanious buddies the author talks about, why wouldn't they beleive him? He stumbled upon some lost city that also happens to be on a moon that has some Jedi or force using history. I would think they would have more trouble beleiving that he shot Darth Vaders tie fighter down.The author does something that every write who delves into Sci-fi and fantasy knows not to. He makes references to real life things on more than one occasion. In the second book, there is kid talking about finding cats and dogs that are noted in the Jedi archives. Later on the author talks about a Bantha as being the size of an elephant. Maybe that is how kids books are written, but I found it to be piss-poor writing. He also mentions 'computer notebook'. There are many ways to say 'portable computer' and still sound sci-fi ish. He may as well say that an X-Wing is half the size of a NASA shuttle or that the stormtroopers rifle shoots through armor as well as an AK-47. You simply do not mix reality with fantasy as it ruins the illusion. Many Star Wars books have done it better, such as the word &#34;Coffeine&#34;, which is a mashup between coffee and caffeiene. You know what what it is and even if you eyeroll a little on the combination, it is still not a direct link to something so real. It is also done very well in other books like on the word flimsiplast, or flimsi. This is meant to be paper, or some type of thin material to write on, but still keeps you immersed in the Star Wars universe without a mundane explanation or some realistic comparison.Next up we have simple unoriginality. In the first book there is reference to two different aliens with 3 eyes. The names are Triclops and Trioculous. Yeah. I guess it is a good thing there wasn't a 3rd three eye alien or it would be named Triumph or Triceratops or something else equally unoriginal. There is also quite alot of acronyms used. Yes, this is a regular thing in the Star Wars universe, but it feels overboard. From TNT's to SPIN. The acronyms are not only bad, but spelled out telling you &#34;SPIN is short for Senate's Planetary Intelligence Network&#34;. A decent author is able to work in an acronym's long name without spelling it out directly. There are also HSD's (Housekeeping specialist droids) and JDT's (Jawa Droid Traders). I mean really, why not just say Jawas? Though this is a kids book so I suppose I will be lenient on this one. There is also a Homework Correction droid... ugh. There was alaso a reference to a secret code in one of the books JE-99-DI-88-FOR-00-CE. Again, I suppose I have to cut it some slack for being a kids book, but I did a major eyeroll on this one.Next up we have continuity problems - Darth vader has an indestructible glove? Ummm, ok, sure why not. Banthas on Yavin? I suppose that is possible, though unlikely. There is a reference to a few neighboring towns near the Alliance temple on Yavin. I suppose a small village might be set up but for the most part, Yavin was a jungle world with no indigenous sentient life forms and was a pretty secret place to begin with. The fact that there would be a few well populated towns nearby seems a bit overstated. In the 3rd book it talks about Jabba's palace and how when Jabba died the palace was turned into a retirement home for aged aliens by the government of Tatooine. Really, the palace was taken back by the B'omarr monks, and I would highly doubt anyone wanting to live their last years in peace would want to do that in a place like that, that also happens to be quite a long distance away from any well populated area. And then the idea that there is an actual government for all of Tatooine? Possible but again, doubtful.Overall the writing is simple and silly and truly meant for very young children. Much of the continuity does not align well with other books and too many times as I was reading this I laughed out loud at either the absurdity of plot or character actions, to cringing at how bad the writing was. The Star Wars fan in me wants to keep reading the last 3 books but quality issues aside, this is too far out of the normal Star Wars universe to be considered extended extended universe or even alternate universe."},{"Title":"Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 3)","review":"In this book written by Paul Hollace\\\\Davids,Zorba the hutt or Jabba the hutts Father returns to Tatooine to meet with his son ,but he soon finds That Jabba is now dead because Princess Leia choked him with a chain.

There Zorba also learns of an imperiel bounty on Ken. In Jabba's old palace he finds Jabba's will. One of the things in the will are some hotels on the Cloud City. So he decides to travel to The Cloud City. As that happens Luke & Ken (the Jedi Prince) are going to Han's new opening of his Cloud House. They bring him a house-cleaning droid. Trioculus has a training base near there. Zorba comes and wins the rulership of the Cloud City from Lando in a rigged card game. Han's new house-cleaning droid falls from his house (which is suspended in mid-air). Though Luke and Leia rescue the droid they are captured by empiriels. They take Leia to Trioculus who wants her to be his bride, though she resists and Trioculus locks her in his room. Then Han leaves to see what has happend to Luke & Leia. So Ken is looking in the cockpit of Han's cloud racecar when it accidentally starts and flies off with him in it. He is arrested for being to young to fly. But Zorba learns thet he is the Jedi Prince that is wanted by the empire. He summons Trioculus and offers him Ken for Leia. Trioculus refuses saying that he wants him for his queen. Zorba is furious because he wants to kill her. And that is how the feud begins. It is very good and exiting.

Now that I have recently read this book and the whole series again, I realize that they are really not very good at all, and I am generally pretty leniant with books of all kinds! This book in particular was one of the worst. The plot is silly and unbelievable, and the characters and writing are plain awfull. Kids twelve and under probably won't notice or care, but older fans will most likely find them boring and stupid.

I was hoping to identify warblers that have been visiting my bird feeders but I was unable to use this book for that purpose. Some of the plates are blurred which gives them an almost watercolor look, if that makes sense. I could see someone using this book as a starting point to identify birds that live near you.At over 450 pages you should be able to find a description of any land bird in America. Not all have pictures but those that do will list on what page the plate (picture) is.

I believe Mr. Culpepper was what was known as a county agent, who worked for the State of Alabama, where we lived. He actually was in Monroeville, which as you may know is the home of Harper Lee, writer of To Kill a Mockingbird. If you look on the back of the book, there's a surprise.But the book itself is a treasure of folksy, delightful and self-deprecating humor. I am surprised at how fresh it is today, after more than sixty years. Some of the titles of the columns (he mentions that they are columns; I'm guessing they were published in the local paper) are \\"Dogs Like to Attend Cookouts in a Body\\", \\"Most Football Coaches Spend Most of Their Time Rebuilding\\", \\"Better See What You Are Getting Married To\\", \\"The National \`Tight Pants' Association, A Growing Institution\\" and so many more.

My father may have been a shrewd and sometimes ruthless negotiator but he always saught a good home for \\"his pictures\\" and could judge a great one from a \\"postage stamp\\".

It reminds you that it's easy to see things clearly when you're looking back on any sports hero's exploits, but the trip was hard work and tough choices while the history is being written.

If you don't currently believe in \\"a higher power\\" who orchestrates amazing feats through His creations, you will after reading this book.In addition to the story, itself - there are many beautiful pictures which document his journey into horse racing history.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"After reading all these wonderful reviews, I don't think I can contribute anything more with mere words. Being fortunate enough to have been around thoroughbreds, and just plain horses all my life, this horse, since day one that I saw him, for some reason, struck some chord in my being that was very deep, sometimes you meet or come in contact with beings that seem to be kindred spirits of some very close nature. Secretariat was one of those very inspirational beauties.This book does him true justice. Also the reviews, I mean 5's across !!Just as a side note, I don't know how many watched the Belmont Stakes this year, (2009), but the horse that won, Summer Bird, looked somewhat like Big Red. The horse, (Mine that Bird), that he ran by at the finish line is his half brother, (both by Birdstone), the only difference is one of the great great grandfathers on the, (Summer Birds)dams side is........ you guessed it, Secretariat. Blessings....."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"In over 40 years of following the thoroughbred industry and its participants I have seen no book that even begins to match this one in capturing just a small glimpse of what was the reality of &quot;Secretariat.&quot; No offense to Mr. Ali but if this horse had been a boxer there would be no doubt about who was &quot;the greatest&quot; . . . just as there is no doubt that this book will satisfy any lover of horses and the horse racing industry. The photographs are unmatched. I bought an original edition and am now buying the revised edition for my friends and children. Do I like it or what?"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I, too fell in love with Secretariat and the sport of horse racing as a young, horse crazy girl. I am proud to own this one and William Nack's &quot;The making of a Champion&quot;. The photos are beautiful, also. It gives you an up close look at the process of developing a world class athlete. This book is a great tribute. Secretariat will live on in our memories forever. I miss him."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This a beautiful array of pictures of the greatest horse ever! Even people who aren't that interested in animals would probably enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I'm almost 40 years old and first came across this book when I was a mere 10. The very first book was bigger and had the famous blue and white blocks on the front. I am glad that the pictures are still the same. But the only thing that was disappointing.. print marks on the edges and across the page. I bought this book brand new and though the photos are pretty good, the book is marred. This book was also thicker and that was what I was hoping for.I did see the movie on IMAX and though it was a Disney film, it was pretty good. Not enough racing and the Belmont stakes he was so well known for terribly slices deep into taking away the furlongs that were greater and greater as he ran. They should have used more live footage with today's technology and should have had a bio on the horse. *sigh*"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"bought as a gift, it seems very well put together and very informative for anyone who is interested in the best race horse ever"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This book is full of pictures which is what I was looking for even more than informative text, though it has that as well. It's a good overall recollection of a horse and the events that occurred when I was just twelve, but has touched my life forever."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Because of a lifetime interest of all things Horse, i enjoy reading about them, their owners, handlers,etc.i was able to see the great horse SECRETARIAT run his races,winning and the two he lost. so much has been said about that incredible horse, that i really cannot add more words, except WOW!!!!! HE was quite the BOY."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! I adore Secretariat and wept like a baby when he died. This book is really the next best thing to watching the videos of him run. Even just reading about the Belmont Stakes sends a thrill down my spine. This book captures the spirit of &quot;Big Red&quot; - from when he was foal on the farm to his retirement from racing. The pictures are wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this great champion."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Mr. Woolfe's book is just what the horse-lover and racing fan needs to remember the astounding racing career of Secretariat. To think that his records still stand to this day --it gives the reader an idea of his true greatness. The only fact that wasn't mentioned in the final chapter was that Secretariat won three Eclipse Awards in 1973, and I'm sure that was just an inadvertent oversight. To those who saw Real Quiet race in the Kentucky Derby--Secretariat would have been many, many lengths ahead of him. It will be a long time before there is another like him."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Why does Secretariat bring tears to our eyes ? A little less than perfection can make us smile, but this horse (\\"horse\\" is such an understatement)is so emotionally overwhelming, some of us cry. Although I haven't read the other books listed here, \\"Secretariat\\" by Raymond G. Woolfe may be the definitive book about this unique champion. There are details that put the reader at the scene and in the action. In the back of the book are special features: Secretariat's lineage (his bloodlines), his winning get (progeny), and biographical sketches of what happened to the significant persons in his life. (This feature of the book is especially interesting if you've seen the movie.)There is a copious supply of pictures, both black and white and color. If you buy this book, allow an hour just to look through it, then read it to relive vicariously the days of horseracing glory. I have the original newspaper page about his winning the Belmont,which I had considered selling. I think not; it's a physical means of contact over the years with a magnificent creature. This is a fulfilling book for anyone who loves horses, especially this one."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Even though I was around and part of the scene, I was riveted to this updated version book and read it through, every last page, every word, and devoured the pictures... What an incredible horse and what an incredible time in history... This is a book to be treasured and handed down. I loved the pictures and the foreword by Turcotte... well, don't want to be too emotional, but if you were caught up in the racing world in the 70's or if you truly love a good horse story that is factual, then you will love this book!!!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I watched the Disney movie and then was compelled to look up all the old books on Big Red that I'd read before. It's funny, but the passage of time doesn't seem to lessen the emotion I feel about this amazing horse, and in reading this book, I found myself deeply involved again in all the players and the stories behind each race. I love the photos, and some of them brought tears, such as Secretariat being led off the track for the last time, Ron Turcotte kissing him goodbye, and especially the picture of Eddie Sweat, the groom, standing alone with his suitcase, back to the camera, but apparently wiping tears as he said goodbye to Secretariat at Claiborne farm. Those of us who have been impacted by this horse will love to go back in time with this story and these pictures, but a warning that the \\"Where They Are\\" section at the end can really bring up the emotions. You realize that not just the horse, but the people around him, touched you deeply. I'm glad there are books like this, videos, and a web site to help us keep Big Red alive in our hearts."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This book was everything I thought it'd be. Many pictures I'd never seen and lots of facts I never knew about this magical horse. I loved the fact that it contained information about what happened to many of the people and animals who were intimately involved with Secretariat. There were a couple of things that I'd read years ago when Secretariat died that were different in this book, however, and I'd like to know which are factual. I've visited Claiborne Farm and laid a dozen red roses on Secretariat's resting place, and would incourage anyone to visit there someday."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"SECRETARIAT has been my hero since 1973 when he demolished all Triple Crown records. I read everything I can about him; I have an entire room devoted to his pictures. Any book about SECRETARIAT is a great book, and this one is."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I was quite pleased with this book, especially the expanded edition, which includes information about his offspring. I wish it had more photos, but the photos that are there are choice. Wolfe did his research. And interesting read and a must have if you're a fan of Secretariat."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I was wounded on 12/24/72 on the Bassac River,Vietnam.I came home and was at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital in April of 73when I first heard of Secretariat.My Mom was a an avid horse racing fan,so I watched his Derby and Preakness on T.V..I felt that I had to see this horse in person so when I went to New York to see my parents I went to the Belmont on the day he ran.I was feeling really bad about myself from the war,but when I saw him in the circle before he went out to the track,I felt cleansed.I don't want to sound all flowery and all,but I'm sorry if no one understands.They weren't there with me.He looked me right in the eye and I felt good for the first time in a long time.I didn't feel that I would ever feel good again,but a horse changed all that in me with just one look.Imagine that.For making me feel better,I owe him that,and will alwys love him for it.I bet $100.00 dollars on him that day.I still have the ticket."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"SECRETARIAT was first published in 1974 by Raymond Woolfe and immediately sold out. For years the book was out of print, except for a limited edition book published in around 1991. Thank goodness it is now back in print and is available to all fans of the great horse.Woolfe seemed to have had unlimited access to Secretariat's connections. He traces the horse's life from the time he was foaled in 1970 until his death in 1989. Furthermore, the book is jam-packed with photographs by the author, the most famous being the &quot;takeoff&quot; shot of Secretariat about to make his first turn sweep of the field in the 1973 Preakness. The book truly gives the reader a feel of what this horse was like, especially those readers who were not lucky enough to have seen him in person.SECRETARIAT is for all lovers of horse racing, and it is the perfect companion to Bill Nack's classic biography, SECRETARIAT: THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I've always been a Secretariat fan, since I was a 12 year old horse crazy girl and saw him run for the first time. I own two Secretariat books and while they are both good, this one is by far more detailed and interesting. Not to mention the GREAT photos. Very well done."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I own a granddaughter of Secretariat and since I wasn't alive when the big red horse was racing, I wanted to read about my horse's famous grandfather. This book told the details of all his races, especially his Triple Crown races. It was also very detailed about other times in his life, like his training, when he was young, and when he retired to stud. There was a whole chapter devoted to the offspring he sired during his time at stud. It was a great book that told all about one of the greatest racehorses that ever lived. There are also many pictures, color and black and white. They show the master at work on the track and they show what a beautiful horse he was. A great book for any Secretariat fans and for horse lovers."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"How does one even begin to describe the greatest horse of all time? I suppose it probably helped to have spent a lot of time with the horse, which Ron Turcotte certainly did. And no doubt, it helped that said horse broke all records in the Derby, Preakness and the Belmont, and did it with such style! How well I remember the Derby! Our senior prom was the night before and everyone in our group wanted to make sure we were back from the beach in plenty of time to watch Secretariat as he made history with his 1:59 and 2/5's to win. Then on to the Preakness, with his famous lunge going into the turn past two horses, and then 'clean-up time' as he moved past all of them, on the turn. One of the more interesting quotes-and this book has many of them- is George Cusimano, riding Ecole Etage describing what it was like when Secretariat flew by his horse: '&quot; When he came by, it felt like a freight train passing-blew the number right off my sleeve.&quot;' And what is there to say about the Belmont? Quite simply, a quiet reverence to the unreality of what this horse was doing. 31 lengths-one sixteenth of a mile ahead of the other horses. Sensational! This book is also chock full of photos, from the one on page 27 when he was a ' &quot; big, well made foal,&quot; to the photos of his dam, Somethingroyal and his sire, Bold Ruler, to the touchingly, poignant photo of Penny Chenery saying goodbye to Secretariat, with Lucien Laurin and sculpter Jim Reno looking on.I felt when he died, that our nation's national pet had died. He represented everything that was wonderful and great about our country because he made us feel good about ourselves. Thank Heaven we still have him on film. He'll be with us forever and always, forever in our hearts. Miss you, Big Red."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This big beautiful book brings back the magnificence of Big Red like no other. Crammed with photos of everything form his Jockey Club ID photo as a foal (adorable) to workouts and races, grooming and bathing, and of the people around him - Penny (Tweedy) Chenery, Lucian Lauren, Eddie Sweat, Ron Turcotte and others - these alone are worth the price of admission. The photo of him and Turcotte taking off in the Preakness is as close to a flying horse as you'll ever see. The text is an engaging biography of Secretariat's earliest days at Meadow Farm, to his record shattering, history making races, ending with his retirement and success in the breeding barn - including photos and deeds of a few of his most accomplished get. It concludes with his untimely death at only 19 years. This book is also full of the history of, and interviews with, those who surrounded this awesome horse, and well known racing people who witnessed him run. As a horse loving 12 year old I watched history being made in 1973 - though it was only on TV - as Secretariat galloped seemingly effortlessly into history with those three races. I knew even in my youth and naivete that I would never see a feat that magnificent again. It's been 30 years now, and I haven't been wrong yet. This book is a must for those who love, and still love, this horse and racing. And for those who doubt - read the book. You will doubt no more."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I am a huge fan (like most people who know anything about horse racing) of the great Secretariat. As most people know, he was the most OUTSTANDING horse that ever graced the earth, and this book is a great tribute to him. I found it in an old book store and had to buy it. Then Woolfe came out with a 25th anniversary edition which is much better because it talks not only about his race career, but his life as a stallion and as a retired legend. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something about Secretariat. It not only contains a wonderful life story of him, but it also contains many pictures to go along with the history. You will see pictures of him as a yearling at Meadow Stables in Virginia, him winning the races that made him famous, hanging out with Eddie Sweat, and even him retiring at Claiborne Farms. This book has it all and I still get teary-eyed when I read the end."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I remember checking this book out of the library several times in the late 70's as I was a big fan of Secretariat, the greatest race horse in history. It gives a great summary of his life from birth, including the story of how his ownership was determined by the LOSS of a coin flip. It gives a great summary of all his races, especially the 1973 Triple Crown, where Secretariat battled his West Coast nemesis Sham and wiped him out with his 31-length victory in the Belmont Stakes. But what I like about the 1998 version of the book is that Mr. Woolfe updated it to discuss Secretariat's life after racing, including a review of his successful proginy. The pictures are great. If you combine this book with William Nack's book on Secretariat, you will have a very good understanding of the horse of a lifetime. A must for horse racing enthusiasts!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"On Oct. 4, 1989 the evening news shows carried the story that Secretariat had been euthanized. I cried my heart out. Called in sick to work the next day. My personal hero had left us. The current generation of Barbaro-worshippers can't understand what it was like to watch The Red run. You knew you were watching history unfold, as much as when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon. Secretariat lifted up an entire nation, kissed it and put it back down. We were sick of Vietnam, sick of Watergate, sick of being the trashcan the world kicks down the street. Secretariat, the most magnificent assemblage of bone, muscle, brain and heart walked out in front of us and said, \\"watch me.\\" Simple and to the point. Bred in America. Homegrown and hardworking. And setting the gold standard for perfection. This book simply reminds everyone how he was and how he made us feel. Nearly 20 years later I still cry my heart out on October 4th. But I look at his photos and read the stories about him and I am grateful to have been a witness to something that defies description."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This book is great and chock full of beautiful, rich, and colorful photos; Secretariat almost looks real in some of them. It has just as much accurate information as Bill Nack's \\"The Making of a Champion,\\" but doesn't go into the tedious detail of related bloodlines and the syndicate deal made for Secretariat. I found this book to be better than Nack's because of that, the pacing, and the gorgeous photos."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I love this horse and this book. The pictures are just great. If you have any interest in horses, this is one that you cannot miss. The book is full of information and pictures that show Secretariat in all his powerful glory. This is one to keep."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This was the first biography/hagiography of Secretariat, and it was impossible to find for many years. A few years ago there was a limited edition of the book, but it was out of the price range for most Secretariat fans. Thank goodness the book is now readily available. Woolfe has wonderful photographs to back his prose and it is a fine companion to Bill Nack's book. Let's hope this edition doesn't go out of print."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I really enjoyed this book! There are many wonderful pictures and you learn a lot of things about Secretariet...the greatest racehorse that ever lived! If you are a fan of Secretariet, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This is the second book I read on Secretariat. It filled in some gaps from the movie and the first book.I remember the Derby and the Preakness but for the life of me I cannot remember why I missed the Belmont.After having seen the movie and learning of the time period, it raised some interest on my part and I read all I could about the horse, the trainer (Eddie), the Chenery's. I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"If yoy are a Secretariat fan you will love this book! The pictures are gorgeous and it clears up some information that is different than the movie."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I loved Secretariat. I was a young man that had watched my heros get killed in the 60's. Watching this great horse run inspired me and helped me believe again. The book brings back memories, but I think Secretariat was bigger than horseracing and his story needs the context of the bigger events of this era."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Short of video, this book is very good. Text is informative and photos are superb. I would recommend this to any horse fan."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Wonderful historical story about maybe the best athlete ever to live. I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good story."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"If you love the story of Secretariat, you will enjoy this book! This is a great book to display and has wonderful photos!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This DVD and book are Christmas presents so we have not seen either as yet. I was very pleased with the service by the vendor, as noted by my rating."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I bought this book as a Secretariat and general thoroughbred racing fan. I discovered it in a book store in St. Petersburg, FL a couple of years ago, and just recently purchased it for my very own through Amazon. At that time, I remember seeing it on the shelf and with wide-eyes, removing it to sit on the floor cross-legged and look at the beautiful array of photographs. I couldn't believe that a coffee table book had been put together about my favorite champion.And that's still how I feel. If one is looking for photos and photos and more photos of this red legend, this book is the one to own. I am just now getting around to the text, as I have read two Secretariat biographies already, but that is also well written and captures major and interesting details about this horse's life.Thank you Raymond G. Woolfe Jr. for composing a book that is worthy of our 1973 hero."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"Great book for everyone. Gives good insight into backgound on Secretariat before, during and after his races. Great insight into how he was handles, media pressure and everything around this great horse. Would highly recommend for everyone. Could not put down."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This book has it all: wonderful photos, great text, the definitive book on everyone's favorite thoroughbred. If watching Secretariat win the Belmont still makes your heart pound, this book is for you!!!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I got this book primarily because I was told it had all Sec's charts in it. It does, and it has his career log (races, works, etc), terrific beautiful photos, and a good solid narrative. I was pleased with the data presented, and the writing style was nice without the over-fawning poetic prose too typical of the few racehorse bios there have ever been. I'd still like to see data more concisely and thoroughly presented (e.g., thorough categorization of records and the differentials), but this is no worse than any other racehorse work; I've not seen or heard of 1 yet that does.Clearly Mr. Woolfe loves Sec, but has the good sense not to present a bunch of flowery poetry as the argument for being #1 horse. He's even wise to leave open the #1 horse argument when it's brought up in the course of the story (not that I'd really blame a Sec fan in his own book for saying Sec is greatest, but this way he's avoided alienating those of us with different opinions). Yet, Woolfe's &quot;emotional&quot; enough to have brought a tear to this &quot;non-Secretariat&quot; fan's eye at his retirement. I think Woolfe did it mainly through his generally even-handed coverage of Sec's career all along, covering him both in fact and engaging &quot;human/horse interest&quot; narrative, so that by the end all of us are sad at his departure from the track because we all sort of felt like Sec was our pet. Even those of us &quot;veterans&quot; numbed and hardened by the &quot;Who's the Greatest Horse&quot; Wars. ;-)I was also touched by the coverage of Riva Ridge. It was nice to see him get so much attention. He may not have been Secretariat, but he was an excellent horse (with striking coloration - like a golden-red dun almost!) and it was nice he could &quot;tag along&quot; even in this book.It didn't convert me to Sec-is-#1 Camp, but it's an excellent book on its own. I think Woolfe could have made us cry over any horse the way he set this up."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This is a wonderful trip down memory lane for those who followed Big Red's career. Those who were introduced to him through the movie will learn the whole story. Riva Ridge also gets his just due in this book."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I have loved this ever since I found it (and bought it) in 1974. I memorized the race cards and statistics in it, read it over and over; it was next to my bed for months until I was probably 14 or 15. Engaging and well-written."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"this book is absolutely awesome!!! it is wonderfully written and put together, it is entertaining as well as factual, and thoroughly entertaining! with the advent of the new movie, this is an awesome book to tell the actual story about secretariat, and it straightens out many mis-nomers in the movie - albiet the move was very good but lets face it... it is a disney story, not a story about secretariat. also the pictures are awesome and a wonderful historical archive to keep in my library. a must for all horse lovers of any kind. i would have paid double for it!!!"},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"I liked this book alot as it gave alot of the backgound of him and went into alot of detail of the races. It made me appreciate him as the wonder horse he was(I always thought Man O War was the best).Had alot of photos also which I liked. Great book."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This book is a beautiful book, with great photos to supplement the text. It will be of interest to all."},{"Title":"Secretariat","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful book about the greatest racehorse of all-time.

O'Reilly's 'Nutshell' series really are the most valuable books on my shelf (I'm a programmer). I have at least 5 others in the Nutshell series, not counting the older ones since upgraded to 2nd or even 3rd editions. So when my dad upgraded his office to AutoCAD 2000, and I had to fiddle with his new machine, and 2000, I quickly discovered how rusty I was! (Haven't used it extensively since r12). This book really is the supreme AutoCAD reference for those who don't want to read 5 pages to get two sentences worth of information. Sick of those 2000 page paper(literally)weights? This one will comfortably tote in a briefcase, or laptop bag - without losing any of the meat within all those other, fatter books. Now my dad loves it as well! He stole my copy, and bought a couple more as gifts. It's worth every dime - and far, far cheaper than those giant tree-killer 'bibles'. (How apt! All those extra words!) Hopefully they'll print a 2nd edition soon, for Acad2002..."},{"Title":"Autocad 2000 in a Nutshell: A Command Reference Guide","review":"This AutoCAD book contains all of commands and the best practice method. Also it is a flawless desk reference about engineering design. To approach to the solutions are the only thing that keeps this book from being the best available for making design a person for all engineering areas.

Sloan. His colleague, Inspector Harpe ('Happy' Harry, who's never seen anything to smile about in Traffic Division) gets his fair share of the stage.\\"Blue Upright\\", \\"Cause and Effects\\", \\"Slight of Hand\\" - These 3 Henry Tyler mysteries can be found on the unabridged audio _Cause and Effects_, read by Edward Raleigh (see my review for details).\\"Bare Essentials\\" - See my review of the audio collection of the same name.\\"Devilled Dip\\" - Anthony (known as 'Ant'), as a professional pickpocket, doesn't take much stock in his wife's announcement that his horoscope says he'll be the life and soul of the day's events.\\"Double Jeopardy\\" - While Sloan and Crosby are waiting for a report in the mortuary, Dr. Dabbe the pathologist tells one of his doctor father's stories, about an experimental high-fever treatment for VD (infecting the subject with malaria to sort of cancel things out) that very nearly went into the doctor instead of the patient...\\"A Fair Cop\\" - This is really Happy Harry's case rather than Sloan's. A young nurse, coming off duty late one night, found herself being pursued by another driver for miles. (That story doesn't turn out quite the way you'll expect; very clever.) Now Harpe has 'chummie' locked inside a car, and wants Sloan (as CID) to tell him what the creep can be charged with, since the girl mercifully hasn't been hurt.\\"The Hard Sell\\" - Harpe, meeting Sloan over tea and sandwiches in the police canteen, had to deal with a death by motorcar at the Calleshire Classic Car Club. A Jaguar being put through an engine test for a prospective buyer, with no one at the wheel, managed to kill a man. Sloan has to cross-examine Harry to get all the details.\\"Her Indoors\\" - Leeyes is relaying a request to Sloan from the Assistant Chief Constable: he'd like Sloan's opinion, as a working detective, on an unnamed woman whose husband was murdered by her daughter's boyfriend. See if you can work out exactly who the ACC is asking about before Leeyes spells it out.\\"Home is the Hunter\\" - Sloan and Crosby are sent to carry out an extradition order on Laura Vercollas, whose much older husband died in suspicious circumstances in a small-town hotel in France. If she didn't kill him, what happened?\\"Lord Peter's Touch\\" - This was originally written for a book dedicated to *the* Lord Peter. As it happens, the 8 ringers at Almstone church in Calleshire are always called after the ringers in Sayers' _The Nine Tailors_, and one of the ringers was killed when his bell's stay broke, toppling the bell over its balance point and slamming the ringer on the other end of the rope into the ceiling. This story consists of Sloan's final report to Superintendent Leeyes; a friend of the Almstone rector's, substituting for (who else?) the ringer called William Thoday, seems to have worked out most of the case before Sloan even arrived.\\"The Man Who Rowed for the Shore\\" - In an unusual twist, the viewpoint character is Norman Pace, who has just cleverly arranged the murder of his wife. He seems to have thought of everything, even timing matters so that her death and funeral arrangements happened while he was out of the country. The question is how Sloan will ever find out about it, let alone be able to prosecute, as Pace had his wife cremated and is about to scatter the ashes at sea.\\"Memory Corner\\" - Crosby has just taken a call from Almstone University, asking the CID to please come around, because the caller just killed a man. (Sloan's first reaction is to call people in white coats instead). We're treated to the weirdest confession of a supposed murderer I've seen in a long time - is the guy crazy, or crazy like a fox?\\"The Misjudgement of Paris\\" - Henry Molland has the most experience in among the candidates, but isn't likely to win in the final interviews for general manager (UK), being held in Paris to see how the candidates get along without support staff - the higher-ups think he's too old. Instead of having a stag night with the other candidates, he opts for breakfast with his daughter in the hotel on the morning of the final interview, which has unexpected consequences. Not a mystery, but entertaining.\\"One Under the Eight\\" - Sir Paul Markham of Almstone is a distinguished scientist, working for a clandestine agency. (Sloan has some private, uncomplimentary comparisons with a nutter under the railway arches who also has problems with unnamed outside agencies.) Sir Paul's research was stolen the night before, and now the chief constable has been called in to help contain the problem - because only 3 members of the security agency could have tipped off whoever bypassed Sir Paul's security system. The question is, when did any of them have a chance to pass on the information, and how did they do it? They were at a wine-tasting exhibition all evening...\\"Steady as She Goes\\" - After the sudden death of Anna Macmillan, Dr. Dabbe found she died of antimony poisoning.

The main character's name is Akaky Akakievich, who is destined to be a &quot;no body&quot; in this world from birth. He lives a hard life in Petersburg earning what little money he gets by copying documents. Gogol uses excellent imagery with the description of Akaky by using phrases such as &quot;a complexion that might be aptly described as hemorrhoidal.&quot;Akaky is always the butt of jeers and jokes because of his social and physical status. Clerks often shower pieces of paper on the silent Akaky. One quote from Akaky often sticks in the minds of readers when he was being teased by one of the new clerks; &quot;Let me be. Why do you do this to me? . . .&quot; It is easy to see why Akaky is the butt of the jokes because he wears a shabby, almost see through frock known as the &quot;old dressing gown.&quot; He doesn't even care when scraps of melon rinds and trash are thrown on him when he is walking to and from work.The story gets underway when Akaky is forced to scrape together what little money he can and buy a new overcoat. This is the part of the story where he changes pretty drastically because he gains a little respect from his peers and is even seen at a party drinking a little champagne. The plot continues as something happens to Akaky and the overcoat.I highly recommend reading this short story, as I enjoyed it immensely. I often wrote as many essays as I could possible on this story in my 10th grade english class. After reading this book I grew to love Gogol and I look forward to looking for more of his works. I really admire Gogol's way of using imagery to describe Akaky and his symbolism of the old dressing gown and the new overcoat. The ending was not expected as you find out what happens to the overcoat, Akaky, and the others involved."},{"Title":"The Overcoat","review":"I purchased this item thinking it was the English translation, probably because the title was in English and I could find no indication that it was the original Russian text.

Also the way Gogol exemplifies the hardships of being poor and trying to work the way up the ladder of life only to see that you end up back at the beginning. Akaky is concerned with greed towards the end and is happy with where he is now only to leave the reader unsatisfied. The clever points that Gogol uses to refer to the devil and greed were baffling. One example that sticks out in my mind is the fact that the story was based on St. Petersburg, Russia, and the apostle of Jesus, Peter, was known to deny Jesus three times became devilish. While reading this book, I found myself feeling bad for Akaky becuase as the author say's &quot;True this creature, who had meely bore the office jokes and gone quitely to his grave, had had, toward the end of his life, a cherished visitor-the overcoat, which for a brief moment had brightened his wreched existence. Then a crushing blow had finished everything, a blow such befalls the powerful of the earth...&quot; I defintly reccommend this book for it's clever wit and many emotions it pulls you through, throughout the story."},{"Title":"The Overcoat","review":"These stories are a painful insight into the way Nikolay Vasilyevitch Gogol percieved the world around him.

The first half has snippets of code showing how to do this and that, organized in package order (javax.swing are in the yet to be published 2nd volume). Very useful. The second half is a very detailed class documentation in alphabetical order. My take is that if you have an IDE like VisualAge, which allows you to browse through classes and methods, and their references, senders, implementors, then this section of the book is not necessary. On the other hand, if you leaf through the latest Java in a Nutshell... The first half of the book also reminds of Java Cookbook. Couple of things I am perplexed by all these example books is that when exposing an example with dates, they all use the Date class. Unfortunately, this class cannot represent a date prior to 1970, thus many birtdays of living adults today cannot be represented (CalendarDate should be used).

The first section includes simple examples of common uses of the java packages. I find this extremely useful. There are realms in Java where the intricacies often slip my mind, particularly in java.io, and the small examples of these packages shown in section 1 serve as a perfect reminder of how exactly to accomplish my task.Section 2 is the meat of the book and includes a reference to the classes and their members. This is similar to the online API, but lacking the descriptions for the methods / classes. This is strictly a quick reference of the methods, their arguments, return types and modifiers, and the variables belonging to a class. For a description of every method, use the online API. Personally though, I find this reference quicker to use than the online API when searching for a particular class. It probably comes down to personal preference, though.Sections 3 and 4 I honestly haven't found a need for.

In my work as a technical editor of Java books, I have found this book invaluable. The content consists almost entirely of the class names, what they are derived from and the interfaces. The remainder is a collection of \\"examplets\\", small snippets of code that show how some of the methods are used. Alphabetized based on the class names, it is adequate when your only interest is in the name of a class or the characteristics of a method. Of course, it is only my first avenue, for more detailed information it is necessary to consult another resource.

I teach Java classes to experienced developers and I have always kept it at my side to answer those inevitable questions concerning prototypes and other methods available in a class.The examples in this book make it more helpful than if it was just a listing of methods.

Thorough and yet concise, it has the highest content-to-page ratio of any programming reference I have seen. The Java classes are big and the _Java Developers Almanac_ is the tool to use to quickly find the details needed to get programs running. It is a great help for rapid prototyping in new application areas, and to fine-tune and polish the finished product. The &quot;traditional&quot; class documentation found in other reference books can be tiring, frustrating and time consuming to use because it usually only describes what is new to a class, leaving it to the reader to flip around to chase up the inheritance tree to see everything. The &quot;Almanac&quot; tells everything for every class. While this may be a redundant use of paper and ink, it is a great time saver to the programmer trying to use a new class.This is not a book to learn Java or object oriented programming.

The most successful reference books strive for heft - the bigger the better - often approaching prehistoric proportions. But sooner or later there comes a book that defies tradition and manages to be complete without breaking your desk, or your wallet.

This is 5.5&quot;x8&quot; book is small enough to carry comfortably and lays flat next to a keyboard without taking up the entire desk, but it is not so small that the print becomes indecipherable. It is truly printed in the style of an almanac - the same paper, the same form factor. That would be enough to make me buy it even if it didn't contain some great stuff inside.For the most part the book contains prototype declarations for every public and protected member of every Java class, all 18,837 of them. How do I know there are that many? Because one of the most interesting sections consists of statistics gathered from every Java release since 1.0. In addition the book contains detailed listings of what has changed - omissions and additions - between every Java release, including PersonalJava. Seeing the definitive list of changes from one version to another was fascinating (although it shows what a shambles the compatibility story is.) Nonetheless this book manages to capture the vary latest changes up to Java 1.2b3. It is just staggering to consider that there has been an order-of-magnitude growth in the number of methods since Java1.0!!! That's why I need this book.The prototypes are organized alphabetically by class making it easy to find just what you are looking for. There are notations where necessary for methods that are only available under certain Java versions. For each class, the inheritance hierarchy is reproduced and what interfaces that class implements is noted. Even though the contents are organized for speed, I like brow! sing this book just to get a feel for breath of the Java class landscape. Thankfully I will never need most of the 1592 classes and interfaces in the Java 1.2 class hierarchy but it's nice to know they're there in case I do.Unlike some authors that have let their Java books get mouldy while the language evolves, Patrick Chan has been writing and revising java reference books since he left the Java development team at Sun. He was one of the first people to write any substantive Java applets back when the whole Java group fit in one (small) room. Since then he has written or revised at least three (or more?) books on Java.I think this book will prove to be a useful addition to any experienced Java hacker's bookshelf.

It has four parts, but the first two are the bulk of the book. Part 1 lists each java package. Within a package, it tells of each class and interface and provides examples of how to do often needed tasks. You already need to know java to fully take advantage of this. Part 2 is an alphabetical listing of all classes, from all packages. For each class you can see its ancestors and all members of the class, with calling arguments and return values. Part 3 has miscellaneous topics; most usefully the difference between java 1.3 and 1.4 (the latest), as in the title. Part 4 is basically an index, being a cross reference of classes and interfaces.The sweep of the book is comprehensive and up to date. But of limited use. Part 2, which is half the book, differs in no material way from this URL- .... Sun makes this available on the web as an aid to java programmers. Other websites also publish it. In addition, you can copy the manual and have it available locally on your computer. My mode of programming involves bookmarking the URL and having a browser window dedicated to it during coding. Not just me. In various companies and universities, I've seen others do this.Are you old enough to remember log tables? These were books of logarithms, powers and trigonometric functions. Prior to the advent of pocket calculators, students would have their own copies. They were comprehensive and correct. Now totally redundant. That is what Part 2 reminds me of.

Part 2 contains detailed information about the classes themselves, and contains references to code examples from Part 1 to see how the class is used in code. This is essentially the documentation that SUN's website provides, but in my view, it's more condensed and the references to code are a bonus.Part 3 contains topics on the transition of Java from 1.0 to its current incarnation, detailing deprecated classes, new classes, etc. Part 4 is the cross-reference section, where if you know the name of the method, but not the class that contains that method, you can simply look it up.

Good software is increasingly making tools like this obsolete, but somehow hard-copy atlases always seem to have a place, and they're handy to grab off the shelf and just casually study too."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"Even if this atlas does not shows all the stars to magnitude 23 (!), it should keep your small telescope busy for years!A really nice index of interesting objects faces the charts.The monthly star charts are, on the other hand, of little use, and can be replaced by a good planisphere."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"awesome great cool the best ever fantastic wonderfull number #1 1st place book"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"I have a 4 inch apo and if you have scope like me, buy this little gem. Sky maps are just beatiful, having exactly as much info as I need. They are beautifully rendered by a master. Maps overlap generously.Tables are above every map and they are pleasure to use. Of course there is only 912 deep sky objects, but if you have a light bucket over 10&quot; you need an atlas at least as heavy as your scope:) For me it is more than enough.There are very interesting all-sky maps of various objects distribution. They give you a good feeling of our position in Galaxy and Universe.I gave only four stars because in the field it can catch dew and you have to be carefull. The Moon map is not the best and for a reflector, so not good for me.Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"This is the only Star Atlas I have, and I've been using it most nights I am out using the telescope or just studying the night sky. I havn't had the opportunity to compare it with Star Atlas 2000, but to date I have been relatively happy with the purchase. I can't say I have found the best way to physically handle the book when I'm outside, not wanting to damage it or get moisture on it from the dew. I think this would be a consideration next time I make a Star Atlas purchase. A laminated one would be excellent. I would be interested in hearing from people who have other publications, to provide some sort of comparison."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"It's a star atlas and planisphere all in one convenient guide.

The book came quickly and I have already put it to use."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"This product is concise and easy to use and is laid out logically. Of particular benefit, it's easy to estimate the relative brightness of stars by the size of the dots. You need a little background to make the atlas more useful-- particularally, a basic understanding of right ascension. The maps of the moon surface are good and there are both the correct pictures and inverted ones with labels, as seen in a reflecting scope. Physically, the spiral ring binding lays the pages flat and the paper is relatively thick and rigid. On the charts that are to be held below the horizon when being used(where East is to the right when looking north,) there is a terrestial slyline clearly visible. Also for beginners, there are didactics on the phases of the moon and instructions on how to find the correct sky chart for your particular area with the above exceptions noted. I have not used the atlas in the field yet, but since there is good contrast between the background of the page and the black star dots, it should be easy to view with a red light.

I have had Peterson's Field Guide for 15 years. Peterson's has lot's of interesting text info to go along with each chart, but charts are many and small. I recently got Sky Atlas Deluxe. It has great charts but no tables of info. Cambridge is a compromise. It does not show as many stars as either of the other two, but shows enough stars and a considerable number of deep sky objects, with tables accompanying each chart to show coordinates of the objects on that chart. It's not a pocket book like Peterson's, but is a good size to take outside while at the scope. Sky Atlas 2000 is to big to take outside, but is the charts I use at my desk. Cambridge will be the book that is on my little work table when I'm in a field with my scope late at night and just can't seem to find that deep sky object by star hopping. The tables provided with each chart don't list all the deep sky you want to see, but they list enough to keep you occupied."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"Having looked at all the alternatives, this is my favorite small star atlas. With each chart covering 4 hours of right ascension, this atlas lets you get oriented to the major features of a part of the sky in order to start a star-hop. It includes plenty of deep-sky objects to keep you busy.It is *not* sufficient to show all the stars or objects you can see in a small scope - for that, you need Uranometria 2000 (also by Trion) or the Millenium Sky Atlas. But then you're talking a major investmant. In the field, I tend to use Cambridge and Uranometria - Cambridge for star-hopping in close, then Uranometria for nailing down the exact field.By now, my copy is somewhat warped from absorbing so much dew over so many nights - but it still lies flat when opened.As others have mentioned, the monthly charts are somewhat superfluous if you have a planisphere. Anyhow, as you learn the sky, a planisphere quickly becomes unnecessary."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"In addition to this atlas, I own Sky Atlas 2000, Uranometria, and the Millenium Star Atlas, and this is by far the one I use the most. It is a scaled down version of Sky Atlas 2000, and it's reduced size, the convienience of having more of the sky fit on each map, and the increased overlap between charts far outweigh the extra detail you get with Sky Atlas. Of course there are times when more detail is needed, but at these times it's usually best to go stright to Uranometria or MSA. There are a few annoying printing errors, but not enough to interfere with the practicality of the atlas. There are enough deep sky objects plotted to keep you busy for a long time."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"On the plus side, the star charts are the most clear and readable of any 6th magnitude atlas. Unfortunately, the atlas contains a couple of flaws which impede its usefulness in the field.It goes to magnitude 6.5 and shows 9500 stars, which limits its usefulness. Even a lowly 6x30mm finder goes considerably deeper than that.When you look for an object just off the edge of one of your charts, the edge of the chart tells you nothing about where to go next. You have to fumble back to the index page to find out which chart to go to, which is time consuming and aggravating.Terrestrial atlases place guides at the edges of their maps: \\"continues on 14.\\" This is all the more important for astronomical observation, where the user is in the dark with nothing but a red flashlight and possibly holding an eyepiece or filter. To make the atlas practicable for field use, users must write the adjacent chart information on the charts themselves. A row of tabs with the numbers of the charts would make the charts even more usable.It is sad when designers of star atlases do not take into account the needs of their users.A better combination 6th magnitude atlas and observer's guide is Levy's Skywatching. But I would recommend skipping 6th magnitude altogether. Get the Sky and Telescope Pocket Star Atlas instead. It is better designed, goes far deeper--to magnitude 7.6 with 31,000 stars, and costs less. Supplement it with an observer's guide like Skywatching or Celestial Sampler."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"Computers too bulky, pocket books too small? This is probably one of the better books to have at your observing session and site. It makes your observing just that much easier. The pages are loaded with information that others lack. Granted the book does not include all the stars, and why would you want too? It would only add to the confusion of finding the object your really after when your out there in the dark looking at the pages under a red light! The book limits itself to the 23rd magnitude which is fine! Anything beyond that is over kill for the amatuer astronomer anyway. This book gives you the meat and potato's! Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"I have this book and I am very disappointed in it.Yes, the charts are very well done. However, the book's layout and organization (or lack thereof) make the charts next to useless. They do next to nothing for the beginner who needs first to learn the sky. For the more serious observer, these charts are hopeless.I would encourage beginner's to look at Norton's Atlas (20th edition) which has nice, large swaths of the sky covered in each chart along with a large reference section. Yes, if you get serious, you'll outgrow Norton's charts quickly, but you'll still have its useful reference material which is the bulk of the book.For the serious observer, there's the Sky Atlas 2000.0, the Millenium, and older Uranometria atlases, all of which have much more detail that the serious observer craves.As other reviewers have observed, these middle level charts (up to Mag 6) are probably not very uselful for either beginner or serious observer. I would add, \\"especially in the format presented here\\"."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Star Atlas","review":"If you were to buy just one book, this one would be a good choice.

(these are similar to the all sky charts deleted from the paperback edition of luginbuhl & skiff's \\"observering handbook\\".)but the star charts have simply been photoreduced too far: the \\"sky atlas 2000\\" plots the whole sky across 26 charts at about 3 degrees per inch; the \\"cambridge atlas\\" uses just 20 charts, at 8 degrees to the inch. squinting at these delicate, crowded and detailed sky maps is like trying to read any other star atlas from four feet away.the chart labels are in a font that is very small and almost impossible to read: you may need a magnifying glass to use the charts in daylight, and they are uninterpretable with a red light flashlight when observing at night. the facing page of each chart lists varible stars, double stars, globular clusters, open clusters, bright nebulae, planetary nebulae and galaxies (as appropriate), but these lists are also in a delicate 9 point font that most books would reserve for footnotes. difficult to use, this atlas was a real disappointment."},{"Title":"Studies in the Sermon on the Mount","review":"This is a good book, it is highly devotional and not very pastoral or technical.

Though a bit deadening, being more scholarly than confessional, it's very thoroughgoing as to what he sets out to do: in addition to covering purely native cults, he includes mention of the numerous eclectic amalgams of native and Christian faiths which were an eventual result of early rampant colonialism.Since he's not a medicine man or sorcerer or any of that kind of thing himself, he doesn't get inside the system as does, say, Malidoma Som&eacute; (the Dagara people of Burkina Faso and Ghana), or the Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa.But his last chapter \\"God\\" does an about face from the general dryness, and shows how in fact God was in Congolese religion well before the Christian missionaries hit the beaches, and how the new proselytizers really didn't bring anything gratifyingly new or spiritually enlightening to the region. He writes some beautiful and wise passages here, then also makes it plentifully evident that the best of the 'amalgams' graft the new onto the old, rather than indulging in subordination of native to Christian beliefs."},{"Title":"Death and the Invisible Powers: The World of Kongo Belief","review":"The author states this book arose out of his doctoral thesis, which explains the rigorous approach to its subject matter. Anyone who has studied history or anthropology at college could easily understand the author's approach. I was very impressed with this book's presentation of Kongo community, family, education, social mores, and religion. Mr. Bokie himself qualifies as a member of a Christian church, but, as he explains in numerous examples, many if not most Kongo peoples beleive and practice Kongo traditions even if they are members of various Christian or syncretic churches. I personally prefer the scholarly over the confessional, though it should be noted the author presents numerous personal ancedotes throughout the book that help further his discussion of the subject matter. All in all I found this to be a very well written, intelligent and thoughtful book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Death and the Invisible Powers: The World of Kongo Belief","review":"A great book for those interested in Kongo culture. I could deal without the Christian bits, but that's just my personal preference."},{"Title":"Death and the Invisible Powers: The World of Kongo Belief","review":"Years after I had grown up, went through a number of ordeals that I had to overcome and researching my own book, I came across this book. Because the author wasn't writing about how to perform magical rituals and the like, I didn't read it immediately but off and on, I would thumb through the pages and then put it down. Then one day, I was inspired to read it and when I did, I was just at awe because there was a section that talked about when the people couldn't get change in their lives. They would do their best to offend God. This was powerful to me because when I was a teen, I did the same thing, which inspired me to follow the spiritual path that I am on today. Naturally, I started at the beginning and read the book, because \\"someone(s)\\" thought it was important that I read it.Like most thesis turned book, it is composed of a lot of surveys about the Kongo religious beliefs and practices as they exist today. Fortunately, his detailed explanations about the numerous beliefs and practices that continue to exist despite the influence of Christianity compensate for the dry analytical-ness of the book. Such as how the people address certain issues like AIDS from a communal perspective. Unlike in western society where the ailing are isolated and allowed to wither away. It is understandable why the author conducts this type of survey and comparison because otherwise one would not see the uniqueness of these cultural beliefs. It is through such an analysis it becomes clear that being religious and living religious are completely different. The Kongo people as seen through their old beliefs and practices were and are living according to Christian principles before they were Christianized.Anyway, there were a lot of fascinating things I discovered from reading this book. One of the most interesting beliefs I came across was how the people in this particular part of the Kongo viewed ill-intent spirits, as being reptiles. Anyone familiar with the Kamitic (Ancient Africans of Egypt) spiritual beliefs will note that the ill-intents spirits of that tradition were associated with reptiles as well-particularly certain types of snakes. I think after I read this, it became apparent to me why I was inspired to read this book in the first place. It was because I needed it for my book,MAA AANKH: Finding God the Afro-American Spiritual Way, by Honoring the Ancestors and Guardian Spirits. I highly recommend this book because although it is written from an anthropological perspective, it is rich with information on how the Kongo beliefs and practices have survived by molding new concepts like Christianity to it, and not the other way around."},{"Title":"Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to Web Development","review":"Although this book covers its subject area well, the technologies discussed are now out-moded.

MS has moved so fast into this area that most of what is discussed shows its age.Obviously, this book was written just as MS was entering the Web Development arena. -The MS toolset has come a long way since then.I feel that the book still can be helpful (especially in the area of ADO- the interfaces haven't changed that much), but I agree that some of what is discussed is rather primitive in hindsight."},{"Title":"Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to Web Development","review":"Martiner takes a no nonsense approach at explaining the real issues in internet/intranet web development.

Though he is using the same police characters from the Garda Siochana in Dublin with which he began the series (in Death of an Irish Politician), he has not yet begun to concentrate on their quirky personalities, their humor, or their often hilarious interactions. In terms of his plots, he has yet to discover the charm of using strictly Irish settings and intrigue, as he does in his later novels, concentrating instead on Nazi art thefts in France during World War II and the party bureaucrats who conveyed impressionist masterpieces to Nazi collectors.When Henry Craig, a Dublin art and antiques dealer is found shot to death near his showroom, Peter McGarr and his investigators first concentrate on his business associates, his schizophrenic French wife, who may have seen the murder, and Craig's son, with whom he has had a recent fight. Soon, however, McGarr finds that Craig's own staff has some strange connections, with direct ties to the IRA. The theft of a priceless Alfred Sisley painting brings McGarr's art conservator wife Noreen into the investigation, and the war-time activities of Craig's wife and his partner, along with the paternity of her son, come into question.The mystery is complex, with the author needing to provide a good deal of background information about the Nazi Occupation of France in order to connect the plot elements. Several additional, intricate subplots keep the reader challenged with even more characters, interactions, and complications. Violence, stories of atrocities, brute force on the part of McGarr and his staff, and the suggestion that one of the Garda higher-ups is protecting IRA members keep the plot firmly focused on the sensational. None of the humor which characterizes Gill's later novels is observable here, and Noreen is included primarily as an expert on art, rather than as a humanizing factor for McGarr.Gill has obviously done considerable research on art, conservation, and Nazi history, and he incorporates it well. Since his first novels, his plots have grown more complex, and his hand seems surer as he manages his characters and juggles details. His descriptions are beautifully drawn, and his ability to recognize and promote those elements which keep the reader interested is obvious. He is still a developing novelist here, however--a very good one whose full talents finally burst forth in the eighth book in the series, Death of a Joyce Scholar.

The book is beautiful."},{"Title":"Singing family of the Cumberlands","review":"I found myself laughing while reading this book, and crying, at times, too. Jean has a style of writing that makes the reader feel like he/she's there. The people come to life, and you find yourself living with them in the Kentucky Cumberlands. I don't think I've ever even been there, and this book made me homesick.Of course, if you're looking for crime and action, this isn't the book for you. This book is about 'down home' living when chores were really chores and food was home grown. In ways, it was a simpler kind of life, but in other ways, it was a lot harder.You won't find this information in a history book. History books always put a tint on the past, leaving out peoples' mistakes and their imperfections. This is a real family story told by a real family person. It's evident that the two most important things in the writer's life were her family and their musical life together.On a different level, I can't tell you, as an amateur genealogist, how valuable this book is to me. Every page has stories about the people who grew up in the time and place of my kin, many of them even mentioned by name. The next time I read it, I will be gleaning information for my tree!

I must be one of the lucky few who Dave Eggers did not force to read this book at gunpoint. The title of this book is \\"Nonrequired Reading\\" - by definition, you are going to find pieces which are off the beaten path.Personally, I found this book an invaluable tool to judge the state of modern writing. This is the only \\"Best American\\" collection I own, and I think it is the most valuable. Whereas this one gets criticized for being \\"too hip\\" the others strike me as being too high-brow or revisionist. This collection shows what people ACTUALLY READ.The story behind the book is that Eggers has a team of literary-minded high school students cull the best of everything they've read from the entire year. The works contained in this collection run the gamut from fiction, to journalism, to humor, to essays - it even includes a comic strip. What makes this book so indispensable for any aspiring writer is not only that it gives an idea of the current voice of writing and the new young authors who are writing it, but it also lists the publications where one can find them.Among the new authors that this book has helped me to discover is the very young J.T. Leroy. The author of Blackhawk Down provides an incisive and disturbing biography Saddam Hussein. The always dependable David Sedaris provides a very funny account of his brother Rooster's wedding.I would have felt I got my money's worth from the book if I had just read the forward by Eggers (the part we were supposed to \\"skip\\"). Eggers is one of the best, freshest voices in writing today. Even better is the introduction by Zadie Smith where she provides guidelines of \\"how to read\\", complete with a lot of useful quotes from literature."},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","review":"I bought this for a plane ride and I loved it.

A dubious prospect. But, whether it's youthful enthusiasm or the editor's \\"firm, unrelenting\\" guidance, the result is a funny, serious, edgy, clever and thoughtful mix, for all ages.There's a long, quietly chilling piece on Saddam Hussein by Mark Bowden and a buoyantly resolute piece on growing up American and Muslim during the first Gulf War by V. Kvashay-Boyle.A number of pieces turn on the traumas of childhood and dealing with family. \\"Then there's the time I went as Hitler for Halloween,\\" begins Ryan Boudinot. David Drury gets childhood cruelty and suburban conformity down pat in \\"Things We Knew When the House Caught Fire.\\" David Sedaris, funny as ever, offers up his family on his brother, Rooster's, wedding day, and Jonathan Safran Foer has a clever piece on the silences of family communication. More edgy are Douglas Light's wrenching story of abandoned sisters, J.T. Leroy's tale of an angry, ambitious, homeless boy, and Judy Budnitz' eerie, creepy story of a girl visiting her busted-up brother in the hospital.The journalism is first rate, especially George Packer's fascinating exploration of what, exactly, happens to all those donated clothes, \\"How Susie Bayer's T-Shirt Ended Up on Yusuf Mama's Back;\\" and Chuck Closterman's profile of a tribute band, \\"The Pretenders.\\"Shorter pieces - Sherman Alexie's meditative \\"What Sacagawea Means to Me,\\" as well as the Onion's humorous \\"I'll Try Anything with a Detached Air of Superiority,\\" and Amanda Holzer's brief, smart, story in song titles - round out the mix.Whether funny, grim, hip, winsome or informative, all these pieces are stimulating, gripping, thought-provoking.

She died of some mysterious illness when she was only in her twenties. Lynda Barry's entry is in the nature of a graphic short story. She covers the interesting subject of the peculiar scent of each person's house.Ryan Boudinot writes of having a costume as Hitler for a school harvest carnival. First he created trouble on the school bus. His fourth grade teacher was amused and disturbed. Another student dressed as Anne Frank. The teacher elected to have a discussion about the Second World War. The girl playing Anne Frank saw her popularity soar. Davy, the boy character of the story, decided not to be Hitler that evening. He and his father found a Frankenstein mask.Mark Bowden writes of the tyrant, Saddam Hussein. In his sixties, he cannot appear to age since his power is based on fear. He swims, he dyes his hair. His desk is immaculate. He reads voraciously which is a good thing since he is fed lies. His passion is Arabic history and military history. People have reported it is plesant to sit and talk to Saddam. As people age, the area of making choices is reduced. A tyrant has the narrowest field of all. Power shuts the tyrant off from the world. Saddam's clan was known to be violent and clever. Saddam committed his crimes publicly, cloaking them in patriotism. Things started with ego and ambition and became a political movement. The conflict in Iraq was a conflict in mentalities, between the city and the village. The backbone of politics is in the city. In the city politics is a matter of law, not blood. Saddam was a man of the village, of tribal loyalty. His favorite movies were THE GODFATHER and THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. The invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was a military miscalculation. Mark Bowden explains that cruelty is the tyrant's art.Judy Budnitz in \\"Visiting Hours,\\" describes visiting her brother Ezra in the hospital after he suffered a concussion causing short term memory loss. She tells her parents she is danger of being suspended from school because she has taken time-off to visit her brother. The family dynamics appear to be conflict-ridden and mysterious. The brother suffers a new injury to remain in the hospital.David Drury states in a piece that a suburb is a delicate thing. A family whose house burns down inherited the house from an aunt. The blended family did not really fit into the neighborhood. Family members did not tend the lawn, and Christmas decorations were taken from the yards of the other houses. The children did not have the approved kinds of bicycles and they were shunned by the other children.Tribute bands are a maligned sector of the rock and roll scene claims Chuck Klosterman in \\"The Pretenders.\\" Being derivative is not simple. Fans already exist for the tribute band. You don't have to beg your friends to come to watch you play.This selection of material by Dave Eggers and his advisory group of mostly high school students is quite good. The idea of having annual volumes for different kinds of writing is great."},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","review":"This is the second collection of the Best American Nonrequired Reading series. Like the first volume, this is a collection of a wide variety of writing, both fiction and nonfiction alike. Also, like the first volume, there are a few excellent pieces in this collection with the rest being good, but not quite as good. A couple of the standout pieces are Mark Bowden's \\"Tales of the Tyrant\\", Daniel Voll's \\"Riot Baby\\", and Ryan Boidinot's \\"The Littlest Hitler\\". The Tyrant in question in Bowden's piece is Saddam Hussein, and this is a very interesting look at the dictator. Daniel Voll's article is about a boy who was born during the L.A. Riots a decade ago. \\"The Littlest Hitler\\" is an excellent short story.Other pieces that I would highlight are: \\"Things We Knew When the House Caught Fire\\", \\"The Guide to Being a Groupie\\", \\"Love, and Other Catastrophes: A Mix Tape\\", \\"I'll Try Anything With a Detached Air of Superiority\\", \\"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post\\", and \\"Lost Boys\\". These are not the only pieces that I enjoyed, and as a whole, I would say that this collection was better than the first. There were fewer weaker pieces, and the Nonrequired Reading collection is one to look for every year."},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","review":"So you need a gift. Maybe its for your office and you actually like your cubicle mate. Or your brother. Or your girlfriend that you've known about four months. Or you deserve a present after buying all those presents! This is the book to buy. It surpasses the 2002 edition with tighter focus of journalism, poetics, free form and traditional fiction. With enjoyable writers such as Lynda Barry, David Sedaris and some humorous quips from The Onion (which is another great gift book, btw), it really does have something for everyone-from a clueless mom to your hip nerdy emo friend, this book is worth shelling out full price-and I don't even care for short stories!!!!"},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","review":"This is the second year of the Best American's newest series, The Best American Nonrequired Reading. Last year's volume was an interesting mix of work. This year is another interesting mix of work, though I will say that it is not nearly as good as last year's volume.Let's focus on the best pieces, which includes Zadie Smith's introduction (skip the weak forward by Eggers). There is also a great article by Mark Bowden (who brought us Black Hawk Down), David Drury, Aamanda Holzer (great way to tell a story, by listing songs), Chuck Klosterman, Daniel Voll, and David Sedaris, who is great as he always is. I'd skip the pieces by Sherman Alexie, Lynda Barry, Michael Buckley, Dylan Landis, Andrea Lee, Nasdijj, and John Verbos--they're pretty weak. Still, the stronger pieces do make up for the weaker ones. But I do hope Eggers is careful, or next year he'll run the risk of turning this into another mediocre Pushcart-type volume."},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","review":"They should retitle this volume: &quot;Nonrequired Reading, Where Literature Comes To Die&quot; Why anyone would want to waste their time with pretentious drivel like this is beyond me.

If their own books are any indication, this volume will be chalk-full of pompous post-modern dronings about the absurdity of contemporary existence. Eggers forward is atrocius. So you should skip that. Actually, skip the whole book.

In Curry's case, his mother had been the dominant influence with her loving guidance and support that propelled him to the boardroom of his own conglomerate. Ivory, on the other hand, was compelled to run away from her widowed mother, whose fondness for alcohol and various men made life hell for the Texas girl.Ivory did, however, display a talent for drawing and design; a scholarship to a design school provided her with her first boost up the ladder toward success. Nearing graduation, she took first place in a competition, offered by Curry's fashion enterprises. The prize was a position as junior designer.Despite sending half her salary to her mother as a form of blackmail, Ivory quickly settles in to her new job and an apartment in Queens. Volunteering one day a week at a shelter for the homeless, she befriends a young boy who is HIV-positive and his mother.The promised position at first appears to be a dead-end, as her supervisor cannot accept new talent. The company is losing money at a prodigious rate, and after a peaceful run-in with her new boss, Ivory is talked into showing him some of her designs. Drawn to each other in spite of their own personal reasons for not wanting to become involved, Curry and Ivory set about designing and producing a dazzling new collection.All should be well, but Curry's mother is diagnosed with cancer, and he loses his mainstay. Her new success splashed nationwide by the media, Ivory's mother discovers her new identity and location and promptly invites herself to New York. Once there, she cannot abandon a lifetime of selfishness and nearly destroys Ivory and Curry--and the company--in the process. Fortunately, an overheard tid-bit of conversation makes all clear, allowing Curry to reclaim Ivory, but this time as more than just his senior designer.This is a fast-paced but satisfying 'glitz' novel that demonstrates the hazards of keeping secrets."},{"Title":"All That Glitters","review":"Back cover reads:TELLING SECRETS CAN DEEPEN A LOVE.OR DESTROY IT.When Ivory Keene won a design contest that landed her a job at a prestigious fashion house in New York, no one could have guessed the secrets she hid so well. Even the company's owner, Curry Kells, drawn to Ivory by a desire neither could resist, saw only a beautiful, talented young woman whose fresh, exciting designs could make them both millions. As easily as lies can be told, he believed in her and her innocence despite the suspicions of others. Now, as fame and wealth lay within Ivory's reach, the one thing she shouldn't risk was the shared intimacies of an affair. But suddenly, all that she had been striving for her whole life-all the dreams she clung to so ferociously-seemed cold and empty without Curry's love..."},{"Title":"All That Glitters","review":"This is a book by Susan Kyle, also known as Diana Palmer. It is the story of Ivory, who grew up extremely poor with an awful mother. She gets a scholarship to a design school and then wins a design contest and gets an internship with a prestigious fashion house. The company's owner, Curry Kells, meets Ivory and takes an interest in her. Unfortunately, Ivory lies to Curry and everyone else about her past, so when her mother shows up she can do plenty of damage.To begin with you can definitely see the same style of writing and characters in this book as you do in Diana Palmer (for those of you that don't know, they are the same person). You have the young innocent female and the older world-weary man. I have to say that I liked this book more than a lot of other Diana Palmer books, however the ending made me rate this book 4 stars instead of 5. I didn't like Curry's attitude, and I thought that Ivory forgave him too quickly and easily. Also, everything was all tied up in a bow way too nicely. I personally wasn't always fond of Ivory either. She just didn't do it for me, she lied too much and I just never connected with her the way I wanted. I wanted a little more spunk or from her - she was too much of a martyr. And the town she lived in - come on people... seriously the whole town is that stupid?But still, this was a good book. There were parts I wasn't crazy about, but it was well written. I would recommend it to all Diana Palmer fans."},{"Title":"All That Glitters","review":"Good book...characters are strong. Makes it seem like its happened just a few years ago...

I liked the brevity and clarity of the reviews in the first three chapters concerning information system and networking fundamentals and an overview on Microsoft Windows Operating systems and application development tools.ANOTHER TERRIFIC FEATURE: I particularly liked the way the author used the same example from beginning to end--both in the text and for the hands-on exercises. I also appreciated that he started from scratch with the users' requirements and no pre-existing database.A VERY NICE FEATURE: I also found this book to be one of few which describe up front precisely what hardware, operating programs, and software programs you need in order to complete the exercises in the book.I find the previous reviews surprisingly different from my own reactions to this book. Like one reader, I, too, bought the book particularly because of the hands-on exercises. Although it is true that some of the hands-on exercises do not build on each other, these are obvious. The important exercises are those that pertain to the &quot;CTIS Case Study\\", and these do build on each other. And these were the ones I was particularly interested in."},{"Title":"MCSD Architectures Exam Prep (Exam: 70-100)","review":"So far, I have only read the first three chapters of the book. I will update my review if my analysis of the book changes.Basically, one of the main reasons I purchased Exam Prep instead of Exam Cram was that the book introduction stated &quot;You must work with the same number Hands-On project throughout the book, following the order of the chapters. If you chose Hands-On Project 1 you must continue doing only Hands-on Project 1 for each chapter.&quot;Now, this tells me that I am going to learn by building an application, which really sold me. Not only could I learn as I go, but I could go back and build the other projects in succession to get even more hands-on experience.Wrong. The hands-on projects are isolated to each chapter. You do not build upon projects from previous chapters. Bummer.Also, right from the very first chapter, the practice test has incorrect answers. The answer key gives the following:#2. &quot;_Data_ is refined and processed _information_ that has meaning.&quot; Clearly _information_ is refined and processed _data_.#18. &quot;The service that supplies the user interface to the application is called _business_ services.&quot; Give me a break. Clearly it is _user_ services.With these kinds of simple inaccuracies, I really have to question how much BS the text of the chapters is feeding me. The only reason I have given three stars is that, so far, the actual text appears to be a pretty good source of information. I already have the Transcender MCSD pak, so I am not concerned about the review questions or practice tests.So far, the bottom line is: Good source of information, but isolated hands-on projects, inaccurate review question answers."},{"Title":"MCSD Architectures Exam Prep (Exam: 70-100)","review":"I have used the &quot;Exam Prep&quot; and &quot;Exam Cram&quot; series to help pass 2 of the tests in the 4 test MCSD certification.

They are terse, condensed books that are usually well worth reading. They make excellent books to prepare for most Microsoft exams.In general, I love the exam cram/prep books. They present the material in a no-nonsense, mater of fact way that covers the necessary topics with a minimum of extraneous information. This book, like the others reinforces the topics with review questions at the end of the chapters.Unfortunately, the 70-100 exam isn't like any other exam. It is a test divided into several &quot;testlets&quot;. While this book will prepare you well for the background/architecture questions that appear in two of the &quot;testlets,&quot; it won't do much to prepare for the case-study-drag-and-drop testlets and scenario-based testlets.This is a great study resource, but it is inadequate for the entire exam. As a result, I would recommend this book, download the transcender demo, and get your hands on a resource that focuses on ERD (entity relationship diagrams) and database fundamentals. The architecture exam is heavily database oriented."},{"Title":"MCSD Architectures Exam Prep (Exam: 70-100)","review":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK FOR THE PRACTICE TESTS AND CD. You will be sorely disappointed. The CD-ROM fails on almost all it's promises. In my case, the practice tests didn't even work and the solutions to the hands-on projects were fragmented and disjointed.Content wise, the book is a quick, simple introduction to the models but certainly won't give you enough of a basis for the test alone.

This is the most recent to date, and definately the best of the four I've purchased so far. I just completed a canvas number on G. Putz's book, ( which is an exceptional book also), but I wish I had seen this one at the onset for it's strength as a general reference.So far I've know of three basic kayak building techniques - canvas on frame, stitched plywood, and strip kayaks. This book describes the very advanced (and perhaps most beautiful) method of making a boat of strips with re-enforcing epoxy. They are absolutely beautiful creations, though probably a little heavier than the plywood ones.This is a very highly detailed book with great photographs and computer generated diagrams. The author is a professional boat-builder who, like the magician that reveals his tricks, descibes everything - down to proper material selection, a list of current suppliers, plans (x3 + paddles), scientific details on boyancy and design, and numerous other details. This book is useful to those going off of other techniques and advices.Skill-wise I would say that you'd have to be fairly advanced, not afraid to use epoxy and fiberglass, and the owner of at least a band-saw. ( unless you buy a kit or pre-cut wood)A great resource! I'm building a strip one next!P.S. - the guy who says that these boats aren't seaworthy is full of bunk!"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"My parents bought this book for my birthday two years ago. Last week I finished building a gorgeous (with all modesty) Guillemot Kayak. Mr. Shade seemed to understand that there were many &quot;right&quot; ways to do the same thing and he allowed for different skill levels. In addition, nearly every task was described with an accurate degree of difficulty and understanding of the problems associated with each task. In fact, the only difficulty I had was when I deviated from the book's instructions to complete the hatch hold downs. If you want to paddle and have fun, go buy a &quot;plastic&quot; kayak. If you want people to exclaim, &quot;What a gorgeous boat! Where did you get it?&quot; and will derive pleasure in saying, after an appropriate pause, &quot;I built it myself&quot;, buy this book and get started. One warning. This is a BIG project and will take several hundred hours to complete (depending on your skill level), but the book can be read and followed by anyone with average woodworking skills and the end result is quite fantastic."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"This is the best book I have ever seen on the subject of strip built technique. I have read this book, several times, and created a boat based on the designs from the author. This book has ALL the information needed to make a beautiful kayak. It is my primary shop reference, with specific details on design, how to assemble the strips, how to fair the boat, how to fiberglass, how to outfit and finish the boat. The steps are described in detail, and richly illustrated with informative pictures.Thank you Nick Schade for your excellent book, your superb website and your magnificent boats. I picked this boat for all the wrong reasons. I had not paddled one, or evaluated the technical merits of it's design with respect to other boats. I didn't do a cost-benefit analysis or listen to the advice of friends. When I saw that boat, she stole my heart. Honestly, I can't imagine being happier with a boat if I had done all those other things anyway.To think that by using what I learned in your book, in thirteen short weeks I watched a bundle of sticks and a roll of blueprints metamorphose into a such a beatutiful creature, is almost incredible. She may have come out of my basement through my hands, but she's your creation too, and I thank you for helping me make it real.The single biggest disadvantage to having a boat made from this book is that it takes much longer to launch, because everyone around wants to know where you got such a lovely boat. This book will get you there, so plan ahead for the delays now.Sincerely,Ed Valley"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"I am just about finished with my double Guillemot kayak from Nick's book.

I am confident that anyone, even if you've never worked w/wood before could build a boat after reading this. The added bonus is that he includes the offsets (don't get scared) for three of his boats. At first this chapter intimidated me, however after reading it a second time (and slower) it all made sense. Lofting is like a &quot;connect the dots&quot; coloring book, only you have to use the offsets to first place the dots in the right place. Once you place the dots, simply connect them to make a form.

Because Nick's enthisiasm is infectious, and his humanity, his good humor, his attention to detail, and his love of what he does are everywhere in this book. This is the book I come back to over and over. Don't be discouraged by an earlier review from a man well-known to the online kayak-building community for his consistent disparagement and negativity.

As I built the boat from rough planks, I was glad for all my wood working experience and my many readings of the book. While I was building the Boat I read the book even more closely, and it was a great help. The stands and internal strong back plans are the key to my success... I feel this book is a bit lacking in the description and sizes of the cockpit combings and lips and then how to manipulate the fiberglass in this same area. But if I sat down and thought things through, I found a way to muddle the combing and lip done... I suggest that you read another book about kayak building written by another author to help clarify or show his approach to the challenge. I got better than satisfying results even though this was my first try at building a Kayak and only had this one book to refer to. I had never worked with fiberglass and the instructions in this book are top notch, my fiberglass is so crystal clear, nobody believes me when I tell them it's fiber glassed inside and out. As a Scout leader I've borrowed many plastic and aluminum boats to go on scout outings. So far the Guillemot has no equal in beauty, speed, handling, lightness, or in loading, making it a challenge to have a turn paddling this fine boat. I know I've spent even more time at the water's edge listening to compliments, praise, and answering the questions of the curious who are brave enough to come close and talk. I'm in the process of building a canoe. and have a collection of boat building books from many different authors and I learn from each one, but this is still my favorite reference book to get the answers.

I built the Guillemot kayak using this book, no need to purchase plans separately. Some prints may have some errors in the tables but you can find updates in Nick Schade's website[...]I entered the right numbers and was able to draw all the forms. The kayak is gorgeous. If anything, the Guillemot single tracks way too loosely for my taste. It was too difficult to stay on course without doing constact corrections, which made impossible to achieve a decent cruising speed. However, After adding a little fin keel the kayak tracks a lot better and it is still quite maneuverable. Overall very satisfied with the contents of the book. The techniques described are good to build your own boat from scratch but you can completment them by reading Ted Moore's Kayakcraft (both books complement each other). It is also very useful to look for additional information in the internet (e.g. staples construction or hand beveling wood strips).

I highly recommend this book if you want to build a canoe or kayak."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Well structured and written with lots of information to give you the kick start needed to begin making my strip built kayak."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"This is really an excellent book. I'm an engineer, and college professor, and publications like this are collector's items! I admire the completeness, and the very digestable writing style. Graphics are very clear and explicative. Only suggestion: the glossary should include a list of the tools and other technical terms."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"As a sea kayaking enthusiast and occasional builder of stitch and glue kayaks (7 and counting)I found Mr. Schade's book to have more than enough information clearly presented to get a person started and finished in strip building a kayak. I found specific recomendations for different lay-ups of fiberglass to be particularly helpful in my boatbuilding. For a boat building nut, The Strip Built Sea Kayak is at the top of the coffee table pile and in the shop."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Si est&aacute;s pensando en construir un kayak de madera, este libro es el mejor. Compr&eacute; cuatro libros sobre &eacute;ste mismo tema y la verdad que con el que escribi&oacute; Nick basta y sobra. Adem&aacute;s, la construcci&oacute;n del bote se divide en pasos realmente f&aacute;ciles de seguir. Es un proyecto que te va a dar un mont&oacute;n de satisfacciones."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"I just got Nick's book last night. I only had time to skim it, but here's my first impression.If you're looking for a book with step by step instruction from start to finish, buy Nick's book. I think anyone with reasonable shop skills could successfully complete a kayak with this book to guide him.If you want a good discussion on design philosophies, and an overview of what goes into designing a kayak, without detailed mathmatical analysis, then this is for you. Nick doesn't try to be artificially eloquent and use excessive jargon to appear intelligent, and thereby make his book difficult to understand. Instead, he uses common words with enough terminology to understand the information being given.There are good quality illustrations throughout the book which make the building techniques described easier to understand.If you're looking for a hardbound coffee table book full of beautiful color pictures, you might be disappointed.Pictures are, in most cases, the best way to communicate. The effectivity ranking of pictures is, in my opinion, as follows:1. Color illustrations. 2. B/W illustrations, drawings, and sketches. 3. Color photos. 4. B/W photos.The only thing I would like to see changed in Nick's book, after a brief perusal, is more color. But, I realize that this would add to the cost of the book.The book is priced quite well, and it is a very good value. I feel I definitely got my money's worth.When a hardbound coffee table version full of color illustrations and photos of beautiful boats in beautiful surroundings becomes available, I'll probably want to order an autographed copy."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Nick Shade is an artist, not a woodworker. He doesn't fret over minute details, or force you to make things perfect. But his designs are positively gorgeous. Since his book is a recent print, he covers many aspects of construction the older books do not cover, and many of the ideas are his own and are used professionally on the curent market. He does not cover everything, and if you want to find out the most recent developments as far as boatbuilding, you have to subscribe to the blogs online. (such as on Ted Moores' site). He is not as clear as Ted Moores in KayakCraft, but sometimes has more ideas. I suggest to buy both and visit all the websites."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Nick has really outdone himself. Reading Nick's book got me motivated to the point I have a kayak springing to life in my basement as I write this.At any moment if I get confused on what to do next, I thumb through the book and usually find detailed instructions. When that fails, Nick is always available to answer questions on his Bulletin board. His web site is very informative with lots of color pictures.&quot;Two Thumbs Up!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"If you enjoy woodworking and want to build a beautiful, lightweight, high-performance sea-kayak for a fraction of what it would cost to purchase a similar boat, this is the reference for you. The book is well written and illustrated and provides enough detail to complete a project from start to finish. An excellent reference (5*)."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"I purchased the book nearly a year ago, and I've reread it almost 4 times. It's an excellent resource for any wood kayak builder (or potential builder!).The book has a great primer on design and helps the reader understand why a boat's hull is shaped the way it is. Nick explains just enough so that you could design your own boat.There is a great section on what tools are necessary, which ones are nice, and why.Building instructions are excellent, and the chapter on getting artistic really gets two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"There's a lot of information packed into a relatively short book. But the best part about it is you'll come away with the skills to build any strip-built boat, not just a kayak. The section on lofting is the best part of the book as it is one of the few (and in owning perhaps a dozen books on boatbuilding, the only book) that goes into any great detail on how to translate the offset tables into meaningful plans. The only gap is how to translate the graphs created when input into Excel's x-y scatter plot into real sheets of paper that can be used as templates for the forms. I guess when I make my run to Staples, I'll figure it out. The rest of the book draws upon the author's vast experience building boats. Many other strip-built boats provide similar information but not with this clarity.The point is once you learn how to turn offset tables into plans, you are really and truly on the way to building the boat of your dreams. It took me about a half hour of careful typing and following along in the text to finally \\"get it\\". If I can understand it, anyone can. Really. If you read between the lines, though, that means the three plans in the book are not the ones I'd want to build. The tandem is too large and the Guillemot too complicated. That leaves the Auk which won't do me well for the lakes and fishing I want to do. As another poster said, use this book to give you the foundation to build a different kayak, supplemented with Youtube videos (there are a LOT).Four stars instead of five for the 'second tier' kayak plans included in the book and the lack of clear directions on how to print. Other than that, I feel like I'm ready to start planing!"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Again before I began I had to convert all the measurements of one the three kayaks, to millimetres and made the forms ready to put on the strong back. I found the terminology in the book a bit difficult to follow at first, given that I'm not yet into the boat building scene, but having read through the book a couple of times I think I'll be able to use it as a good reference as I build my first kayak."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"The author truly covers everything you will need to know to build your first kayak. I will reccomend that if you have no previous knowledge of tablesaws or wood working that you should practce cutting with some cheaper wood before you go straight for the cedar- have fun!"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"this is a great book with 3 kayaks tou can build your self. i am building my fourth s&g kayak and dreaming of a strip kayak very soon i will take that leap. with Nick's book i feel in good hands"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"With all the rave reviews already stated, I add my own.Mr. Schade will break your heart in the very introduction of the book; at this moment you will come to understand the true dedication of this author to his craft (and love for his wife). Then there is a descent into the inner secrets of this craft that he loves. As an accomplished gymnast, he will certainly make this kayak-building appear easy, almost too easy, and yet the details are in place to convince you that, yes, you can do it yourself.You have to pinch yourself to bring yourself back to the reality that you will spend many hours building this kayak, that it will cost you quite a bit, and that the process is not as easy as it looks. Then stop pinching yourself and start planning; the reality is that you can do it!There are a few gaps in the details that I had to think my way through, but none of these gaps are intentional. In fact, these opportunities are more exciting than aggravating.This is not the only good resource available for learning the strip-building technique. I am already modifying Mr. Schade's designs to include elements provided elsewhere, as he would even encourage himself. On the other hand, this book is all you need to make a great kayak, and the information in this book is superior to anything that I have seen elsewhere.I would recommend this book even to those who never plan on building a kayak if for no other reason than to appreciate this fine art of shipbuilding."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"This book is very good I must have read it 3-4 times the first month I had it and picked up tips each time. It is well written, easy to understand, as I have never built a boat before, still havn't but hope to this winter. Excellent intro to a project like this."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"If you are interested in building a strip built boat, either a sea kayak or a canoe, this book needs to be in your library. Nick Schade wrote a start-to-finish guide, from theory to practical application, about building these fine craft. He is an engineer by training, but he manages to write the book in an easy to follow, let me go clean my garage and get started style. The techniques he discusses are applicable to all light boats of this type, and can be applied to virtually any design. The only thing that might be a little intimidating is the drafting plots for the three designs... after all, he sells the plans for these boats as well.This book is also a detailed study in marine art... these boats are beautiful!-Chris Perkins, Canoe Builder"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"The book is very detailed and informative covers subject matter fully. Better than other do it yourself books on the art of building a boat using the strip method of building. Couldn't put it down once I started reading."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"If anything, I tend to overdo the book research before starting anything new. When I started my cedar strip canoe, I had already purchased and read three books on the subject, and they were all very good. Nick's book came out after my boat was done, and as I read it. I kept thinking 'I wish I had seen that six months ago'.I recommend the book to anyone considering cedar strip construction of either a canoe or kayak."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"I have been building kayaks for years and I still learned a lot from this book. Well thought out, logically laid out, nicely augmented with graphics and photos, Nick's book will become THE reference for woodstrip boat building. You won't want to build a strip kayak without this book (and don't believe anyone who says different)!"},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"Readers will not only know how to construct a variety of kayaks but will understand why they are built they way they are. Specifically, you will understand how relative thickness of wood to fiberglas contributes to strength of the epoxy encapsulated composite. The result of this form-follows-function engineering is also esthetically stunning, as the wood strips are what you will see beneath this incredibly tough and TRANSPARENT epoxy and glass. Mr. Schade also explains how you can lengthen or shorten a given design to match your own physique, so in reality, you get more than three designs...if you have the kayak bug this book is indispensible."},{"Title":"The Strip-Built Sea Kayak: Three Rugged, Beautiful Boats You Can Build","review":"This is a very useful book in terms of getting a handle on wood strip kayak construction. It is well written, concise and clear. It suffers from some unfortunate americanisms (eg material suppliers, wood types, etc). There are also some areas like staple-less construction that are not covered deeply enough - but overall a fine addition to the books in this space.Richard RawlingAUSTRALIA"},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"Mr. Landels brings together two of the world's oldest academic endeavors, history and engineering. This is short volume is a quick read yet serves as a valuable reference tool. Landels provides a wonderful historic background for each piece of technology discussed in the book. The breadth of actual technolgy is not as great as one would want (unfortunately limited to ships, lifting devises, some seige engines and water procurement machines... yet to the author's credit the actual knowledge on complex technology of the ancient world is limited) but the technology that is covered is both well explained with many diagrams and placed into a historic perspective. To this reader, the last chapter serves as an invaluable reference for the simple fact the author provides short biographies of four ancient writers; Hero, Pliny the Elder, Frontinus and Virtuvius which leaves one starving for more knowlegde of aforementioned subjects. If you have any interest in the classics, history of the ancient world or the development of technology,.... please add this to your library."},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"A very enlightening volume, although it occasionally left me behind and parts will have to be reread when I have looked up some mechanical engineering concepts- but this did not happen often enough to interrupt my enjoyment. A particularly fascinating section briefly discusses why the Greeks didn't quite get to concept of a the steam engine.Very worthwhile and, sadly, all too brief."},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"This is a very amazing which treats a rare subject. There is a lot of books about ancient times, but very few about the science put into practise in the times. This book brings very sophisticated look into the problems and successes of ancient engineers. Their solutions are somewhat ingenious, but there are also problems which could not be solved without the necessary equipment. J.G.Landers has done a great job looking into all that scarce sources related to engineering in the ancient times.Dont hesitate and buy this book.Michal Ruzek, Czech Republic"},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"This book is a must read for anyone from USAID/Military/DOS deploying downrange to Afghanistan, Iraq (soon to be moot) and East Africa. This should be part of the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) standard operating procedure. Should be mandatory reading at the Civil Affairs course, Ft Leavenworth, War Colleges, and JFSC. If you can think of a challenge that faces development in what used to be called the third world; if you can imagine a development problem you might face when confronting \\"The Pentagon's New Map\\"....This book is likely to either provide the answer or point you in the right way of thinking. From moving water to harnessing mechanical energy, this will open your horizons to an alternative way of thinking about development, scalability, and sustainment of projects. My copy is beat to shreds and I am about to order #2. My only wish is that it came in something I could fit in a cargo pocket and the only downside is that the author has not written more on the topic!If you are in the development industry you need to own this book.GM"},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"This book brings to light the knowledge ancient engineers possessed. This book does get a bit technical, however I believe most people should be able to follow the basic mechanics discussed at least well enough to get the gist of the discussion. I think this is a great book to review engineering mechanics for those trained under a more modern school.To provide some perspective I am a Civil Engineer, and I had to think back to my basic classes to completely comprehend some of the sections of this book. However not quite understanding most of those sections is not going prevent you from following the basic concept of this book."},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"I'm delighted that Amazon lets us read freely the very first paragraph of the book, which sets a sobering context for all that follows. The gist of it should be memorized by everyone who gets a high school diploma: The energy in just one gallon of gasoline (which we take for granted and think little of burning) is equivalent to the hard labor of ninety men for an hour.Only in the past century or two has anyone other than a ruler, high-ranking military officer, or unusually successful businessman enjoyed such power at his beck and call. Our sources for it are all too finite and will not last forever, as we are only beginning to realize. A reader who keeps this in mind will be amazed at what the ancients were able to achieve with the limited energy resources at their disposal: manual labor, beasts of burden, wind, and water-- as the author goes on to describe. By and large they were, after all, just as intelligent as we are. They knew a few tricks that we would do well not to forget. Before long the human race may need them again."},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"I ordered this book because I needed to understand the beginnings of technology better in order to understand its progress. I expected either a childish book or one of the typical books with many dates and misconceptions about technology that tend to be prevalent in books written by history professors. Professor Landels, however, has done a great job with the subject. Despite being a history professor, he shows a great understanding of the intricacies of engineering and has built some of the devices himself. In building the devices, he has gained great insight into the problems and solutions that ancient engineers faced, and it is this insight that I find particularly interesting. There are no equations, per se, but he does explain some of the physics involved. Additionally, there are a number of illustrations that make the book easy to read. Rather than many dates, he talks about the period in general. Rather than when, the main focus of the book is how. Analyses of text from Vitruvius show that Professor Landels is a very intelligent man. The book rarely gets tedious, though, with a new problem and solution being posed every few pages. Of the several books I have read of this nature (history of technology...see other reviews), this is one of the best."},{"Title":"Engineering in the Ancient World","review":"Roman conquered the known ancient world as much with a shovel as with a sword. Everywhere the Romans went they brought the engineering techniques with them. EG: They knew to seperate sewage from drinking water. Fresh drinking palatable water was generally avaiable within a couple of blocks of every citizen of one of their cities. Sewage was carried away and dumped outside the city and away from sources of drinking/bathing water. This book details Roman engineering in an easely understood fashion. Cerainly not a waste of time and money if interested in these subjects: Engineering, Life during Roman times."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"If you want bang for your buck, pick up Rachael's 365 book instead of this one. The recipes here are mostly found in that book as well. These recipes really aren't all that innovative, as far as kids recipes go (you already know how to cook hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches, right?), and the Rachael Ray 365 book has lots more information about altering recipes to suit your needs and other really helpful hints."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"This title and three others like it by Rachael Ray in the 'Top 30 30 minute meals' series are, for the content, relatively expensive and inconveniently sized volumes of recipes reprinted from Rachael's previous books. Looking through two of the titles I recognize every recipe I see from earlier books. While Rachael is the nominal author of these books, I fully believe they were assembled by her publisher and a copy editor with maybe a day's input from Miss Rachael for all four books together.This is becoming a common practice among major cookbook authors, with Mark Bittman's re-releasing his 'How to Cook Everything' in three volumes, cumulatively more expensive than the original book.One may for a moment equate these books with the music world's 'Best of' releases, but the experience is simply not the same. A 'Best of' album's tracks are based on a genuine audience vote with their purchases and air play. These recipes are simply Rachael's opinion and that of a few of her colleagues. The parallel also breaks down in the sense that listening to, for example, 'The Who's top twelve hits introduces you to a whole new experience of listening to 'My Generation', 'I'm Free', and 'I Can See for Miles' on the same album.My 3 star rating is not based on the quality of the recipes. It is a warning that these volumes are, in fact, reprints and not new recipes. So, if you already own many or most of Rachael's books already, you may be disappointed if you buy these books.One other consideration if you do NOT own any of Rachael's books is that for not too much more money, you can get 10 times as many recipes in her 'No Repeats' book of almost all new recipes.In every way, this is a better purchase than one or all of these minibook samplers. With this kids book, you would also do much better in getting the similarly priced but larger 'Cooking Rocks' book."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"I got this book a week ago and tried two of the recipes (tomato/basil soup and the 4 cheese grilled sandwich) they were great! So far the book has lived up to it's name. My daughter is 15 months and LOVED the soup and sandwich. This was the first soup that she would eat without spitting some of it out. She kept wanting more and ate 1/2 a sandwich as well. I can't wait to try the other recipes."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"It is true that most of these recipes can be found in Rachaels 365( highly recommend ) but the true charm of this book is that it's kid friendly. Some reviewers say who needs to know how to cook hot-dogs and cheese sandwiches? They are missing the point of this book, it's meant for the young-ones and my children(ages 8-11) love the simple recipes and really enjoy preparing their own meals. For the children I would rate it a 5, but for the adults looking for something new from Rachael they should look elsewhere. So my rating is a 3 taking these factors into consideration. Thanks..."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"I can't believe this is supposed to be a book dedicated to kid food!? It's dedicated to all those picky eaters out there.... hmmm. This book contains mostly recipes that will not fly on my 3-1/2 year old's plate, and the rest are repeated recipes from her other books. I'm glad I just took this out from the library. I think these recipes would work well with 8 year olds on up, but that's just my opinion. As always, check your library first before wasting your money."},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"Getting kids to eat food other than peanut butter & jelly, and chicken nuggets is a struggle for many parents. In this cookbook of kid food, Rachael Ray has tried to enliven children's' repertoire of foods to include eggplant, succotash, and lots of yummy green plants. As other reviewers have noted, however, be aware that this cookbook is a compilation of some of Rachael's previous recipes from other cookbooks. If you are a collector of her recipes, be sure to peruse this book prior to its purchase.Some of my kid's favorites include: Homemade Chicken & Stars Soup, Broccoli & Bow Ties, Sesame Noodles, Cashew Chicken, and Supreme Pizza Pasta Salad. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"How many Rachael Ray cookbooks do you own? That's an important question when considering this book because you may already have some of these recipes in other cookbooks (such as Rachael Ray: 365) by this delightfully speedy provider of zesty dishes.Here's another question: How much \\"fixing up\\" will your kids tolerate? My four were always on the conservative side. Here's an example. Our oldest would go into a restaurant and order a grilled cheese sandwich as follows (and this was before he ever saw Jack Nicholson's famous scene in Five Easy Pieces): \\"Here's how to prepare my grilled cheese sandwich. Put American cheese slices on plain white bread. Do not toast or grill the bread. Do not add tomatoes, ham, or anything else. Put a small container of mayonnaise on the side, but not touching the bread.\\"Almost all of these dishes are too adventuresome for what our kids would have tolerated with a few exceptions: cheesy popcorn, chicken cutlets, chicken and stars soup, chicken and dumplings, stuffed potatoes, and fettuccini all'Alfredo. So if your kids groove on Kraft macaroni and cheese and see vegetables as evil, they may not be ready for these dishes,However, if you enjoy kid favorites . . . and would like a more adult version, you'll be pleased very much by this book and its recipes. The ingredients are well chosen, and the herb and spice selections are inspired. Consider the quesadilla recipe. Most people put in some American cheese, diced chicken, and perhaps some cut up tomato bits. Ms. Ray adds a little finely chopped onion, a palmful of chopped cilantro leaves, a Serrano pepper, coarse salt, a half pound of chorizo (smoked sausage from Spain or Mexico), a touch of barbecue sauce and a blend of Mexican cheeses. As you can see, that's a novel and interesting dish. Not all the dishes are upgraded as much, but there's always at least a little element of sophistication added in time-efficient ways.Be aware that this book has only 30 recipes in it (along with some side dishes). But it's quite compact. You could easily fit it into a purse or pocket to take along to cook at an event where you've been asked to prepare food away from home . . . or when you are on your summer vacation if you prepare meals sometimes.One of the beauties of this little gem can be found in the close-up photographs of the dishes. With these visual images to stimulate you, the food presentation will undoubtedly be improved. It just made my mouth water to look at these luscious images.Dig in!"},{"Title":"Kid Food: Rachael Ray's Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"At first glance, I laughed. All of the recipes list several ingredients, and many have a bunch of things that I didn't think my 3-year old would really be interested in...but I was SO wrong! First, and most importantly -- the food is awesome! Second, it really does take 30 minutes or less for her meal plans. (I timed it!) And third, my 3-year old has eaten everything (even though some of them I leave out certain things) that I have made from the book.

It describes a security assessment process end-to-end, covering all aspects of it: reasons for the assessment, risk assessment methodologies, scoping of an assessment project and its goals, how to conduct the assessment, what to put into the final report, and what is involved in the post-assessment activities. The book also gives an overview of contemporary government standards and security evaluation tools, and even offers security assessment forms and a sample report. This book is *NOT* a detailed description of the intrinsic and technology behind the attacks or ways of warding them off, even though the authors do a superb job of explaining most major concepts and terms.While anything that ends with the word \\"process\\" promises the excitement of watching paint dry, I've found this book quite informative and written very well. For me, it is more important to understand than remember; every statement in a book is logically solid and supported by a reason or explanation. With respect to this, the authors have not disappointed me.I disagree with negative comments mentioned in the F. Yan's review below. For example, indeed, on page 111 the authors stated that the greatest threat to an organization and its IT infrastructure are employees, contractors, and third-party users; on the same page they named insecure computing habits of the *employees* as the 2nd threat, and on page 112 they listed *disgruntled* employees as the 3rd greatest threat. I don't see any contradiction, since disgruntled employees are a subset of the total population of employees. Similarly, I could not find validation to other negative comments.Nevertheless, the book has a couple of rather small shortcomings. One is a bit dry style of some chapters consisting primarily of bullet point lists, although the points themselves are sharp, concrete, and important. I also wish that the book's cover were made from a more practical and durable material.Overall, this is an excellent and useful book, that delivers on its promises."},{"Title":"Inside Network Security Assessment: Guarding Your IT Infrastructure","review":"In my experience what's important is to have an overall structure when performing any task. That's one of the things I liked about this book as it didn't get bogged down with an endless review of a million tools. The book offers a look at the bigger picture providing information on the overall structure and flow of the assessment. While it is evident that it was written by two writers, those individuals planning on performing an assessment or involved with one should find this book useful. I believe this book would also be helpful to people new to the security assessment area. When reading a book my objective is to learn something I did not know before or to add to my skill set. This book met that mark for me."},{"Title":"Inside Network Security Assessment: Guarding Your IT Infrastructure","review":"After reading a few chapters of the book, I find this book was not thoroughly edited or reviewed before being published. It is not well structured while it is inconsistent and even self-contradictory.Take chapter 6 as an example. In terms of bad structure, the overview presented four characteristics about attackers, but in the chapter only two have big headings.Also, when the four kinds of attacks are discussed, it starts off with a paragraph of short description for each. Then it goes to further not-so-detailed (or even repeated) explanation for each attack. Why can the short description and the not-so-detailed explanation for each attack NOT be combined?On inconsistency: while there is a tip for a few security countermeasures after discussing coordinated attacks, there are none for the other three kinds of attack.On self-contradiction: the authors say the greatest threat is internal/disgruntled employees. Then on the following page it mentions disgruntled employees again in a different heading but as the \\"third\\" greatest threat.I am sure the authors are very technically knowledgeable in security as the book provides a lot of security-related materials. However, they need to polish their writing skills so that the next book they write will not be as chaotic as this one."},{"Title":"The Necklace and Other Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"De Maupassant, Saki (H.H.

The authors may have lived in an earlier time, but their character studies, humor or insights remain true to today. De Maupaussant's stories are often brief, well crafted and absorbing.

I originally bought Kafka's &quot;The Metamorphasis and other Stories&quot; and was delighted by the selction of a few fine representative works by that author. Again, for a shockingly low price, I decided to revisit a story I read many years ago and bought this volume. &quot;The Necklace&quot; is a great tale of irony in which the old adage &quot;no good deed goes unpunished&quot; is illustrated. It is a tale of honorably living up to one's resposibilities and it ends with quite a twist. This was a great read when I was very young and it still is well into my middle age.

After Maupassant&#8217;s parents divorced, his mother became friends with Gustave Flaubert of the &#8220;Madame Bovary&#8221; fame. Flaubert committed himself to tutoring the young aristocrat &#8211; hence the &#8220;de&#8221; in his surname &#8211; and said of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, &#8220;I love him like a son.&#8221; What an apprenticeship?An artist owes much to his or her environment hence the background just volunteered reveals decisive influences that informed Guy&#8217;s craft. In turn, Maupassant&#8217;s work would influence those of Chekhov, Joyce, James, Babel and Hemingway! Chekhov&#8217;s oeuvre then influenced Katherine Mansfield and so on - an impressive literary family tree indeed!Maupassant, who studied law, was a master of irony and the title story exemplifies that. &#8220;The Necklace&#8221; and &#8220;A Piece of String&#8221; (otherwise translated from French as &#8220;The String&#8221;) are much anthologized. Of the more than 360 short stories he wrote, the nine stories in this collection are well plotted and, like most of his followers, the author avoids imposing any moral judgments on his characters &#8211; not even on the prostitute in his sensational first story, &#8220;Ball-of-Fat&#8221; (&#8220;Boule de Suif&#8221;). ...- enjoy the dreams!"},{"Title":"The Necklace and Other Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Guy de Maupassant was a master of short stories and he is best read in the original French language as the translation is not at its best. However - even so, I really enjoyed re-reading them especially 'Ball of Fat' 'A Piece of String' and 'The Necklace'. He has a great power of observation of human frailties and there is that 'twist in the tail' which rather reminds me of Roald Dahl's 'Tales of Unexpected'."},{"Title":"The Necklace and Other Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I bought this book because I needed it for my college English class, but when I went to use it I noticed thatIt was missing a couple of short stories.

They are well-written and were ground-breaking 150 years ago, but they do not age well.

This book answers some hard questions at last.The whole concept of a Sovereign God, who is not in the least challenged by Satan, but rather is over everything including Satan, changes your whole perspective. It makes the scriptures finally make sense. God is in control. Satan is not in control except when God allows it. It's about that simple.Everything that is good, or just appears to be good, and everything that is bad, or just appears to be bad comes from the true and living Father. Once you grasp that reality, you suddenly discover that you are empowered through God because you are not just someone mindlessly asking for God's will in your life, you actually are being God's will. You are then a vessel of honor instead of a vessel of dishonor.This book is destined to be controversial and kick up some outrage among die-hard religionists, and it won't make any difference at all in the theology of those who prefer to worship church and organized religion instead of believing in and worshipping a God who cannot be defined by man-made religion.For those who have the ears to hear and the eyes to see, this book is one that has been long overdue. Refreshing and challenging, often disturbing and sometimes scary, it makes perfect sense. Written in plain English, but it leaves the reader standing at a cross roads. Take the new road or continue on the old?The author has taken the new road and his personal experiences (towards the end of the book) are enlightening. If I had one complaint, it would be that I would have liked to see more of the personal experiences early in the book."},{"Title":"Sovereign God for Us and Through Us: A Faith Building Revelation of God's Power and Purpose to Use Everything to Mature and Empower Us for His Use","review":"SOVEREIGN GOD, FOR US AND THROUGH US: As a lover of truth, I write this: This is a wonderful help!

Various sets of them were collected and published in book form both during his life and after his death. Trying to determine what works are in what collections is difficult - most works appear in more than one collection, some works appear under more than one title, and some collections appear under more than one title.To aid readers, in this review I've listed the works in this collection, with notes indicating other collections they have appeared in. Where a work has appeared under more than one title, I give both titles separated by a slash.Table of Contents:&quot;The Efficacy of Prayer&quot; (1), (2)&quot;On Obstinacy in Belief&quot; (2), (3), (4)&quot;Lilies that Fester&quot; (2), (3), (5)&quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; (2), (4), (6)&quot;Good Work and Good Works&quot; (2), (4)&quot;Religion and Rocketry&quot; / &quot;Will We Lose God in Outer Space&quot; (1), (2)&quot;The World's Last Night&quot; / &quot;Christian Hope - Its Meaning for Today&quot; (1), (2)Notes:(1) also published in &quot;Fern-Seed and Elephants and Other Essays&quot;(2) also published in &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;(3) also published in &quot;They Asked for a Paper&quot;(4) also published in &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast and Other Pieces&quot;(5) also published in &quot;Christian Reunion and Other Essays&quot;(6) also published in &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; / &quot;The Screwtape Letters and Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;Recommendations:If you are interested in Lewis's shorter works, my best advice is to get &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US. That collection consists of about 130 short works by Lewis. The works in that collection are mostly, but not exclusively, Christian.If your interest in Lewis's shorter works is restricted to those on Christianity, and your budget or enthusiasm does not run to &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, then my second-best advice is to get any or all of the following (they don't overlap significantly, and between them they include most of Lewis's shorter Christian writings):&quot;God in the Dock - Essays on Theology and Ethics&quot;*&quot;The World's Last Night and Other Essays&quot;&quot;Christian Reflections&quot;&quot;The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses&quot;* Be careful - there is a UK Fontana paperback lurking about called &quot;God in the Dock - Essays on Theology&quot; that is substantially shorter than the &quot;God in the Dock - Essays on Theology and Ethics&quot; collection. A full version of &quot;God in the Dock - Essays on Theology and Ethics&quot; was published in the UK under the title &quot;Undeceptions - Essays on Theology and Ethics&quot;."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"This book is a collection of various essays that C.S. Lewis authored and published a few years before his death. The titles are &quot;The Efficacy of Prayer&quot; (that discusses what practical, if any, effect our prayers have), &quot;On Obstinacy in Belief&quot; (exploring the reasons why people cling to a particular world view), &quot;Lilies that Fester&quot;(&quot;Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,&quot; a talk about those whose concern is with a superficial desire to &quot;be cultured&quot; versus those who really care about the things that comprise culture), &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; (a short sequel to his book The Screwtape Letters), &quot;Good Work and Good Works&quot; (describing the difference between quality workmanship and Christian charity), &quot;Religion and Rocketry&quot; (discussing the truth of religion in a world where advancing technology allows humans to visit other worlds), and &quot;The World's Last Night&quot;(about the second coming of Christ). The essays are full of the usual vintage Lewis: shrewd, humorous, wise, and clear. In brief, they make for a fine reading time."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"The World's Last Night is an education smushed into a neat, tiny, little package. Whenever I read Lewis, I am struck by his intense clarity of thought. This book is no different. Lewis is at his brightest and most lucid in these pages.A variety of topics-from the effectiveness of prayer, to the end of the world-are covered in the pages of The World's Last Night. Each essay (and the story) is brilliant in its own way.Lewis is one of my favorite writers. I have come to believe that I like him so much not because of his clarity or depth of thought-which are good reasons for liking him-or even because we share a distaste for modernism and all that it has done to cloud modern thought, but I believe what I appreciate most about Lewis is his sense of humor. Lewis' humor is on display in every one of these very diverse pieces. Even when I disagree with Lewis, his humor humanizes him, and I cannot hold anything against him. Contemporary authors could take a lesson from this.Buy this book. It is worth reading and rereading. If nothing else, the humor will lift your spirits."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"The World's Last Night is by no means the most comprehensive collection of Lewis' essays available and each has been published elsewhere. Nonetheless, this collection might best be described as a wonderful sampler. That is, within this compilation Lewis touches on a variety of subjects ranging from the, perhaps, more commonly contemplated questions with regard to The Efficacy of Prayer to those questions which arise due to the possibility of life on other planets as they perceivably pertain to Christianity. This collection also includes Lewis' effort to portray the battle between good and evil from the perspective of his famous character Screwtape in Screwtape Proposes a Toast. It is rounded out by essays that challenge the reader to consider the affect of government and society on Christian life at any given time. So while The World's Last Night might not be the best or most comprehensive collection of Lewis' work, it can be viewed as a comparatively cheap alternative to receive just enough variety to really whet one's appetite for a full portion of C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"Excellent series of articles by CS Lewis with his usual incisive views of Christianity. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"If you want a brief introduction to Clive Staples Lewis's thoughts on several different subjects before you attempt his array of books, then this is a good book to start. In seven essays he covers a gamut of topics-prayer, belief, culture, evil, evolution, works, life on other planets, and the Second Coming of Christ.Being a devout Anglican, after being a devout atheist, Professor Lewis combines his teaching skills, medieval literary background and writing skills to convey a lot of theology about the nature of things in these essays. Of course, you will not agree with everything this gentleman wrote, but it should cause you to reflect upon what you believe.Professor Lewis wrote and spoke on a number of subjects. It is very true that he was a Christian Apologist, but he was a professor of English holding the prestigious Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge.He was best friends with J. R. R. Tolkien of the Lord of the Rings fame. It is a certainty that these two literary masters would sit around tossing out ideas and stories which became the foundation of their lasting popularity, even though, Tolkien did not care for the Chronicles of Narnia.Here are three quotations from these essays:\\"I have wondered before now whether the vast astronomical distances may not be God's quarantine precautions. They prevent the spiritual infection of a fallen species from spreading.\\"\\"The doctrine of the Second Coming teaches us that we do not and cannot know when the world drama will end.\\"\\"What modern Christianity find it harder to remember is that the whole of humanity in this world is also precarious, temporary, provisional.\\""},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"\\"The World's Last Night: And Other Essays contains a number of C.S. Lewis's short essays and a Screwtape addition (I could be mistaken but I believe his wife did that one). The essay \\"Lillies that Fester\\" was interesting as it mocked the ideal of looking cultured and the Screwtape addition was pretty good (I considerably enjoyed and recommend the original book \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" as well). The most interesting essay was probably \\"Religion and Rocketry dealing with what might happen if life was discovered in the cosmos. The essay \\"The World's Last Night\\" deals with the Second Coming and was a good read itself.

Lewis....thank you trying to collect all I can of this author and it arrived just as promised thank you"},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"If you want to be challenged and entertained all at once, you can never do better than read C. S. Lewis. His fiction contains great theological truths, and his essays are not purely informative.The writing of C. S. Lewis is more like poetry. It sings. It glides. It pulls you in, and moves you on. It makes you laugh in surprise. It makes you think. And once you have read a book or essay by Lewis, you never view the world the same way again.The essays in this book are a good companion to God in the Dock: Essays on Theology and Ethics.His essay on \\"The Efficacy of Prayer\\" is one of the best explanations of prayer I have read. There are same great quotes about religion in \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" and I believe that the ideas in \\"Religion and Rocketry\\" form the background for Lewis's Narnia series and the Space Trilogy.If you like C. S. Lewis, you will like this book."},{"Title":"THE WORLD'S LAST NIGHT and Other Essays","review":"I picked this book up a few years ago before I knew much about God and belief. This was a few years before I got into apologetics, theology, and philosophy. However, I 'rediscovered' it in a box of books out in my garage last week and started flipping through it. To be quite honest, I don't remember a single thing I'd read in this book a few years back but I did see my underlinings, notes, and water wear to show that I indeed had gone through it.I started with the essay 'The Efficacy of Prayer' and I can only say, \\"Wow!\\" It really helps put some things in perspective that I have a hard time explaining to people. Indeed prayer is not a 'magic' but a 'request'.If you can handle Lewis' prose and style of writing - which isn't hard to do for most - you will love this book. He comes at the topics in honesty and examines them quite well. To some extent I believe the essay 'The Obstinacy of Belief' is a little dated, but only for people who understand the overwhelming evidence for Christianity.Highly recommend. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"Wait untill 5th edition comes out or try Linux Secrets by Barkakati.I am going to throw this book away and replace it with somthing else,it is not worth the space it wastes on the shelf!"},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"At first glance this book looks like it is going to be really helpful, but on buying and reading it, I was severely dissapointed.

It came with 2 versions of Linux (RH 5.1) and 5.2 is out already, as is a memory fix for 5.2 -- but such is Linux. The book seems to be pretty complete, often with actual text from .conf files and such. It covers topically most areas of Linux, and also has redundant sections which are briefs of commands and such --which I am grateful for! Looks like I lucked up and bought the right manual for a change.

The book is a classic which takes you through all the set up steps... and with latest versions of ALL the major distrobutions you cant really go wrong.

However, individual chapters are very poorly organised. For instance, text switches from one topic to another, then back to the original one, almost as if points were noted down in the sequence the author thought of them. Typographical and syntactical errors are rife, making it impossible to rely on the information imparted.Quite obviously, the book has not been proof-read. It is unfortuate really, because it could so easily have been a useful piece of work."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"This is a VERY good book, it covers all versions of linux, but it mainly focuses on Red Hat Linux and OpenLinux, although I was suprised that it didn't come with Slackware linux as it was in the previous edition. You could tell that it wasn't edited extremely well, as it still contains sections which mention the &quot;Slackware&quot; CD that comes with it. I wasn't too disappionted about that there wasn't any mention of 5.2. Ihe CD's contain all the RPMS and the Source RPMS for Redhat linux which I found very useful. The installation process is simplified, even though I had already installed it when I read. I think it's a bit more expensive at 37.49 UK Pounds then it should be and it should contain Slackware, but apart from that it is a flawless book.Overall: Que made a book which covers mainly two versions of linux.

I have used Dos, win win95 and winNT for about 7 years and though that I would give Linux a try after I had heard such a lot about it. I found the installation stage of linux documented by the book very easy to follow even if it took several attempts. When I had the system installed I found very little information on considering periperals and PPP scripts. I also found it very difficult to find out how to perform the normal every day tasks that I would with MS Windows.

I picked up this book because of the 3 CD-ROMs, RedHat, Slackware and Caldera. The book is preety good, but could use more in Xwindows installation/useage chapters. The distributions are getting old, if you buy the book, go out and buy Redhat 5.0, I'm running Debian Linux I got from boot Magizine issue 15"},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"Yes, it comes with three distributions of Linux: SlackWare, RedHat, and Caldera Lite. I started with the RedHat edition and gave up after three attmpts. It simply would not install on my system. The SlackWare version went on very smoothly.However, once getting it installed, the book does not help very much when configuring XFree86. It scares the user instead of assisting the user with multiple typical examples. Similarly on configuring PPP and using auto-dialing. It covers a few files and points the reader to How-To files on the Internet.This book is not for intemediate Windows users trying to figure out Linux. It lacks a cohesive roadmap, a description of sequence and processes for configuring systems to accomplish real world tasks. It's a little like reading a dictionary when you were looking for a &quot;how to&quot; manual.Overall, this appears to be a rehash of material available on the Internet with the author providing one sample thread through the process."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"I bought this book primarily because of the three different installation packages that comes with the book. (Red Hat 4.1, Slackware 96 and Caldera OpenLinux Lite).The book itself was fairly broad in scope, trying to cover the basics of Linux on two versions. Caldera's installation receives only a short chapter. The book repeats a lot of information when covering installation, but does a thorough job.I was particularly dissapointed in the coverage of Xwindows, the information provided was barely adequate."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"If you have some understanding of Linux this book will make you even more confused."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"While the back of the book says it is aimed at Intermediate to advanced users, the introduction claims that it is aimed at beginners.I have never used Linux much, and have recently installed a dual-boot system.

Caldera does provide decent documentation for its product, but the installation and user's guide is a bit spare fora newbie to make much use of. This book is the one that took me from being a wet-eared newbie to a competent OpenLinux user. The book assumes that you know very little about Linux and gives you an introduction to the history of Linux, the open source philosophy, the distributions of Linux and a host of other pertinent information before taking through Star Office, the K Desktop Environment (using and manipualting), the command line, package management with RPM, the file system, configuring the X Server, configuring sound, the file system, networking (including using Samba and NetWare), connecting to the Internet, reading the XF86Config file, tweaking, programming languages, compiling source code, shell scripting, runlevels, troubleshooting, and a range of almost every possible problem that a home user or small office user will run into. This book can get quite in depth, and is suitable for those who want to get into Linux quite deeply, or for simple casual use as a reference guide. This is the one book that should ship with every version of Caldera. With this book, you'll find that Linux really can be quite fun to learn and quite easy as well."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"This book is very good in the sense that it covers almost everything from how to use Linux effectively (play games, use office suite, play audio CD, etc) to system administration tasks.

Just remember that Linux, by definition, has a larger learning curve than Windows and you are guaranteed to have to edit some text config. files to make it work just like you want it to.During my second week of use I was able to recompile my kernel and set up modules to do just what I wanted. This book walked me step-by-step through the whole thingSome of the mentioned gripes could be solved by using other install methods, rather than trying to install from Windows (this is the most likely to fail method). Try the boot disk or boot from the floppy."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"I purchased this book per a recommendation and was extremely excited, after reading the cursory synopsis of the book. Upon receipt of the book I first looked at the CD's and found no mention of the Slackware Distribution, Only Redhat's and Caldera's, along with the Star Office. Now perhaps the Slackware distribution is included somewhere on the CD's but it is not immediately evident and will undoubtably lead to confusion. My initial foray into the contents started well, and I was pleased with the explanations of Linux, it history and use. Unfortunately, this is stopping point for, in my estimation, any attempt by the authors at making the subject matter the least bit interesting. It is in the 2nd chapter that the subject matter, while extremely important and manditory reading, as it is dealing with the set up and installation process, becomes painfully dry, an effort to read and definately not for the beginner or casual user. In the 3rd chapter much of the second chapter dealing with set up and installation is repeated verbatum, and again is technically difficult to read. At this point I should say that while not a total computer techniphobe, I do have 10 years of experience with computers, beginning in the days of DOS and continuing into the Windows amd Macintosh families of operating systems. I also over the years have accumulated a certain degree of experience with both hardware and software so I am what I would consider a fairly advanced computer user. I am currently starting into the 4th chapter and will attempt to get some understanding of the Linux OS. I would not however recommend this book to anyone just starting out with Linux, but would only recommend it to those whom already have linux up and running and require a reference book to fall back on. Great for the advanced user , but not for the beginner on thier initiation into Linux. I myself will probably purchase a much more user friendly reference to begin my experience with Linux."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"I am new to Linux but have worked on Windows 95/NT for many years. After reading &quot;Using Caldera OpenLinux 2.2,&quot; I was able to do just about everything in OpenLinux 2.2 that I currently do in Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. I was able to connect to the internet, create a WordPerfect document, customize the GUI, and install new applications. One downfall to the book is that it often used &quot;print screens&quot; from OpenLinux 1.3 (the previous version of OpenLinux). For my soundcard, the book recommended that I buy a commercial driver from 4Front technologies; I wish the book would have given me instructions on installing the free OSS sound driver.The CD included with the book is superb. It includes Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 with WordPerfect 8.0 and hundreds of open source applications. KDE, the graphical user interface to OpenLinux 2.2, is better than the Microsoft Windows GUI. &quot;Que Using Caldera OpenLinux 2.2&quot; and the OpenLinux 2.2 distribution of Linux is a must for anyone new to the Linux community."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"I bought this book and found it very helpful, but my hardware wasn't supported(Laptop with external CD-ROM) so I had a heck of a time trying to get it installed. The book gives a good layout of how to setup, configure, and administer a Openlinux 2.2 box and I though it was a good deal since it came with the whole dist. on CD. I have bought and tried many dist. of Linux and make it my hobby; this is the first dist. that I would call a serious competitor to Windows 9x and would be great for the beginner, but as an experienced Linux user I find either Slakware or Debian better for the experienced computer user as they present more of a technical &quot;hands-on&quot; experience when using linux.

It summarizes what is installed in a Linux system. However it is not meant for an adminstrator of an existing system. It provides no troubleshooting advice. This book may provide some assistance in studying for certification because of its broad, but not detailed information."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"I have copies of the second edition, and the fourth edition, 1999 reprint. The second edition is Slackware oriented, and comes with Slackware and Red Hat on CD's. The fourth edition is supposedly Red Hat oriented, and comes with Red Hat 5.1, and Caldera OpenLinux Lite 1.2, on CD's, as well as a CD with source code for the Red Hat distribution. However, the fourth edition does not come with Slackware. But, for some strange reason, the command explanations, eg, adduser, relate only to the Slackware distribution, and are completely different to the Red Hat distribution. The installation instructions for the Red Hat distribution are poorly written, and miss too much material, skipping over important material. The information is somewhat inaccurate, and this is only discovered when it is too late. On page 33 of the book, it states &quot;For a complete installation of everything in the distribution, 150MB to 200MB is recommended.&quot; However, after having repartioned my hard disk with a partition for Linux of 625MB, so I could install Red Hat Linux and Star Office, with lots of room left to spare, when I was installing Red Hat Linux 5.1, from the CD, with all the packages, I found that it required 657 MB. I ended up re-installing, without many of the packages, and cutting the installation to supposedly 500MB, according to the installation information displayed during installation, to leave room for the Star Office installation. But, it took 525 MB of disk space, when the reduced installation copmpleted, so I can't install Star Office, without scrapping the system, and re-partioning the hard-drive again. Also, no explanation is given as to why the df figures displayed don't add up, and why they disagree with the fdisk figures, for free space and usage. The figures mentioned, apart from the 625MB partion, do not include the 35MB swap partition. This is all quite unfortunate, as the QUE Special Edition books have thus far had a good reputation, which this book appears to degrade. It is unfortunate that no-one appeared to really read the book, or check its validity or relevance, before unleashing it on an unsuspecting public. Perhaps Que should hire some proof-readers, and technical advisers, to go through books such as this, before unleashing them on the public. Thus, the future books (and reprints, if any), could be more accurate and reliable."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"DON't do it, this book is so confusing, it has a lot of information, but the probelm is that you undersatdn nothing for me it! some of the authors of the book know nothing about teaching Linux, they might be good on linux, but, ha, this jum around from one point to another, man, I had to call one of my friends to help me installing the program, Please, Please, don't wast your money, buy something else.

Anyway I got it in the end after browsing all Caldera and general Linux titles in a local bookstore - and looking back I never regretted my decision.I find this book extraordinary in the breadth and depth it covers. It has very good coverage on a wide range of topics in addition to the usual installation and configuration and common sysadmin tasks that is present in most Linux books, and the authors had a lot of insight into the topics (I was skimming through the sections on pgp, ssh, tcp wrappers and firewalls and learned a lot from it).It is, at the same time, very well written and easy to read and gave me much less headache than reading the howto's, man pages, RFCs, or my Linux Bible! My only criticism is that it is sometimes a bit application-oriented (e.g. it was focussing mainly on swat in the Apache configuration chapter and did not cover manual configuration nor gave explanation of the Apache directives).In general I find the book well structured and very well written and I definately hope to see the authors continue to update the with the new features of the new versions of Caldera Linux."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Caldera OpenLinux","review":"Que has done it again!!

Its main fault is that it is frequently chaotic and can be difficult to follow, especially if it has been awhile since you read the previous stories. The protagonist, Merlin, continues his sparring with Luke, Jasra,and the Mask, and his girlfriend, Julia is back in the story, unknown to Merlin at first. Merlin's brother, Jurt, also is involved, along with multiple other extended family members.Zelazny fans will like this, but the Amber premise is noticably tiring in this story."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"In the Sign of Chaos, Zelazny turns the magic of his sorcerous Logrus initiates loose in a big way, including a very entertaining sequence where Merlin, his very interesting half brother Mandor, and a surprising third ally make an assault on the Keep of the Four Winds. Spells and fur fly, and in the end Merlin finally gets a handle on who all the players may be in his troubles through these books, if possibly not a clear picture of all their motivations. We also see more interaction with the Ghostwheel.As with both five book Amber series, Sign of Chaos does not stand on its own. It is, fittingly, just the middle of this very intricate series of mysteries and adventures.Zelazny's writing continued to entertain in a way separate from the plot itself. For example, he gives Merlin very clever and amusing names for his spells. Merlin continues to be a fascinating combination of spunky and naive, taking great pains to follow his own agenda despite what those around him might prefer. Many of Zelazny's characters from the first Amber series play interesting roles, along with new, vibrant characters introduced here with Merlin's story.I'm having a terrific time reading these books again. As I write this review I'm halfway done with the final book, and I'll be a bit sad to be done with them."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"Merlin is trapped in a crazy version of Wonderland, which is actually, of course, just a Shadow.

It's not a bad book by any means, but Merlin's story is one of an ever-increasing number of people who want to either kill him or run his life for him. This book is that critical mass when there are so many characters to keep track of that small minds like this reviewer's tend to shut down.Fittingly enough, the book starts out with Merlin and Luke trapped in the Mad Hatter's Tea Party Bar, where the previous volume left them off. A psychedelic Mickey has turned Luke into a hallucination machine and it takes both ingenuity and chemistry for Merlin to take his leave. He makes it back to Amber only to discover that he has a new, and beautiful aunt. Who just as promptly disappears, leaving Merlin once again in the clutches of an old friend.Along the way Merlin picks up Mandor, his older brother on the Chaos side, and Jasra, who is now a 'friendly' enemy instead of a coat rack. This is about where characters and plot get so intricate that you may wish you had been keeping score from the beginning. Zelazny is merciless, captivating his readers at the same time he is confusing them.By way of personal history, I took a several year break from the series at this point, picking up the last two volumes when the appeared in paperback. You may feel like doing the same thing, but there are only two more quick volumes to go and you will be a member of the I Love Amber club, a very exclusive group of folks."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"This book held interesting turns!

It has some wonderful tips. It gives you an idea of how long to cook beans, soups etc... also shows you how to use your own recipes with a pressure cooker. The practical workings of a pressure cooker are explained to you and that was very helpful as I had never used one before. My experience has been that not all the timings are correct, at least for my altitude. For example if I cook the beans as long as the book says my beans are mushy.

My daughter was interested so bought each of us copy of this book. After reading about the need to replace the seal and the pressure valve every year or two I gave the cooker I bought at discount to my daughter so she could try to see if she liked cooking this way. As it was discontinued model doubt we can find replacement seal and valve for it so using it only to see if she really likes it and can then get her a 4 or 6 qt stainless steel model. But this way she can try one out first. Meanwhile I bought a Presto 4 qt stainless steel from Amazon for my use. When arrived I found the Presto manual a bit intimidating although very useful and one of the better manuals I have read lately. This book, however, was just what I wanted to get us started. Discussed pros and cons and definitely made me feel much more comfortable in using a pressure cooker. Recipes are simple and useful. What I really wanted (and needed) was the first 57 pages explaining the history of problems with early cookers (not the new ones), how to use and maintain them to get the best performance.

I didn't know about how to set up the cooker, I didn't know what to look for, I didn't have any recipes, etc.Anyway, I made a really sound decision. I would recommend that anyone buy this book before starting out. (In reading some of the reviews, it's very obvious that the people don't know what they are doing. But enough of that.) For example, a cooker should steam gently while it is cooking, people with electric stoves should use the two-burner method and the rubber gasket must be treated gently. It is ideally washed in warm water, dried carefully and oiled, placed in the lid and the lid stored upside down to prevent compression on the gasket when it's not being used.I did look on YouTube for videos showing how the pressure cooker behaved, and it was useful.I am making the Master Bean Recipe for dinner tonight.

But frustratingly laden with Freudian content or revisions of Freudian concepts (thus the subtitle; so no real secret there). As with Freud, Perls had much to say but unfortunately developed his revised thinking in such a unique and personalized way that it became almost impossible to disconnect his meaning and purpose from an intimate knowledge of his being. As the readers, we do not have the luxury of knowing him that well and thus much was lost on me. Still, if you're considering this book for academic pursuits, it's a good book to say that you have read."},{"Title":"Ego, hunger, and aggression;: A revision of Freud's theory and method,","review":"In his book Perla describes his concepts of an individual as an organism with basic biological needs.

We can only understand that they are need of something from which they have suffered deprivation leading to such thing and neurosis and anxiety. His explainatio.

Her first glimpse at the outside world is not a pretty one. Little did she know that behind the gates that protected her lies a divided land, one with differing cultures and religions who are all vying for a position of power, and beneath them all, the common people are suffering, oppressed on all sides, especially by Arsenal's \\"Inquisitors\\", who they refer to as \\"Testarotho\\". These Testarotho are the very same people Capria will be helping. Just like the Spanish Inquisition during the Middle Ages, the Inquisitors go around rounding up heretics and trying to convert them to the one true religion, that sanctioned by Arsenal. If they can't get this through reason, they try torture, and if that doesn't work, then there's always execution, preferably burning at the stake! Capria works under Father Garrincha, who seems like a nice man, but doesn't blink when he sentences heretics to death. The other two members of her team are Leonedus and Socrates. Socrates is part priest, part doctor. Leonedus is the main warrior, sporting a bazooka-like rifle that equals or probably exceeds him in size, begging the question of how and where he carries it. If he's not shooting people, he's knocking their heads off with it. Volume 1 is pretty much an intro to the setting and the characters, but already we're beginning to see that the Testarotho team is starting to question whether what they're doing is right or not. Capria's introduction is going to push them even further down that road because she hasn't accepted the violent status quo of this horrible new world.Brutality is the word that comes to mind after reading Testarotho Volume 1. It's a cautionary tale about religion and how there is never one true faith. Religions are simply literary interpretations of a divine source as put into words by impure humans. Since all faiths are corrupted by the unskilled hands of Man, humans will never be able to agree about one true God. So we kill people to settle the argument, because reason will never solve such a problem. Capria is a great Everyman character because her introduction to the world is a symbol representing the reader. We feel like she does, because perusing this world we are filled with loathing and disgust, just like her. One thing that is so comical that it almost ruins the serious nature of this work is Leonedus' \\"big gun\\". There is no way this guy could carry this everywhere he goes. He'd have back problems like I don't know what. And this huge 10 foot long rifle is hidden under his cape??!! Come on!! Maybe they'll explain it with some extra-dimensional scientific theories later one, but for now, it's just plain dumb, and mars an otherwise emotionally honest tale."},{"Title":"An Introduction to NLP Neuro-Linguistic Programming : Psychological Skills for Understanding and Influencing People","review":"I was getting reference info for this book when I noticed someone gave it a bad review.

Back then the customer was always right and businesses had time to make the customer happy. Today customers are more demanding and unreasonable. Time truly is money and it's getting harder and harder to go the exra mile when it means letting something else slide. Yet no one can afford to lose customers. The principles in the book are good: giving the customer your full attention, listening to them, making eye contact, inviting them back and so on. But there's nothing new here, and it needs to be updated for 2003. Come on Ron, get with the times and give us something we can use.

It gave me a good understanding of how my body works - as a total unit, and how emotions effect the functioning of my body. It is written in easy to understand, laymen terms. I recommend this book to any one and every one. It is just full of good information and recommendations.William L. GlassVP ST&I; Inc."},{"Title":"Heal Yourself: Body Mind Spirit","review":"Dr. Kamph has compiled a complex subject in an easy to understand readable style for the lay reader. The book is divided into five sections, and describes how structure and function, emotional and mental health affect each other. Each chapter begins with a case study from \\"the doctor's diary.\\" These studies include the symptoms, the prescribed treatment, and the results.The material reported in the case study is then examined for cause of the symptoms, the reasons for the prescribed treatment as it relates to the bodies system, and why the treatment was successful.Topics like understanding stress, the nervous and muscular systems, the spine, spinal nerves, the cells, the cardiovascular, lymph and immune systems are all covered in depth. The digestive and the excretory systems are illustrated and detailed.I found the information on diet and nutrition of special interest and extremely helpful.Dr. Kamph is well known for her educational workshops, her informative articles, and for her earlier book, \\"Prescription of Robust Health.\\" She has been a presenter at The Power of Healing conferences, and often appeared as a featured guest on radio and TV.\\"Heal Yourself\\" is an excellent guidebook for making informed choices for reversing illness and regaining emotional, mental, and physical well being."},{"Title":"Heal Yourself: Body Mind Spirit","review":"Reviewed by Susan Pettrone for Reader Views (12/06)The premise of this book is a simple one. If you take to heart the advice within its pages and apply the techniques described to your body and your life, you will not only be a healthier individual but a happier one as well.This is such a simple sentence, but one that packs a lot of promise into its structure. And so it is with this book as well. Within its 122 pages (including Bibliography and index); this book puts into simple language the difficult task of making ones life a healthier one. Broken into four sections, \\"Heal Yourself: Mind Body Spirit,\\" the reader is taken through the various problems that plague the average person and in turn is given advice from Chiropractor/author Marcia Kamph on how to simplify ones life and become a better person for it.Section one gets off to a great start, mentioning the \`mind body emotion connection' and how all three of these areas affect each of us in different ways. It also explains through examples and easy to understand language, how a problem in any one of these sections can affect the whole body and throw the whole of a person into turmoil. One chapter of special interest is that of Chapter 4, which address' the \`spine, spinal nerves and symptoms' and how they work to keep our bodies in check, as well as how when one of these 3 areas is \`out of alignment' the whole of the body suffers. This was interesting to this reviewer in that I have had experience in this area with migraines and have discovered that when my spine is out of alignment, the headaches are more severe and actually longer lasting than when I make a point of keeping my body aligned. The author does a wonderful job in this chapter explaining the spine and its part in the wellness of the body and in my opinion; this is by far one of the best chapters in the book.That said I must also be honest when I say that although I agree with the author when she maintains a healthier diet can help alleviate a number of negative situations with our bodies, I have a problem with her in that the diet described within the pages of this book seems to be a difficult one to maintain. Though the author is very thorough in her description of why each item is important, I have a hard time believing that the average reader will have the time or the resources available to maintain the diet suggested. The section on \`food combining' and \`pulse test' while interesting, are also questionable as to whether many readers will be dedicated enough to follow through on the advice within at least after the first few days.All in all, this is an interesting book. It covers a myriad of problems and offers solutions which vary in their applications and difficulty level to achieve. Although I may not agree with all the stringent rules and suggestions within its pages in regards to diet, I still find this book to be a worthwhile read for the common sense and eye opening information about the body presented by the author. I would suggest that the reader determine what his/her needs are and whether he/she is open to new information, ideas and applications before purchasing \\"Heal Yourself: Mind Body Spirit..\\" If the reader is willing to make significant changes, then by all means purchase this book and dive into its pages. It holds many new ideas, insights and suggestions and given a chance, can educate the reader and show the path to new ways of becoming a happier healthier person....perhaps sooner than you ever imagined.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Wow!

Fun Activities To Make Reading Happen (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I picked up this book, I did not expect it to be so comprehensive in teaching reading and writing. This a small, but powerful book. I expected a few activities as a supplement to other methods. The activities use all five senses and are fun. They incorporate dancing, singing, and sometimes eating. As another reviewer wrote, this may be the only book you may ever need to teach reading!I have a Masters Degree in Education, with focus on literacy and learning disabilities. I have read many books on whole language vs. phonics instruction, but none that incorporated both as well as this one does.The book is divided into 7 sections, each one building on the other as they master it. Within each section, is a list of supplies needed for the activities. This is the only book that I have read that I really have all the supplies necessary to start right away. Then, the actual activities. At the edge of each activity page, there is a box that the author has given some more wonderful information. She has a Reading Zone with books to read to the child to expand on the activities. There is Teaching Time that explains the concept development that the activities focus on. The last, but very important item the author included, is State Standards Say which tells what most states expect of children to know when they are tested in reading at school.Here are the 7 sections (just a small sample of activities included):Let's Talk About It (prereading skills)make a collage, make a sequence crownteaches to identify and sort words, extend vocabulary, following directions, connect to real life experiencesStart with Soundsrhyme time, treasure hunt, monster munchrecite and produce rhyming words, listen for phonemes in wordsPrint Power!rainbow writing, autograph book, word necklacedistinguish letters from words, learn that print provide information in everyday settingNow I Know My ABC'seating the alphabet, milk-cap mania, alpha-petlearning upper and lower case alphabet, sequencing lettersPhonics Funalphabet crowns, word puzzlers, phonics gizmoslearning consonant and vowel sounds, as words change so do soundsWrite On!office signs, business cards, stationery, it's in the mail, spell-a-phoneidentify types of everyday printed materialsBeyond the Taledazzling diagrams, wonder webs, teeny-tiny theaterlearn to use fiction and non-fiction material, retell stories"},{"Title":"Wow!

Most can be done with no special materials, or with paper plates, magazine pictures, and other materials you probably have lying around the house.

Each page builds on ideas learned in the last section, yet they can also be done out of order for fun. This is a perfect resource for home schoolers who have pre-school aged children. Some activities are quiet, some are active, some are creative, but all are fun. This is not a workbook, so it can be used over and over again. The supplies used for some of the games are easily part of a household. You won't have to run to the store for some obscure item just to do a lesson.

Below were my impressions: 1. The course was by far the clearest and easiest to learn recorded presentation of Spanish that I have yet experienced. (and I have tried several). 2. The instructor gave English translations for everything on the tapes which meant I didn't have to look up anything. 3. The native Spanish speaker's voice was extremely clear and easy to understand. The best I have heard. 4. The material was relevant to everyday situations one would encounter in a Spanish speaking country or in conversation with a Spanish speaking person. 5. The course was by far more flexible in its approach to the teaching of basic sentence building which allowed me to express myself and my likes and desires basically but effectively IN MY WAY and in my own words without studying Spanish for years. This was VERY helpful. Overall, I would highly recommend the Speed Spanish series, and I hope that there will soon appear a written guide to accompany these wonderful tapes!

In fact, this book includes xhtml 1.1 information, and basics on reading and writing a DTD. The book is a 2001 book, which means Ms. Navarro must have finished it up in 2000 to submit to publishers. Since 1999 was when xhtml 1.0 was published by the standards organization, W3C, covering some of xhtml 1.1, in a writing of 2000, when most browsers barely supported xhtml 1.0 with CSS 1 is looking forward a good bit.The book is written in the old style, that is graphic design 101, coding plus color theory for impact. Graphics themselves are very lightly covered. An intro to Jasc, Photoshop, and Fireworks are about all you get on graphics.On one hand, this book is utterly out of date, in the fact that CSS is the primary style layout tool now. On the other hand, because CSS is so loud these days, HTML may be falling by the wayside in peoples necessary knowledge of it.Either way, this book was ahead of it's time, and now, only 5 years later is now behind the present time.

Almost any short story in any issue of ELLERY QUEEN'S MYSTERY MAGAZINE will have more substance to it.Many of the chapters (so-called) are only 2 or 3 pages long. Another thing that irritated me is neither Parker nor the publisher cared enough to bother proofreading this book! It is FULL of typos of all sorts. And did I mention yet that the \\"characters\\" are one-dimensional? They are as fleshed out as a row of pencil dots . . . . Would you believe that one of the main villains actually hisses? Repeatedly? Like a reptile?! And bites both Hawk and Spenser?!As for plot holes, they are abundant: nobody in a huge company that sells electrical power (like ENRON) seems to be doing anything to earn money (and only two people in management notice this); a pistol is found with a man who was killed by a shot in the head, but the police do not check whether it actually fired either of the two bullets found in the room (nor is anyone concerned about the number of bullets left in the gun); the police (and Spenser) never think about checking the keys of the dead man's computer for fingerprints, although a suicide note has supposedly been typed on it by him; police in two counties seem content to let a private eye do all the work of solving two murders for them; worst of all, the private eye gathers evidence illegally on MULTIPLE occasions, and yet we are to believe that the main villains will be convicted.Finally and quite incredibly, it is clear that Spenser has no computer in his own office, let alone one with Internet access (nor, apparently, does his genius psychiatrist girlfriend), and yet on several occasions he has questions about public figures that could easily have been at least partly answered by Googling their names.But that is just the bad news. The good news is that anyone can read this book at lightning speed, so that very little of the valuable time of anyone's life will be wasted by it.As far as constructive criticism is concerned, I can think of two suggestions. (1) Follow the path of Ruth Rendell in her short story \\"The Case of the Shaggy Caps\\" (1977). This is a well written Puzzle Story which ends inconclusively despite having a solution that is convincing: the detectives agree that very possibly the guilty person cannot be convicted--and Rendell takes the story no further. Or (2) make the story a Full Monte case of vigilante justice (why just stop at having the \\"Saints with Guns\\" commit only blackmail, robbery, breaking & entering, assault & battery, and kidnapping?)--have Spenser end BAD BUSINESS by implying that his helper Hawk \\"disposed of\\" the worst two villains without bothering to involve the cops or the courts."},{"Title":"Chosin: Heroic Ordeal of the Korean War","review":"I was with Able Co. 5th Marines, 1st MarDiv, and was wounded during this battle. Naturally, I was very interested in how a military historian saw it. Eric Hammil has done a thorough job of recounting the minute by minute and day by day events of the Chosin Reservoir battle. For one engaged, war becomes about a 10 square yard arena. You only see a small part and are emotionally involved with a very small group. The big picture is not available. Only from talking with others who were there can one begin to understand what happened. Hammil has done an excellent job. He covers it from the view of the individuals engaged, and from the overview of those who were in command. Excellent reading for anyone who is interested in how battles are won and lost. I could almost smell the cordite again when I read it."},{"Title":"Chosin: Heroic Ordeal of the Korean War","review":"Very nicely done account of a very horrible event. Granted, I suppose it is not the type of book that is \\"everything to everyone\\" but it does give one author's perspective on one huge event. The author perhaps misses covering all the sides to all the hundreds of personal stories which unfolded here, but overall I enjoyed the work and suggest it's reading and indeed, it's addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Chosin: Heroic Ordeal of the Korean War","review":"Hammel does a great job of recounting effectively the Marine breakout from the Chosin Reservior. It's obvious that he used the citations from many of the Medals of Honor and Navy Crosses that were awarded to add detail. The maps, though few, are nevertheless very helpful, and the TOO of the First Marine Division is a great addition. A great, exciting, and generally accurate read.The only criticism I have is that Hammel's account is somewhat insulting towards the U.S. Army troops on the other side of the Reservior. I think part of this is because the U.S. Army itself had somewhat buried that story, and there were few good sources available.Apart from that criticism, its an extremely worthwhile book. To get the full story, read this, and then Roy Appleman's fantastic &quot;East of Chosin&quot; for balance."},{"Title":"Chosin: Heroic Ordeal of the Korean War","review":"This is yet another book on the Chosin campaign. My gripe with the book deals with the portrayal of the army units on the east side of the reservoir, whom Hammel seems to have worked into the book in a slap-dash manner. I believe he hastily added these occasionl glimpses without much interest, as their portrayal is riddled with inaccuracies. For example, he falls into the same trap that Mr Martin Russ ('Breakout') has in his research involving Captain Ed Stamford, the marine tac-air controller attached to the army. The supposedly jaundiced view Stamford has of the &quot;doggies'&quot; ineptitude actually stems from an &quot;as-told-to&quot; article in which Stamford basically was interviewed by a marine writer for a dubious magazine article published in 'Catholic Digest' and 'Blue Book' magazines. Stamford was greatly annoyed by it and didn't want it used as a source, and he hadn't cleared it for publication. He said he was incensed by its tone and rhetoric. Hammel lists this article in his bibliography. He obviously didn't interview Stamford; that's part of the reason for the negative portrayal, and partly why legions of casual readers on the subject think the US Army behaved in a less than honorable manner. This book came out years ago, probably before the more authoritative works on the subject were released. His book was interesting, though, for the list of Navy Cross recipients in the appendix. I would recommend the official USMC history by Montross and Canzona, which is actually a volume of its Korean war history, and 'Escaping the Trap' by Roy Appleman."},{"Title":"Chosin: Heroic Ordeal of the Korean War","review":"Hammell has quite a large number of inaccuracies, slanted opinions, and has failed to verify facts from his sources. The book has a very negative view of the same US Army, whose sacrifice on the east side of Chosin undoubtedly saved the allies chance for withdrawal from Hagaru-ri and also provided the rear guard action for the evacuating column.

Written in the early 1920s, this novel may seem a bit dated in its language and cultural references to modern readers, but it is absorbing and shrewdly observed, with well-drawn characters who will remain with the reader after they close the book. The novel was considered somewhat shocking at the time it was published for describing romantic/sexual attachments on the part of what, at the time, were considered young children, and delivers some passionate observations on the conflict between art and \\"civilization\\" through its characters.The novel focuses on the Sanger family, headed up by Albert Sanger, a womanizing, self-involved English composer of some note, who has secluded himself and his family of undisciplined children in a chalet in the Austrian Tyrol. The children are from two different marriages and one liaison, and show varying degrees of their father's artistic brilliance as well as his contempt for societal norms. The household is propped up by the two eldest children, Caryl and Kate, who are already young adults and the most stable of the menagerie. The middle four children are the product of Sanger's second marriage to Evelyn Churchill, an Englishwoman of good family who cut herself off from her family to marry him, while the youngest is the product of Sanger's liaison with his current mistress (both wives are dead).The novel opens with the almost immediate death of the seriously ill Sanger, leaving four of his five younger children parentless. The youngest child disappears from the story very soon with her mother, as do the two eldest children, who have careers of their own to follow, one as an operatic soprano and the other as a conductor.It is the fate of Evelyn Churchill's four children, ranging in age from ten to sixteen, around which the novel revolves. Their closest relatives turn out to be their uncle, the dead Evelyn's brother, Charles, and his adult daughter, Florence, their cousin. Charles, the headmaster of a highly regarded private boys' school, is notified of the now parentless state of his sister's children.Charles sends the 28-year-old Florence to the Tyrol to take charge of her unruly young cousins. Her intention is to bring them back to England with her and place them in proper boarding schools where they can acquire discipline and basic education, and become suitably civilized. As soon as she arrives, Florence sees that she has her work cut out for her. The eldest, Antonia, sixteen years old, has recently been seduced by a rich friend of Sanger's, Jacob Birnbaum, who has fallen deeply in love with the beautiful young girl and offers to marry her. At first doubtful of this plan, Florence realizes that at 16, placing Antonia in a boarding school is unlikely to prove successful, especially given Antonia's state of newly awakened sexuality, and Florence agrees that the marriage is perhaps the best solution for Antonia. That leaves Teresa, or Tessa as she is called (14), Pauline (12), and Sebastian (10). Pauline evidences serious dramatic talent, and Sebastian is a gifted pianist - it is clear that these two children, at least, already have some direction that can guide their futures. Only Tessa shows no particular sign of the family heritage of quirky brilliance - artistically, at least.Rounding out the bizarre household that Florence finds when she gets to the Tyrol is Sanger's best friend, the rebellious, charismatic, and gifted young English composer Lewis Dodd, who, like the children's dead mother, is from a fine English family from whom he has cut himself off, and whose hypocrisies and pretensions he despises. Young Tessa has loved Lewis with all her heart since she was a little girl; she feels as if she belongs to him, and her portion of the family gift is an unnatural openness and clarity of mind - she understands Lewis completely and has known from a terrifyingly young age that they belong together. Already, at 14, she knows how to handle him and sustain him in a way that is quite startling in so young a girl. Her strange maturity where he is concerned, their perfect complementariness, is something that so far, her young age has kept Lewis blind to, although her sisters and brother, with the offhanded intuition of children, are aware of it. It is this aspect of the novel, Tessa's passionate devotion to Lewis at so young an age, that shocked readers of the 1920s - the novel makes no bones about the fact that the young Tessa loves the thirty-year-old Lewis the way an adult woman loves a man. The novel does not, to its credit, condescend to Tessa's love for Lewis, or pass it off as a \\"phase\\" or \\"crush\\", but presents it as real and deep: Tessa is not the victim of a schoolgirl crush, but a girl who has seen her heart's destiny too early.To Tessa's dismay, Florence and Lewis fall immediately in love and get themselves quickly married. Tessa's dismay is part personal anguish but part dread: she knows that Florence has fallen in love with Lewis's surface, that Florence has no knowledge of Lewis's darker nature and his capacity for cruelty. After their honeymoon, Lewis moves with Florence to England, where Florence buys a house. Tessa and Pauline are sent to a boarding school with other nice English schoolgirls where they are miserable. Sebastian does better at his school because of his wit, detached nature, and undeniable musical gifts, but none of the Sanger children are happy as they move from their unfettered past to what Florence cheerfully calls \\"the shades of the prison house\\".Florence believes herself to be sophisticated and tolerant, and she is quite knowledgeable about music. But, although initially charmed by her histrionic cousins, the conflict between her fundamentally conformist views and their freewheeling natures, which reverence nothing but music, soon begins to take a toll on the relationships among the characters - especially between Florence and Lewis. Florence begins to try to \\"manage\\" Lewis's career and push it forward using her contacts in English music circles, deaf to his passionate insistence that he doesn't give a damn whether anyone hears his music or not, and to his increasing hostility as she tries to force him to embrace the very Establishment values of \\"success\\" that he fled at sixteen when he left home. As their polarized views of life and art emerge, the marriage begins to fray. These tensions escalate when Tessa and Pauline, unable to cope any longer with the mob rule that characterizes English boarding school life and that is so contrary to their individualistic upbringing, run away and arrive on the Dodd's doorstep, to Lewis's approval and Florence's fury. Florence wants to send them back, but the school will not take the Sanger sisters back, they are too disruptive. Pauline is quickly shipped off to a dramatic academy in France, but Tessa has nowhere to go and finds herself between Florence and Lewis in their home, a position that becomes ever more dangerous as the Dodd marriage deteriorates. Florence, sensing Lewis's partiality for Tessa, increasingly resents her young cousin's presence, although she still does not grasp the depth of their attachment.It is Charles, Florence's father, who first recognizes the true nature of the profound bond between Lewis and Tessa, and the looming disaster that will occur the moment Lewis himself becomes fully aware of it. Charles tries to warn Florence to be less vicious toward her cousin and less domineering toward her husband, behaviors that are driving Lewis away. Charles even offers to educate Tessa privately in his own household - he likes Tessa enormously, enchanted by her unusually broad and perceptive mind. Charles believes that if he can get Tessa out of the Dodd household, he can save her from an early involvement with Lewis that will blight her young life, and give Florence a chance to salvage her marriage.But it is too late - the novel is already building to its inevitable confrontations between the unbidden nature of art and love and the artificial boundaries of civilization. Florence's doom is that she is both the invader and the victim of the little world whose Bohemian character once so charmed her; she has wandered, unwary, into an environment that is hostile to her essential ideas of order and morality. Despite her beauty, sophistication, and good intentions, Florence remains an outsider in this world, which she despises while longing for true membership in it. She hates and envies her cousins for their natural citizenship in this world. Tessa and Lewis, on their parts, realize at last not only that they belong to each other, but that they do not belong in Florence's neatly ordered universe. No compromise is possible here, only tragedy.This beautifully written novel explores uncomfortable truths about the nature of love and genius. I stumbled upon it first as a young girl and have revisited it since with admiration as well as pleasure. It is, as mentioned earlier, acutely observed, and if you like English literature and the early 20th-century English \\"voice\\", you will likely adore this stylishly presented work. I'm delighted to see that it is available in print again."},{"Title":"The Constant Nymph","review":"What a discovery, this book by a British author little known in the US. Margaret Kennedy creates the atmosphere of a creative rather mad household in vivid detail. We love the Sanger children, not quite certain at the beginning who is our heroine from the way we are brought into their Alpine retreat. The omniscient point of view gives us insights on even the characters who are relatively stereotyped by today's sensibilities: the Russian ballet designer, the wealthy Jewish family friend. Kennedy's broad sympathies and wisdom on love and the relation of the sexes make this much more than a period romance or 'woman's book,', and her depiction of musical genius vs bourgeois society is complex. Read Anita Brookner's introduction afterwards--you want 'The Constant Nymph' to unfold with no preconceptions."},{"Title":"The Constant Nymph","review":"It took a while to get going but once it did, I could not put this book down.

If you seriously need to understand bookkeeping, forget about the course, and read this book."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"It was a good story but it WASN'T Lord Soth's story. This book was so inacurate I could have written it better off the top of my head without reading any of the other DL books over. That isn't not the only problem though. Soth's decline into evil was much too rapid. He didn't go through any emotional struggle before becoming evil, he just did. I even question if he was ever good. The book starts out with one of his henchmen murdering 2 people at his command. If you want a good book about Lord Soth there are 2 in the Ravenloft series that are very good."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"I loved Knight of the Black Rose, and looked forward to getting more in depth detail of Soth's rise and fall as a Knight of Solamnia. I think its a little unfair to come down so harshly on this book. True, Van Belkom isn't James Lowder, but his style is readable and he made the novel accessible to anyone who came off the street not knowing anything about Dragonlance. As for discrepencies between Lowder and Van Belkom, he does point out in the opening pages that this story is one of many told about Soth, and details may vary between tellers. As a whole, this book was a solid read. There's enough action for a sword and sorcery fan to get into, but enough intrigue to keep you through the calm parts of the novel as well. The Kingpriest's madness is one of the coolest parts of the book. While mostly confined to small scenes, his Edict of Thought Control will send a shiver down the spine. In all, Lord Soth is a fine way to turn a friend on to Dragonlance. Its a simple, self-contained story that leaves the reader wanting more. I hope either Van Belkom or Lowder is allowed to detail Soth's early days as a Death Knight. How did he come to serve Takhisis? He seems more remorseful than evil by the end of the tale."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"Given the difficulty Edo van Belkom must have had to write about one of Krynn's &quot;unapproachable, unchangeable&quot; characters, LORD SOTH comes off as a pretty well-written book. Having little interest in the Death Knight's personal story-because I'm just dabbing into Dragonlance right now-I read it as a straight, linear book. And it came off rather well-done. Quite literally, too, at the end when the gods bake all major characters of the book (with the gory exception of three elf maidens on the side of a certain road...). But on the serious track, the book is an interesting read for someone who doesn't try to poke through all the tidbits of Loren Soth's life. The biggest fault is not in the prose or style of van Belkom, but rather that he never really delves into Lord Soth's character. Throughout the book, Loren Soth is the doomed man, haunted by past misdeeds but also rationalizing his actions with his noble title and reputation. Yet though his madness is quite vivid in portrayal, he is only a masked character, and one is inclined to feel more sorry for say the trio of elves he cuts down on the way to (or depending on your viewpoint, back from) Istar. There are also some good parts about the pyschology of the Kingpriest of Istar. The Cataclysm isn't well portrayed in this book, not a shame, but one does wish for more depiction of the scene where the fiery mountain collides with the planet. Of course, the event has been detailed elsewhere so any extensive depiction here might come off as redundant. There is plenty of gore in the book, and it's very much domestic in nature, and to some people it may be exceedingly disturbing. The murder of a wife and child is bad enough, but when repeated... At the end, LORD SOTH is very much one of those books that is interesting to read but lacking the Dragonlance atmosphere. One can say the same thing about THE IRDA, any of the Fifth Age books, and so on (and on the badly faring side, there is THE DARK QUEEN...) Good to read, but in the end it felt like a distraction from Krynn's main road."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"This is a DARK story. While there may be some contradictions from other accounts(I haven't read the Ravenloft books yet)I thought this novel showed how Soth lost everything - even his soul.Someone said it showed Soth as never being good. I disagree. Soth didn't want to have those murders comitted at the start. It made references to his nobility several times. The book wasn't about his good side. It was about how he transcended into darkness.A great story."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"Soth, the most mysterious, most menacing, character from the first two Dragonlance trilogies finally gets his own starring role in a story that describes how the man became the dreaded undead knight.The author attempts to create a Shakespeareian-like, Othello-esque story of a noble, honorable knight with a checkered family heritage who succumbs to his tragic flaws of pride and lust. Pretty impressive for a mass market paperback assumed to be targeted at the 12 to 18 year old age group.I believe it is that very marketing fact that limits the impact of Lord Soth. Having to pull his punches, dance around mature topics, and avoid adult themes, the author is prevenented from writing the story that could be. He does his valiant best to create a decent story but in the end the reader is left saying \\"there could be more\\""},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"An excellent book in many may ways. I'm a big Lord Soth fan, and I must admit, this book suits him well. It shows he downfall of a man, respect and adored by many others, a man that gives himself into greed and lust, and how jealousy and mistrust can corrupt even those who seek to be so pure and noble. Although the end of the book is a little rushed (the effects of the Cataclysm could have been more explored... but that wasn't the theme anyway)."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"The book, Lord Soth, I found to be poorly written and failed to explain and give good reason for Lord Soth's spiral downward into the depths of evil. The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it. Weis and/or Hickman should have written the book as opposed to some novice."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"Lord Soth was originally a Knight of Solamnia who turned evil- was it pride, lust or greed? His descent into darkness and evil is detailed here. He accepts a task from Paladine to redeem himself. He is a major villain in the War of the Lance, also featured more subdued in Ravenloft. It's kind of creepy."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"This was a well written book, but the main events were all wrong. I enjoyed James Lowder's novel, \\"The Knight of the Black Rose\\" a lot more, (I even cried at the end!) but that was when Soth was dead and the author could have him do whatever he wanted.You quickly learn why it has a disclaimer in the beginning saying that this story might be wrong - the main facts that Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman said about Soth when he was living were completely left out! It started to go downhill from the point where Soth took Isolde back to the keep. That's not what happened. Soth and the elves made camp and escorted them to Palanthas. (Though I'm not sure if they made it there or not.) He seduced her - NOT the other way around. His first wife was not mentioned that much, but I don't think he loved her that much or he wouldn't have cheated on her. And I don't think he was the one who personally killed her. I got the feeling that he had one of his loyal knights do the job instead. And what's with all the people around in the land? There were no people that were \\"his\\" to watch over. That's why he got away with everything. There might have been a trial and his knights set him free, but there was NO mention of why he was taken to court. Also, Soth beat Isolde. Right before they got the message to go save Istar, she was crying (from his beating) and he took pity on her and they went and prayed together.Now I know I haven't read the Dragonlance Series in a really long time, but my soul knew it was WRONG! Then why did I continue reading it? Because it was well written and I wanted to see if any of the other events would happen correctly.This book really doesn't answer any questions or help you \\"know\\" Soth any better, if anything, it left me frustrated and confused - if over half the \\"facts\\" presented in here are false, how can it help you \\"get to know\\" him any better? I don't know if Soth was *ever* a truly good man, yet, throughout this book, Soth appears to be a good guy until the very end of the story. He loved Korinne, yet slept with Isolde and made it seem like her fault. Which I have major problems with...but that's another story..."},{"Title":"Lord Soth (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 6)","review":"This book tells the tale of the events leading up to Lord Soth's mysterious change from Solamnic Knight of Paladine to Death Knight of Takhisis for those of us who have come to know him as Kitiara's creepy sidekick from the Chronicles stories.

Other than the inconsistencies in the story, it isn't a bad book. The story documants Lord Soth's decent into darkness very well. And the chapters in between the main story, which tell about the Kingpriest in Istar, are spectacular. I also enjoyed reading abuot the child Lady Korinne gave birth to. It is ashame Soth killed it.

Parker moves on to extrasolar planets and the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence. After touching on interstellar flight, he closes with a discussion of the claim that Earth has been visited by aliens. All this adds up to a broad brush overview, leaving out most of the detailed arguments associated with this question. The writing, which avoids equations and elaborate statistics, seems to be aimed at the high school level. Some of the black and white illustrations, particularly the caricatures of scientists, are surprisingly crude."},{"Title":"Alien Life: The Search For Extraterrestrials And Beyond","review":"Alien Life is an easy-to-understand survey of alien life.

Parker is a scientist (Professor of Physics and Astronomy) but can write like a journalist; so the book is authoritative yet so well written that it almost breezes along in places. The whole presentation is very evenhanded. I like that. Too often I have purchased books that were peddling one point of view and shading the evidence without me knowing it until later. Not here though. Parker discusses pros and cons of several points of view, keeping the discussion balanced while making it all lively and interesting.

Other villagers share unique problems with Miss Read, who thanks the heavens that custodian Mrs. Pringle remains as morose as ever.VILLAGE CENTENARY is over two decades old but retains a freshness rarely seen in a long running series like the Miss Read Fairacre novels. The story line is a simple look at village life as a key milestone event is to occur. Heated arguments over what to do in a cozy environs seems so insignificant. That is until one thinks of some of the same types of debates in America such as the centennial celebration for the Statue of Liberty, the bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence, and even the one-hundredth anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge, etc. Miss Read's tales are fun, insightful, invigorating, and universal.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Village Centenary (The Fairacre Series #15)","review":"Miss Read books are lovely stories of the everyday life of a village schoolteacher. They are wholesome, funny and light reading. This particuluar story chronicles a school year where the school is celebrating its 100th anniversary. The banter between Miss Read and her school cleaner Mrs. Pringle is wonderfully funny. I love Jan Karon and the Mitford series, these books are as delightful as a visit to Mitford."},{"Title":"Village Centenary (The Fairacre Series #15)","review":"\\"Miss Read lovers everywhere will welcome her...novel set in the beautiful English village of Fairacre. It's the one hundreth anniversary of Miss Read's school, which first admitted pupils in 1880. It was Miss Clare, who was a pupil and later a teacher there, who pointed out that such a centenary should be celebrated; and all Fairacre was quick to offer suggestions ranging from a tea party to a full-scale pageant.Thinking of a practical way to stage such an occasion was only one of Miss Read's problems. A much grander affair, the Caxley Festival in May, took up a great deal of time and temper. The ancient skylight that had dripped for a hundred years on teachers and pupils alike was to be replaced by a new dormer window, about which Mr. Wllet had his doubts. The new teacher, Miss Briggs, fresh from college with idealistic theories, was a thorn in her headmistress's side. Mrs. Pringle was her usual dour self.Fairacre had other problems. The vicar decided to keep bees. Miriam Quinn feared that she might have to leave home. Henry Mawne went house-hunting, and Amy, Miss Read's sophisticated friend, toyed with the idea of writing her autobiography.The centenary year unfolds with its hopes and feard, its memories and forecasts, its friendships and feuds, and a lot of favorite characters return to delight and amuse in America's favorite English Village.\\""},{"Title":"Superconductivity of metals and alloys (Frontiers in physics)","review":"Possibly the best superconductivity book I have ever read. He covers GL equations excellently - he builds them up from Landau theory of phase transitions, by constructing them using the Helmholtz free energy. As far as the microscopic theory goes, BCS is brought from the very beginnings, in a methodical, logical mannar. The book is, however, a little mathematical for most people's tastes. A fair knowledge of quantum mechanics is needed before this book should be read (for example: Dirac notation, matix algebra to mention a few)."},{"Title":"Superconductivity of metals and alloys (Frontiers in physics)","review":"It is not possibly the best superconductivity book I have ever read, it is certainly an everlasting standard for a texbook in physics.

The author discusses the most important network applications--DNS, Samba, Apache (including an all-too-brief introduction to web programming), NTP, DHCP, firewalls, and routing--as implemented on Linux systems. Best of all--this book is extraordinarily readable, which is a wonderful surprise in a techie manual. If you are really serious about implementing any of these applications, I would also recommend the Craig Hunt Linux Library, but for a good introduction to make sense of the man pages and HOWTO documents, this book can't be beat.My only gripe is that Sendmail configuration and administration is far too complex for a book of this scope. The author's introduction to the topic was only deep enough to convince me to disable sendmail on my systems until I had read a more thorough text on the subject."},{"Title":"Linux: A Network Solution for Your Office","review":"This book is basically a descriptive example of how to build a Linux-based server for a small office. This book covers the spectrum of the most common necessities: Internet mail (SMTP and POP3), DNS, centralized backups, Samba (allows Microsoft operating systems to share files and printers), setting up FTP, setting up apache (WWW), and configuring the Linux box as a firewall.In the process, Toth bridges the gap between introductory books and the gargantuan Linux books.My only negative comment is that Toth used Caldera Linux (which is on the CDROM), so you may run into some minor inconsistencies when trying to implement the information on other flavors of Linux/Unix.

The author must have been pushing eighty when he embarked on his west to east journey through the 'Girdle of Emerald'.The Dutch decribed the control they had established over a maritime empire consisting of more than 16,000 island as stretching 'from Medan to Merauke', and it is this itinerary that Lewis follows.As usual he tries to stay away as far as possible from the beaten track. No Borobudur, Bali or Lake Toba here, instead the author and his companions decide to explore the northern tip of Sumatra, venturing into the troublesome Aceh province. The staunch Muslims of Indonesia's northern-most region are strongly independent. Even after decades of incessant warfare the Dutch had been unable to completely subjugate these Malay warriors. After independence the nationalist, Javanese-dominated government in Jakarta failed likewise.Lewis then takes us to East-Timor, ravaged by the Indonesian military after the Portuguese withdrawal in 1975. Although political developments since Lewis' visits have changed the outlook of East-Timor dramatically, his account provides an interesting insight into the political situation of the territory just before the collapse of the Suharto-regime and subsequent granting of autonomy to East-Timor.Finally the author visits the interior of Irian Jaya, the Indonesian-controlled half of New Guinea. A disconcerting portrayal of a traditional society on the verge of collapse is followed by a worrying report on the onslaught of greedy mining companies; Lewis makes us witnesses to an ecological disaster in the making.'An Empire of the East' does not reach the level of his earlier books 'A Dragon Apparent' and 'Golden Earth' about French Indochina and Burma respectively. Written in the 1950s these two giants of 20th century travel literature established Norman Lewis as one of the greatest travel writers. Nevertheless, he has again been successful in presenting a cocktail based on his well-tried recipe: combining his highly original depictions of natural scenery with insightful portraits of the people he meets, and - above all - his penchant for unusual situations."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"Come on, admit it, you always thought you knew exactly what caused the tides, and why the Bay of Fundy has such a large tidal range! Hah! You only thought you knew. Now, thanks to Dr. Jim McCully's easy to read treatise, you will soon be able to impress all of your friends with great knowledge. Who knows, you might win some trivia contest!No, seriously, this is a readable and witty explanation of all of the many factors that go into the tidal process. This book patiently explains why tides come and go, why some areas have more than two tides per day, and where the water goes when it goes. Dr. McCully is a knowledgeable researcher and an entertaining writer who makes all the physics and astronomy easy to understand. If you have curiosity about all things natural, if you are a yachtsman or woman, or if you love to fish (as does the author), you will find this book incredibly interesting and helpful."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"If you're interested in a mostly non-technical detailed description of the forces that influence tides, read this book. I had to work a bit beyond the level of effort I'm used to putting into bedtime reading to understand some of the concepts and some of the author's personal anecdotes are a bit distracting. However, as a layman non-oceanographer, I found Beyond the Moon really interesting. Did you know that the oceans oscillate like water in a big basin that has been bumped? I didn't. This is a treasure of a book that you'll pick up again after your next fishing or sailing trip to re-understand what was pushing the boat around."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"For those who are really interested in the tides, this is a good comprehensive discussion of the physical forces that cause the tides and the manifestations thereof. There is quite a bit of information packed in this book, ranging from very interesting to very obscure. While the technical explanations are generally quite good, the organization of the book can be quite frustrating in that the author builds up the process step by step without giving a summary at the front. You have to be dedicated to make it through 200 pages. IF the author tried to create a book for the general audience of natural history readers, then I think the book falls short because the heavy emphasis on harmonic analysis and a whole chapter on the 37 coefficients used by the government in calculating tidal predictions. On the other hand, I have read a lot of books on tides, and this does an admirable job in explaining the technical details. And, while I am not a fisherman, the author's discussion of the tides and fishing was the best I have ever read, clearly written by someone who knows and practices what he preaches."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"In the event one is interested in the how and why of the tides this is a good read. Even if you are not but enjoy a fuller awareness of the world around you it is still a good read. The first 4 chapters are the core of the subject and then he nicely digresses on specific tidal situation. Fun."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"The author strikes the right balance of story telling and technical detail. This book confirmed some things I learned years ago, explained some things I suspected or observed, and layered it in a way that was easy to assimilate. If you work on the water, and you want to go beyond the mechanical calculation of the tide, this book is the next logical step."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"An interesting and thorough study of the tide changes. Always thought it was the moon but after reading, have a solid understanding of the various factors that influence tidal movements, frequency, elevation extremes, etc. Some of the explanations get rather involved so appeal would be limited to those that really want to understand."},{"Title":"Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides","review":"The book is actually in good shape and arrived in a timely manner. My only issue is that one corner of the front cover and several pages are creased or bent. I am not sure if this happened in shipping or storage.An excellent book on tides though."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"This book is on the highest level of scholarship and aesthetic criticism, bringing together many facets of art, philosophy and literature that gave birth to de Chirico's great works. Paolo Baldacci is a brilliant and erudite writer and an expert on this important, original artist. I am very disappointed that this excellent work is now out of print. The reproductions are of the highest quality as well, and this is a book that should be on the shelf of everyone interested in surrealism."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"More than its many full-color and good-sized reproductions of the great artist's best paintings, this book also offers much fascinating text to illuminate the many influences that shaped the life and work of this supreme creator of enigmatic clarities."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"True surrealism is the most profound form of art because it tackles the absurdities and contradictions of our modern world and helps us to work them out through our Subconsciousness and dreams. The first time I saw an exhibition of de Chirico's works, I had extremely vivid and memorable dreams for a week after and felt &quot;cured.&quot;But like any religion that can deeply touch people, Surrealism, once it became famous also attracted its fair share of quacks and charlatans. This is why de Chirico is so important: In the same way that Patti Smith was 'punk' before Punk Rock was officially invented, de Chirico was a surrealist before the Surrealist Movement took conscious shape with Andre Breton's shrill &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism&quot; in 1924. De Chirico didn't jump on the bandwagon. He was pulling it!This worthy but pricey (therefore minus a couple of stars) book focuses on this early period when de Chirico was happily pursuing his own path into the twilight, undisturbed by the excessive fuss that the Surrealist movement and its showmen, like Dali, later whipped up.Paintings like &quot;The Endless Voyage&quot; (1914) show a jarring clutter of objects setting up intangible lines of tension, often with humorous results. In effect, his art works like the human brain, abstracting images and objects from their natural context and relocating them to the landscape of the mind and memory.Setting the stage with his deserted cityscapes painted with sharp contrasts of light and shadow, distorted perspectives, and a blurring of the border between interior and exterior, de Chirico evokes a haunting, ominous, but strangely relaxing dream world. This deep psychological aspect of his paintings has him constantly reinterpreting themes, leading to recurrent motifs. In these early paintings lavishly reproduced in this massive tome, he constantly uses statues as focal points, later replaced by his trademark faceless mannequins. Other mysterious objects further increase the element of enigma.De Chirico was a surrealist more by accident than design and his work relied less heavily on overt humor and shock than the more famous surrealists who followed him, like Dali and Magritte. De Chirico's focus was always on beauty and the creation of moods through an appeal to a deeper psychological language. For this reason, while much surrealist work has dated like an old joke, Chirico's art is still as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"This book is for those just discovering De Chirico, as well as those who have valued him for many years. The color reproductions are many and excellent. His various subjects are presented in developing groups; great idea. This painter was so honored in the heyday of surrealism; because he was the most original; the pioneer of a large sweeping mood of painting. You can read as much of the text as you wish; but don't be discouraged by the endless rambling of the author; he just didn't know when to stop. If you were not a De Chirico fan when you get this book, you will be when you own it."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"This book a great resource for people who are studying de Chirico--not only does it contain tons of illustrations, but it has provenance and condition information for all of de Chirico's Metaphysical paintings. This is especially useful if you want to know which paintings of his were owned by the Surrealists, who often re-titled his works.At the same time, however, this book is incredibly difficult to use. THERE IS NO INDEX. Why? I don't know, but I do know it's annoying. If I wanted to only know about de Chirico's relationship to Apollinaire, instead of just looking up the man's name in an index, I have to skim through the entire freaking book. aaaaaaaaaaargh. And let me tell you, Baldacci's \\"prose\\" is dry dry dry dry dry. Furthermore, when Baldacci is trying to cite something, instead of just giving the reader his sourse or spelling out his reasoning, he just tells you to look at a previous part of the book (but of course not where exactly one is supposed to look). Yay, now I have to skim through more of this freaking tome.Basically, this book is essential for people studying de Chirico, but I would not read it for entertainment."},{"Title":"DE CHIRICO: The Metaphysical Period","review":"excellent photos.a fascinating period, the pre-surrealist era. not much has beenpublished about de chirico's brother, alberto savinio, musician, poet, and painter, who contributed more to de chirico's development than commonly known.unfortunately this book is marred by poor organization and writing. after developing interesting thoughts, baldacci then admits that there is not evidence to support his suppositions...\\"probably\\", \\"if\\", \\"doubtless\\", \\"we can even imagine\\", and so on. i've read better papers by undergraduates. better writers would summarize where baldacci chooses to drag in long, diffuse quotations.baldacci is fascinated by unknowns about de chirico. much about the past may remain unknown, a fact of life."},{"Title":"Hair : Its Power and Meaning in Asian Cultures","review":"An awful atrocity of the literary genre.

That said, it has been a very helpful resource to me. The way that I have used the book is not strictly as a build guide but as a resource to fill in all of the stuff that the hardware manuals leave out. One very simple example came up when building a PC for my business recently. The manual for the motherboard said to connect the CD ROM drive to the secondary EIDE connector. The CD manual said to do the same but the drive came with the jumper settings set to Slave. This issue was not clearly explained in either manual. So, rather than take a guess and have to trouble shoot by trial and error, I looked it up in \\"Build Your Own PC\\" and both the settings and the reasons for those settings were explained. For my situation, with only a single CD on the secondary connector, the jumper should have been set to Master. I changed the jumper and proceeded. The way I use the book is as a place to turn to when the manuals are not sufficient. What that really means to a non-expert such as myself is that I don't have to open the case and start swapping cables and jumpers and components when there is a problem.I also refer to the book for general explanations and background on components, technologies and standards.

Most are either too specialized (case modding, fancy cooling solutions, etc) or too basic (pick a motherboard... pick a CPU... put them together... The end!), but this work is just right. It is very informative, even to someone who considers themselves a very experienced PC user, yet remains straightforward, and anticipated many common concerns. The only downside is that this type of book is out of date very soon after publication. This volume only covers Pentium 4 and Athlon 64 systems, but obviously doesn't include the new Socket 775 Core 2 Duo processors from Intel, or the socket AM2 Athlon X2 from AMD.

The illustrations are very helpful and informative. I had a general knowledge of computers but had never built one from scratch. This book is great for people that don't have much experience with computers because it explains everything in detail, describing all of the parts and has 3 different build configurations. Pretty much everything is covered between the 3 different build so that no matter what kind you will build, it will be covered in this book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I have to agree with other unflatering reviews. This book does not provide any of the detailed information required to build a PC. The four example systems built are redundant for the most part. There's virtually no troubleshooting information and no discussion of tradeoffs between the competing systems (price, performance, relaibility, etc.). The information that is provided is sometimes better explained in the associated product information.Again, I guess I was expecting more detail from this book, but I still don't think it's even appropriate for the beginner.Bottom line ... save your money and buy some some better parts for your PC system."},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"This is a good start for somebody who never build a PC before, and give you and idea on where to start and what to do.

The book demystifies the whole process of building a PC and you'll quickly realise that it isn't difficult or complicated at all; PC engineers beware!!!The first couple of chapters provide information on the components that make up a PC as well as educating you into making a more informed choice when buying components. Obviously it won't tell you about every single type of memory, motherboard etc out there but it gives you enough information to enable you to make the correct decisions, honestly by the end of chapter 2 you'll be extremely confident when purchasing compatible components.The next three chapters cover separate builds including a Pentium 4 and an AMD 64. Within these three chapters the author covers practically everything, so even if you're only building one type of system it still pays to read the other builds as well.The final couple of chapters cover installing an operating system, in this case Windows XP, and troubleshooting.Admittedly I did run into some problems that the book didn't cover, installing SATA controllers for example but this information is found within the motherboard manuals, and that's a point to note, the author does state that you'll need to check the manuals as well. The only down point about this book is that the photos are in black and white.All in all I was excited about the prospect of building my own PC; I've built an absolute stonker of one, and I wouldn't have been able to do it if it wasn't for this book.

Thanks Mr. Rosenthal"},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"Save your money! This book was a real disappointment. It illustrates, poorly, how to install the components. Most or all of the parts you will buy for your computer will do a better job of illustrating and explaining this. The photo illustrations are poor and the explanations even worse. If you're building your first computer, you will find yourself searching for alternative sources for help.It has no troubleshooting guide, so after its all said and done, and all of your parts are installed, if something doesn't work, you're left wondering what to do or who to call. He also does not explain what to expect after you finish building and hook up your monitor and power the machine up for the first time. If you have a blank monitor screen, you're left wondering what to do. No explanation here. The book jumps ahead to how to load an operating system, assuming all went well.I had to search for other sources and actually relied more on the various manufacturers' installation guides that come with their parts, than I did on this book.I feel as though I threw away my money on this book.

I would certainly recommend this book for newbies who want to get their feet wet into this exciting world of computer hardware."},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"You can't save any money building your own PC. In fact, you'll probably spend more than going down to WalMart or CostCo. But when you build your own, you know what you're getting.I want a system with a lot of disk performance and memory to do the jobs I ask of it. The only video I need is enough to get the operating system to load, and I usually don't even connect speakers. A heavy duty gamer needs lots more video power, and may want a sophisticated sound card as well. The WalMart/CostCo systems are designed to fit everybody, so they really fit only Mr. Average.The first thing I did when I got this new 4th Edition was turn to the chapter on building a system using the Athlon 64. Mr. rosenthal was right on the money. He ordered a cheap case, and then immediately replaced the cheap power supply with something heavier duty. He then used an Asus motherboard, again first rate, although (I think) more expensive than some others just as good but with a less valuable name.One minor complaint - I'd like to see some recommendations on brand names. What brand of Power Supply did he use - why? What about a reference list for mainboards, or a web site that would give recommendations? And while I'd hate to see him create a firestorm, how about an Intel/AMD comparison.Finally we need another addition. How do you build a dual processor Opteron? I can't afford one, but I'd like to dream. And of course there will need to be a sixth edition with the new dual processor cores that are coming."},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"As of the date of this review, the Third Edition is a terrific book. Absolutely right on. It covers everything you need to know to build your own ATX-form factor computer, with the possible exception of leads to the best online vendors.

It may be as much of a confidence booster as a &quot;how to&quot; book. PCs today are basically just assembly. Search the web for parts, etc to get the best prices, auctions aren't usually the best deals. Many dealers have online guides that will also help a great deal.I ended up building an AMD 1.2gig, 266FSB PC with almost no problem.

And quite amazingly, it is rather up to date. However, I only wish the author could spare a little ink on how to purchase different parts. After all, assembling all the parts together is not difficult at all, because it is no more than finding the right plugs and connect them (from our point of view, there is very little difference between a CD-ROM and a DVD-ROM). It is the hunting for the parts that get me (and probably a lot of other readers as well). Also the book goes something like this, &quot;it seems that the BIOS does recognize the CPU with correct speed... excellent, now let's get it over with...&quot; But what if something does go wrong? what if there is a hardware conflict, or what if some parts are defective? How would you tell which part is bad, and what the solution would be? Even a loose connection in the video card could seem to be a disaster to a beginner simply because he/she does not have the experiences to judge what and where the problems occur."},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"This is the best book of its kind I have read, and it describes fully what you need and what to do with the equipment..It's 5 star to me......"},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","review":"This book clearly guide throw the building process of a pentium or amd computer.

The book makes things simple, building a PC is not half as hard as it seems. The book is filled with photos, allowing you to see every process of assembling the computer. This book will teach you in normal language how to make a desktop or tower. Not to mention, this book was written recentely and includes PIII cpu's, AMD processors, and even DVD-ROM drives. However, to make your own computer following this book, you must be willing to specd at least $500.00. I highly recommend this book to any person, any age, who wants to make their own computer.

You have to refer to some background knowledge to understand some of the concepts and terminology, but by in large thats really not that big a problem if you're not prone to being easily frustrated.

It's maybe \\"PC Building For People Who Have Used Computers A Lot And Have Brains.\\" It has lots of photos, some highly informative overview chapters, three different step-by-step builds, and a final chapter explaining how to get from hardware to software by installing Windows and the appropriate drivers, etc. Even tells you what the most commonly made mistakes by novice builders are and how to avoid them.

This account, describing the lives of dozens of African Muslims in North America and elsewhere in the New World should serve as a catalyst for further study into the roots of the Muslim American experience. The less than perfect score is due less to the author's compilation, and more to the dearth of extant sources available for analysis. A more in depth study into the lives of existing Muslim communities in places like British Guyana and in Trinidad would likely yield a more comprehensive picture. The account is excellent, but it is by no means definitive, and much research remains to be conducted and codified."},{"Title":"African Muslims in Antebellum America: Transatlantic Stories and Spiritual Struggles","review":"It is about time that someone documented with accuracy the origins of some of the earliest Muslims in America.

The first two chapters are an overview the muslims and historical accounts. Chapters 3-9 concentrate on the lives of some of the most well known muslims and what others wrote about them.The reason why I didn't give this book five stars is because of the author's use of Ar-Rahman as if it is Ibrahim 'adurraHmaan's last name. In the muslim faith, it is blasphemous to refer to a person as Ar-RaHmaan or any of the other names of allah (god). This may seem like a small issue to most, but it is a very serious issue because the author is showing his ignorance of Islam and spreading ignorance among the readers who know little or nothing about Islam. The readers of this book will see the casual use of ar-Rahman and think that it's ok to use it for short 'adurraHmaan.

If you have the reflexes of a lab rat on huge quantities of caffeine you can do as the game requires, and the book reiterates.

The writing was so boring, or the writing style, or the subject, or all of the above, that I ended up not even caring about what happened to the character and had to force myself to finish the book to see what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a good feel for the character or for the lives of the other people in this book. It was so dull, all I remember is her having a lot of children and how her husband wasn't the nicest of people. Otherwise, I found my self reading the Wikipedia entry for Matilda, that was more interesting than this book was! I don't think I will try to read another book by this author again."},{"Title":"Wife to the bastard","review":"This is the story of Matilda of Flanders, wife to William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England. This is the second book I've read concerning both of these two very important people; the other beingBastard Kingby Jean Plaidy. I had to compare the two, and I find that while Lewis' book is a bit more detailed, it lacked in comparison to Plaidy for me.I'll start with what I don't like. I didn't like that through the whole book it seemed like Matilda was fed up with William from the get go. Though there isn't much on her I always was under the impression that Matilda did have some real sort of affection for William. Here I felt like she just tolerated him because she had to, like he was an annoying child who's loveable at the same time. Maybe it was because of how the book started off, which it didn't really have to, but it was annoying for me throughout the whole story. I felt like it detracted from it. I'll also say that I felt like her use of detail went into the monotonous also. I felt Lewis repeated herself quite a bit when it wasn't needed and dragged the book out longer than was necessary in some parts.Now on to what I liked. I did like that I got a better feel for their daily lives as opposed to Plaidy's novel. I felt like I got to know what it was really like living in Norman Normandy and England. I also like that I got to know their children Robert Curthouse, Richard and William Rufus(though, like Matilda, I detested him from jump street.)Overall this is a good book if you like more detail. I will say that I felt like there were a lot of typos in my copy, like it was a first draft in some places. I also was confused on some of the dates(though some of it is partially my fault.)

Joe X is about a mysterious man whose plane crashes in front of an \\"average guy\\" in his truck, at night, in a rural area. The guy takes Joe to the hospital, while becoming increasingly puzzled at the things Joe says on the way. At the hospital, in the bright light, he is surprised to see that Joe is much older than he had initially taken him for since Joe is so extremely fit and trim. Later visits to the hospital, bring our average guy to know Joe better, and Joe begins to explain his theory and practice of fitness. The specifics of the actual workout are included in an appendix at the end of the book with charts you can photocopy and use for yourself.I have just finished the book and have not had a chance to try the workout, and will get my husband to walk me through it since each exercise has specific instructions for body alignment and breathing, also there is timing involved. I don't think I can work through it very well initially by always having to refer to the book. I will also try to get my husband to read the book for himself.My motivation to exercise is pretty near zero, and my need for better fitness is very great. This book was written for people just like me. I am going to try the method and see how it works.Very interesting book.

If anything, the story may be TOO engaging. What I mean is there is some very interesting, maybe even break-thru concepts in the Joe X workout but readers my miss it because they're focussed on the story. I can see what the author is trying to do (make a dry topic interesting), but I was more interested in getting right to the point.Things I like about the Joe X workout: 1) the focus on breathing 2) going light on the weight resistence (far too much emphasis on increasing weight rapidly in most programs). 3) his technique of comparing exercises against one-another to determine which load to increase. 4) Life-long time frame point of view. Every other program preaches how fast you can advance and ignores the mental drugery of how hard it is to \\"maintain\\" a level of fitness.

I couldn't put Joe X down. I kept wanting to turn the page to learn what would happen next. It was so easy to relate my experience with exercise and lack of exercise to Joe X's philosophy. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be young at heart and enthusastic about getting up in the morning."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"A lot of books, for all they teach, are actually over-stated articles. But since books are more profitable, writers and publishers prefer them. So you wade through all those pages of a book, only to realize you've learned as much as could have been covered in a less time-consuming booklet. This is such a work. The author does offer a sensible program for getting in shape, but he cloaks it in a lame story. Is it worth the money? If it motivates you to get and keep in shape, yes. You may like it. I got awfully bored."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I don't care if he's married and older than dirt. He's a man's man... he's a WOMEN's man ... and he's a hunk!

Is it possible the old and eccentric town matriarch (and now business tycoon) was once an exploited blonde bombshell of the '50s? Hmmm ... could it be??If you can't tell, I loved this book. It's smart, it's slick, and it's wise. I loved the absurdity of the news blurbs that comes out of Hugh's clock radio when he wakes in the morning. Just like real life if you stop and think about it. As for you and your workouts, the author knows exactly what's in your head. No workout book has ever been so much fun. It starts off with a smoothly written and informative history of human's quest for life long fitness, then whammo, you're dropped into the \\"real\\" world. I probably missed some of the inuendo and inside jokes. I suspect the broader your life experience, the more you'll pick up.

He says the challenge is not physical but mental and he's EXACTLY right."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"This was one of the books recommended by critics of the book YOU ON A DIET. In comparison to YOU ON A DIET this book is poor indeed.The book is a story about a man who survives an aircraft crash and is helped by a local fellow who is in need of several life changes. The person in the aircraft (Joe X) proceeds to help his savior through several life changes including how to lose weight. The process can be applied to numerous areas of life it seems, but the weight loss aspect is stressed.What to do? Set up exercise routines that can't fail by establishing a routine of tiny but constant increases in the routine. You are ALWAYS making progress so you keep it up. Same for other problems encountered in life, business and marriage. Set up a program of making small but constant improvements and the net result is success. Because you see the progress every day and every week you do not give up.Ok, but where are the facts about the problems with being fat in the first place? Where is the analysis of the psychological problems people face or personality problems that impact weight? Not everyone is the same and people face different problems at different times in their lives. One solution doesn't fit all people. The weight problem is viewed in a dreadfully simplistic paradigm. The book just doesn't address the multifaceted issue of weight in our individual lives or in our culture. In essence the book still relies on will power to see the person through; it just makes the will power easier to hold onto because the individual sees consistent progress.Of course Joe X is successful in every area of life and loved by all around him. Why not? He is such a perfect person. Someone to emulate and extol in every aspect of life. Follow his benign example of perfection to glory. What about guys like me? Nothing to extol, a far cry from perfection and a fellow who struggles with things like getting up and putting on my socks correctly (not inside out). What about people with lives that are being crushed by society, their work, their lack of support from family and perhaps few or no friends? People do exist who are intimidated by a society that screams \\"thin or else\\", and the \\"or else\\" is rejection and outright discrimination by every joke teller and movie maker between here and Bollywood.I think people need more than a \\"feel good\\" book about someone who changes everything by their very presence. People need facts not theories about small progressions making their lives perfect over a period of time. Please don't misunderstand this review. Perhaps this approach will work for some, but I think most people will benefit far more from a more comprehensive look at dieting and weight loss (and gain) by people who are qualified MDs who know the science and the research behind weight loss or gain and can explain those things in everyday terms.Get YOU ON A DIET and arm yourself with medical facts about weight gain and investigate the psychological and physical facts about weight in our culture.AD2"},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"The writing will make you cringe -- it sounds like a high school student wrote it -- and \\"your\\" is several times spelled \\"you're\\", but it purports to give one an approach to working out that you won't get sick of and quit.

Joe X was the final straw. It's just too good a book to not comment on. I received it as a birthday gift last month and have just sent copies to my parents and our kids. It's a book about physical fitness, and lays out a good exercise program in detail, but its much more than that. It's a novel about a man living in a small town coming to grips with growing older and increasing job stress. By chance he meets up with a mysterious guy (Joe X) who helps him find \\"the correct path.\\" It's all done with a cast of characters, some outrageous, anyone can relate to from their own lives. It's written with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, irony, and sensitivity. More than once I burst out laughing, but there's also passages you may shed a tear over. My favorite passage is when Hugh, the main character, comes to realize:\\"The most important reason to not neglect your health and fitness has nothing to do with vanity or personal appearance. You should take care of your health and fitness for the sake of those around you, for those people that care about you, for the people that YOU care about, and for the betterment of society. It's a selfish thing to do, to neglect yourself and then die.\\"No truer words were ever spoken! If you only have time to read one book in the coming months, I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I'm a physical thearapist and amature athlete, so I take fitness seriously. This book is brilliant on multiple levels, but also so outside the box I'm surprised the publisher had the courage to print it. It breaks all the rules... and I'm very glad it does. Many more words than pictures. Mostly a story, not a cook-book. Zero self-aggrandizement. Hardcover, no color, rather retro. Most fitness books today differ only on the margins. Any one of them is about as useful as the other if it gets you out of your chair and into the gym or on the road. It's cookie-cutter books, just like cookie-cutter movies and cookie-cutter TV shows. As for the needs of society, they add little new to the discussion except for maybe the fitness purist. They don't actually move the needle. Joe X is the first book I've seen in a long time that actually has the potential of benefitting the larger population, not just the purist. How? By addressing head-on the real hurdle that other books conveniently sidestep: the mental side of fitness. Other books tell you how to get in shape, and they usually emphasize how fast their method works. Fine. What about being physically fit for 5 years, 25 years, 85 years? The early Yogis, Friedrich von Schiller, and Joeseph Pilates were all correct (you'll have to read the book's preface - it's great): \\"it is the mind itself that builds the body.\\" This is the stuff that Joe X addresses, not with psycho-babble but with a simple and smooth writing style that concludes with a workout routine that takes into account how our minds work. If you are of the Gameboy generation and want to save time you can jump right to the conclusion if you like, but you'll be missing a lot. The book is written to be read, maybe several times, and absorbed."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I'm another one of these baby-boomers that can't stick with a workout routine for very long, then feeling guilty and frustrated about it. That is until I was introduced to Joe X by a colleague. The Joe X workout is excellent. Since October I've been averaging 5 workouts a week, usually at home but sometimes at a club near my job. I've never been more consistent, and I feel great. As Joe X would say, \\"I'm moving forward again.\\"To an innocent bystander the Joe X workout looks ordinary, just some traditional exercises with dumbbells. But looks can be deceiving. As other reviewers have said, there's no pausing between sets and your motion is tightly synchronized to your breathing. You progress through a cycle of ten sessions that is laid out in such a way that your motivation increases as you approach the end of the cycle. You're not focused on how much weight you can horse up but which muscle group is being stressed the least, a simple but profound difference. I've gone through the cycle 6 or 7 times now and without fail that special motivation kicks in as I near the tenth session. It's uncanny, and it keeps me looking forward to working through the next cycle. I don't know if the Joe X routine will work for everyone but it's definitely working for me.Joe X is actually a fictional character, and two thirds of the book is a novel rich with life-meaningful philosophy as Joe coaches his \\"young\\" (40-50ish?) protege, Hugh Paterson. I found the story very entertaining and could personally relate to much of what Hugh was going through. If you've ever worked in a corporate environment you're going to really identify with the story. I wished it were longer."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"Joe X is such an enjoyable read and the fitness routine is amazingly liberating. I've been exercising in the morning for a little over two weeks, following the routine to the letter, and it is everything the author describes in the story. You finish with more energy than you started and look forward to the next session. I'm not exagerating. I've tried a lot of exercise programs and this is the first one that I can honestly say this about. All the exercises are conventional, but tightly scripted. You use light weights. You increase reps each session but you always do your workout in the same amount of time (aerobics and stretches included). Every ten sessions you drop the reps down and start over. There's a little more to it than this but the end result is you end up listening to your body big time. Weight of resistence is a non-issue. You increase resistance only one exercise per cycle and only by a small amount. I don't think its possible to understand this until you try it but the motivation you feel as you approach the end of the cycle is mind blowing! I just went through this this week and its real!! This isn't for body-builders because they are motivated by bulking up fast. Joe X is for people interested in life-long fitness... long time frame point of view. Joe X is very different but to me this is it in a nut shell: It's not the goal, baby, its the journey! And our lives are 80 some odd years long if we're lucky, not 12 weeks, which is how just about all the other programs are sold and not the real world."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I bought Joe X when it first came out in 2005 and started the workout shortly thereafter. I identified completely with the main characters (husband & wife) and was totally hooked. It's the best routine I've ever come across. I practiced the routine religiously for 18 months, the first time I'd ever been able to be so consistent after decades of sputtering starts, stops, even occasional injuries with other routines. The best thing: I felt great physically and mentally, and my middle age spread finally reversed course. But then I took a new job and due to extra long hours and high stress got out of the Joe X habit. I knew what was happening at the time (change can be hard!) but always believed when I was ready I could pick up the routine again quickly. I was wrong. I tried repeatedly to get back on the Joe X wagon, taking short-cuts, and kept failing. I really missed the feeling of being in control and \\"moving forward.\\" I finally made it though, and have been doing the workout 5 days a week for over six months again. I highly recommend this book, but for the benefit of other readers, here's my lessons learned:1. Though the Joe X story may come across as unusually quaint to some and the workout routine simplistic, don't be fooled. The messages and principles contained are profoundly on target and the details are more important than you think. (Like others have commented, I'm sick to death of the typical self-help fitness book. Yuck!)2. Really take to heart this concept, the book's main idea: fitness is not a physical challenge, it's a MENTAL challenge. Not physical work, but mental work. The Joe X workout and its moving forward concept is based on this principle. It's so true. If you think you can simply decide to work hard, buff-up, and maintain that beautiful bod for the long haul, then 99% of you are going to be disappointed. As Joe says, just look around you! What do you see? That's the snake oil the fitness industry is selling.3. When Joe says to figure out what weight you can lift comfortably, then start the program with HALF of that, believe him! (This is the key mistake I was making when I tried to get back on the wagon.) The principle of \\"moving forward\\" is 10 times more powerful than the weight lifted.4. Make yourself a set of \\"cheater-weights\\" using the instructions in the book or buy some kind of eqivalent. The publisher used to sell a kit but I understand they're sold out. I've made a couple of sets. It's not hard. Without them you'll likely increase weight too fast.5. The book stressed the importance of always performing the workout in exactly the same about of time. I didn't pay much attention to this in the beginning. Now I have a big round clock with a sweep second-hand on the wall in my workout area. I do my workout in 37 minutes flat. It would take me too long to explain way, but it's important. Focus attention on form and timing, not weight.Hope this helps some of the new Joe X'ers out there."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I love this book and the Moving Forward Method (MFM). I'm 46 years old and I have been working out for the past 20 years. I've tried just about everything to stay in shape. This is it for me - I am amazed at my level of motivation and the results."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I really appreciate how this book doesn't try and sell me something. I don't recall a single product endorsement or celebrity name-drop anywhere on the outside or inside. My impression is the author is sincerely trying to help his readers, period. This is so unusual for a fitness or diet book these days it's almost stunning. The closest to a product endorsement there is, the author thinks motorized treadmills are good (I agree). Don't be fooled though, even the brand name of the one mentioned in the story is make-believe...I checked.The book includes a detailed description of an exercise routine along with supporting charts and tables, but this information is more of an appendix. It's a little cryptic in places but not bad. The bulk of the book is a fictional story like no other, certainly not any self-help book I've ever read. The only way I can think to describe it is it's like Clive Cussler and James Patterson collaborated to rewrite Who Moved My Cheese, if you can imagine that! It reads very quickly and almost every chapter tends to have multiple levels of meaning. It seems even the book title has a double entendre. It's physical fitness for adults all right, but not in the chronological sense. It means to stop being manipulated by slick health and fitness salesmanship, and start thinking for ourselves and seeing the obvious.An awful lot of life-wisdom is packed into a few pages. (Along the way you might learn who the person was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas!) In case the reader misses any key points, the story concludes with an explicit listing of the important principles and recommendations to achieve life-long fitness. For example, one of the key principles introduced in the very beginning of the story is, almost Confucius-like, \\"take as long as possible to reach your fitness goals.\\" This is so contrary to the typical sales pitch that it tends to shock the reader into wanting to learn more. (The reason this might be good advice is based on how our minds respond to moving towards a goal versus achievement and maintaining a goal. The fundamental premise of Joe X is that life-long physical fitness is a mental challenge, not a physical challenge.)As for the fitness workout itself, I read or at least skim through about every book on the topic I come across, and the Joe X workout is both innovative and fundamentally sound at the same time. It combines warm-up, resistance exercise with dumbbells, aerobic, and stretching into a 37 minute daily routine. It's designed to be low impact and combines the best of both Eastern and Western lessons learned, that's the intent anyway. It's also very tightly scripted to leverage how our minds work to keep us motivated over the long haul, something most workout programs ignore (unless you look forward to 60 years of incessant preaching and loud music). A lot of people are going to like this part: its designed to eliminate the need for psyching yourself up or being in an adrenaline rush to do your workout, something the author believes in the long run is counter productive (think yoga). The author isn't wedded to particular exercises. He stresses that effective principles are more important than the specific exercises.While the workout routine is both gender and age neutral, because of the story content, Joe X seems to target men and women in their 40s or older, even much older. (It's never made clear how old the elusive and enigmatic Joe X is, but from the clues dropped he must be at least 80!)If you are particularly vain, anorexic, or way overweight and defensive about it, you might not care for this book, but I do recommend you read it. If you are a serious body-builder or athlete, this book isn't intended for you. If you like a lot of glossy photos of buff success stories, don't buy this book as there aren't any. If you believe in being physically fit but periodically get sick and tired of working out all the time (my category), you'll love this book. And if the last time you pulled on some gym shorts was 20 years ago, Joe X looks like a great way to get moving again.I've only just read the book and haven't started doing the workout. Plan to start next week and then report back in a month or two with an update. -SJB"},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I picked this book up as a gift for my husband from a hole-in-the-wall bookstore (sorry Amazon) while on a trip. The sales person suggested it. Judging by the impact on my husband, I must give it 5 stars! He's been working out a few minutes each day for over two weeks, and loves it. This from an over worked, overweight sales manager that hasn't been able to stick with a routine for more than about 2 days before losing interest. I'm reading Joe X now and about half way through. It's definitely not your typical self-help book. Like the description says, it starts with an overview of fitness exercise evolution and from trial and error over the centuries, what seems to work. Yoga, Tai Chi, Pilates, weightlifting, circuit training, cross training, intervals, aerobic, anaerobic are all discussed briefly. Its covered in just a few pages and is the best summary I've ever read about concepts and terms I always hear but not really sure where they came from. Then the book jumps into a fictional story about a husband and wife in a small midwestern town, along with a mysterious stranger named \\"Joe\\" that literally drops in after surviving an airplane crash. Its a very engaging story filled with interesting characters. My favorite so far is Maggy, a young gymnast-accountant that studies Sun Tzu's Art of War for tips on dealing with her incompetent boss (I'm not making this up- its a hoot!). The story seams to have multiple levels of meaning, but through it all Joe is instructing the main character on how to achieve life-long fitness. The author really knows what makes people tick. Among other things, he absolutely skewers manipulative infomercials. I've not got to it yet, but the last 50 or so pages summarizes the story's messages and details Joe's exercise routine which is a combination of resistance and aerobics training synchronized to your breathing, more meditative than adrenaline. Right now I'm more interested in finding out what happens to Maggy!"},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"This was an interesting and enhoyable read. The concept is to wrap an engaging story around a concept for long-term physical fitness.

Worth the money and very practical to put into practice."},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but dont go into it expecting your typical exercise/fitness approach.

A multitalented poet, painter and musician finding himself in a decade that encouraged the artist to invent cool new worlds. He portrays his many journeys and places in a newly published memoir \\"AsEverWas.\\"There are also darker worlds in Guthrie's life and soul. And their pain and despair get the same clear thorough treatment as the great highs and happeningsthat at the beginning, energized his path and pushed him forward.Hammond starts out in southern California. His mother abandons him. His father is sort of mixed up in the American Intelligence community and is distant. There is a second wife and Hammond actually chooses military high school over family life. The school is filled LA-Hollywood type uncared for rich kids and Guthrie learns about sex, drugs and rock n'roll.Moving on to San Francisco the author dodges the draft and provides us with one of the best in-print accounts of the method acting involved in pulling it off.Along the way, he encounters the Diggers, Bolinas, Allen Ginsberg, Carmen McRae, experimental film making, improve theater and the over dosed colorful world of San Francisco's fantastic hip. He also adds to the adventure by taking a beautiful bold wife.And then on to post-Beatles International Times William Burroughs London and he fully feasts on its experimental artistic community. And then to 'the dope is almost legal' Amsterdam with its Provos and houseboats. And Hammond the painter is discovered by Willem Sandberg, a great presiding maestro of the international art scene.Up to now the tale told in AsEverWas is filled with endlessly expanding light. The Sixties are nurturing the author, developing his multi faceted talents and preparing for a larger stage and an enthusiastic reception. He is about to become famous. And then (as it was with so many of us) the rug was pulled out from under our feet. Since we were off the ground for much of the time, it took us a while to notice the terrible turn, but it did hit all the more harshly for our tardiness.Hammond's wonderful wife and pal for life gets attracted to a hard core gang of dope smugglers and there is one in particular that stimulates her fantasies. The remainder of the memoir is an account of the destruction of the marriage and the almost complete spiritual dismemberment of Hammond Guthrie. He blames himself for his wife's alienation and gives up his art as a kind of punishment sacrifice, in order to make amends and win her back. The pair move on to Tangier for a fascinating, weirdly amusing telling of Hammond's efforts to spring his wife's lover from a Moroccan hell-house prison.It struck me that the end both of Hammond's marriage and his art does so much resemble the collapse of the whole Sixties with it's new found passion for criminality over creativity and for an inexplicable capacity not to see the tragedy of it all.What gets the reader through it and actually enthusiastic about the book is Guthrie's cool writing style. When he's describing the bitter, the sweet, Burroughs, Richie Havens, his wife, his father, Allen Ginsberg, a Dutch houseboat or a Moroccan cafe, the author is always generous in detail, ironic, gentle and insightful. You see, feel and understand the moods, people and places that shaped an extraordinary decade, even if its ending wasn't up to its promise.I took a different trip back then--more political and activist, Berkeley instead of San Francisco, Algeria rather than Morocco, it's more like Hammond was a very likable neighbor than a member of my commune. Yet pouring over his life and times teaches me much about my own.And that rarely happens. For its style and its lessons, Hammond Guthrie's memoir is a rare and important achievement."},{"Title":"AsEverWas: Memoirs of a Beat Survivor","review":"Remember Woody Allen's movie \\"Zelig\\" that places the chameleon-like Zelig in all the important places among all the major people of the history of the time? Insert \\"Hammond Guthrie\\" as Zelig in all these places from LA to London, from Amsterdam to Tangier and you'll get an idea of the scope of this memoir. In reviewing it, the temptation is to reel off lists of the famous people that the author has known. But one has only to glance at the well-appointed index to see the illustrious names. The spectrum of his contacts - artists, architects, cartoonists, writers, musicians, film-makers and even scientists - boggles the mind. He has a talent for schmooozing with people from diverse cultures and persuasions, famous and infamous. He can be the hipster extraordinaire in L.A, the proper gentleman in London, the cutting edge artiste in Amsterdam, as well as the flamboyant \\"European with two wives\\" in Tangier. His adventures there read like a page from Tennessee Williams' *Suddenly Last Summer* or Lawrence Durrell's *Alexandria Quartet* (but with a more engaging spin).Being all things to all people, he had his finger in every pie and his hand on the pulse of everything artistically innovative in the \`60s and early \`70s. In addition to being a painter, writer, musician and film-maker, he experimented with \\"...cinematic dissolve and juxtaposition of genre\\" in his \\"event rituals,\\" tone poems and overdubbed happenings.There are hilarious episodes, from getting a fake marine ID in Mexico to his elaborate and ultimately successful ruse to avoid the draft. Once he jumped out of a car he'd hitched a ride in when the driver told him it was stolen. He ditched the \\"supposed narcosi\\" the driver had given him behind the first bush he came to and \\"...to avoid the obvious, I ducked into the darkened courtyard of a quasi-subterranean establishment called the Fifth Estate...\\" where he met some people he would know for the rest of his life.I most enjoyed the odd little serendipitous scenes such as the time when,still in school, but working for the summer with his high school band buddies at a Lake near Tahoe, Hammond met three Angels who had descended on the town caf&eacute;, much to the perplexity of the waitress who made noises about closing at 9:30 a.m. When a smooth Latin voice intervened on his behalf, Hammond turned around to see \\"...three of the most ominous-looking human beings I had ever laid eyes on.\\" After inviting them politely (he \\"knew enough to be very polite) to his band's evening at the local lodge, one of them asked Hammond if he \\"...drank beer or smoked dope.\\" Says Guthrie, \\"I told him I certainly drank beer and had \`tripped out on LSD once,\\" but hadn't smoked any dope, which was the truth. (Never tell an Angel anything but the truth.\\") His \\"outlaw companions\\" cracked up at this. Then Hammond's benefactor handed him his \\"senior member of the Hell's Angels\\" club card saying that \\"...it might come in handy some day.\\" It was signed, \\"Zorro.\\"Two years later, Guthrie saw a news article that identified the three \\"modern-day gladiators\\" that he'd met in his youth. More years later, flat broke in Barstow, CA \\"...where tumbleweeds go to die...\\" a biker wearing Angel colors roared up and Guthrie's \\"speed-drenched brain\\" remembered Zorro's \\"well-worn wallet card.\\" He \\"...stumbled up beside the hairy behemoth\\" presented him with the card and asked politely for assistance. Whereupon, \\"...he sized me up for just a second, smiled as only an Angel from Hell can, and said, \\"Hop on little buddy and I'll take you anywhere in the country you want to go.\\"Or how about the time that Lawrence Ferlinghetti handed him the original hand-written pages of Jack Kerouac's *Scriptures of the Golden Eternity* or when Ginserg handed him a Tibetan Dorje and \\"...a numbing energy surged through my arm and my hand spasmed out in front of me like a humanoid dowser's wand!\\"Guthrie met with William Burroughs in London, who helped in publishing his *Belfast Insert* which was an experiment in \\"cut/up writing.\\" \\"Cut/up writing\\" explains the author, \\"is an extension of Tristan Tzara's early Dada prose taken to a painter's point of view and then reapplied to the written word. The resulting texts of combined structure and newly formed contents offer an unusual approach to the written space/time continuum.\\" (There is a picture of the cover of Belfast Insert in the very interesting photo section of the book).Of Emmett Grogan, Guthrie says: \\"I was especially enamored by his consciously plagiaristic use of Adolph Hitler's Mein Kamphian Diabologue at the Roundhouse in London, during the \\"Dialectics of Liberation\\" event, a counter-conference of hip dignitaries. At first he was vigorously applauded for his oration and then people cried out in staunch indignation when he revealed the origin of the words.\\"And although Guthrie's heartbreak at the loss of his wife to a drug smuggler was obviously real and excruciating, perhaps the subtext of his reaction was that the event served as an excuse NOT to take the plum of artistic success offered him by Willem Sandberg (his mentor and friend in Amsterdam) and limit himself to painting alone but to remain free and flexible.All these experiences are liberally laced with copious amounts of pharmacopoeia of every kind from grass and hash to hallucinogens to amphetamines so these pages are compressed life. Elegant as champagne and caviar, rich as eggnog and cheesecake, the memoir runs cinematic-like reels through the imagination. Since the author's life is not over yet (his book begins and ends with his decision to kill himself) it's fitting that the very last words on the last page are \\"to be continued.\\"One can only hope that the words mean just that and that in the fullness of time, we will be treated to the rest of the story.

Guthries memoir takes us from a not so humble start in a good military school for Americas most privileged children to a failed suicide attempt in later life. Guthrie did not survive anything he voluntarily dropped out of society after he took from it all the trimmings that most of the silent majority aspire to achieve.The same majority that he wants to buy his book to sustain his over extended hippy lifestyleThere is nothing exciting to be read here, it is not an extra-ordinary life like most biographies. But rather a series of tedious juvenile anecdotes typical of any American adolescent. The draft dodging chapter is mundane at best, but Guthrie tries to have us believe that he out smarted the system.This book typifies all that was wrong with the beat generation. Guthrie done nothing in some great locations. He associates himself with the heavyweights of that time but actually does nothing to help them with either their cause or philosophy.Guthrie like the rest of his generation basically just took what he could and put nothing back in return. This literary offering is another extension of that philosophy and serves only to demonstrate that the author, like the rest of his ilk is still on the take.Not a good book didn't enjoy it at all"},{"Title":"Ready-to-Run Delphi(r) 3.0 Algorithms","review":"I really wanted to like this book mainly because there has been nothing like it for Delphi. The algorithms hare handled competently enough and the breadth is all one could ask for in an introductory book. The code however is pretty bad. It shows that Mr Stephens converted it from Visual Basic and that he doesn't have enough Delphi knowledge (eg using / instead of div, integers are NOT 2 bytes). It isn't Ready-To-Run by any stretch of the imagination. There are some annoying lapses in the text as well (a nice chapter on hash tables but nothing about hash functions?). As far as I can tell no tech editing was done and it shows. Nice try."},{"Title":"Ready-to-Run Delphi(r) 3.0 Algorithms","review":"Having read excellent John Wiley books in the past, I had great expectations from Ready-to-Run Delphi 3.0 Algorithms. Unfortunately, this book is far from being a good book. First of all, the author, Rod Stephens, is not a Delphi programmer. He merely ported, or more precisely attempted to port, one of his previous Visual Basic books to Delphi. Several Delphi code listings contain code that is... Visual Basic code!Furthermore, the title is totally inappropriate: none of the supplied code is &quot;ready-to-run.&quot; In part because it contains too many errors, but more importantly because the sample code is too academic to be really useful in a real life application.Do not waste your money on this title."},{"Title":"Ready-to-Run Delphi(r) 3.0 Algorithms","review":"I own 20 Delphi books (I am the author of one of them), and this book is one of the select few that I come back to time and again.I was hoping someone would do a &quot;concise&quot;, Object Pascal-specific version of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, and here it is.The title is unfortunate, I think. It should be something like &quot;The Art of Delphi Programming&quot;; the material here is virtually timeless, not Delphi 3-specific.While there are minor lapses here and there (for example, a data type of &quot;string * 20&quot;, which won't compile in Delphi (it should be String[20])), that is a very minor problem.If you are a Delphi developer and need to learn about lists, trees, sorting algorithms, etc., search no further: this is the book you need.Clay Shannon"},{"Title":"Ready-to-Run Delphi(r) 3.0 Algorithms","review":"This book has an excellent collection of classic and modern computer science algorithms. Unlike many other similar books, Rod Stephens (the author) goes deep into every topic. For example, under &quot;searching&quot; most books write about why do we need searching, describe exhaustive searching, and then finish with binary search, saying &quot;look: we can search among 16 items with only 4 comparisons, - is that cool or what?!&quot; On the other hand, here is what &quot;Ready to Run Delphi 3.0 algorithms&quot; has under &quot;searching&quot;: exhaustive search, searching sorted lists, searching linked lists, binary search, interpolation search, string data, hunting and searching, binary hunt and search, interpolative hunt and search. The chapters are Fundamental Concepts, Lists, Stacks and Queues, Arrays, Recursion, Trees, Balanced Trees, Decision Trees, Sorting, Searching, Hashing, Network Algorithms, and OO Techniques. I gave 4 out of 5 rating because although there is a lot of stuff in there, some important algorithms are missing. Minimax discussion is not followed by alpha-beta pruning.

It covers all the common programming problems such as searching, sorting, stacks, ques etc. Although the book says it is for Delphi 3, the code is generic and would work equally on later versions. I have yet to use some of the code in my own programs but I found some of his thoughts interesting, especially recursion eg. most books would use it for binary searches or factorials but as he states it would run much more efficiently by placing it in a simple loop!, a fact that most other discussions fail to recognise. He points out that while one approach may be suitable for some problems you should realise that sometimes what is a 'less efficient' approach may be better eg. don't use hashing or binary searches on short lists, exhaustive is better.

A resident of Charleston, South Carolina, DuBose Heyward observed the black underclass of the city and in 1925 published PORGY.The novel was both a popular and critical success, but then as now many note that Heyward was writing from the outside: although his observation was acute, and although his portraits were generally both positive and sympathetic, Heyward was a white man. Given the social climate of the era, he was therefore not fully privy to the culture he scrutinized, and in consequence many have considered PORGY well-intended but intrinsically flawed and somewhat patronizing.The title character of the novel is a crippled black man who lives in a slum named Catfish Row in the \\"Negro Quarters\\" of 1920s Charleston. Heyward paints the slum in colorful terms; no less so are the characters. Unable to work, Porgy exists as a beggar, using a goat cart to travel the area, and so pitiful is his physical condition that his earnings allow him enough for his room, his food, and the occasional crap game. At one such game a stevedore named Crown murders a fellow player--and in time Crown's woman, Bess, stumbles destitute into Catfish Row and Porgy takes her in.Most readers of PORGY are likely to come to the novel from the celebrated opera PORGY AND BESS and will be quite surprised to discover that while Bess does indeed figure in the novel, neither she nor her romance with Porgy forms the focus of the book. In 1927 Heyward and wife Dorothy adapted the novel to the stage and substantially altered the plot, and it was this play, not the book, which so captured the imagination of George Gershwin. The novel is quite different and the conclusion is bathed in pathos rather than optimism.Although it is indeed flawed by its \\"looking from the outside in\\" status, PORGY deserves more attention from the reading public than it presently receives. In a very real sense, the book opened the door to literature--by both white and black writers--about the African-American community, and thereafter the subject would become increasingly mainstream. It also captures many of the customs of the culture it observes which would have otherwise gone unrecorded. Historical significance aside, it also remains a touching work, filled with memorable characters, graced with Heyward's poetic turn of phrase, and intriguing in its effort to catch the Gullah-inflected accents of the 1920s South Carolina Africa-American community. Recommended, particularly to those interested in how \\"white\\" America perceived \\"black\\" America in the early 20th Century.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Porgy","review":"I just finished reading this. Its considerably different from the play and film, but I enjoyed it.Since I'm a Black person who grew up in Charleston, I'm very familiar with the culture that spawned Porgy and bess. This book is DuBose Heyward's original story that led to the plays and film. Based on the real life beggar Samuel Smalls (whose story is told in detail in Damon Fordham's \\"True Stories of Black South Carolina), Heyward was very good at observing the Black culture of Charleston for a white man of his time.The Gullah speech is recorded phonetically and accurately, which is a difficult task since it is more tonal and does not usually translate well into print. he also adds lesser known aspects of Black Charleston such as the Mosquito Fleet fishermen and the Jenkins Orphanage Jazz band. The type of flamboyant parade he describes in one scene still occur in Charleston's Black neighborhoods on Martin Luther King day and New year's/Emanciation day.The order of some of the more famous sequences differs, as does the ending. More time is spent on sctual conversation between Porgy and Bess, and Sportin' Life is a lesser character in the book. There is also more interaction with White characters in the book which makes the racial aspects of the era more clear. The book is more a series of anecdotes than a linear story as is the play and film versions.If you've heard the score or seen the movie, you'll enjoy this book. Those unfamiliar with Gullah may find the dialect difficult, but accurate.Overall, a good little piece of social history."},{"Title":"Porgy","review":"Porgy is a classic tale well known to most. I purchased the book with mixed emotions. One part of me was apprehensive about an Anglo-Saxon's interpretation of one \\"segment\\" of the black community is the early 1900s. Another part of me wanted to know the full story that has captured the hearts and minds of so many people of various backgrounds, as long as I can remember. Needless to say, I'm very glad I read the book.Given the popularity of this story, I'm not compelled to analyze any aspect of it. I will just suggest that you read it for yourself. The book is short, sweet, and full of life. By the time you get to the end, Porgy and Bess will have softened your heart and made you glad for investing the time. However, be mindful that the book only depicts one segment of the community...by no means does Porgy reflect the experiences and struggles of all, or even most, of Charlestown's early 20th century \\"Negro\\" society."},{"Title":"Porgy","review":"This is the book that the musical, \\"Porgy and Bess' was based on....and it doesn't disappoint.We had recently seen the Broadway \\"Version,\\" and since it was so truncated, i had a burning desire to read the BOOK.However, the prices were prohibative!!!!

This means every page of the book is useful to the alto sax player, unlike some books where music for other instruments takes up large portions of the book.Second, Strommen has created arrangements that have the \\"basic\\" melody in the first half of the song followed by melodic riffs/alto sax solos in the second half. The arrangements are targeted for alto sax and are put together to get a full and interesting sound. This allows a novice or intermediate player to sound like a \\"real\\" saxophonist instead of someone who is stuggling through a barren and uninteresting melodic line.Third, the accompanying CD is excellent. Even numbered tracks have a trio made up of percussion, piano and a REAL alto sax. (This is compared to many other CDs which have the piano or bells playing the sax part.) Odd numbered tracks leave out the sax so you can play along. In all tracks the piano and the percussion are arranged to support the sax so again you really feel and sound like a saxophonist.Strommen has three books that I know of that are all produced in the same style--a movies book, a Gershwin book and a Christmas book. They are all excellent in my humble opinion. If you are looking for an alto sax book that has sound musical values, is playable by a novice/intermediate player, and will make you sound AWESOME then these are the books for you!"},{"Title":"Pamphlet Architecture 14: Mosquitoes","review":"This little book is exactly why I keep buying the Pamphlet Architecture series. In manifesto-like directness, K/K R&amp;D stab at the heart of politics, culture and the traditional establishment of Architecture. The work presented is not peripheral; it is clearly at the center of where the understanding of Architecture should be at this stage of societal development. But, unlike the canonical manifestoes, it stays away from rhetorically utopian statements. The words are honest, brutal and unforgiving- and so is the architecture which it describes. This work finally reconciles the practice of architecture with the dystopic world views of Zamyatin, Kafka and Orwell. More of K/K R&amp;D's work can be found in Pamphlet Architecture No. 12, Building: Machines. It is not for the light-hearted or those seeking a model career as a well-dressed architect.

Thought to be the work of the serial \\"Campus Killer\\" Mercedes works with her fellow officers to track down the killer. When a suspect is found, who rambles that Allah told him to kill the evil women, she finds evidence that someone else killed her niece. As her life begins to fall apart, Mercedes takes a medical leave to look for \\"the real killer\\"Midway through the novel, the author reveals ... the killer .... Through the narrative, we finds what drives him to kill. Not satisfied that he has escaped detection, the murderer's ego needs to have someone to document his murders and thinking. He kidnaps a Florida co-ed who he nicknames Boswell and brutualizes and tortures her until she is brainwashed and frightened to displease him or try to escape.Barren picks up Jeffries' trail, finding his psychiatrist brother along the way and enlisting him in the chase.The unique aspect of this novel was the mind control the killer had over his kidnapped victim, so much so she could not ask a state trooper for help when she saw him. He lectures her on his experiences and takes her on a \\"sentimental journey\\" of childhood sites and murders that meant a lot to him....My advice to you if you have not read any of Katzenbach's work, is to try a more recent work, such as the Analyst. While the Traveler is a suspenseful story, it lacks the fast pace, character development and satisfying ending of his later works."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I've read a lot of books in this genre.

Great for anyone interested in the workings of the performing arts."},{"Title":"It's Not All Song and Dance: A Life Behind the Scenes in the Performing Arts","review":"Gershunoff is a keen observer of character and an excellent judge of artistic quality. This book describes the good, the bad and the ugly in artistic life. The author looks behind the headlines. He gives us a true sense of what it was like to live as a person and as an artist in various parts of the world during the period 1940-80. Because politics played a huge role in the arts (and still does, for that matter!), he has some not-so-flattering things to say about powerful politicians as well as about Isaac Stern and the extremely aggressive way in which he promoted some of his proteges who might not really have been ready for prime time. Stern's constant political machinations also cut into his practice time and affected his own performance quality. And who could ever forget the major hype surrounding the Panovs? Well, here's the real scoop. Want to know how Soviet artists lived during that period? Gershunoff can--and does--tell you, in painful detail. It wasn't pretty.

First, it is one of the rare books in approximation theory that covers complex analytic functions. Second, the selection and presentation of the material is unusually clear and full of useful examples. The author balances the level of generality against the usefulness of the result. In other words, he avoids the trap of stating the result in such a high level of generality that the usefulness of the result is completely obscured. Another good book in this area at a slightly higher level of difficulty is &quot;Theory of Approximation&quot; by Achieser. This book is suitable for self study by a graduate student in the first year or a very advanced undergraduate."},{"Title":"Interpolation and Approximation.","review":"I think that this is book is too difficult for all but the most elite of undergraduate students (i.e., Ivy League, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and so on). I think also that pure mathematicians at most second rate grad schools will find the book challenging to too difficult. And the reason is that he assumes a lot of familiarity with functional analysis and advanced complex analysis that usually only comes from a master's in math. In fact, I think that a master's in math or its equivalent is a good pre-requisite for being able to follow most of the book.I am currently a grad student in math, and I love numerical analysis and am doing well in it, but my class is mostly algorithms like the QR algorithm and matrix decomposition. There is not even a master's class in my program that is offered that would quality as a necessary prerequisite for this book - i.e., functional analysis is not offered in my program, and this I think is only one of the prerequisites for this book.I don't have a problem with his writing style, presentation, or use of examples, as far as I can understand the book. I just think that a master's from a good school or equivalent math experience is necessary to follow his arguments."},{"Title":"Time and Eternity","review":"Based on a sample of one, this book is a fascinating challenge for those who are professionals in science (pure or applied), who also have a dilettante's interest in theology and philosophy, and who might enjoy reading random chapters of a book as much as reading it sequentially.A symmetrical extrapolation of the above leads one to surmise that the book is equally interesting for professionals in philosophy and theology who have more than a passing acquaintance with physics and mathematics, independent of their reading patterns.The author herself appears to have more in common with the latter group. Antje Jackel&eacute;n is Bishop of Lund in the Church of Sweden. The book is translated from the German, and is based on her 1999 doctoral thesis at the University of Lund. Between departing Lund with her new doctorate and returning as Bishop in 2007, Jackel&eacute;n was for a time on the faculty of Religion and Science at the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago.In an attempt to bridge the apparent gulf between theology and science, Jackel&eacute;n chooses to treat a specific topic rather than comparing the gestalten of the two schools of thought. The topic she chooses is the fascinating concept of time.Time - - the mysterious flux which sweeps us all along toward we know not what. What we know not is the nature of the absence of time, Jackel&eacute;n's \\"Other\\" of time, the \\"eternity\\". In most differential equations written to describe and model the real world, the independent variable is time. With computers today we can explore different rates of time flow, we can even reverse its flow in our models, but those accomplishments do little to advance our basic understanding of time itself.Jackel&eacute;n ranges far and wide in her considerations of time and eternity. She explores and explains eschatology as the \\"core of a theology of time\\", based in part on concepts from a 1927 Paul Tillich document on \\"Eschatology and History\\". She suggests that a God-related space-time line can be represented by a vector in the plane of complex numbers. (The fact that complex numbers have imaginary components seems to raise no irony.)Among other sections of the book which stimulate heretofore unencountered notions for this reader, a favorite is that titled \\"Time and the Quantum World\\", which has as one of its observations that quantum physics shares with psychology \\"constant difficulties in identifying objective content\\". (Perhaps in that characteristic, theology would fit well also.)The diversity of this book is perhaps no better illustrated, however, than by the chapter found most intriguing by this reader, the treatment of the lyrics of hymns as evidence of time and eternity, based on the idea advanced by French hermeneutic phenomenologist Paul Ricouer that time has meaning only when it is narrated. Jackel&eacute;n analyzed some 3000 hymns, finding in them over 3500 references to time. \\"Amazing Grace\\", with its explicit reference to time and implicit reference to eternity (infinity + 10,000 = infinity), was not specifically mentioned, a disappointment of sorts.\\"Time & Eternity\\" is recommended as a constantly stimulating and often surprising collection of ideas about time and eternity, prepared by a scholar. As with any successful dissertation, it closes with ideas for further thought and study. Unlike most dissertations, it provides many such ideas on its interior pages."},{"Title":"Letters to Milena; (Corgi modern reading, XL 6771)","review":"These letters written by Franz Kafka to Milena comprise my most loved Kafka letters. Writing to Felice, his former fianc&eacute;e, he was less mature - could he be said to have been less himself? In 'Letters to Milena' he asks at one point (I paraphrase) 'Is it you I really love or the existence that you give to me?' Couldn't any of us ask this question of the person we really love and of ourselves when we really love? I think Milena, whom his biographers considered a far more fitting companion for Kafka than Felice; Milena who in Berlin, years younger than the ageless Franz, living desperately and often pennilessly with her loved hurtful husband (who frequently withheld money from her, so that at one point she worked as a railway porter) - this woman who 'lived her life down to the depths' and who was a writer in her own right - really did give Kafka existence in the years they wrote and too infrequently met. She did not let the nervous, procrastinating and intensely self referential Kafka hide from her - which may be part of why he loved her - and when he is finally prevailed upon to visit her, deliciously drolly reassuring her that if he does get onto a train he will likely as not get off it at the right stop, she does not wait until they each arrive at the much discussed meeting point to actually meet him, but goes unflinchingly to his hotel, cutting off Kafka's apprehensions, making everything in their meeting easy, amicable and precious to him.'If only it were possible to go to Berlin, to become independent, to live from one day to the next, even to go hungry, but to let all one's strength pour forth instead of husbanding it here, or rather - instead of one's turning aside into nothingness!' Kafka wrote in his diaries in 1914 whilst still engaged to Felice. Milena, for a little while, allowed him to feel he was living, the tragedy was that concurrently Kafka's terrible illness was progressing, depriving him of time and physical energy. He was a man who needed so much time, and who had so painfully little, but, notwithstanding his not infrequent sensation of 'turning aside into nothingness', Kafka lived, he lived his whole life as few, very few, ever do, these letters are a testimony to his intense aliveness and to his genius as a writer. I envy Milena, even though she knew eventually she could not leave her husband for Kafka, she was still the woman who received the treasure of these letters. And yet - a reader has to, bewildered, witness and realize the inevitability and sadness of the eventual cessation of Kafka and Milena's communication, witness Kafka poignantly losing his plans for their future and the idea that Milena can live with him, witness both withdrawing and both mourning.'M was here', Kafka wrote (again in his diaries, 8th May 1922, when he was more or less housebound with his illness) 'won't come again; probably wise and right in this, yet there is perhaps still a possibility whose locked door we both are guarding lest we open it, for it will not open of itself.'I treasure this book. I've read and reread it so that the pages are all dog-eared, falling out and closely annotated all over. To anyone who finds themselves drawn to Kafka I'd say get your hands on a copy or two."},{"Title":"Letters to Milena; (Corgi modern reading, XL 6771)","review":"These are Kafka's best letters .

Great geek reading!"},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"If you want to know why Bill Gates is a rich geek and the authors of this book are only geeks, go ahead and buy it and try it. The installation instructions are incomplete and confusing. I ended up OVERWRITING AN ENTIRE HARD DRIVE, losing all the information! To subtitle this mess &quot;Configuration and Installation&quot; this is nothing short of false advertising. Shame on you guys! I don't know why the Linux and Unix people are unable to explain things clearly. I suspect that's they don't write code much better than they write English, and that's why so much software doesn't work too well. Of course, being lost-in-a-Jolt-Cola-buzz geeks, the author DO recommend that YOU GO OUT AND ASSEMBLE A SYSTEM JUST FOR LINUX! OK for the technoids, but not for the mere mortal. Some other reviewers give this book a 9, so decide for yourself if you want to risk your money. For the .5%, this may be a good book - for the rest of us 99.5% type &quot;Linux&quot; in the amazon.com search form and try another book."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"This book is very useful as a reference, which should be used with additional information sources on Linux. The guidance on setting up the Linux operating system discards alternative ways on doing so by mentioning other techniques in passing. For example it mentions that you can install using your hardrive as the source for the installation, but fails to mention the directory that needs to be copied to the hard drive. This confirms their singular approach of installation using the CD-Rom I think that the authors assumed that persons who purchased this book are very familiar with Linux and should have no throuble with the installation. The assumption should be that individuals purchasing this book are installing Linux for the first time; this premise will ensure that there is enough handholding to guide them through. The only chapter that incorporated this approach was chapter3 &quot; Installing and Configuring XFree86&quot;. I found it rather helpful to use this book in conjunction with the QUE book &quot; Using LINUX (Third Edition) by Jack Tackett Jr. and David Gunter&quot;.

The depth it goes into on setting up Xfree86 and the touching on shell programming is awesome. The cd's were also a lifesaver and a resource to get software without searching all over the net. Id reccommend this book to any linux newbie."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"If you're looking for a guide to Linux and a distribution that will work on an older computer with very little hard drive space, and only need to play around with it and not do anything terribly useful, then this may be the book for you. Otherwise, I suggest you look elsewhere.While this may have been a helpful book at one time, this distribution is now very out of date. As the book focuses on the Slackware distribution included, it may or may not pertain to newer Slackware distributions or other distributions. The book includes the Slackware 3.3 distribution on a single CD.I purchased this book as it was recommeneded as one of the few ways to get Linux on an old 486 laptop. I had no previous experience with Linux, but with this book and some helpful websites I was able to install it to the laptop. The laptop only had a floppy drive, requiring a floppy installation (about 2.5 hours). While I did learn much about Linux in this process, I didn't really make the computer much more useful than when it had Windows 3.1 installed (for my limited needs). I'm giving two stars because it did assist me in installing Linux.Summary: The book and distribution are now out of date. The book does not necessarily stand on its own in guiding installation. Not recommended as an introduction to Linux as there MUST be better books out there now."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"This book covers exactly what its name says it does. It is an in-depth tutorial and discussion of configuration and installation concerns with regard to the Slackware Linux operating system. Period. It doesn't cover commands or the X Window system to any great extent, but then again, it never claims to do so. It does provide a thorough examination of Linux installation. After reading this book (OK, after reading the first couple of chapters), I was able to install Linux with no problems on my home PC. I am still looking for a good command reference manual so that I'll be able to become proficient with this operating system. All in all, this is a great book as far as it goes."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"At first I found this book very daunting, technically oriented, and not very newbie friendly. However, I found that if I re-read the chapters on installation and config before I touched my computer, it started to make more and more sense. This is an excellent book for those with a bit of computer experience (I would not recommend this to those who are quite new to computers and OSes). Following installation it is gives a quick overview of Linux functions and programs which should get the average person up and running."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"The book does not teach you how install Linux step by step. per se .But guides you through an installation process. It has some useful sections, that will help &quot;guide&quot; the intermediate to advanced Linux user on installaing and configuring Linux. I found the 2-CD set packed with usable sofware. So the purchase price alone was worth it. If you are a novice at Linux installation, then this is not the book for you. However if you have at least some minimal experience with Linux setup , you'll find enough useful tips to get you up and running with minimal fuss.If you look closely you find a few glitches, but not many. I've installed other good Linux distrubtions and they were more error prone than this one. The CD installation has some automated tools to help make the steup and install process less of an anoyance. So kudos, a better than average guide."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"This is the book for those people who want to install a linux into their system. The book dealed only with the installation and configuration, but it's not so comprehensive. More details should be included. The 2CDs contained a pretty good distribution of linux, worth to try it out."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"This was the first Linux gook I bought. And although I learned some lessons from it, I wouldn't recommend it to the absolute beginner.This book doesn't communicate with the reader well. I had to look back and forth for answers to my questions and only now(8 months later + 2 other linux books bought) begin to realize what I am doing.Slackware is designed for people that are somewhat familiar with Linux/Unix, which most people are not. Knowing that, they should have been very careful in explaining things to users, which they were not.In fairness, most Linux books emphasize what to do after Linux is installed, but the hardest part about Linux is getting past the beginning(install, kernel config, X, installing devices). Most books mention the beginning aspects so far apart that it easily confuses and discourages new users.This book may be okay if you have a companion book on it(Linux for Dummies or TY Linux in 24 Hours), but don't expect overnight success with! ! linux using this book by itself."},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"This is the book that cleared a *LOT* of confusions I had about Linux. I'm not sure if this book would be that helpful for absolute beginners. By the time I came across this book, I already had floppy installed Slackware running on my computer. But if you have previous UNIX user (non-root) experience and want to be a Linux root to set up your system, this book would be a sure and quick way to get you way ahead. Persoanlly, a big thank you to Mr. Volkerding!"},{"Title":"LINUX Configuration and Installation","review":"The software provided with the book is where the good things I have to say stop. Applications and the LINUX distribution were arranged exceptionally. The book itself seems to be an example of a quick new edition to make a quick buc k, while sacrificing editing. Many commands referenced in the procedures were incorrect. Even though the CD included distribution 3.3 the text referenced previous versions. My favorite overused phrase was &quot;most users&quot;. Everytime he said this I cringed. Vague references were made to alternative procedure s based on setup, configuration and hardware then details were provided for the &quot;most common method&quot;. I don't know how Mr. Volkerding determined who &quot;most users&quot; were, but not one time could I be included in that group. Some details of the book (XFree 86 configuration and system administration) we re sharp, but I have to give it an enthusiastic thumbs down.

Perhaps more so than ever before in our history, we're asking important questions and desire to strengthen our relationship with the creative force of life.This book was a comfort to me recently during the anniversary of 9/11. I turned off my television and hungrily dug in. My appetite for understanding was well satisfied. The stories expressed by men, women, children, teens, older folks, a death row inmate, an agnostic, and people of many faiths, occupations, economic and educational backgrounds, reassured me that I am not alone in my longing.Some of the interviewees have clearly struggled with their understanding of the Divine; I found the sincerity of their stories, their courage and the intensity of their questions equally enlightening, and I took a moment to appreciate my own hard-won sense of faith.Ms. Cromwell's personal story charmed me from page one. She is funny and warm. On occasion, her words were tough for me to read. They reminded me of my own feelings of awkwardness and alienation as a child, and an early disillusionment with church going. Most of all, I saw my own life mirrored in her questions regarding romantic relationships and her commitment to her integrity. I am heartened by the strength and courage that clearly guides her well along her path.Two interviews in particular captured my attention.Abdullah, the Muslim Sufi and mystic speaks of the beauty of his faith and expresses sadness and frustration with those who distort Mohammad's vision by creating violence and terror in the world. Read this book if you're interested in receiving an education regarding the much underreported, positive side of this rich, ancient path to God. Abdullah's kindness, wisdom and grace brought me much hope and a sense of peace.It is the Cherokee Medicine Woman Jasmine Hishaw's words in the final chapter that remain with me most strongly. This is the chapter that sold me on the book. Ms. Hishaw teaches about the structure of the Universe, organized religion, the New Age movement, human sexuality, the Creative Force as expressed through Divine Father and Earth Mother, and many other topics of interest to us today. You won't want to miss out on this one. Her words are filled with humbleness, humor and a wonderful wildness. Her message is so simple that I trust it.This book will appeal to open minded human beings, truth seekers of all faiths, and individuals who hear the urgent call to help bridge our differences and work to bring in understanding and acceptance among all peoples of the world.We need more positive books like this one - keep up the good work Ms. Cromwell. I look forward to your next one!"},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"This book provides a glimpse into the diversity of the human interpretation of God and how it affects the lives of those who agreed to share their beliefs with the author. For me it was interesting to see the personality differences between people who believe God is outside of them vs. inside of them vs. non existent and how these beliefs play into their life experience.Some people want to ask God for more favors and some simply want to thank God over and over for their lives and loved ones. Some want to give \\"God\\" a piece of their mind and some do not even want to bother with the question or the concept.The Author does a wonderful job of interviewing. I felt almost as if I were hearing the conversation first hand which kept me interested to the point of wishing that the conversation would not have to come to an end. Her commentary on the interviews was like reading a diary which added another level of reality to the reading.If you like to delve into the depths of the minds of many, you will enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"The plight of the homeless, beyond the obvious poverty, is gross disenfranchisement. They are cut off not only from the mainstream but from all other streams. They are deprived of any meaningful dialog because they have no voice in our society, but worse they also do not have society's ear. The same can be said for meaningful open discussions of individual beliefs. Crowded out by organized religions and individuals who tell you what to believe, there is seemingly no open earnest ear or forum for this important discourse. Even the bible, through my own limited review, reveals more asking and being directed rather than true dialog with god.Mare Cromwell in her book has shown herself to be an open engaging individual whose interviews provide a warm comfortable place that allows for this essential dialog. Like the new friends in \\"The Summer of 42\\", who seal their growing friendship by revealing secrets about themselves, Mare earns the confidence of her interviewees and readers by revealing her own beliefs and concerns to us. Through the careful interjection of her own thoughts amongst the interviews, she has shown her path to an open dialog with nature, mankind and ultimately God. The lesson of her book is to keep your ears open, while seeking out and following your own path."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"I just finished this book and think it is great. Motivated by a personal quest for a deeper understanding of the spiritual side of life, the author has conducted a series of interviews with ordinary people that shows the quest is present with most all of us.I liked the book's organization into \\"interview\\" chapters, things that stood by themselves. I would find that I would read an interview at a time and then reflect on what I had read. I also liked the variety of interviews ranging from an eight-year-old girl to an eighty-year-old woman reflecting on her life to a convict on death row. I found myself pulled to these interviews in the same way that I was pulled to Neale Walsch's \\"Conversations with God\\". As different as the interviews were I was struck by a common theme through most of them - if God is real and good, how can He allow bad things to happen? The best answer to this came in the last interview with a Native American who brought a wisdom and clarity that reinforces my profound respect for indigenous cultures.This book is obviously a work of passion by a woman where the result it self seems to represent the thing that motivated her to do it - to seek out and find a true connection with God."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"I could not resist writing a review of this book in order to encourage others to read it. Mare Cromwell does a superb job of bringing poignant issues to light. I laughed, I cried and I totally embraced and identified with the interviewees insight and personal struggles that all of us confront. Thank you, Mare, for your candidness about your own path and for all the hard work it took to bring this work of art to fruition."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"... a rare combination for a spiritual book. Ms. Cromwell chronicles the literal response to the question, \\"If I Gave You God's Phone Number\\" then adds her own non-judgmental views of her respondents' insights. These reflections of her own, along with her own letters to God and Earth Mother that she inserts throughout the book, give the reader a book-within-a-book as we watch her struggle and finally find her own personal phone number to God. Her selection of interview candidates are fascinating and across the board - children, a death-row murderer, a Muslim and an evangelical Christian to list just a few - all get equal time, respect and honor for their private revelations. This book would make a great gift to anyone searching for a private and personal connection to a higher power."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started to read. Her nonjudgmental stance toward religion in general is amazing (unlike with fundamentalists of religions such as Christians and Muslims), and she does a marvelous job of conveying what was said in the interview. She interviews a group of very diverse people whom it must have been a challenge to find and have them agree to interview about God. I admire her determination in finding the strength to interview these people and make a book about it. The interview that touched me the most was of the death row inmate who claims was unjustly convicted for a crime he didn't do and who believe God is being tough on him. I really don't know if he is making up his own story or if he really is innocent (only God knows the full truth...). Finally this book is infinitely better than the Christian scare tactics ones by Bill Wiese and Mary Baxter about hell (those I didn't appreciate at all).I am definitely saving this book for future reference and going to read again in 6 months. Hopefully I will read it in half the time at that point. Anyway thank you Mrs. Cromwell for the wonderfully written book. Great job!"},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

From my own perspective as a Christian, I was humbled by the honest, gentle and respectful way Mare has dealt with all of these different stories. I think we could all learn something, simply from Mare's discipline of openly listening. Whatever your spiritual stance, I would recommend this book as something very thought provoking and real. A rare and unusual book."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"\\"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America\\", a book by Mare Cromwell is a fast, easy read & I enjoyed it. In her book, Mare asks that if given God's number and you called him, what would you ask? Responses go from, \\"Why is the #1 grossing business, weaponry?\\" to \\"What's next weeks winning Lottery winning number?\\", (world view to personal view). But that's who we are, sometimes \\"big picture\\" sometimes \\"near sighted\\".MML&J; wrote about events long ago & far away. Scholars throughout the ages have written profound insights based on what they wrote. Mare has asked a simple question, (love it), and gives us a good selection of answers by people who live today. She makes one think about important things & of course, you ask the question of yourself.I met Mare briefly. For her, spirituality is important, hence the topic she chose. What if she was to use the same format and using the Internet with follow up phone interviews, asking people living today relevant questions, could their answers cause me to reflect?. So, \\"If you were Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, what would you do first?\\", \\"If I gave you President Barack Obama's phone number and I could make sure he would take your call, what would you ask him?\\", \\"So what that Physicists have found a particle that goes faster than the speed of light?\\", \\"In the old days, things were intuitive, I could pretty much fix or make work anything on my bicycle. Today I can't even start a Prius without instruction. What other things today are too complicated and how do you deal with them?\\".Mare, I gave you 4 of 5 stars because I would have liked shorter interviews that included the full content of their answer, so there could have been a larger set of answers, and, (I don't know how you could do this), as your were brutally honest about yourself, get those you interview to be equally, brutally honest. Good Luck & I hope there is another book in your future."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"In this book, the author interviews people starting with the question in the title. The question amused me, but the interviews are serious (well, sometimes funny) and the author does an excellent job of following up with other questions that get to the core of the person's philosophy and concerns. What's striking about this book is the way people opened up to the author and shared their thoughts and beliefs. It says a lot about the author's openness and empathy. The range of people interviewed and the personal memoir wrapped around the interviews give depth to the book. Anyone who is curious about the state of spirituality in this country will find this book interesting."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"Found it a very new experience to read this book. It was quite fascinating to read the incredibly wide range of experiences of God, higher power or however individuals do or don't engage the divine. The opportunity to explore these very personal individual experiences was very artfully intertwined with the author's own life questions and experiences at a very deep level...it's a brave telling of deeply personal experiences that generously offered the opportunity to walk with her on this journey. It profoundly changed my perspective of how each person has a truly individual experience of the divine. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"This is a delightful collection of responses to an ancient question with a modern twist. Mare described each character to enable me to envision them answering the questons.

The beauty along the path is made more vivid when it is shared. - With love"},{"Title":"If I Gave You God's Phone Number....: Searching for Spirituality in America","review":"The more of this book I read, the more I envied the author's having had the encounters she describes. The interactions between Mare Cromwell and the individuals she interviewed were what I always hope for in conversation--because she and they had Conversation That Matters. Clearly her respondents WANTED to talk at the intimate and meaningful level that characterizes all the interviews. All deep sharings are not only voluntary but often eager. Chances are all conversations would benefit by infusions of content that Matters."},{"Title":"Done in a Day: 100 Years of Great Writing from the Chicago Daily News","review":"A classic newspaper book that ought to charge up any real or wannabe ink-stained wretch.

I reccomend."},{"Title":"Evolution Book: The Story of 4,000 Million Years of Life on Earth","review":"This book has 375 pages before the index. It is not an easy read. It covers a lot. The scope is, very very wide, entirely too wide for my current needs (preparing curriculum for a 1st grader), so I haven't spent a lot of time going through it in detail yet. My initial reaction is that this isn't for the average 10 year old. I first seriously studied the evolution of man at 9, but it was a more focused study, and I think this would have just annoyed me, giving me information I didn't want yet, and not providing me with enough details about what I did want, perhaps killing my interest in the subject. I won't list off all the chapter information because it would take too long, but as an example I will list the information for the one section. 1000 Million Years Ago: Sexual Seaweeds, Jelly Animals, An Explosion of Shells, Seavegetables, How to a Make Plankton Net, Algae Collection, Pretty and Pretty Useful, Small Worlds, Sponging, Moon Babies, Seashore Guide, The Aliens, A Taste of Worms, Worm Hunt, The Oldest Sea Monster, Shell Shapes, Beachcombing, Shell Hunt, and Mollusk Stew.

Most of the struggles Donna faces are still so relevant today. It's obvious from the success of the movie Grease, TV show \\"7th Heaven\\" and & Happy Days & The Brady Bunch on DVD that people still love to relive these magical times and that teenagers never really change.

There are a huge number of web development tools out there, and a confusing variety of techniques for web page development and for web server management. After reading this book my decision was clear. I use the Web Tcl Server which I down-loaded and booted first shot. Instead of having to juggle a number of techniques I can now just stick to Tcl. It is the common glue across the company and it is also liberating. People can use their own tools to create various aspects of the web site and yet central policies can be maintained. For example, everyone can use their favorite word processors instead of being forced to use a Web management tool such as Front Page that is universally hated. Get this book.

Most of TCL books will cover the language or how to build pretty grahical programs, but this books emphasis in on the web. In the scope of the web, the book has many sections including: (1) SafeTCL, (2) CGI Scripting, (4) Servlets, (5) TCL Web Server, (6) Client side scripting, (7) document processing with XML, (8) Java Intigration. This book offers so much.I really like how the authors started off with SafeTCL as a way to firewall your code taht could potentially be attacked by hackers. I was touched by the coverage of Tclets and TCL Netscape plug-in. This stuff was really cool, as it is a way to reuse code on the client browser, but also offer ways to interact with JavaScript. Some really neat stuff.I highly recommend this book for anyone that likes to tinker and do really cool things with little effort involved.

It is the story of a congregation of Shouters or Spiritual Baptists, an African Christian religion that was banned and persecuted by British colonial authorities, as they struggle with the conflict between worshipping as they believe they should and conforming to the heavy hand of the law. As such, it also has much to say concerning the cultural and psychological costs of colonization. It is a short, simple, engaging and profound novel, one of the best from the Caribbean.

Lovelace's conversational narrative script offers easy reading and engages the reader's involvement in Wine as in his other works. His accurate use of the Trinidadian Creole displays the natural beauty and unique nuances of the language. His narrative explores the perceptions of the characters from his omniscient author perspective and brings to life the value and the power of faith in God. His is not a fictional or isolated tale of an individual or make-believe community; his is the chronicling of a dark time in the history of a nation when a people's freedom of worship was denied them by misuse of the very laws that enshrined such freedom. It is the recounting of the triumph of faith when the Prohibition Law of 1917 was repealed in 1951 and the Spiritual Baptists were free to ring the bell for freedom.My Faith - Spiritual Baptist Christian"},{"Title":"The Wine of Astonishment (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"The Wine of Astonishment is a magnificently crafted piece of literature. For anyone who has read \\"The Dragon Can't Dance\\" or any of Lovelace's other works are familiar with the colloquial style of his writing, which captures the Trinidadian vernacular at its finest. This story centers around a people facing religious persecution, and holding on to dearly to their cultural identity. Metaphorically, they're seeking someone to rise up & become the saviour of their village, in the mold of Christ. If you've read \\"The Dragon Can't Dance\\" or Chinua Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart,\\" you will see some parallels, but still be impressed. Overall, a very good read and one worth recommending."},{"Title":"The Wine of Astonishment (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"Is not what I expected, even though is not a bad book. I expected something a little more 'fast', but is a kind of slow story. However, like I said before is not a bad book only different to say so. It reminds me Acehebe's work (racism) and is not too long so people can read it in a day or two."},{"Title":"The Wine of Astonishment (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"This is the best book that I've read in the last 10 years.Politics , social commentary , religion , it's all in here.Set in Trinidad , Wine... follows a church leader , his familyand their surrounding community , as they grapple with a widearray of social ills. Beyond a good book. This one's a classic."},{"Title":"The platinum rainbow: How to succeed in the music business without selling your soul","review":"I read the book in the Mid 80's while living in California and saw all of the myths that I thought were just that myths come to light out of the dark.

The book was a joy to work through from beginning to end, covering so many aspects (many of which other authors neglect to cover), all of which add up to produce a first class book and subsequently a well rounded course - everything you need to confidently tackle 3D CAD.BUY IT."},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 3D f/x and design: Elevate your AutoCAD 2000 designs to the next level","review":"This is probably the worst technical book I have ever read. The author simply covers the commands of the software without any insight. There is a total lack of fluidity between the sections--each one seems to have been written by a different individual who doesn't care what was said before or will be covered later. Lots of boring repetition without purpose and very dry humor. If you still would like to buy one, BUY MINE."},{"Title":"Talking Back to Poems: A Working Guide for the Aspiring Poet","review":"It's an unfortunate fact of our educational system that students are often required to write original poetry without ever being taught what poetry is all about. This book is an excellent introduction to the art of reading and writing poems. The author begins by introducing four basic components of poetry: sound, imagery, structure, and meaning. He then devotes a chapter to each of these four elements, using well-chosen examples from poets both famous and not-so-famous. Readers are encouraged to &quot;talk back&quot; to the poems by writing original poetry that reflects one or more of the techniques--rhyme scheme, structure, imagery, etc.--demonstrated by the examples in the chapter. A sizable glossary is provided for readers who wish further to enhance their understanding of the poetic devices described in the text. The author states that this book is meant to function as a classroom: It is a classroom well worth visiting."},{"Title":"Talking Back to Poems: A Working Guide for the Aspiring Poet","review":"The book was very clear-cut and straight-forward. It helped to focus your attention on the rhythm and music involved in the making of a poem."},{"Title":"Talking Back to Poems: A Working Guide for the Aspiring Poet","review":"This book is not worth the gas I used driving to the bookstore. I am an avid poetry reader and I was excited when I picked up the book. Clearly, as a lot of people have mentioned before Daniel Alderson collected well-written poetry and put his name on the cover. His comments add no insight into the poem and if anything are just stringy and sloppy. There was little \\"talking back\\" to poems and rather \\"reading poems\\" and using my minimalist knowledge on poetry to predict what the author was thinking. Over and over again he is redundant and makes repetitive comments about the poems, that, in all actuality, have no basis. I understand that Daniel Alderson in a high school teacher and that is what he should remain doing instead of wasting his time ranting on and on about poetry. I am embarrassed to have a copy on my bookshelf so I left it in my \\"Free Books\\" pile at a garage sale. Hopefully, that's where it stays. Save yourself the trouble and pick up a copy of a insightful poetry book and not this book of nonsense."},{"Title":"Talking Back to Poems: A Working Guide for the Aspiring Poet","review":"Mr. Alderson should get his facts straight. In chapter five (\\"Meaning\\") he erroneously refers to Carlos Drummond de Andrade as a woman; he proceeds to analyze Elizabeth Bishop's translation of a Drummond de Andrade poem based on this false assumption. A few paragraphs later he refers to the poem as Bishop's own. I have zero confidence in a book that makes such colossal mistakes."},{"Title":"Talking Back to Poems: A Working Guide for the Aspiring Poet","review":"I bought this book because my name happens to be the exact same as the author's. I thought it would be novel to show to my friends and family, especially my father, whose name is also the same as the author's. Little did I know that the author was devoid of any original thought. As I perused the book, it became evident that the author had amassed a bunch of well-written poems and slapped his name on it. I thought my review quite harsh until my father said the same thing. The author is a disgrace to Daniel Aldersons everywhere."},{"Title":"The Monkees: A Manufactured Image : The Ultimate Reference Guide to Monkee Memories and Memorabilia","review":"If you are looking for the DEFINITIVE reference book on everyone's favorite TV show ABOUT a rock and roll group...this is the one. I thought I knew a lot about the show and the guys, but thanks to Bill Chadwick (who was almost a Monkee, and was there for it all!), Maggie McManus (Monkees fan extrodinaire), and Ed Reilly (whose memorabilia collection I REALLY wish I had! ), this publication is the most comprehensive, detailed book regarding The Monkees ANYWHERE! In &quot;A Manufactured Image&quot;, you will discover the day to day occurances and situations that took place from the very beginnings of Monkeemania, following the guys through the height of their popularity, through the dissolution of the cast and group, including Head and 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee, and throughout their respective solo careers, up through their triumphant return in 1986. It was great to be able to follow Micky, Davy, Peter, and Mike through their trials and tribulations after the project ended, and it tied up a lot of loose ends to questions I had about where they were, and what they did between 1970 and 1986. As a fan of the music, I especially enjoyed the complete list of recordings, seeing the titles of the unreleased stuff up to the date of publication. You will also see a section on some of the hundreds of Monkee Collectables from throughout the years, hundreds and hundreds of wonderful pictures, a great number of them previously unreleased. Want to know how the TV show fared against Gilligan's Island and Gunsmoke? Want to know how long The Monkees had SEVEN albums on the charts at one time in 1986? It's all here! In addition, pictures of the 45's by the guys, both solo and with the group, along with LP covers from around the world, which was a real treat! I highly recommend this book as an excellent way to introduce new fans to the Monkees, as well as fans who want to learn more about their favorite &quot;Pre-Fab&quot; Four! You cannot go wrong with &quot;A Manufactured Image&quot;"},{"Title":"The Monkees: A Manufactured Image : The Ultimate Reference Guide to Monkee Memories and Memorabilia","review":"This yellow hardback book is out of print, so it is pricey. If you are a die hard fan of Monkee history, of any generation, mine being 2nd, then this book is for you. It is like a Chronological History of the Monkees, which is probably a more apt title of the book, in my opinion. It is well done, lots of factoids packed with all black and white photos in 307 pages. The style in which the info is presented feels kind of like a school annual. The book does in some ways it seem older than mid-1980s when it was published.I like how it is chornological, year by year milestones of the Monkees, even in the post-Monkees years to 1986. There are lots of great rare black and white pictures of the guys from all eras as well. I also enjoyed how the authors displayed images of the band's releases in foreign countries and post Monkee releases; quite detailed. I also liked reading the week by week tracking of the Monkees songs on the Billboard chart. Also they found many obscure ads, photos, of the Monkees. All very interesting.The only drawback appears to be the lack of details about the Monkees in 1969, while the 3 Monkees, minus Peter, appeared on numerous TV programs as guests. The Monkees also had toured with Sam and the Goodtimers; I wish there was more information here. I would like to know more about this weird era post-TV show. Also the cinematic flop, Head, has sparse info. To make up for that shortage, there is lots of info and pictures, too about the 4 Monkees in the 1970s and 80s.One neat fact I did not realize was that cassette tapes were in use in 1969! - There was a photo of Head release on LP. 8 Track and cassette. It mentions that 5 Monkee albums were released on cassette in 1969. I thought cassettes were introduced a few years later, like 1974ish.Other than my criticisms, this is a splendid book. If you are a serious collector, it is worth spending the extra money. I hope you find a good deal on it: I have not seen this book listed online for less than $50.I would like to purchase/review some of the other Rock and Roll Reference Series books they had published.

My husband and I have reread Patrick Moon's first book Virgile's Vineyard at least 3 times each and so I was hoping for more humour than this one provided - actually, I don't think I chuckled once. It is very interesting to learn all about the workings of a restaurant, about Perrier and Roquefort cheese but this felt more like a reference book than a biography. Perhaps it's because I am comparing it to the first book. I would have liked more talk about the people and their inter-relationships."},{"Title":"Sweetest Taboo (Arabesque)","review":"In the follow-up to her debut novel Honor's Destiny, Yolonda Greggs takes us on a journey into the life of Cai McIntyre.
