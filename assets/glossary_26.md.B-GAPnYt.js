Bush pledged $10 billion to combat AIDS in developing nations. Noted specialist Susan Hunter tells the untold story of AIDS in Africa, home to 80 percent of the 40 million people in the world currently infected with HIV. She weaves together the history of colonialism in Africa, an insider's take on the reluctance of drug companies to provide cheap medication and vaccines in poor countries, and personal anecdotes from the 20 years she spent in Africa working on the AIDS crisis. Taken together, these strands make it unmistakably clear that a history of the exploitation of developing nations by the West is directly responsible for the spread of disease in developing nations and the AIDS pandemic in Africa. Hunter looks at what Africans are already doing on the ground level to combat AIDS, and what the world can and must do to help. Accessibly written and hard-hitting,Black Death brings the staggering statistics to life and paints for the first time a stunning picture of the most important political issue today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DA0XCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last of Her Kind","description":"The paths of two women from different walks of life intersect amid counterculture of the 1960s in this haunting and provocative novel from the National Book Award-winning author of The Friend Named a Best Book of the Year by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Christian Science Monitor Sigrid Nunez's The Last of Her Kind introduces two women who meet as freshmen on the Columbia campus in 1968. Georgette George does not know what to make of her brilliant, idealistic roommate, Ann Drayton, and her obsessive disdain for the ruling class into which she was born. She is mortified by Ann's romanticization of the underprivileged class, which Georgette herself is hoping college will enable her to escape. After the violent fight that ends their friendship, Georgette wants only to forget Ann and to turn her attention to the troubled runaway kid sister who has reappeared after years on the road. Then, in 1976, Ann is convicted of murder. At first, Ann's fate appears to be the inevitable outcome of her belief in the moral imperative to \\"make justice\\" in a world where \\"there are no innocent white people.\\" But, searching for answers to the riddle of this friend of her youth, Georgette finds more complicated and mysterious forces at work. The novel's narrator Georgette illuminates the terrifying life of this difficult, doomed woman, and in the process discovers how much their early encounter has determined her own path, and why, decades later, as she tells us, \\"I have never stopped thinking about her.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CvSgS3AOguQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Composition of the Pentateuch (Biblical Seminar)","description":"This is an introduction for beginners in biblical studies and for those who want to learn what scholars are able to discover about the origins and history of the books of Genesis-Deuteronomy.

Customs and traditions of family life and other aspects of human existence were drastically changing. Our children no longer had the security and optimism that the older generation had known. By the 80's, my contemporaries knew that we would never recapture the magical moments with which we grew up. However, storytelling in the Deep South was alive and well, and acquaintances encouraged me to write down some of the many experiences of daily living that I talked about. That encouragement led to a weekly column in several newspapers, and I called it \\"From over the Hill.\\" Recently, friends and followers of my articles advised me to put together a book of some favorites written during that time. Most of the stories are very similar to today's happenings-we are still in the 80's mode.

Every marker of social difference can be easily interpreted in the fashionable language of \\"borderlands\\"--and if so, as Victor M. Ortiz-Gonzalez reveals, the practical reality of the border region is often grossly misrepresented and its people woefully served. He argues that amid the tantalizing abstractions generated by the sweeping reconfigurations of globalization, people in cities like El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, on the U.S.-Mexican border, are actually living the gritty realities of a new world order. With descriptions of grassroots initiatives to confront the challenges and opportunities that NAFTA represents for the city, El Paso challenges us to acknowledge and address the conceptual and sociopolitical tasks of a world in which abstract representations and nonlocal interests override concrete situations. Ortiz-Gonzalez also provides an indepth analysis of groups such as La Mujer Obrera, Unite El Paso, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and their attempts to give local residents and workers more autonomy and power. Balancing ethnographic detail with precise theoretical insights, El Paso offers a compelling case study and a stirring call to understand both the conceptual challenge and the social urgency of the effects of globalization in local settings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBd06e4zL18C&dq=El+Paso:+Local+Frontiers+At+A+Global+Crossroads+(Globalization+and+Community)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Content Area Reading","description":"NOTE: Used books, rentals, and purchases made outside of Pearson If purchasing or renting from companies other than Pearson, the access codes for the Enhanced Pearson eText may not be included, may be incorrect, or may be previously redeemed.

The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey.

From 1873 to 1905, Dodge worked to create what she called a \\"pleasure ground\\" for children--a magazine that would have great impact on several generations of children. The list of authors who wrote for her includes Louisa May Alcott, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Rudyard Kipling, Theodore Roosevelt, and Mark Twain. The quality of the magazine's illustration was equally high. The magazine was also the launching pad for a new generation of authors and artists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, E.B. White, Jack London, and Eudora Welty. This anthology of critical writing on St. Nicholas includes some of the most influential articles already published and newly commissioned essays on a variety of subjects, including the impact of the St. Nicholas league, the utopian thrust of the magazine's fiction, and the story of the long and productive literary partnership between Dodgeand Alcott. Essays also analyze Dodge's relationship with her readers, her editorial practice, the illustrations, American family life as seen by young British readers, war and military life, advertising, and the middle-class preoccupation with \\"change of fortune\\" tales. The work places St. Nicholas in American cultural history, and analyzes how it both influenced and was influenced over thirty years. Essential documentary material presently unpublished or inaccessible and illustrations from the magazine are also included.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jC9TP14HpfAC&dq=St.+Nicholas+and+Mary+Mapes+Dodge:+The+Legacy+of+a+Children%27s+Magazine+Editor,+1873-1905&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 1001 Rewards & Recognition Fieldbook: The Complete Guide","description":"A practical, motivational handbook explains how to design and manage a rewards or recognition program in the workplace, the best ways to recognize the contributions of an individual or group, how to develop a low-cost recognition program, and how to assess its effectiveness, accompanied by templates, handy reference cards, and low cost recognition ideas.

Throughout this fascinating work, Mowinckel carefully explores the relationship of the various psalm types to the congregationbs devotional life, including hymns of praise from Israel's national festivals, psalms of lamentation and penitence, and personal or private psalms of thanksgiving. Other topics include the psalms' relationship to prophecy and wisdom, their composition and collection, their style and performance, and the technical terminology involved in Psalms study.

Minette Swift had been a fiercely individualistic scholarship student, an assertive even prickly personality, and one of the few black girls at an exclusive women's liberal arts college near Philadelphia. By contrast, Genna was a quiet, self-effacing teenager from a privileged upper-class home, self-consciously struggling to make amends for her own elite upbringing. When, partway through their freshman year, Minette suddenly fell victim to an increasing torrent of racist harassment and vicious slurs from within the apparent safety of their tolerant, \\"enlightened\\" campus Genna felt it her duty to protect her roommate at all costs. Now, as Genna reconstructs the months, weeks, and hours leading up to Minette's tragic death, she is also forced to confront her own identity within the social framework of that time. Her father was a prominent civil defense lawyer whose radical politics including defending anti-war terrorists wanted by the FBI would deeply affect his daughter's outlook on life, and later challenge her deepest beliefs about social obligation in a morally gray world. Black Girl / White Girl is a searing double portrait of \\"black\\" and \\"white,\\" of race and civil rights in post-Vietnam America, captured by one of the most important literary voices of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dRRYBKwLxMkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Place Names of Kent","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UMcxAQAAIAAJ&dq=Place+Names+of+Kent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not Guilty: The Case in Defense of Men","description":"A rebuttal of feminist charges against men discusses such issues as child sexual abuse, the sexual harassment of males, and husband battering and the presupposition of men's guilt. 35,000 first printing. $15,000 ad/promo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NhMgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Not+Guilty:+The+Case+in+Defense+of+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mayo Clinic on Alzheimer's Disease","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Epiphany","description":"Discover Just How Good Your Writing Can Be If you write, you know what it's like.

Their father was the Duke of York, the second son of King George V, and their Uncle David was the future King of England. We all know how the fairy tale ended: When King George died, \\"Uncle David\\" became King Edward VIII---who abdicated less than a year later to marry the scandalous Wallis Simpson. Suddenly the little princesses' father was King. The family moved to Buckingham Palace, and ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth became the heir to the crown she would ultimately wear for over fifty years. The Little Princesses shows us how it all began. In the early thirties, the Duke and Duchess of York were looking for someone to educate their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, then five- and two-years-old. They already had a nanny---a family retainer who had looked after their mother when she was a child---but it was time to add someone younger and livelier to the household. Enter Marion Crawford, a twenty-four-year-old from Scotland who was promptly dubbed \\"Crawfie\\" by the young Elizabeth and who would stay with the family for sixteen years. Beginning at the quiet family home in Piccadilly and ending with the birth of Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 1948, Crawfie tells how she brought the princesses up to be \\"Royal,\\" while attempting to show them a bit of the ordinary world of underground trains, Girl Guides, and swimming lessons. The Little Princesses was first published in 1950 to a furor we cannot imagine today. It has been called the original \\"nanny diaries\\" because it was the first account of life with the Royals ever published. Although hers was a touching account of the childhood of the Queen and Princess Margaret, Crawfie was demonized by the press. The Queen Mother, who had been a great friend and who had, Crawfie maintained, given her permission to write the account, never spoke to her again. Reading The Little Princesses now, with a poignant new introduction by BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, offers fascinating insights into the changing lives and times of Britains royal family.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CX4aDVMO0ugC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desire and Deception","description":"Let's Just say, I believe in Saints...Pampered princess and daughter of a drug lord, Isabel Ramirez, is on her way to grabbing the brass ring in the legitimate world of academia when her boss gets in the way.

It is a sad story but not always a gloomy one. In these pages, bereavement becomes a pilgrimage for the reader, as it was for the author. In 1989, the author's older daughter was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After a four-year remission the cancer returned. Ellen Manson died April 8, 1994. At the time, mainstream media was almost routinely covering stories of angel sightings and near-death experiences. Says the author, \\"I wanted to be in touch with Ellen, but this seemed to presuppose very specific beliefs in a spiritual reality. How did one enter such a reality without adopting the tenets of traditional religions and philosophies?\\" In contemplating her daughter's death, the author began to think about her own: What does it mean that we all physically die? What is death? She asks age-old questions and looks for answers in her own direct experience. After three years of trying on evenings and weekends to write this memoir-tribute-song, Manson realized that such a book required her best energies; she needed to make some life changes. The first was to leave her job. In August 1997 she went home to her computer and began to write full time. Hallelujah Crocodile Blue Boogie for Ellen is the result. Part biography, part philosophical exploration, it is a work of discovery. Says Manson, \\"As I 'found' Ellen, I began to find myself.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_hZSKoU1dXwC&dq=Hallelujah+Crocodile:+Blue+Boogie+for+Ellen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latter-day pamphlets (Carlyle, Thomas, 1795-1881.

Some people recoil in fear at the very suggestion of these creatures, while others happily keep them as pets. Snakes can convey both beauty and menace in a single tongue flick and so these creatures have held a special place in our cultures. Yet, for as many meanings that we attribute to snakes from fertility and birth to sin and death the real-life species represent an even wider array of wonders. The Book of Snakes presents 600 species of snakes from around the world, covering nearly one in six of all snake species. It will bring greater understanding of a group of reptiles that have existed for more than 160 million years, and that now inhabit every continent except Antarctica, as well as two of the great oceans. This volume pairs spectacular photos with easy-to-digest text. It is the first book on these creatures that combines a broad, worldwide sample with full-color, life-size accounts. Entries include close-ups of the snake s head and a section of the snake at actual size. The detailed images allow readers to examine the intricate scale patterns and rainbow of colors as well as special features like a cobra s hood or a rattlesnake s rattle. The text is written for laypeople and includes a glossary of frequently used terms. Herpetologists and herpetoculturists alike will delight in this collection, and even those with a more cautious stance on snakes will find themselves drawn in by the wild diversity of the suborder Serpentes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4MRqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gary Ridgway: The Green River Killer","description":"New York Times Bestseller: From the journalists who covered the story, the shocking crimes of Gary Ridgway, America s most prolific serial murderer.

Despite an exhaustive investigation even serial killer Ted Bundy was consulted to assist with psychological profiling the sadistic killer continued to elude authorities for nearly twenty years. Then, in 2001, after mounting suspicion and with DNA evidence finally in hand, King County police charged a fifty-two-year-old truck painter, Gary Ridgway, with the murders. His confession and the horrific details of his crimes only added fuel to the notoriety of the Green River Killer.

Revised after Ridgway s conviction and featuring chilling photographs from the case, The Search for the Green River Killer is the ultimate authoritative account of the Pacific Northwest killing spree that held a nation spellbound and continues to horrify and fascinate, spawning dramatizations and documentaries of a demented killer who seemed unstoppable for decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DRAoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A NATION IN TORMENT: THE GREAT AMERICAN DEPRESSION, 1929-1939.","description":"A spirited narrative history of America's most desperate decade.

Many European countries removed their paupers, convicted criminals, rebels and religious dissidents to remote communities or to their colonies where they could be simultaneously punished and, perhaps, contained and reformed. Under British rule, poor Irish, Scottish Jacobites, English criminals, Quakers, gypsies, Native Americans, the Acadian French in Canada, rebellious African slaves, or vulnerable minorities like the Jews of St. Eustatius, were among those expelled and banished to another place. This book explores the legal and political development of this forced migration, focusing on the British Atlantic world between 1600 and 1800. The territories under British rule were not uniform in their policies, and not all practices were driven by instructions from London, or based on a clear legal framework. Using case studies of legal and political strategies from the Atlantic world, and drawing on accounts of collective experiences and individual narratives, the authors explore why victims were chosen for banishment, how they were transported and the impact on their lives. The different contexts of such banishment  internal colonialism ethnic and religious prejudice, suppression of religious or political dissent, or the savageries of war in Europe or the colonies  are examined to establish to what extent displacement, exile and removal were fundamental to the early British Empire.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kxHZIRqh_nwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Them Right: A Saint's Advice on Raising Children","description":"This work...applies in a concrete manner the profound spiritual wisdom of Orthodoxy to the realities of the common life and, in this case, the raising of children.

Professor Claire Jordan lives with the memory of a brutal assault. Only when her attacker, Gerald Steckman, is convicted of the crime and sentenced to prison is Claire able to rebuild her shattered life. With her partner, artist Jane Sellers, she settles in Denver and attempts to put the horror of her experience behind her. But when her friend's young daughter, Chloe, is found brutalized, she is drawn back into the web of terror once more. When she discovers that it is Steckman who has raped Chloe, Claire is stunned and then, outraged. As Steckman stalks and attacks women in the Capitol Hill area of Denver where she lives, Claire, her lover Jane, and their two friends, Mattie and Brooke, decide to take matters into their own hands. Their conspiracy is born in The Steel Magnolia, a bar frequented by the four women. Frustrated by the lack of progress by the police, the women enlist the aid of Denver's gay community to find Steckman and bring him to justice. But the justice the women plan for Steckman is not society's justice. Claire's obsession with finding the man who raped her is driven by her need to exorcise the fear that has haunted her for years.

There was a loving atmosphere that seemed to actually change the physical environment that surrounded Him. The grasses became greener, the blades became stronger, the blooms more colorful and the flowers smelled sweeter. Magdalene was caught up in an ethereal realm where she felt like she was too exquisite for the world she was in  and she was absolutely sure Jesus was too perfect for this world. She gazed at Him and she realized it was He who made her feel that way. It s Time gives the reader a greater understanding of conflicting politics on the lips of first-century Jerusalem citizens and Jewish principles in a Roman world. This book shines new light on the Magi and their interpretation of the heavenly spheres as it pertained to the birth of Jesus and their duty to Jesus while He was a youth. It offers a broader understanding of Joseph of Arimathea and the role he played in the life of Jesus. Through this new light, the reader has a greater understanding of Jesus as a youth. The scriptures are silent on these missing years, and it is time to sift out a logical, although imaginary, life surrounding Jesus as a youth that He could have lived in the first-century world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1vXcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low-Carb Juices and Smoothies","description":"Contains 50 mouthwatering, nutritious juices and smooties that use only low-carb fruits and vegetables.

Home to the best and the brightest, training ground for the corporate elite. Surprisingly enough, however, an overwhelming majority of students in any entering class identifies itself as liberal to leftist in its political orientation. Then why does the majority of any graduating class choose corporate law practice over public interest work? What happens to students in those three years between orientation and commencement? Making Elite Lawyers is the first detailed study of legal education at America's premier law school. Drawing on in-depth interviews, student questionnaires, and his own classroom observations, author Robert Granfield documents the conservatizing effects of the Harvard legal education on a broad cross-section of the student population, paying particular attention to the fate of women, students of color, and those from working-class backgrounds at Harvard Law School. In his analysis of the legal curriculum, Granfield shows how the boot-camp of first-year law school marks the emergence of a finely-tuned legal consciousness which comes to value gamesmanship over ideals, and competition and victory over right and wrong. As learning to \\"think like a lawyer\\" begins to take its toll on students - leaving them confused and alienated by this legal education - students are forced to pragmatically conclude that their moral beliefs are a thing apart from their work as attorneys. Making Elite Lawyers reveals how the \\"Harvard Mystique\\" also helps conservatize students. From the moment they arrive on campus for orientation to the manner in which they are wined and dined as summer associate candidates by top-flight corporate law firms, students are encouraged to accept the status, power, and money that the Harvard Law School experience confers. By offering students the psychological and material path of least resistance into America's higher circles, Granfield concludes, Harvard ultimately only schools its attorneys to represent the interests of the social and political status quo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SakVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Making+Elite+Lawyers:+Visions+of+Law+at+Harvard+and+Beyond+(Critical+Social+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winesboro Ohio (Collected Works of Sherwood Anderson)","description":"This carefully crafted ebook: \\"Winesburg, Ohio (A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life)\\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. This ebook is a series of loosely linked short stories set in the fictional town of Winesburg, mostly written from late 1915 to early 1916. The stories are held together by George Willard, a resident to whom the community confide their personal stories and struggles. The townspeople are withdrawn and emotionally repressed and attempt in telling their stories to gain some sense of meaning and dignity in an otherwise desperate life. The work has received high critical acclaim and is considered one of the great American works of the 20th century. Sherwood Anderson (1876  1941) was an American novelist and short story writer, known for subjective and self-revealing works. Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. He may be most influential for his effect on the next generation of young writers, as he inspired William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Thomas Wolfe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lh1CBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Cooper's Town: Power and Persuasion on the Frontier of the Early American Republic","description":"A dual history and biography profiles William Cooper, a shrewd land developer, presiding judge, and U.S. Congressman, against the backdrop of post-Revolutionary War America, and explains how his life reflected the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dtQmAQAAMAAJ&dq=William+Cooper%27s+Town:+Power+and+Persuasion+on+the+Frontier+of+the+Early+American+Republic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Threatened With Resurrection: Prayers and Poems from an Exiled Guatemalan (Spanish Edition)","description":"Dissolve the distractions of ego to find our authentic selves inGod In his bestselling book Falling Upward, Richard Rohrtalked about ego (or the False Self) and how it gets in the way ofspiritual maturity.

The archaeological record contains hundreds of situations in which societies developed long-term sustainable relationships with their environments and thousands in which the relationships were destructive. Charles Redman demonstrates that much can be learned from an improved understanding of peoples who, through seemingly rational decisions, degraded their environments and threatened their own survival. By discussing archaeological case studies from around the world from the deforestation of the Mayan lowlands to soil erosion in ancient Greece to the almost total depletion of resources on Easter Island Redman reveals the long-range coevolution of culture and environment and clearly shows the impact that ancient peoples had on their world. These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society. They show that humankind's commitment to agriculture has had cultural consequences that have conditioned our perception of the environment and reveal that societies before European contact did not necessarily live the utopian existences that have been popularly supposed. Whereas most books on this topic tend to treat human societies as mere reactors to environmental stimuli, Redman's volume shows them to be active participants in complex and evolving ecological relationships. Human Impact on Ancient Environments demonstrates how archaeological research can provide unique insights into the nature of human stewardship of the Earth and can permanently alter the way we think about humans and the environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XKNKafsCPdwC&dq=Human+Impact+on+Ancient+Environments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wayward Icelanders: Punishment, Boundary Maintenance, And The","description":"Is Iceland, universally perceived as a peaceful, idyllic nation, being threatened by an inevitable flood of crime as it enters the global community? In recent decades the Icelandic state has taken serious steps to curb mounting crime, establishing a specialized drug court and an undercover drug police agency. Public opinion polls clearly demonstrate Icelanders' growing concern that crime and drug use are on the rise. In their provocative new book, Wayward Icelanders, Helgi Gunnlaugsson and John Galliher offer another, more nuanced explanation for recent Icelandic attitudes toward crime, one that takes into account the unique history and culture of this relatively homogeneous and isolated nation. Wayward Icelanders explores how the threat of crime has affected Icelanders' collective self-identity, producing an ever greater need for social control. Historically Iceland has provided stiff sanctions for the use and abuse of mind-altering substances. Drunk driving has long been systematically punished, and even beer was prohibited for more than seventy years. The rate of conviction for these crimes is high, even in a democracy that prides itself on protecting civil liberties. Even more troubling, however, is the low rate of convictions for rape cases, which suggests that such crimes receive less attention from the state. Drawing on the classic work of Durkheim as well as Kai Erikson's Wayward Puritans, Gunnlaugsson and Galliher demonstrate that an escalating war on crime can threaten freedom even in a small, affluent, and relatively nonviolent nation like Iceland with a long-standing commitment to democracy and individual rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B-M07srWvdoC&dq=Wayward+Icelanders:+Punishment,+Boundary+Maintenance,+And+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Makes Sammy Run?","description":"What Makes Sammy Run? Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.

Generally regarded as America's oldest book, the Popol Vuh, in fact, corresponds to our Christian Bible, and it is, moreover, the most important of the five pieces of the great library treasures of the Maya that survived the Spanish Conquest. The Popol Vuh was first transcribed in the Quiche language,  but in Latin characters, in the middle of the sixteenth century, by some unknown but highly literate Quiche Maya Indian-probably from the oral traditions of his people. This now lost manuscript was copied at the end of the seventeenth century by Father Francisco Xim nez, then parish priest of the village of Santo Tom s Chichicastenango in the highlands of Guatemala, today the most celebrated and best-known Indian town in all of Central America. The mythology, traditions, cosmogony, and history of the Quich  Maya, including the chronology of their kings down to 1550, are related in simple yet literary style by the Indian chronicler.

Joseph Mangina's Karl Barth: Theologian of Christian Witness offers a concise, accessible guide to this important Christian thinker. Uniquely among introductions to Barth, it also highlights his significance for Christian ecumenism. The first chapter describes Barth's extraordinary life, from his youthful break with liberalism during the First World War, to his mature theology in the Church Dogmatics. Subsequent chapters offer a detailed reading of this magisterial work, and place Barth in dialogue with five contemporary thinkers: George Lindbeck on revelation, Michael Wyschogrod on election, Stanley Hauerwas on creation, Robert Jenson on reconciliation, and Henri de Lubac on the church. These ecumenical conversations not only set Barth's thinking in greater relief, but serve to demonstrate its continuing theological fruitfulness. The book concludes by examining Barth's wider significance for the church in our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hGdQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sixth Rider, The","description":"WINNER OF THE MEDICINE PIPE BEARER S AWARD FOR BEST FIRST NOVEL FROM WESTERN WRITERS OF AMERICA THE MAKING OF AN OUTLAW They were kin to the infamous James and Younger clans the hard-riding, hard-shooting Dalton boys of Kansas, sired by a drunk, raised by a Bible-believing mama, scratching to survive in a West being tamed by the law.

On 31 May, 1916, the great battle fleets of Britain and Germany met off Jutland in the North Sea. It was a climactic encounter, the culmination of a fantastically expensive naval race between the two countries, and expectations on both sides were high. For the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, there was the chance to win another Trafalgar. For the German High Seas Fleet, there was the opportunity to break the British blockade and so change the course of the war. But Jutland was a confused and controversial encounter. Tactically, it was a draw; strategically, it was a British victory. Naval historians have pored over the minutiae of Jutland ever since. Yet they have largely ignored what the battle was actually like for its thousands of participants. Full of drama and pathos, of chaos and courage, JUTLAND, 1916 describes the sea battle in the dreadnought era from the point of view of those who were there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1RE6AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aging Mind: Opportunities in Cognitive Research","description":"Possible new breakthroughs in understanding the aging mind that can be used to benefit older people are now emerging from research. This volume identifies the key scientific advances and the opportunities they bring. For example, science has learned that among older adults who do not suffer from Alzheimera?s disease or other dementias, cognitive decline may depend less on loss of brain cells than on changes in the health of neurons and neural networks. Research on the processes that maintain neural health shows promise of revealing new ways to promote cognitive functioning in older people. Research is also showing how cognitive functioning depends on the conjunction of biology and culture. The ways older people adapt to changes in their nervous systems, and perhaps the changes themselves, are shaped by past life experiences, present living situations, changing motives, cultural expectations, and emerging technology, as well as by their physical health status and sensory-motor capabilities. Improved understanding of how physical and contextual factors interact can help explain why some cognitive functions are impaired in aging while others are spared and why cognitive capability is impaired in some older adults and spared in others. On the basis of these exciting findings, the report makes specific recommends that the U.S. government support three major new initiatives as the next steps for research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vk4hIKBArS8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue in Black & White","description":"Whatever your position is on Black Lives Matter, defunding the police, and equity in law enforcement, former police chief Carmen Best shares the leadership lessons she learned as the first Black woman to lead the Seattle Police Department a personal insider story that will challenge your assumptions on how to move the country forward. Chief Carmen Best has spent the last 28 years as a member of a big-city police force, an institution where minorities and women have historically found it especially difficult to succeed. She defied the odds and became the first Black woman to lead the Seattle Police Department. During her tenure, she was successful in bringing significantly more diversity to the force. However, when the city council cut her budget amid months of protests against police violence, she had no choice but to step aside. Without the city s support, she felt she wouldn t be able to continue changing the status quo of the police force from within. Throughout her career, Chief Best has learned lessons that those coming up behind her can benefit from. In this book, she will use her story to share those urgent lessons. Readers will read about: How Chief Best grew up to believe in the change she set out to create. Her early days in the police force, including lessons from the academy and her time on patrol. How she progressed in her career within a primarily white law enforcement culture and the events that led to her becoming Chief. How she built her team and overcame the politics involved in her high-level position until the call for defunding came. Carmen Best teaches readers the core qualities and mindset to persevere and rise through the ranks, even within a workplace whose culture and leadership must be challenged, and policies changed on the way to achieving that vision.

Its manifestations are conniving and destructive, dwelling in she who desires to have her way, no matter who is destroyed in the process. You can't defeat what you can't see. While most people are hyper-focused on Jezebel--and are basing their warfare on a misunderstanding of what Jezebel really is--fewer understand the workings of Jezebel's demonic partners in crime. The spirit of Jezebel couldn't execute all its wicked plots without the spirits of Ahab, the false prophets and the eunuchs.

Armed Forces Journal Bassford's comprehensive proposals put him in an altogether different category from other self-proclaimed \`defense reformers.' . . . Bassford criticizes but he also offers a package of solutions. His frustrations seem to be shared by at least some of the Army's leadership. Gen. John Galvin, our top commander in NATO, has lamented the \`grindstone of bureaucratic business' that undermines combat readiness. In his approving foreword to Bassford's writing, retired Lt. Gen. Robert Elton declared: \`The potential is there to mold a truly great Army. . . . This book screams for someone to listen.' And perhaps more important, to act. Chicago Tribune The problem of adjusting American military organization to new social, political, and strategic realities has perplexed military thinkers since the closing days of World War II; proposals for reform have proliferated since the end of the Vietnam War. Practical solutions, however, have proven elusive. In this volume, the author examines the various existing approaches to reform and concludes that most are either unworkable or irrelevant--if not actually counter-productive--to improving the effectiveness of American combat forces. The author rejects suggestions that perennial American military failure can be traced to the inadequacies of military personnel or of American society in general; he argues that neither a return to the draft, imposition of an ethical code for military leaders, nor creation of a General Staff will address fundamental issues. Likewise, he argues that structural reform, while needed, can only strike at symptoms, not causes. It is the author's view that the roots of American military ineptitude lie in the military services' organizational methods, not their organizational structure. These methods are the natural product of the unique evolution of American military institutions. They are incompatible with the structure, role, and doctrine of the armed forces as they exist today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nS25AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Spit-Shine+Syndrome:+Organizational+Irrationality+in+the+American+Field+Army+(Contributions+in+Military+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joshua Tree","description":"Drawing from the legendary heroic life of Bill Keys, this classic story of the Old and New West uniquely captures the romance and tragedy of the American West.

Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: ? make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); ? overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; ? design your environment to make success easier; ? get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XfFvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Better+Books!+Better+Readers!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EARTH ANGELS","description":"In the same way that \\"The Indigo Children\\" was a phenomenon that was much talked-about, before the book came out and explained it, \\"Earth Angels\\" is a topic of much discussion among spiritually minded people world-wide. Four years ago, Doreen Virtue wrote an article on the topic, and then a chapter in her book, \\"Healing with the Angels,\\" and then more information in \\"Healing with the Fairies.\\" Since that time, Doreen has been flooded with letters from people who resonate with the idea, requesting more information. \\"Earth Angels\\" will be the first book devoted to the topic. Doreen will describe the five different types of lightworkers: Incarnated Angels (those who had previous lives as angels, but who are now here as humans); Incarnated Elementals (those whose previous lives were in the elemental kingdom, as fairies, elves, etc.); Starpeople (those who have lived the majority of their past lives on other planets); Walk-In's (those who came from a high spiritual realm and walked-in to another person's life, as that soul gladly exited their body); and Reincarnated Sorcerers, Sorceresses, and Wizards (those whose most recent past life was during Arthurian or Atlantian times, when they practiced high magic). The book will include dozens of case studies; a fascinating analysis of an extensive survey that Doreen has conducted among people who identify with the five types of Earth Angels; and guidance to help readers to feel happier about their lives, their own idiosyncrasies, and their missions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIfn7F2nWAsC&dq=EARTH+ANGELS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unexpected Dragon","description":"Includes \\"Pigs Don't Fly\\", \\"Master of Many Treasures\\", and \\"Dragonne's Eg.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gqb2AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Unexpected+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The new criticism","description":"This work is the first history and evaluation of contemporary American critical theory within its European philosophical contexts. In the first part, Frank Lentricchia analyzes the impact on our critical thought of Frye, Stevens, Kermode, Sartre, Poulet, Heidegger, Sussure, Barthes, L vi-Strauss, Derrida, and Foucault, among other, less central figures. In a second part, Lentricchia turns to four exemplary theorists on the American scene Murray Krieger, E. D. Hirsch, Jr., Paul de Man, and Harold Bloom and an analysis of their careers within the lineage established in part one. Lentricchia's critical intention is in evidence in his sustained attack on the more or less hidden formalist premises inherited from the New Critical fathers. Even in the name of historical consciousness, he contends, contemporary theorists have often cut literature off from social and temporal processes. By so doing he believes that they have deprived literature of its relevant values and turned the teaching of both literature and theory into a rarefied activity. All along the way, with the help of such diverse thinkers as Saussure, Barthes, Foucault, Derrida, and Bloom, Lentricchia indicates a strategy by which future critical theorists may resist the mandarin attitudes of their fathers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fRN-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To hell with fishing; or, How to tell fish from fishermen,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x3gcMwEACAAJ&dq=To+hell+with+fishing%3B+or,+How+to+tell+fish+from+fishermen,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Die For The People - The Writings of Huey P.

Corrington offers the first thorough reconsideration of Wilhelm Reich's life and work since Reich's death in 1957. Reich was seventeen years old at the outbreak of World War I and had already witnessed the suicides of his mother and father. A native of Vienna, he became a disciple of Freud; but by his late twenties, having already written his classic The Function of the Orgasm, he fled the Third Reich and departed, too, from Freudian psychoanalysis. In The Mass Psychology of Fascism, Reich first took the now classic position that social behavior has its every root in sexual behavior and repression. But the psychoanalytic community was made uncomfortable by this claim, and it was said -- by the time of Reich's death in an American prison on dubious charges brought by the federal government -- that Reich had squandered his prodigal genius and surrendered to his own paranoia and psychosis, an opinion still responsible for the neglect and misconception of Reich's contribution to psychology. In this transfixing psychobiography, Corrington illuminates the themes and obsessions that unify Reich's work and reports on Reich's fascinating, unrelenting one-man quest to probe the ultimate structures of self, world, and cosmos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u8AN0mxBDzcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painless Research Projects (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Painless...(Pb))","description":"Provides the latest information on a wide range of topics including animals, culture, geography, the environment, history, and science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7sD8RR_uhMUC&dq=Painless+Research+Projects+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Database Programming with Visual Basic .NET","description":"The purpose of this book is to give established and new VB developers direction in how to get started developing database applications with VB .NET.

Moving from E. B. Taylor all the way through the development of modern fieldwork, Barth reveals the repressive tendencies that prevented Britain from developing a variety of anthropological practices until the late 1960s. Gingrich, meanwhile, articulates the development of German anthropology, paying particular attention to the Nazi period, of which surprisingly little analysis has been offered until now. Parkin then assesses the French tradition and, in particular, its separation of theory and ethnographic practice.

The book will narrate the development of global supply chains in response to trends in both, telling stories ranging from a Prussian-born trader in New Jersey in the 1760s who dreamed of buidling a vertically-integrated metals empire, to new megaships too big to call on most of the world's ports leaving half empty, as globalization entered a new stage in its history around 2006.

In this impeccably researched history, Robert W. Henderson uncovers the true origins not only of baseball but of a score of related sports involving hitting, catching, throwing, or kicking a ball.Henderson traces the origins of ball sports to religious rites in ancient Egypt, where the ball (perhaps a shrunken head) represented a fertility symbol and opposing teams engaged in mock combat signifying the struggle of good against evil. Centuries later, pagan fertility rites featuring the ball were adapted by the Christian church as rituals symbolic of Easter and the Resurrection. Court tennis was also firmly rooted in the church, the earliest players being the bishops, canons, and clerics who played it in their cloistered courtyards.Henderson overturns the popular belief that the game of racquets originated in the debtors' prison on Fleet Street in the early nineteenth century. He also notes that polo, the most ancient of games played with stick and ball, originated in Persia and migrated to China and India, where it was eventually embraced by English imperialists. Other sports discussed include football, lawn tennis, cricket, and golf.The most substantial portion of Henderson's study is devoted to the game of baseball. Providing copious evidence of early forms of baseball played in England and the United States before 1829, he offers a meticulous account of the legerdemain by which Abner Doubleday, the famous Civil War general, came to be identified as the inventor in 1839 of a game that was already at least two centuries old. The new foreword by Leonard Koppett affirms the significance of this classic work of sports history, which was the first to dismantle the Doubleday/Cooperstown myth.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w9ztAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ball,+bat+and+bishop:+The+origin+of+ball+games%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palmistry Made Practical: Fortune in Your Hand","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZgrZJ1vs-rkC&dq=Palmistry+Made+Practical:+Fortune+in+Your+Hand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Witch Alone","description":"This book carries on the tradition of the solo village witch emphasizing white rather than black magic.

When he drives his kids to school in the morning, they listen to the Ramones, the Clash, or the Descendents and that's it. They can listen to Britney and Justin on their own time. Jim goes to soccer games, dance rehearsals, and piano recitals like all the other dads, but when he feels the need, he also goes to punk shows, runs into the slam pit, and comes home bruised and beaten . . . but somehow feeling strangely better. While the other dads dye their hair brown to cover the gray, Jim occasionally dyes his blue or green. He makes his daughters' lunches, kisses their boo-boos, and tucks them in at night and then goes into the garage and plays Black Flag and Minor Threat songs at a criminal volume. He pays his taxes, votes in all the presidential and gubernatorial elections, serves on jury duty, and reserves the right to believe that there is a vast Right Wing Conspiracy and that the head of the P.T.A. is possibly in on it. He is a Punk Rock Dad.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IxfX_L8PVXcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Use a Fake Book : Fakin' Accompaniments from Melodies and Chord Symbols","description":"Finally!

Kahn offers a philosophical meditation on the problem of evil. He uses the Genesis story of the Fall as the starting point for a profound articulation of the human condition. Kahn shows us that evil expresses the rage of a subject who knows both that he is an image of an infinite God and that he must die. Kahn's interpretation of Genesis leads him to inquiries into a variety of modern forms of evil, including slavery, torture, and genocide. Kahn takes issue with Hannah Arendt's theory of the banality of evil, arguing that her view is an instance of the modern world's lost capacity to speak of evil. Psychological, social, and political accounts do not explain evil as much as explain it away. Focusing on the existential roots of evil rather than on the occasions for its appearance, Kahn argues that evil originates in man's flight from death. He urges us to see that the opposite of evil is not good, but love: while evil would master death, love would transcend it. Offering a unique perspective that combines political and cultural theory, law, and philosophy, Kahn here continues his project of advancing a political theology of modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8GqSudzNh1wC&dq=The+trouble+with+Eden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooky book","description":"Provides recipes for making many different kinds of cookies, with instructions in baking techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0Cd4xgEACAAJ&dq=Cooky+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Temptations Peculiar to the Sanctified","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v1-pHAAACAAJ&dq=Temptations+Peculiar+to+the+Sanctified&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wagon Wheels: A Contemporary Journey on the Oregon Trail","description":"When Horse-Drawn wagons retraced the Oregon Trail to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Great Migration, Candy Moulton, as a correspondent for the Casper Star-Tribune, climbed into the lead wagon driven by Ben Kern.

But if you're a biologist with little or no programming experience, starting out in Perl can be a challenge. Many biologists have a difficult time learning how to apply the language to bioinformatics. The most popular Perl programming books are often too theoretical and too focused on computer science for a non-programming biologist who needs to solve very specific problems.Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics is designed to get you quickly over the Perl language barrier by approaching programming as an important new laboratory skill, revealing Perl programs and techniques that are immediately useful in the lab. Each chapter focuses on solving a particular bioinformatics problem or class of problems, starting with the simplest and increasing in complexity as the book progresses. Each chapter includes programming exercises and teaches bioinformatics by showing and modifying programs that deal with various kinds of practical biological problems. By the end of the book you'll have a solid understanding of Perl basics, a collection of programs for such tasks as parsing BLAST and GenBank, and the skills to take on more advanced bioinformatics programming. Some of the later chapters focus in greater detail on specific bioinformatics topics. This book is suitable for use as a classroom textbook, for self-study, and as a reference.The book covers: Programming basics and working with DNA sequences and strings Debugging your code Simulating gene mutations using random number generators Regular expressions and finding motifs in data Arrays, hashes, and relational databases Regular expressions and restriction maps Using Perl to parse PDB records, annotations in GenBank, and BLAST output","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OG2xVZnf_ckC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Private Bruckshaw's Diaries, 1915-16","description":"Krithia was a key objective in the land offensives; a killing ground greater than Anzac or Suvla. This book adds to the Gallipoli story and the preceding Battleground books on that campaign by recounting not only the landings at Helles of 25 April 1915, but also the subsequent bitter battles that followed in an attempt to capture the village and the vital high ground of Achi Baba. General Hunter-Weston s weakened 29th Division achieved little during the first two bloody battles of Krithia, even when reinforced by the Anzacs, 42nd Division, Royal Naval Division and the French. The allies had little to show from their costly daylight frontal attacks, apart from a slightly firmer footing ashore and a growing casualty list. As the military situation looked to degenerate into a Western Front style stalemate, General Sir Ian Hamilton pushed for a final battle of Krithia. Using Hunter-Weston s newly formed VIII Corps, and General Gouraud s French Corps Exp ditionnaire d Orient, the Third Battle of Krithia launched on 6 June 1915. Despite a promising start, the attack soon collapsed against a stubborn Turkish defence, and although some lessons had been learnt from earlier failures; underestimation of the enemy was not one of them. This is the true story, told using a rich mix of letters, diaries, photographs and maps, of Gallipoli's most costly battles. Gallipoli today is an exquisitely beautiful and tranquil place, with its turquoise waters, stretches of sandy beaches, wild flower covered meadows and pine forested heights, such a contrast to what occurred here over a hundred years ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UfNNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Private+Bruckshaw%27s+Diaries,+1915-16&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our New Baby (Cuddly Board Books)","description":"An introduction to the world of fluffy friends!

Only ten of thema\\"about 3 percenta\\"have been women. Why? In this updated version of Nobel Prize Women in Science, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores the reasons for this astonishing disparity by examining the lives and achievements of fifteen women scientists who either won a Nobel Prize or played a crucial role in a Nobel Prize - winning project. The book reveals the relentless discrimination these women faced both as students and as researchers. Their success was due to the fact that they were passionately in love with science. The book begins with Marie Curie, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics. Readers are then introduced to Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, Emmy Noether, Lise Meitner, Barbara McClintock, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Rosalind Franklin. These and other remarkable women portrayed here struggled against gender discrimination, raised families, and became political and religious leaders. They were mountain climbers, musicians, seamstresses, and gourmet cooks. Above all, they were strong, joyful women in love with discovery. Nobel Prize Women in Science is a startling and revealing look into the history of science and the critical and inspiring role that women have played in the drama of scientific progress.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nXR_8pxl8vEC&dq=Nobel+Prize&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paranormal: A Guide to the Unexplained","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_aaLswEACAAJ&dq=The+Paranormal:+A+Guide+to+the+Unexplained&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Wood to Ridge/O Choille Gu Bearradh","description":"This is both the first complete annotated edition of the letters exchanged by these major twentieth-century Scottish poets and the first major exploration of their long friendship and literary association. Spanning nearly fifty years, from 27 July 1934 to 23 July 1978, this engaging correspondence offers a revealing and sometimes intimate look at their lively dialogical exchanges on a broad range of topics from major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War and WW II, to the mundane challenges of daily life.The introductory chapters chart the development of MacDiarmid and MacLean's enduring friendship in relation to their quite different literary contexts and careers, discuss MacLean's significant contributions to MacDiarmid's Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry, and situate MacLean's literary innovations in terms of Gaelic modernism. They thus provide comparative critical insights into the influence of cultural nationalism on each writer's developing poetics, their work as translators, and their mutual influence on each other's careers. These private letters in which culture, politics, and modern history intersect offer a fascinating glimpse at the creative processes and collaborative work of Hugh MacDiarmid and Sorley MacLean.Key Features:* The first complete annotated edition of the correspondence between the two poets * The only major exploration of MacDiarmid and MacLean's friendship and literary association* Full biographical and historical Introduction, bibliography and appendices","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mpkkDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TUNNEL THROUGH TIME","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qu1dcDyFS4cC&dq=TUNNEL+THROUGH+TIME&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In My Room: Teenagers in Their Bedrooms","description":"Few teenagers welcome anyone in their bedrooms, least of all adults.

Salinger's interviews with her subjects accompany each photograph, illuminating the harsh realities of some of their lives.

In Recovered Roots, Yael Zerubavel illuminates this dynamic process by examining the construction of Israeli national tradition. In the years leading to the birth of Israel, Zerubavel shows, Zionist settlers in Palestine consciously sought to rewrite Jewish history by reshaping Jewish memory. Zerubavel focuses on the nationalist reinterpretation of the defense of Masada against the Romans in 73 C.E. and the Bar Kokhba revolt of 133-135; and on the transformation of the 1920 defense of a new Jewish settlement in Tel Hai into a national myth. Zerubavel demonstrates how, in each case, Israeli memory transforms events that ended in death and defeat into heroic myths and symbols of national revival. Drawing on a broad range of official and popular sources and original interviews, Zerubavel shows that the construction of a new national tradition is not necessarily the product of government policy but a creative collaboration between politicans, writers, and educators. Her discussion of the politics of commemoration demonstrates how rival groups can turn the past into an arena of conflict as they posit competing interpretations of history and opposing moral claims on the use of the past. Zerubavel analyzes the emergence of counter-memories within the reality of Israel's frequent wars, the ensuing debates about the future of the occupied territories, and the embattled relations with Palestinians. A fascinating examination of the interplay between history and memory, this book will appeal to historians, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and folklorists, as well as to scholars of cultural studies, literature, and communication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vvalCdL_0q0C&dq=Recovered+Roots:+Collective+Memory+and+the+Making+of+Israeli+National+Tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painless Science Projects (Painless...(Pb))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UJsB0MDdrVoC&dq=Painless+Science+Projects+(Painless...(Pb))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Veron: Corals of Australia and the Indo-Pacific","description":"The first reference of its kind, this book represents good biology, well-founded systematics, accessible biogeography, geological history of corals, and one of the finest collections of coral photographs to be found anywhere.

Now, in her magnificent work of storytelling and imagination Margaret George bring us Henry VIII's story as he himself might have told it, in memoirs interspersed with irreverent comments from his jester and confident, Will Somers.

From humble peasant beginnings Repin rose to a place of artistic pre-eminence and international acclaim and was the most important influence in shaping a distinctly Russian school of art. Through a series of successful but controversial works he addressed such issues as the hard lives of the peasants, the fate of revolutionary activists and Russian history, as well as painting some of the nation's greatest cultural figures, many of whom - such as Tolstoy, Mussorgsky and Gorky - he counted as personal friends. The Russian Vision: The Art of Ilya Repin presents the life and work of the most celebrated Russian painted of his generation. A comprehensive survey of Repin's oeuvre, featuring a wealth of little-seen paintings; dramatic, distinctive images that evoke the hardships, pleasures and everyday routines of Russian society in the twilight years of Tsarist rule. Having declined in the twentieth century, Repin's reputation is growing again. Combining close readings of all his major canvases, as well as many of his lesser-known works, within the broader context of Russian art, society and culture, written in an accessible style, David Jackson's book, featuring more than 100 colour plates of Repin's work, and telling the story of his life, will do much to help restore his stature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkvJrQEACAAJ&dq=Ilya+Repin,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Portable Do It (The Life 101 Series)","description":"For those who enjoyed the popular Life 101, here's a wonderful little 4 1/2 x 6 miniature, containing 179 excerpts chosen by the authors and 177 favorite quotes from the original.

In this gripping account, Anthony Collings takes us into the world of independent journalists, and the daily challenges they face confronting dictators, hostile military, and narcoterrorists. Unfettered by any ties to those in positions of power, these guerrilla journalists are often the first on a story whether reporting on corruption in Mexico, organized crime in Russia, or sexual scandal in the Middle East and accordingly face the brunt of their subject's wrath.Collings, who has himself been held captive while on assignment, here focuses less on those nations in which the press is either largely free (such as the U.S. or Western European democracies) or aggressively restricted (as in China), and more on those \\"battleground countries\\" where the eventual outcome of the struggle between state and fourth estate remains unclear. Relying on interviews, professional contacts, and his own experiences, Collings explores the dilemmas and strategies of journalists who persevere in the face of war, repressive governments, and criminal aggression, with particular emphasis on the role of the Internet.At a time when journalism is increasingly a profession under siege, Words of Fire forces into the spotlight a more positive side of the profession, those who pursue journalism not for profit or fame but as a personal crusade.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P9mKDAEACAAJ&dq=Words+of+Fire:+Independent+Journalists+who+Challenge+Dictators,+Drug+Lords,+and+Other+Enemies+of+a+Free+Press&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baudrillard: A Critical Reader (Blackwell Critical Reader)","description":"Self-described \\"intellectual terrorist\\" Jean Baudrillard is one of the most important and provocative writers of the contemporary era.

Only the year before, three astronauts had burned to death in their spacecraft, and since then the Apollo program had suffered one setback after another. Meanwhile, the Russians were winning the space race, the Cold War was getting hotter by the month, and President Kennedy s promise to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade seemed sure to be broken. But when Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders were summoned to a secret meeting and told of the dangerous mission, they instantly signed on. Written with all the color and verve of the best narrative non-fiction, Apollo 8 takes us from Mission Control to the astronaut s homes, from the test labs to the launch pad. The race to prepare an untested rocket for an unprecedented journey paves the way for the hair-raising trip to the moon. Then, on Christmas Eve, a nation that has suffered a horrendous year of assassinations and war is heartened by an inspiring message from the trio of astronauts in lunar orbit. And when the mission is over after the first view of the far side of the moon, the first earth-rise, and the first re-entry through the earth s atmosphere following a flight to deep space the impossible dream of walking on the moon suddenly seems within reach. The full story of Apollo 8 has never been told, and only Jeffrey Kluger Jim Lovell s co-author on their bestselling book about Apollo 13 can do it justice. Here is the tale of a mission that was both a calculated risk and a wild crapshoot, a stirring account of how three American heroes forever changed our view of the home planet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xAZRDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leadership and Management in Nursing","description":"This new edition focuses on preparing your students to assume the role as a significant member of the health-care team and manager of care, and is designed to help your students transition to professional nursing practice.

He examines Muslim separatism against a background of more than four hundred years of political relations among indigenous Muslim rulers, their subjects, and external powers seeking the subjugation of Philippine Muslims. He also explores the motivations of the ordinary men and women who fight in armed separatist struggles and investigates the formation of nationalist identities. A skillful meld of historical detail and ethnographic research, Muslim Rulers and Rebels makes a compelling contribution to the study of protest, rebellion, and revolution worldwide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wYvwWcL0_DIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quantum Leap Thinking: An Owner's Guide to the Mind","description":"\\"You've certainly hit the nail on the head.

For this special twentieth anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be. Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, Celebration of Discipline explores the \\"classic Disciplines,\\" or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found. Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study, offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service, help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration, bring us nearer to one another and to God. Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities-and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and \\"bring the abundance of God into our lives.\\" He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and \\"sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others.\\" The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance, for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. Celebration of Discipline will help motivate Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_92CMWUPv3UC&dq=Pursuing+Sexual+Wholeness+(The+Healing+Center+of+Vineyard+Christian+Fellowship+*San+Francisco%22+Presents:+Ministering+Healing+to+the+Sexually+Broken,+September+18-20+1992)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord Gilmore's Bride","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OLT9AAAACAAJ&dq=Lord+Gilmore%27s+Bride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lyrical Studies for Trumpet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qW39MQAACAAJ&dq=Lyrical+Studies+for+Trumpet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading with Meaning: Teaching Comprehension in the Primary Grades","description":"In the second edition of Reading with Meaning, Debbie Miller shares her new thinking about comprehension strategy instruction, the gradual release of responsibility instructional model, and planning for student engagement and independence.

Reveals the protocols of a traditional ayahuasca retreat and the importance of its ritual diet, isolation, and sacred songs ? Relates an extensive personal account of the traditional indigenous use of ayahuasca for healing and revelation Ayahuasca: The Visionary and Healing Powers of the Vine of the Soul is an autobiographical account of the author s work with ayahuasca, a potent and sacred plant brew of the Amazon region that is known for its extraordinary visionary and healing powers. As she learned from her experience, with the help of ayahuasca we are able to grasp our paradoxical nature, the first step to acceptance of ourselves in both our glorious and dark aspects. Ayahuasca teaches us how to release the illusions we hold about ourselves and makes it possible to integrate our many diverse aspects to acquire our true power. This book reveals the ritual protocols that must be followed prior to partaking of ayahuasca, including the traditional preparatory  diet --which requires enduring austere conditions, isolation, and only small amounts of bland food before receiving the powers of the plant spirit from an ayahuasquero, a healing master--and the sacred songs, icaros, that are sung when imbibing the substance. Although the use of ayahuasca is growing among  underground  spiritual seekers and through the burgeoning ayahuasca tourism trade in South America, few of its seekers understand how it is used traditionally and the importance of the rituals the indigenous people follow. With this book, the author hopes to restore the importance of these indigenous practices so that we may truly understand all the gifts of ayahuasca.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dJb8GwAACAAJ&dq=Ayahuasca:+The+Visionary+and+Healing+Powers+of+the+Vine+of+the+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hound of the Baskervilles","description":"When Sir Charles Baskerville dies suddenly from a heart attack, a rumour of a deadly, supernatural giant dog, who may have been persecuted for generations, begins to circulate in the village. When Sir Henry Baskerville arrives from Canada for the legacy of the Baskerville manor in England, the skeptical Sherlock Holmes is called to help with the case. Was the death of Sir Charles Baskerville really a heart attack or maybe an animal lurking in deserted moors? Will Baskerville's new owner become the next victim of the dog?

Western students of Asian martial arts have long been haunted by the aching suspicion that something is missing from the arts they love and practice wholeheartedly something intangible, but something so essential that its absence leaves an unbridgeable void. For many, that missing ingredient is a true and thorough knowledge of the body's vital points: what they are, where they are, how to quickly find them under duress, how to use them, constructively or for destruction and how to recognize them in the kata, hyung, or forms they thought they knew so well. In Pressure Point Fighting, martial arts expert Rick Clark offers a systematic introduction to this knowledge and to the tools needed to ferret out more of this information from forms and techniques already in place knowledge and tools that are not dependent upon acceptance of the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine, or modern Western medicine, for that matter, but which are based solely on open-minded observation and willingness to try new, or old, approaches to martial arts training.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=corQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The \\"Drifters\\" (Rock Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3w86PgAACAAJ&dq=The+%22Drifters%22+(Rock+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Main Street Festivals: Traditional and Unique Events on America's Main Streets (National Trust City Guides)","description":"Main Street America is kicking up its heels--and you're invited tothe party!

When Dennis is thirteen, he sees a series of photographs of a boy apparently unimaginably mutilated. Dennis is not shocked but stunned by their mystery and their power; their glimpse at the reality of death. Some years later, Dennis meets the boy who posed for the photographs. He did it for love. Surrounded by images of violence, the celebrity of horror, news of disease, a wasteland of sex, Dennis flies to Europe, having discovered some clues about the photographs:  I see these criminals on the news who ve killed someone methodically, and they re free. They know something amazing. You can just tell.  An isolated windmill in Holland provides the perfect setting for Dennis to find out more about bodies of which there are many and what is inside them. In Frisk, as in the award-winning Closer, Dennis Cooper explores the limits of our knowledge and the dividing line between the body and the spirit. Frisk is a novel about the power of fantasy and faith, about the ecstasy and horror of being human.  A significant work of fiction.

It is a pioneering history based on contemporary records, diaries, private and public autobiographies, and on the childhood recollections of living descendants. Never before have the intimacies of life above and below stairs been depicted with such clarity and vividness. Country house family and servants were the two elites of British society and this was the period of their greatest prosperity. They were closely reliant on each other. 'Our servants and we are all members of a large family, who cannot get on independently of each other,' Lady Jenne wrote in 1892. The omnipresence of the servants affected every aspect of the family's behavior and the family shared the lives of the servants: the country house was a community. The power base of the nation's political establishment, it was also home - a tangible symbol of lineage, permanence and stability, embodying in its fabric, decoration and ritual the accumulations and memories of successive generations. The book is illustrated with rare contemporary photographs, is fully referenced, has a wide ranging bibliography of primary and secondary sources, and is comprehensively indexed. Its evocation of a style of life and ways of living that have now largely vanished will be of equal interest to scholar, student and general reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L12BQgAACAAJ&dq=Country+House+Life:+Family+and+Servants+1815-1914+(Family,+Sexuality+and+Social+Relations+in+Past+Times)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Proxy Server 2 Exam Cram (Exam: 70-088)","description":"Providing a special Exam Cram Sheet with tips, acronyms, and memory joggers that readers can take with them to the exam, this book serves as a complement to study guides for Exam #70-078: Implementing and Supporting Proxy Server 2.

Whether a photograph of a national library or a lounge at Volkswagen's headquarters, H?fer's images ask us to conduct distanced, disengaged examinations through the windows she creates. The collected images present a universe wholly constructed by human intention, unearthing patterns of order and logic imposed on these spaces by their absent creators and inhabitants. The Architecture of Absence examines H?fer's oeuvre and its relationship to the work of other noted students of renowned professors Bernd and Hilla Becher. An exhibition of this work will open at the University Art Museum at California State University, Long Beach in January 2005, and travel to the co-organizing museum, the Norton Museum in Florida, among other venues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdVTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Candida+Hofer:+Architecture+Of+Absence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redeye (Thorndike Large Print Popular Series)","description":"Two brothers, each unaware of the other's existence, experience a mysterious psychic connection that has treasonous Soviet leaders plotting to kill the General Secretary and frame the U.S. for the deed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EJa3zgEACAAJ&dq=Redeye+(Thorndike+Large+Print+Popular+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birding (Nature Company Guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pv-GtAEACAAJ&dq=Birding+(Nature+Company+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mists from Beyond","description":"Celtic myths for modern people.

Modernist writers understood themselves to be living in an epochal moment when the design and meaning of home life were reconceived. Moving among literature, architecture, design, science, and technology, Machines for Living shows how the modernization of the home led to profound changes in domestic life and relied on a set of emergent concepts, including standardization, scientific method, functionalism, efficiency science, and others, that form the basis of literary modernism and stand at the confluence of modernism and modernity. Even as modernist writers criticized the expanding reach of modernization into the home, they drew on its conceptual vocabulary to develop both the thematic and formal commitments of literary modernism. Rosner's work develops a new methodology for interdisciplinary modernist studies and shows how the reinvention of domestic life is central to modernist literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=azTNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All About Stock Market Strategies : The Easy Way To Get Started","description":"ALL ABOUT . . .

Delivered during World War II when one after another of Thielicke's meeting places were bombed, the lectures were aimed at people who were not conventional churchgoers and were not accustomed to the language and premises of the church. They were people who had to be met on their own ground, and then introduced to the Christian faith. Thielicke had a unique gift for finding the point of contact and addressing the Gospel to this point.

The author of fifteen New York Times national bestsellers, Ann Rule, a former Seattle policewoman, has researched thousands of homicides and understands every facet of murder investigation. Now, in the most complex and shocking book of her long career, she delves into the motivation that drove a seemingly successful man to kill, and she explores heretofore unknown aspects of a fatal affair between a beautiful young woman who moved confidently in the heady world of the upper echelons of government and a widely admired millionaire attorney who was an immensely popular political figure. On June 27, 1996, thirty-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, who was the scheduling secretary for the governor of Delaware, had dinner with a man she had been having a secret affair with for more than two years. \\"Tommy\\" Capano, forty-seven, was perhaps the most politically powerful man in Wilmington. Son of a wealthy contractor, former state prosecutor, partner in a prestigious law firm, advisor to governors and mayors, Tom Capano had a soft-spoken and considerate manner that endeared him to many. Although recently estranged from his wife, he was a devoted father to his four beautiful young daughters, the trusted son of his widowed mother, and the backbone of his extended family. But sometime after 9:15 that night when Anne Marie and Tom left a Philadelphia restaurant, something terrible happened to Anne Marie. It would be forty-eight hours before her brothers and sisters realized that she had disappeared entirely. Ann Rule brilliantly traces the lives of both Fahey and Capano as she discloses the intimate details of their ill-fated bonding. A vulnerable, trusting woman becomes spellbound by a charming, duplicitous married man, and what begins as a seemingly unremarkable affair is slowly transformed into an obsessive, convoluted, and deadly relationship. Through her impeccable research, Rule peels away layer after layer of deception to reveal a man who lived a secret life for decades, a man so greedy that he would sacrifice anyone to gain what he desired. One of his many mistresses all of whom were unknown to one another was Deborah MacIntyre, an attractive and wealthy member of one of Wilmington's oldest families and an administrator of an elite private school. She, too, would become part of the mystery surrounding Anne Marie's disappearance. As three prominent families are destroyed to satisfy one man's jealous obsessions, this unfathomable tragedy becomes a tale that few would believe if it were presented as fiction. Shockingly, it is all true. Destined to become a classic, And Never Let Her Go is a riveting account of forbidden love and murder among the rich and powerful, and a chilling insight into the evil that sometimes hides behind even the most charming fa?ade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sSfrBkvh_LQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Secondhand Wife (Harlequin Historical)","description":"NOAH CUTTER WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD  Scarred in body and soul, rancher Noah didn't consider himself fit company for anyone.

Unheralded by the general public, the blind pianist's work was revered by many jazz greats including the legendary Charlie Parker. Tristano's persuasive personality made him an ideal teacher, and he proved that (against the accepted theory of the time) jazz improvisation could be taught. His guidance played a big part in the development of many instrumentalists including saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh and double-bassist Peter Ind. It is Ind's long, direct involvement with his subject that makes this such a revealing book: the story of an English musician going to New York to study with a neglected Jazz giant. In the process, Tristano's genius is examined and his reputation revalued, with Ind making a persuasive case for the pianist to be placed at the centre of jazz developments in the mid-20th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmcZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Jazz+Visions:+Lennie+Tristano+and+His+Legacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the American water towers","description":"Gathers photographs of watertowers in the U.S., Great Britain, Germany, and France and describes the authors approach to industrial photography","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IPdwQgAACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+American+water+towers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bel Hana Cookbook: Over 120 Authentic Recipes from Egypt and an Additional 24 Recipes from the Middle East","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q5j6vQEACAAJ&dq=Bel+Hana+Cookbook:+Over+120+Authentic+Recipes+from+Egypt+and+an+Additional+24+Recipes+from+the+Middle+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adult Development and Aging","description":"Written within a bio-psychosocial framework, Cavanaugh and Blanchard-Fields' best-selling text covers the specific ages-stages of adult development and aging.

A Family Farm is the personal story of one such farm from 1916 to 1991, told from the perspectives of four generations. The story begins with the author's grandparents, whose primitive way of farming in northern Illinois, described in evocative detail, was closer to the nineteenth century than to the twentieth. Their daughter, the author's mother, loses her hopes for a scholarly life during the Great Depression, and though bookish and unsuited to farm life returns to the farm with her husband, who describes in his own words his youthful years on a poor Illinois farm and as a rural schoolteacher. The family attempts to modernize the old farm and introduce up-to-date agricultural techniques, but their sons, the author and his brother, leave the farm after high school and unwittingly doom it to failure. It is the author's children who provide a brighter perspective, delighting in visits to their grandparents' farm even as they grow aware of its decline. A Family Farm ends with an elegiac description of death and of the winter auction at which the accumulation of seventy-five years of hard work and frugal living is sold to the highest bidder. Richly illustrated with art work, photographs, and documents, and set within the context of current trends in agricultural economics and rural life, A Family Farm offers an intimate and historical perspective on a now vanished way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YqvvygAACAAJ&dq=Life+on+a+Dairy+Farm+(Life+on+a+Farm)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hail to the Chiefs: Or How to Tell Your Polks from Your Tylers","description":"Offers a satiric look at the life, character, and accomplishments of each president from Washington to Reagan","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hYsMAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hail+to+the+Chiefs:+Or+How+to+Tell+Your+Polks+from+Your+Tylers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Group Leaders' Handbook: The Next Generation","description":"Now completely rewritten, updated and expanded for a new generation of small group leaders, this IVP classic contains everything you need to know about small groups: starting with a strong biblical and strategic foundation; building in 4 key components--community, nurture, worship and outreach; guiding the group through its life stages; creating good communication; handling conflict in the group; encouraging members to \\"own\\" the group; planning group meetings; and developing leadership skills.And besides warm, wise counsel, Small Group Leaders' Handbook includes a resource section that's overflowing with great ideas: ice breakers, application steps, community-building projects, outreach tips and much more!Whether you are starting a new group, working to get a group back on track, or introducing a small group program as part of church or parachurch ministry, here is your ticket to effective foundations, training and practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T_BdDwAAQBAJ&dq=Small+Group+Leaders%27+Handbook:+The+Next+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oriental philosophies,","description":"With an inside view from an expert in the field and a clear and engaging writing style, Asian Philosophies, Seventh Edition invites students and professors to think along with the great minds of the Asian traditions.

Prayer, though central to all denominations, remains mysterious to many. Here, the distinct yet complementary voices of Mother Teresa and Brother Roger honor prayer as the wellspring of love and compassion and illuminate it as an integral part of everday life. \\"In reality, there is only one true prayer, only one substantial prayer: Christ himself,\\" writes Mother Teresa. \\"There is only one voice of Christ. Prayer is oneness with Christ.\\" Mother Teresa and Brother Roger first met in 1976 in Taize, France. Several months later, in Calcutta, they collaborated on what became the first of several joint appeals for Christian reconciliation. Their mutual agenda is clear -- a passionate commitment to the alleviation of human suffering and the use of prayer as a source of comfort, strength and communion with God. In their work and travels, both Mother Teresa and Brother Roger perceived a great hunger for guidance in prayer. The result is this inspirational text of short commentaries on how to use prayer in daily life. Comprised of 12 chapters, each written half by Brother Roger, Seeking the Heart of God is their wise and lyrical offering to those whose hunger is that of the spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y9dGHAAACAAJ&dq=Seeking+the+Heart+of+God:+Reflections+on+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sword of the Sun (Joe Dever's Legends of Lone Wolf, No 4)","description":"Lone Wolf sets sail from Qinefer on a desperate mission to retrieve the Sommerswerd and to defeat the Darklord Zagarna and his ruthless legions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5pd5AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sword+of+the+Sun+(Joe+Dever%27s+Legends+of+Lone+Wolf,+No+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tilly Trotter Widowed","description":"Tilly Trotter isn't like the other girls in the villages of County Durham.

His career also traces the transatlantic engagement of modern painting with the materials of its own making, a relationship that is perhaps still not completely understood. In these interrelated narratives, Hofmann is a central protagonist, providing a vital link between nineteenth- and twentieth-century art practice and between European and American modernism. The remarkable vitality of his later work affords insight not only into the style but also the literal substance of this formative period of artistic and material innovation. This richly illustrated book, the fourth in the Getty Conservation Institute s Artist s Materials series, presents a thorough examination of Hofmann s late-career materials. Initial chapters present an informative overview of Hofmann s life and work in Europe and America and discuss his crucial role in the development of Abstract Expressionism. Subsequent chapters present a detailed analysis of Hofmann s materials and techniques and explore the relationship of the artist s mature palette to shifts in the style and aging characteristics of his paintings. The book concludes with lessons for the conservation of modernist paintings generally, and particularly those that incorporate both traditional and modern paint media. This book will be of value to conservators, art historians, conservation scientists, and general readers with an interest in modern art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oAZVDQAAQBAJ&dq=Hans+Hofmann%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aberystwyth Mon Amour","description":"Schoolboys are disappearing all over Aberystwyth and nobody knows why.

The symbolic and ritual acts that served to represent and legitimate monarchical power in medieval and early modern Europe include not only royal and papal coronations but also festive entries, inaugural feasts, and rulers' funerals. Fifteen leading scholars from North America, Britain, France, Germany, Poland, and Denmark explore the forms and the underlying meanings of such events, as well as problems of relevant scholarship on these subjects. All the contributions demonstrate the importance of in-depth study of rulership for the understanding of premodern power structures. Emphasis is placed on interdisciplinary approaches, drawing on the findings of ethnography and anthropology, combined with rigorous critical evaluation of the written and iconic evidence. The editor's historiographical introduction surveys the past and present of this field of study and proposes some new lines of inquiry. \\"For 'reality' is not a one-dimensional matter: even if we can establish what actually transpired, we still need to ask how it was perceived by those present.\\" This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

It is also the story of every believer who is searching for the Church. Where Christ is Lord. Where holiness, human responsibility, and the sovereignty of God are preached. Where fellowship is more than a covered-dish supper in the church basement. And where fads and fashions take a backseat to apostolic worship and doctrine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5EEQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Becoming+Orthodox:+A+Journey+to+the+Ancient+Christian+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Lands, New Men: America and the Second Great Age of Discovery","description":"For more than 600 years, Western civilization has relied on exploration to learn about a wider world and universe. The Great Ages of Discovery details the different eras of Western exploration in terms of its locations, its intellectual contexts, the characteristic moral conflicts that underwrote encounters, and the grand gestures that distill an age into its essence. Historian and MacArthur Fellow Stephen J. Pyne identifies three great ages of discovery in his fascinating new book. The first age of discovery ranged from the early 15th to the early 18th century, sketched out the contours of the globe, aligned with the Renaissance, and had for its grandest expression the circumnavigation of the world ocean. The second age launched in the latter half of the 18th century, spanning into the early 20th century, carrying the Enlightenment along with it, pairing especially with settler societies, and had as its prize achievement the crossing of a continent. The third age began after World War II, and, pivoting from Antarctica, pushed into the deep oceans and interplanetary space. Its grand gesture is Voyager s passage across the solar system. Each age had in common a galvanic rivalry: Spain and Portugal in the first age, Britain and France followed by others in the second, and the USSR and USA in the third. With a deep and passionate knowledge of the history of Western exploration, Pyne takes us on a journey across hundreds of years of geographic trekking. The Great Ages of Discovery is an interpretive companion to what became Western civilization s quest narrative, with the triumphs and tragedies that grand journey brought, the legacies of which are still very much with us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oG0QEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muffletumps a Story of Four Dolls","description":"The Delightful story of four dolls.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oz44GQAACAAJ&dq=Muffletumps+a+Story+of+Four+Dolls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fat Quarter Quilting: Fast, Fun, Done","description":"Take your quilting from \\"fun\\" to \\"done\\" in no time. &break;&break;Transform your fat quarters into 25 quick and easy coordinated projects from author Sue Penn. &break;&break;Use this easy-to-follow instructions in Fat Quarter Quilting to whip up accessories that are perfect for last-minute gifts, create cuddly throws to chase away the chills and quilt bedding sets that'll give plenty of sweet dreams. &break;&break;Fat Quarter Quilting includes: &break;&break;300 illustrations and 100 full-color photos &break;&break;Full-size applique patterns &break;&break;Step-by-step instructions for 25 projects, including bed-sized quilts, wall hangings and dining and home decor accessories","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EIRpuQEACAAJ&dq=Fat+Quarter+Quilting:+Fast,+Fun,+Done&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A guide to patterns and usage in English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DLoIAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+guide+to+patterns+and+usage+in+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Eliot (Past Masters)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BV-0nQAACAAJ&dq=George+Eliot+(Past+Masters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mayan Mission - Another Mission.

The essays in this book are not limited to the art world, however: He also discusses poetry, political and cultural theory, and popular culture. As wide-ranging, independent, and deeply probing as the essays of Walter Benjamin, Harold Rosenberg's The Tradition of the New is a true classic of twentieth-century criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x3MpswEACAAJ&dq=The+Tradition+of+the+New&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Publishing Photography: Marketing Images Making Money","description":"The tools photographers need to get published Got pictures?

The chapter authors are all principal investigators in an influential research initiative on cognitive science and education. Classroom Lessons describes their collaborations with classroom teachers aimed at improving teaching and learning for students in grades K-12. The eight projects cover writing, mathematics, history, social science, and physics. Together they illustrate that principles emerging from cognitive science form the basis of a science of instruction that can be applied across the curriculum. The book is divided into three sections: applications of cognitive research to teaching specific content areas; applications for learning across the curriculum; and applications that challenge traditional concepts of classroom-based learning environments. Chapters consider explicit models of knowledge with corresponding instruction designed to enable learners to build on that knowledge, acquisition of specified knowledge, and what knowledge is useful in contemporary curricula.

This breathtaking sweep of sea and coastline - dominated by Vesuvius and with Pozzuoli and Sorrento standing sentinel - was Douglas' first experience of Italy. It was here, on the island of Capri, that he died, some 55 years after first buying a villa in Naples. \\"Siren Land\\", Douglas' first travel book, is a homage to a part of the world that captivated him more than any other. Weaving the myths of the Sirens into the landscape and history of the region, Douglas writes with knowledge and an irrepressible exuberance of the past and the present, of legends and archaeology, folklore and daily life, patron saints, local ghosts, wine and the wind. As the summer draws to a close, Douglas' prose becomes suffused with a melancholy tinged with excitement at what still remains to be discovered: 'relics of Roman rule, of old Hellas, or medieval romance...These are the delights of Siren Land'. 'What makes \\"Siren Land\\" exceptional is the quality of the telling. Weaving scholarship, impressions, fact and fantasy into an intricate fabric as enchantingly entertaining and full of human interest as the best of fairy tales or ancient myths. One of the most memorable books of its genre' - Mark Holloway, in his introduction to \\"Siren Land\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V-NiEAAAQBAJ&dq=Siren+land,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*OP Hunter: Holy War (Hunter: The Reckoning)","description":"For centuries, supernatural powers have reigned, warring among themselves, culling the human herds and lashing out from the shadows.

First published in 1962, Leicester s biography provides a revealing and intimate portrait of one of the great writers of our century. Ernest Hemingway was a legend in his own time, whose life was as dramatic as any of the characters in his novels and short stories. He won both the Nobel and the Pulitzer prizes for literature, and the literary style he created has been imitated but never matched. Leicester was the archetypal kid brother, 16 years younger than the great man, whom he adored and in whose footsteps he followed, becoming a respected writer, sharing his brother s love for high risk and adventure, and, when his health failed, choosing to end his own life as Ernest had done. In this poignant biography, Leicester has given us insight into his world-renowned brother s life and career as no one else could. His reminiscences allow us to better understand what prompted so many of the familiar Hemingway responses, and the experiences from which he derived material for his novels and stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JZHVCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Runaway Bridesmaid (Harlequin American Romance)","description":"It's not who youre running from ... it's who you're running to ...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f-4OXrI3-SkC&dq=The+Runaway+Bridesmaid+(Harlequin+American+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*OP Hunter Book: Wayward","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_I25IUpgfdIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Niagara Falls All Over Again","description":"By turns graceful and knowing, funny and moving, Niagara Falls All Over Again is the latest masterwork by National Book Award finalist and author of The Giant s House, Elizabeth McCracken. Spanning the waning years of vaudeville and the golden age of Hollywood, Niagara Falls All Over Again chronicles a flawed, passionate friendship over thirty years, weaving a powerful story of family and love, grief and loss. In it, McCracken introduces her most singular and affecting hero: Mose Sharp son, brother, husband, father, friend ... and straight man to the fat guy in baggy pants who utterly transforms his life. To the paying public, Mose Sharp was the arch, colorless half of the comedy team Carter and Sharp. To his partner, he was charmed and charming, a confirmed bachelor who never failed at love and romance. To his father and sisters, Mose was a prodigal son. And in his own heart and soul, he would always be a boy who once had a chance to save a girl s life a girl who would be his first, and greatest, loss. Born into a Jewish family in small-town Iowa, the only boy among six sisters, Mose Sharp couldn t leave home soon enough. By sixteen Mose had already joined the vaudeville circuit. But he knew one thing from the start:  I needed a partner,  he recalls.  I had always needed a partner.  Then, an ebullient, self-destructive comedian named Rocky Carter came crashing into his life and a thirty-year partnership was born. But as the comedy team of Carter and Sharp thrived from the vaudeville backwaters to Broadway to Hollywood, a funny thing happened amid the laughter: It was Mose who had all the best lines offstage. Rocky would go through money, women, and wives in his restless search for love; Mose would settle down to a family life marked by fragile joy and wrenching tragedy. And soon, cracks were appearing in their complex relationship ... until one unforgivable act leads to another and a partnership begins to unravel. In a novel as daring as it is compassionate, Elizabeth McCracken introduces an indelibly drawn cast of characters from Mose s Iowa family to the vagabond friends, lovers, and competitors who share his dizzying journey as she deftly explores the fragile structures that underlie love affairs and friendships, partnerships and families. An elegiac and uniquely American novel, Niagara Falls All Over Again is storytelling at its finest and powerful proof that Elizabeth McCracken is one of the most dynamic and wholly original voices of her generation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IsKJDQAAQBAJ&dq=Niagara+Falls+All+Over+Again&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red State, Blue State: Defending the Liberal Jesus and Blue State Morality from Red State Religion and Hypocrisy","description":"The presidential election of 2004 demonstrated that the United States is divided in a number of ways-not only, by the ever-present alienation between conservatives and liberals. Religion and politics have become intertwined and a new trend is sweeping the nation that accompanies the ever-widening rift between conservative and liberal Christians. We are a divided nation.In Red State, Blue State, author John Grevstad challenges the ideals and morality of the conservative right. How would the traditional moral values of the Red State conservative hold up to the words and philosophy of Jesus Christ himself? Grevstad both asks and answers the question. Citing Biblical text, Grevstad alleges that Jesus was a \\"card-carrying liberal\\" whose message has been destroyed by Red State conservatives. Additionally, Grevstad uses a humorous tone and clever insights as he compares the lifestyle, values, and culture of Red States and Blue States.

In the countryside, illiterate peasants - the majority of the population - still scratched out a living from the soil, while in the cities, merchants hawked their wares in open-air market stalls and nobles led lives of opulent leisure. Yet everywhere were unmistakable signs that all of this would soon change forever. Spread by France's seemingly invincible citizens' army, the seeds of republicanism had been planted throughout Europe. In the Americas, the United States had proved to the world the feasibility of a government of, by, and for the people, and Mexico was threatening to follow its lead. And while it still took four months for an official dispatch to travel from London to Calcutta, Europe's leading nations - France and England - had established global empire-building strategies. In the year 1800, the world suddenly found itself enmeshed in a web of money, war, and political intrigue, out of which a new world - our world - was struggling to be born. Bringing all his talents as a first-rate storyteller to bear, Bernier takes us inside the courts and parliaments of the major powers to listen in on the political discourse of the day. He leads us into the boudoirs and ballrooms of the rich, the cramped homes of the middle class, and the hovels of the poor to provide an intimate glimpse of the private lives of the first modern men and women. A spellbinding account of one of the most momentous chapters in the story of civilization, The World in 1800 is a singular achievement by a premier historian and an irresistible read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L_NHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Faerie Journals 2006 Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-8fAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Faerie+Journals+2006+Calendar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring Celtic Druidism (Exploring Series)","description":"Covering the basics of Celtic shamanism, with reference to traditional lore and source materials through the lens of both ancient and modern Druidry and shamanic practice, The Druid Shaman is a well rounded guide, showing the seamless cross over between Druidry and shamanism in the Celtic tradition.

Overcoming age-old racial, regional, and political differences, Americans of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Spanish-language origins are beginning to imagine themselves as a single ethnic community - which by the turn of the century may become the United States' largest and most influential minority. Only in recent years have great numbers of Hispanics begun to consider themselves as related within a single culture. Hispanics are redefining their own images and agendas, shaping a population, and paving wider pathways to power. In the process, they are changing both themselves and the culture, government, and urban habits of the communities around them. In this ground-breaking book, Geoffrey Fox shows how and why Hispanics are changing the United States. Based on interviews, observations, and extensive research, Hispanic Nation examines why such diverse people are imagining themselves as one; the politics of turning a statistical fiction into a social reality; the impact of the Spanish-language media on Hispanics' self-images; ethnic consciousness and political movements (Cesar Chavez and the farm workers movement, the Young Lords and La Raza Unida, Puerto Rican and Mexican encounters in the Midwest); controversies surrounding \\"high\\" and popular Hispanic/Latino art, music, and literature; and the institutionalization of the movement everywhere - from local school boards to the U.S. Congress.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5v1xHrkBzVQC&dq=Hispanic+Nation:+Culture,+Politics+and+the+Constructing+of+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ritual Body Art: Body Painting for Ritual & Magic","description":"A bride s nose piercing on her wedding day, soldiers comparing their flash tattoos in the 1940s, face painting at a sporting match, a Yamatji woman s tattoo of the spirit of all Aboriginal women   the meanings behind body art are as varied as the individuals who wear them.

She thought the clairvoyance that allowed her to witness crimes as they happened had been destroyed in the nightmare of her past. Then one night it returned with a vengeance, and she desperately needed to find someone to make it stop. Detective Dane Hollister of the Orlando police department had never met anyone like Marlie. He had doubts about her clairvoyance, but there was no doubt how much he desired her. Her soft, sweet scent set his blood afire, and he wanted to wrap her in his arms and chase the sadness from her eyes. To Marlie, Dane was all heat and hard muscle, and he made her body come alive as it never had before. But not even she could foresee where their passion would lead: a hungry quest for the elusive, dreamy ecstasies of love...and a dangerous journey into the twisted mind of a madman who would threaten their happiness and their lives.... After the Night A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, Faith Devlin had always adored the town's golden boy from afar. But he called her white trash that sultry Southern night when his rich, respected father disappeared, along with her pretty mom. Now Faith wanted to hate Gray Rouillard...not to feel a powerful surge of desire. But she couldn't quench her passion, any more than she could hide the truth about the past she had waited so long to unravel. Even when he raised hell, Gray Rouillard did it with style. Reckless, charming, and backed by Rouillard money, Gray controlled the town of Prescott -- and Devlin was a name he never wanted to hear again. But when he gazed at Faith Devlin, all he saw was a swirl of tangled sheets and her silken flesh beneath him. To care for her was impossible, unthinkable...because Gray Rouillard planned to use all his power to ruin her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p6UvslDgjCcC&dq=Night+Moves+:+Dream+Man/After+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Four Insights: Wisdom, Power, and Grace of the Earthkeepers","description":"The Four Insights are the wisdom teachings that have been protected by secret societies of Earth keepers, the medicine men and women of the Americas.

Identified with repression, bigotry, and fanaticism by his enemies, he has been judged more by the political events of his reign than by his person. This book, published four hundred years after Philip's death, is the first full-scale biography of the king. Placing him within the social, cultural, religious, and regional context of his times, it presents a startling new picture of his character and reign. Drawing on Philip's unpublished correspondence and on many other archival sources, Henry Kamen reveals much about Philip the youth, the man, the husband, the father, the frequently troubled Christian, and the king. Kamen finds that Philip was a cosmopolitan prince whose extensive experience of northern Europe broadened his cultural imagination and tastes, whose staunchly conservative ideas were far from being illiberal and fanatical, whose religious attitudes led him to accept a practical coexistence with Protestants and Jews, and whose support for Las Casas and other defenders of the Indians in America helped determine government policy. Shedding completely new light on most aspects of Philip's private life and, in consequence, on his public actions, the book is the definitive portrayal of Philip II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r3rxf_9CipEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Original Sprite and Midget (Original Series)","description":"From the 1958 'Frogeye' Austin-Healey Sprite to the last rubber-bumpered MG Midget of 1979, all 14 distinct versions of these much loved cars are studied, with a special section on Innocenti models.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=usoCtwAACAAJ&dq=Original+Sprite+and+Midget+(Original+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting for Bread and Roses: A Novel","description":"On January 12, 1912, an army of textile workers stormed out of the mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, commencing what has since become known as the \\"Bread and Roses\\" strike.

Winter activities include trimming and pruning the orchard, seed shopping, and baking bread. To conclude your year on the farm, learn what you can do to support the farmers who pick our carrots and raise the cows for our milk. A glossary defines key sustainable farming terms. Through this colorful and intimate look at life on a small-scale farm, children will learn not only how the farm feeds us, but how the farmer must feed and care for the farm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RoDZDwAAQBAJ&dq=Life+on+a+Chicken+Farm+(Life+on+a+Farm)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Collar, No Service: A Pooch Cafe Collection","description":"Sit on the couch. Speak. Engage in witty banter and share ideas with friends who really understand your predicaments. Sounds like the perfect cafe. Especially if you're a dog. Pooch Cafe is the home away from home for Poncho and his canine buddies. No Collar, No Service marks the second collection of the hip hit strip Pooch Cafe, named for the place where Poncho, Boomer, and the rest of their pals regularly gather to discuss life among the humans and to hatch their plans to catapult all the world's cats into space. But you won't find this spot on Main Street. Its actual location is a canine secret compromised just once when they tried to get a pizza delivered. Poncho is as passionate about his love for his master, Chazz, as he is about his distaste for kitties. When Poncho and Chazz move in with Carmen and her medley of cats, Poncho pals up with \\"Fish,\\" a goldfish who conveniently speaks dog, to learn the lay of the land. Poncho views his master's new life as a threat to the sacred man-dog bond, despite Carmen's efforts to make peace with Poncho using love, tenderness, and cheese. Good thing there's always the gang at the cafe. No Collar, No Service is the saga of a strip that captures the intensity of the human-dog bond in a way that resonates with pet lovers everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4mIPUELYynUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European Monetary Integration","description":"This text provides an unrivalled account of the history, theory and practice of monetary integration in Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SkyhAAAAIAAJ&dq=European+Monetary+Integration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A PRACTICAL GERMAN REVIEW GRAMMAR","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JkOAAAACAAJ&dq=A+PRACTICAL+GERMAN+REVIEW+GRAMMAR&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sir John Templeton: From Wall Street to Humility Theology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FTf-jwEACAAJ&dq=Sir+John+Templeton:+From+Wall+Street+to+Humility+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Gentleman and a Soldier (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1307) (Intimate Moments)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VsrfAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Gentleman+and+a+Soldier+(Silhouette+Intimate+Moments+No.+1307)+(Intimate+Moments)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YZzHtwEACAAJ&dq=Persian+Pilgrimages:+Journeys+Across+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Birds of the Big Bend (Texas Field Guide Series)","description":"This field guide offers information on the 450 bird species of the Big Bend, including behavior notes, status reports, statistics, records, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BLDB01eli8kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacopone da Todi: Lauds (Classics of Western Spirituality)","description":"Jacopone da Todi (c. 1230-1306) was a Franciscan and a poet .

Tuchman, Pulitzer Prizewinning author of The Guns of August, comes history through a wide-angle lens: a fascinating chronicle of Britain s long relationship with Palestine and the Middle East, from the ancient world to the twentieth century. Historically, the British were drawn to the Holy Land for two major reasons: first, to translate the Bible into English and, later, to control the road to India and access to the oil of the Middle East. With the lucidity and vividness that characterize all her work, Barbara W. Tuchman follows these twin spiritual and imperial motives the Bible and the sword to their seemingly inevitable endpoint, when Britain conquered Palestine at the conclusion of World War I. At that moment, in a gesture of significance and solemnity, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 established a British-sponsored mandate for a national home for the Jewish people. Throughout this characteristically vivid account, Tuchman demonstrates that the seeds of conflict were planted in the Middle East long before the official founding of the modern state of Israel. Praise for Bible and Sword  Tuchman is a wise and witty writer, a shrewd observer with a lively command of high drama.  The Philadelphia Inquirer  In her m tier as a narrative popular historical writer, Barbara Tuchman is supreme.

But they were betrayed and the entire galaxy has paid the price. It is the Age of the Empire. Now Emperor Palpatine, once Chancellor of the Republic and secretly a Sith follower of the dark side of the Force, has brought his own peace and order to the galaxy. Peace through brutal repression, and order through increasing control of his subjects  lives. But even as the Emperor tightens his iron grip, others have begun to question his means and motives. And still others, whose lives were destroyed by Palpatine s machinations, lay scattered about the galaxy like unexploded bombs, waiting to go off. . . . The first Star Wars novel created in collaboration with the Lucasfilm Story Group, Star Wars: A New Dawn is set during the legendary  Dark Times  between Episodes III and IV and tells the story of how two of the lead characters from the animated series Star Wars Rebels first came to cross paths.

Now acclaimed historian and bestselling author Alison Weir has drawn on myriad sources from the Tudor era to give us the first book that examines, in unprecedented depth, the gripping, dark, and chilling story of Anne Boleyn's final days. The tempestuous love affair between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn scandalized Christendom and altered forever the religious landscape of England. Anne's ascent from private gentlewoman to queen was astonishing, but equally compelling was her shockingly swift downfall. Charged with high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London in May 1536, Anne met her terrible end all the while protesting her innocence. There remains, however, much mystery surrounding the queen's arrest and the events leading up to it: Were charges against her fabricated because she stood in the way of Henry VIII making a third marriage and siring an heir, or was she the victim of a more complex plot fueled by court politics and deadly rivalry? The Lady in the Tower examines in engrossing detail the motives and intrigues of those who helped to seal the queen's fate. Weir unravels the tragic tale of Anne's fall, from her miscarriage of the son who would have saved her to the horrors of her incarceration and that final, dramatic scene on the scaffold. What emerges is an extraordinary portrayal of a woman of great courage whose enemies were bent on utterly destroying her, and who was tested to the extreme by the terrible plight in which she found herself. Richly researched and utterly captivating, The Lady in the Tower presents the full array of evidence of Anne Boleyn's guilt or innocence. Only in Alison Weir's capable hands can readers learn the truth about the fate of one of the most influential and important women in English history. BONUS: This edition contains a The Lady in the Tower discussion guide and an excerpt from Alison Weir's Mary Boleyn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3v4ONgWH2zUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Become a Successful Consultant in Your Own Field","description":"Cash in on Your Own Experience You possess a wealth of special knowledge and experience.

Indeed the authors examine, compare, and evaluate the evolution of the major rival stories comprising contemporary macroeconomic thought, but they also trace the development and interaction of key events and ideas as they occurred in the last century. Interviews with leading economists, one or two at the end of each chapter, also greatly help to shed light on this complexity. . . In sum, this is book which is very difficult to put down. Alessio Moneta, Journal of the History of Economic Thought It is not difficult to understand why this volume commands high praise from macroeconomic theorists, practitioners and teachers. It contains many interesting features that make it an excellent companion for both students and teachers of tertiary level macroeconomics. . . The authors present the material in a way that conveys to readers that macroeconomics is a living science , continually developing and still open to debate, controversy and competing policy prescriptions. In this respect it is a book that ought to be required reading for all teachers of the subject. It is also a valuable source of background reading for professional economists involved with economic policy making. Economic Outlook and Business Review . . . a wonderful history of macroeconomic thought from Keynes to the present, with an outstanding bibliography. It should be useful to undergraduates and graduate students as well as professional economists. Highly recommended. Steven Pressman, Choice Brian Snowdon and Howard Vane are well-known for their astute understanding of the main macroeconomic schools of thought and their skilled use of interviews with major figures. Here, they deploy a depth of scholarship in explaining the different schools and their key points of departure from one another. This book will be particularly useful to students looking for a clear, non-technical explanation of the main approaches to macroeconomics. Patrick Minford, Cardiff University, UK There are two steps to learning macroeconomics. First, to see it as it is today. Second, to understand how it got there: to understand the right and the wrong turns, the hypotheses that proved false, the insights that proved true, and the interaction of events and ideas. Only then, does one truly understand macroeconomics. This book is about step two. It does a marvellous job of it. The presentation is transparent, the interviews fascinating. You will enjoy, and you will learn. Olivier Blanchard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US In 40 years of teaching macroeconomics, there has been just one textbook that I have assigned year after year after year, namely, A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics by Snowdon, Vane and Wynarczyk. That altogether admirable book made clear to students what were, and are, the main intellectual issues in macroeconomics and did so with just enough formal modeling to avoid distortion by over-simplification. That book is now ten years old and the debate in macro has moved on. So there is good reason to welcome Snowdon and Vane back with this superb updated version. Axel Leijonhufvud, University of Trento, Italy This outstanding book avoids the narrow scope of most textbooks and provides an excellent guide to an unusually broad range of ideas. Thomas Mayer, University of California, Davis, US More than a decade after the publication of the critically acclaimed A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics, Brian Snowdon and Howard Vane have produced a worthy successor in the form of Modern Macroeconomics. Thoroughly extended, revised and updated, it will become the indispensable text for students and teachers of macroeconomics in the new millennium. The authors skilfully trace the origins, development and current state of modern macroeconomics from an historical perspective.

It discusses the Tele-centric (Customer Centric Telecommunications) model for customer management. The book provides the key Analytics that can give your company the competitive advantage. The key first step is recombinant segmentation (identification). Using extended behavioral segmentation (categorization), carriers can produce a customer value function (valuation). Churn models and indexes can be used to determine the projected churn rates (Anticipation). Using key metrics and a WAR Gameboard, the profit levels for customers can be evaluated and maximized. Managers of successful telecom service providers need to understand why customers leaving and what makes telecom churn so special. Successful telecom managers have developed churn management strategies to help them making wise churn investment decisions that give them quick and effective churn response options. By understanding that customers have key telecom consumer shopping cycles and response models, churn management can be turned into an operational perspective. It is a well-known fact that telecommunication technology and services are continually changing. Industry veteran Rob Mattison shares his expertise typical interconnection arrangements for pubic and private telephone systems, data networks, inter-exchange systems, wireless, billing and customer care systems.

With all the latest practical information, plus new features such as coverage of the gateway cities of Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, and a review of the political situation and conservation issues, Bradt's Borneo offers everything you need.Expert author Tamara Thiessen offers in-depth background chapters on the island's exceptional biodiversity and exotic tribal cultures, from the sultry rainforests and sapphire straits of Sabah to the incredible river journeys of Sarawak. Also included is insider information for touring the island, including regional capitals, rural outposts and national parks. As a world-recognised biodiversity hotspot, Borneo's variety and richness of plant and animal life is almost unparalleled. Just 10ha of Bornean rainforest can support up to 700 tree species -more than the number found across the whole of North America - while an estimated 5,000 of Borneo's flowering plant species and 500 animals are endemics, that is unique to the island, including the Bornean Orangutan, which spends more time on the ground than its purely arboreal Sumatran cousins. Also covered are internationally known locations such as Brunei's Ulu Temburong National Park, the stunning coral reefs of the east and west coasts and, in Sabah, the Danum Valley and Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre.From Brunei's mesmerising mosques to the limestone pinnacles of Sarawak's Gunung Mulu National Park, there's plenty to discover in this ideal companion for a successful trip.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3QepxwEACAAJ&dq=BORNEO.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Problem of Hell","description":"This work develops an understanding of hell that is common to a broad variety of religious perspectives, and argues that the usual understandings of hell are incapable of solving the problem of hell.

Now that aspect-oriented programming (AOP) can express crosscutting concerns directly in code, the man who developed use cases has proposed step-by-step methods for recognizing crosscutting concerns in use cases and writing the code in separate modules. If these methods are at all fruitful in your design and development practice, they will make a big difference in software quality for developers and users alike. --Wes Isberg, AspectJ team member\\"This book not only provides ideas and examples of what aspect-oriented software development is but how it can be utilized in a real development project.\\" --MichaelWard, ThoughtWorks, Inc.\\"No system has ever been designed from scratch perfectly; every system is composed of features layered in top of features that accumulate over time. Conventional design techniques do not handle this well, and over time the integrity of most systems degrades as a result. For the first time, here is a set of techniques that facilitates composition of behavior that not only allows systems to be defined in terms of layered functionality but composition is at the very heart of the approach. This book is an important advance in modern methodology and is certain to influence the direction of software engineering in the next decade, just as Object-Oriented Software Engineering influenced the last.\\" --Kurt Bittner, IBM Corporation\\"Use cases are an excellent means to capture system requirements and drive a user-centric view of system development and testing. This book offers a comprehensive guide on explicit use-case-driven development from early requirements modeling to design and implementation. It provides a simple yet rich set of guidelines to realize use-case models using aspect-oriented design and programming. It is a valuable resource to researchers and practitioners alike.\\" --Dr. Awais Rashid, Lancaster University, U.K., and author of Aspect-Oriented Database Systems \\"AOSD is important technology that will help developers produce better systems. Unfortunately, it has not been obvious how to integrate AOSD across a project''s lifecycle. This book shatters that barrier, providing concrete examples on how to use AOSD from requirements analysis through testing.\\" --Charles B. Haley, research fellow, The Open University, U.K. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a revolutionary new way to think about software engineering. AOP was introduced to address crosscutting concerns such as security, logging, persistence, debugging, tracing, distribution, performance monitoring, and exception handling in a more effective manner. Unlike conventional development techniques, which scatter the implementation of each concern into multiple classes, aspect-oriented programming localizes them. Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) uses this approach to create a better modularity for functional and nonfunctional requirements, platform specifics, and more, allowing you to build more understandable systems that are easier to configure and extend to meet the evolving needs of stakeholders. In this highly anticipated new book, Ivar Jacobson and Pan-Wei Ng demonstrate how to apply use cases--a mature and systematic approach to focusing on stakeholder concerns--and aspect-orientation in building robust and extensible systems. Throughout the book, the authors employ a single, real-world example of a hotel management information system to make the described theories and practices concrete and understandable. The authors show how to identify, design, implement, test, and refactor use-case modules, as well as extend them. They also demonstrate how to design use-case modules with the Unified Modeling Language (UML)--emphasizing enhancements made in UML 2.0--and how to achieve use-case modularity using aspect technologies, notably AspectJ. Key topics include Making the case for use cases and aspects Capturing and modeling concerns with use cases Keeping concerns separate with use-case modules Modeling use-cases slices and aspects using the newest extensions to the UML notation Applying use cases and aspects in projects Whatever your level of experience with aspect-oriented programming, Aspect-Oriented Software Development with Use Cases will teach you how to develop better software by embracing the paradigm shift to AOSD.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AqlQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Aspect-Oriented+Software+Development+with+Use+Cases+(The+Addison-Wesley+Object+Technology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why the Chimes Rang","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xL0qAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Environmental Archaeology: Principles and Practice","description":"Authoritative and essential guide to methods interpreting the ecology of archaeological sites, and their applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eTUoDvk_HGgC&dq=Environmental+Archaeology:+Principles+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Assumption of the Rogues & Rascals","description":"Elizabeth Smart was born in Ottawa, Canada, in 1913. She was educated at private schools in Canada and for a year at King's College, University of London. One day, while browsing in a London bookshop, she chanced upon a slim volume of poetry by George Barker - and fell passionately in love with him through the printed word. Eventually they communicated directly and, as a result of Barker's impecunious circumstances, Elizabeth Smart flew both him and his wife to the United States. Thus began one of the most extraordinary, intense and ultimately tragic love affairs of our time. They never married but Elizabeth bore George Barker four children and their relationship provided the impassioned inspiration for one of the most moving and immediate chronicles of a love affair ever written - By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. Originally published in 1945, this remarkable book is now widely recognized as a classic work of poetic prose which, more than four decades later, has retained all of its searing poignancy, beauty and power of impact. After the war, Elizabeth Smart supported herself and her family with journalism and advertising work. In 1963 she became literary and associate editor of Queen magazine but subsequently dropped out of the literary scene to live quietly in a remote part of Suffolk.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Anglos and Navajos expanded their use and settlement of lands north of the San Juan. Grazing lands and the Anglo wage economy drew many Navajos across the river. Oshley, a sheepherder, was among the first to settle there. He cared for the herds of his extended family, while also taking supplemental jobs with the growing livestock industry in the area. His narrative is woven with vivid and detailed portraits of Navajo culture: clan relationships, marriages and children, domestic life, the importance of livestock, complex relations with the natural world, ceremonies, trading, and hand trembling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7OF1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Journey+Of+Navajo+Oshley:+An+Autobiography+and+Life+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calder Pride: Library Edition (Richard Sharpe Adventures)","description":"The Long-Awaited Addition to the Beloved Calder Series from the Queen of the Western Romance!

The volume also illustrates some of the many interactions between Han culture and the cultures designated by the current government as \\"minorities.\\" Selections from minority cultures here, for instance, are the folktale of Ny Dan the Manchu Shamaness and a funeral chant of the Yi nationality collected by local researchers in the early 1980s. Each of the forty unusual selections, from ancient oracle bones to stirring accounts of mystic visions, is preceded by a substantial introduction. As with the other volumes, most of the selections here have never been translated before. Stephen Teiser provides a general introduction in which the major themes and categories of the religions of China are analyzed. The book represents an attempt to move from one conception of the \\"Chinese spirit\\" to a picture of many spirits, including a Laozi who acquires magical powers and eventually ascends to heaven in broad daylight; the white-robed Guanyin, one of the most beloved Buddhist deities in China; and the burning-mouth hungry ghost.

At nineteen he met Clyde Barrow in a Texas prison, and the two men together founded what would later be known as the Barrow gang. Running with Bonnie and Clyde is the story of Fults's experiences in the Texas criminal underworld between the years 1925 and 1935 and the gripping account of his involvement with the Barrow gang, particularly its notorious duo, Bonnie and Clyde. Fults's \\"ten fast years\\" were both dramatic and violent. As an adolescent he escaped numerous juvenile institutions and jails, was shot by an Oklahoma police officer, and was brutalized by prison guards. With Clyde, following their fateful meeting in 1930, he robbed a bank to finance a prison raid. After the ambush of Bonnie and Clyde, in 1934, he joined forces with Raymond Hamilton; together the two robbed more banks and eluded countless posses before Hamilton's capture and 1935 execution. One of the few survivors among numerous associates who ended up shot, stabbed, beaten to death, or executed, Fults was later able to reform himself, believing that the only reason he was spared was to reveal the darkest aspects of his past-and in so doing expose the circumstances that propel youth into crime. Author John Neal Phillips tells Fults's story in vivid and at times raw detail, recounting bank robberies, killings, and prison escapes, friendships, love affairs, and marriages. Dialogues based on actual conversations amongst the participants enhance the narrative's authenticity. Whereas in books and mms, Fults, Parker, Barrow, and Hamilton have been romanticized or depicted as one-dimensional, depraved characters, Running with Bonnie and Clyde shows them as real people, products of social, political, and economic forces that directed them into a life of crime and bound them to it for eternity. Although basing his account primarily on Fults's testimony, Phillips substantiates that viewpoint with references to scores of eyewitness interviews, police files and court documents, and contemporary news accounts. An important contribution to criminal and social history, Running with Bonnie and Clyde will be fascinating reading for scholars and general readers alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cchcAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wannabe: A Hollywood Experiment","description":"From one of Hollywood's hottest commodities and the star of The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, the #1 rated new show on the WB, comes the inside story of one man's harrowing, hilarious, and heartrending rise to fame. 16-page color insert.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wGSdLrqWj8sC&dq=Wannabe:+A+Hollywood+Experiment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemistry: Concepts and Problems: A Self-Teaching Guide (Wiley Self-Teaching Guides)","description":"CHEMISTRY SECOND EDITION The fast, easy way to master the fundamentals of chemistry Have you ever wondered about the differences between liquids,gases, and solids?

Aged 25, Lockhart became the British Vice-Consul to Moscow in 1912. With revolution in the air, it was dangerous, decadent posting. The 'Boy Ambassador' became an eyewitness to pivotal events and in 1918 was charged with establishing a diplomatic understanding with the Bolsheviks, to ensure that Russia remained in the war against Germany. It was a precarious mission: Whitehall could not be seen support revolutionaries; Lockhart grew wary of his masters? secret machinations; while Lenin and Trotsky's cordial relations with the British agent never quite dispelled their mistrust of the nation he represented. When Lockhart met Moura Budberg, who became the great love of his life, he was in an increasingly vulnerable position. In September 1918 he would be falsely accused of a counter-revolutionary plot to overthrow the Bolsheviks, and sent to the Loubianka. His account even inspired a Hollywood movie. From his evocative descriptions of revolutionary Moscow, where the champagne flowed as the bourgeoisie trembled, to his audiences with Trotsky and his brushes with death, this is a vivid, unique memoir.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2cqXAwAAQBAJ&dq=British+agent,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewelry Making For Schools Tradesmen Craftsmen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qth0AAAACAAJ&dq=Jewelry+Making+For+Schools+Tradesmen+Craftsmen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Eliot's Mill on the Floss","description":"In this 19th-century novel, Maggie Tulliver breaks off her romance with the man she loves, after she discovers that it was he who ruined her family's small mill business.

The reality, though, is more complex. Sanctions--mostly economic but also political and military penalties aimed at states or other entities to alter political and/or military behavior--almost always have consequences; sometimes desirable, at other times unwanted and unexpected. What cannot be disputed, though, is that economic sanctions are fast becoming the policy tool of choice for the United States in the post-Cold War world. Indeed, economic sanctions are increasingly at the center of American foreign policy as a policy tool to resolve several issues: to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, promote human rights, discourage aggression, protect the environment, or thwart drug trafficking.Drawing heavily on eight case studies--Iraq, Iran, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, Pakistan, China, Libya, and Cuba--this book presents lessons to be learned from recent American use of economic sanctions.

The distinction between good and evil is always clouded by rationalists who convert the real problems of ethics into complex philosophical puzzles. In the first part of Good and Evil, Taylor looks for a more meaningful conception by reexamining and rejecting the whole rationalistic tradition that dominates philosophical ethics. The second part provides an empirical explanation of good and evil, noting that one does not have to look too far to find prime examples of the failure of fixed moral rules. Including important commentary on Joseph Fletcher's groundbreaking situation ethics, and Aristotle's virtues (e.g., magnanimity and pride), Taylor rounds out the book by developing a philosophy of aspiration--personal worth as an ethical ideal--to replace the morality of duty. He offers a modified form of situation ethics to fit the contemporary problems we face.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sZEQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Good+and+evil:+a+new+direction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patchworks of Lucy Boston","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nUlPAAAACAAJ&dq=Patchworks+of+Lucy+Boston&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The autobiography of Alice B.

No longer an area of specialist interest, it has acquired a central focus in condensed matter studies. The major aim of this serial is to provide review articles that can serve as standard references for research workers in the field, and for graduate students and others wishing to obtain reliable information on important recent developments. The two review articles in this volume complement each other in a remarkable way. Both deal with what might be called the modern geometric approach to the properties of macroscopic systems. The first article by Georgii (et al.) describes how recent advances in the application of geometric ideas leads to a better understanding of pure phases and phase transitions in equilibrium systems. The second article by Alava (et al.) deals with geometrical aspects of multi-body systems in a hands-on way, going beyond abstract theory to obtain practical answers. The combination of computers and geometrical ideas described in this volume will doubtless play a major role in the development of statistical mechanics in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6m0GlhzmyIEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountain Pony And The Pinto Colt","description":"As a boy, in Kansas, Bill learned his love of horses from his father and inherited also his gift of showmanship, which later was to bring him fame.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BBtUAAAAYAAJ&dq=Mountain+Pony+And+The+Pinto+Colt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Douglas","description":"Sir James the Good, one of the finest soldiers Scotland ever produced, is sometimes better known by the name given to him by the English - the 'Black Douglas'.

Dostoevsky's defense against Western Secularization and breakdown takes the form of inscribing \\"the feminine\\" as sacred. But this sacralization is undermined by his deeper intuition of the way certain masculine, sexist impulses exploit and eroticize female sacralization and by the way men's liberties conflict with women's liberation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ewZgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dostoevsky+and+the+Woman+Question&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anglican-Orthodox Pilgrimage","description":"Explains why so many Episcopalians/Anglicans are taking a harder look at the Orthodox Faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2kLLAAAACAAJ&dq=Anglican-Orthodox+Pilgrimage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japan Pop!: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture","description":"A fascinating illustrated look at various forms of Japanese popular culture: pop song, jazz, enka (a popular ballad genre of music), karaoke, comics, animated cartoons, video games, television dramas, films and \\"idols\\" -- teenage singers and actors.

Educators genuinely need a text like this for opening their classroom to critical discussions on the well-worn subjects of race and gender.\\" --Charles Johnson Traps is the first anthology of writings by 19th- and 20th-century African American men on the overlapping categories of race, gender, and sexuality. The selections on gender in Sections I and II reveal what some may view as the unexpected commitment of African American men to feminism. Included here are critiques of the subordinate social, economic, and political position of black women. Sections III and IV analyze the taboos and myths in which black sexuality is enmeshed. These essays also stress the importance of rejecting homophobia and the need to contest the predominance of a heterosexual paradigm. Monolithic constructions of gender and sexuality, reinforced by sexism and historically sanctioned homophobia, are the \\"traps\\" that give this book its focus and its title.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZVsRp-U8P7EC&dq=Soulfires:+Young+Black+Men+on+Love+and+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honu (A Kolowalu Book)","description":"Recounts the life cycle of a Hawaiian green turtle, including the threats from nature and humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oHFvD_1huhwC&dq=Honu+(A+Kolowalu+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lights Out: A Nighttime Diary","description":"The magazine that helps career moms balance their personal and professional lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3l4XyoMaYHMC&dq=Lights+Out:+A+Nighttime+Diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus on Health with HealthQuest 4.2 CD-ROM, Learning To Go: Health, Making the Grade CD & PowerWeb OLC Bind-in Passcard","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WdY18X1u2pQC&dq=Focus+on+Health+with+HealthQuest+4.2+CD-ROM,+Learning+To+Go:+Health,+Making+the+Grade+CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pursue Your Goals (Positively for Kids)","description":"The star center for the Philadelphia Flyers uses anecdotes and personal reflections to illustrate the need for dedication and effort to skate through challenging situations to success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w1ICAAAACAAJ&dq=Pursue+Your+Goals+(Positively+for+Kids)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queen of Mathematics: A Historically Motivated Guide to Number Theory","description":"This book takes the unique approach of examining number theory as it emerged in the 17th through 19th centuries.

And can this tell us something about why we look at art, why artists create it, and why it has to be so expensive? Taking the intriguing story of the Mona Lisa's two year disappearance as his starting point, Darian Leader explores the psychology of looking at visual art. What do paintings hide from us? Why should some artists feel compelled to lead lives that are more colourful than their works? And why did the police bungle their long investigation into the theft of Leonardo's masterpiece? Combining anecdote, observation and analysis, with examples taken from classical and contemporary art, Leader discusses such seminal figures as Leonardo, Picasso and Duchamp, as well as Bacon, Lowry and the Young British Artists. This is a book about why we look at art and what, indeed, we might be hoping to find.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SD29QgAACAAJ&dq=Stealing+the+Mona+Lisa:+What+Art+Stops+Us+From+Seeing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counter Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department Stores, 1890-1940 (Working Class in American History)","description":"The luxurious appearance and handsome profits of American department stores from 1890 to 1940 masked a three-way struggle among saleswomen, managers, and customers for control of the selling floor.

But sometimes we approach Scripture with so many questions to be answered and problems to be solved that we have difficulty hearing God in all the confusion. In Listening to God, Jan Johnson introduces us to lectio divina or sacred reading -- a way of reading that makes space for God to speak through the text. Instead of asking questions of the text, lectio divina helps us listen to the questions God is asking us through the text. Listening to God arranges passages of Scripture by topics, so that you can zero in on a topic that is personally relevant and spend a day or week on a single passage learning to listen to God through His Word. Some topics included are -- finding intimacy with God -- making progress in the spiritual life -- having the heart of Christ -- building relationships. Ideal for personal or group use, Listening to God helps the Bible text come vividly alive and teaches how to experience God's voice through a passage you may have heard over and over, or are finally understanding for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EorXPQAACAAJ&dq=Listening+to+God:+Using+Scripture+as+a+Path+to+God%27s+Presence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constitutional Law: Themes for the Constitution's Third Century","description":"The new edition of Farber, Eskridge, Frickey, and Schacter's Cases and Materials on Constitutional Law exploits two of the most exciting developments in Constitutional Law teaching in the last thirty years: the judiciary's dramatic engagement with social movements and key political debates, and academic and judicial deployment of original meaning as a central methodology.

The new edition provides in-depth treatment of the most exciting issues in constitutional law today--including the validity of affirmative action, the continuing battle over abortion restrictions, the recognition of same sex marriage and the continuing clash between claims based on gay rights and those based on religious freedom, the expanded use of the First Amendment to limit economic regulation, more aggressive deployment of justiciability limitations based upon Article III, and issues of presidential power posed by the current Administration as well as its recent predecessors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDCpwgEACAAJ&dq=Constitutional+Law:+Themes+for+the+Constitution%27s+Third+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Cook Book, The","description":"Offers sixty classic recipes from Italy, France, China, and Mexico as well as cooking terms and safety tips.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dwt2CsYjBwQC&dq=International+Cook+Book,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"V.

With a paradigm that is sensitive to the context of one's research questions, she argues, scholars can develop less dichotomous forms that invoke the strengths of both research traditions. Context-oriented approaches can lift the narrative from beneath the numbers in an experimental study, for example, or bring the useful clarity of numbers to an ethnographic study. A pragmatic scholar, Johanek moves easily across the boundaries that divide the field, and argues for contextualist theory as a lens through which to view composition research. This approach brings with it a new focus, she writes. \\"This new focus will call us to attend to the contexts in which rhetorical issues and research issues converge, producing varied forms, many voices, and new knowledge, indeed reconstructing a discipline that will be simultaneously focused on its tasks, its knowledge-makers, and its students.\\" Composing Research is a work full of personal voice and professional commitment and will be a welcome addition to the research methods classroom and to the composition researcher's own bookshelf. 2000 Outstanding Scholarship Award from the International Writing Centers Association.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mFl5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Composing+Research:+A+Contextualist+Research+Paradigm+for+Rhetoric+and+Composition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gertrude Jekyll's Lost Garden: The Restoration of an Edwardian Masterpiece","description":"Fascinating account of the faithful restoration of a Gertrude Jekyll Garden working to the original plans.

Gregory Lande describes the struggle of the medical and legal professions and the U.S. government to cope with insubordination, substance abuse, and crime in the Civil War-era military. During the American Civil War, as in all wars, soldiers were wounded not just physically but emotionally as well. Good men traumatized by the violence of war were sometimes driven to their mental limits, while criminals and troubled individuals who had joined the ranks of the citizen armies found themselves in a more rigid environment in which to commit their transgressions. In the Civil War military, justice was swift and harsh and forgiveness difficult to come by. Citing numerous period documents, Dr. Lande demonstrates that the scientific understanding of mental illness and substance abuse was in its infancy during the mid-nineteenth century. He chronicles cases in which soldiers' mental afflictions or problems with severe alcohol abuse contributed to their misconduct, soldiers such as Leroy Shear, a.k.a. \\"Lorenzo Stewart,\\" whose arrest after deserting from two different Union units resulted in an even more serious crime. Once charged with disobeying orders or committing a crime, soldiers faced an uncertain fate. While the requirements of military law have always differed from those of civilian law, Civil War troops did not have access to legal counsel unless they could afford to hire a lawyer themselves. The sad result was that many mentally ill, incompetent, and poor men were imprisoned for long periods or even put to death. Though a more sophisticated abuse developed after the war in the emerging field of forensic psychiatry, it would take many years for American society to reform the treatment of those deemed \\"criminally insane.\\" Madness, Malingering, and Malfeasance shows that the effects of war unfolded in numerous compelling, tragic, and shocking events beyond the battlefield. It is an important contribution to the growing literature on the medical-legal aspects of the Civil War era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_9K1i6sc4GMC&dq=Madness,+Malingering&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yonder beautiful and stately college edifice: a history of Pennsylvania Hall: (Old Dorm), Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c_tdMgAACAAJ&dq=Yonder+beautiful+and+stately+college+edifice:+a+history+of+Pennsylvania+Hall:+(Old+Dorm),+Gettysburg+College,+Gettysburg,+Pennsylvania&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outboard Troubleshooter","description":"The first edition of Outboard Engines set the standard for a clear, easy-to-follow primer on engine basics, troubleshooting, care, and repair.

An important innovation was the creation of a public domain for certain kinds of books whose privil ge (or 'copyright') had expired. In order not to relinquish control over a vast category of books, the government decided to implement a new kind of printing and publishing permit - the 'permission simple'. As historian and bibliologist, the author examines the many issues involved in the implementation of the permit, explaining the circumstances that led to the creation of a public domain, the economic policies of the government with respect to the 'permission simple', and what exactly the procedures entailed. Other issues concerning the permit are also covered: edition runs; a number of illicit activities; the relationship of free trade, the physiocrats and Turgot to booktrade policies; the significance of Diderot's Lettre sur le commerce de la librairie. The study is largely based on hitherto unpublished sources and on books printed by virtue of the permit. Included in the volume is an edition of the 'permission simple' ledgers. This is the first time that the registers of an entire category of French books printed by virtue of a given authorisation have been published. They contain references to nearly two thousand editions - many today lost - of a wide variety of works. The entries are invaluable for the information they provide about the output of many important provincial printers and booksellers. Together the two registers provide a unique picture of French book production during the dozen years or so preceding the Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfZDAAAAYAAJ&dq=Art+D%27Aimer+(Folio+(Domaine+Public))+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recording the Guitar","description":"Designed to give aspiring guitarists answers to common questions about recording your music in a brief, affordable, yet informative fashion, this FAQ book provides concepts, techniques and many answers to frequently asked questions about digital recording.

Some genes, including those that shape our bodies, actually adapt to outside influences. In Turn Off the Fat Genes, Dr. Neal Barnard draws on this cutting-edge research to create a revolutionary new program for activating thin genes and suppressing fat genes, a dramatic tool for sculpting away excess pounds to reveal the healthy, vital body that nature intended. In Turn Off the Fat Genes, Dr. Barnard begins by explaining the dynamics of nutrition and its impact on genetics. Once you understand how the genes that control your shape can be influenced, the next step is positive intervention. The heart of Dr. Barnard's book is a three-week gene-control program (complete with menus and recipes) specifically designed to influence the five key genes that determine: (1) which foods you prefer, (2) the strength of your appetite, (3) whether your calories are burned or stored as fat, (4) how fast you burn calories, and (5) your muscular type and ability to exercise. Dr. Barnard's program enables all of us to enjoy the same virtually effortless weight control as the naturally thin people we have always admired.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EC7I-A92SNsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haikus for Jews: For You, a Little Wisdom","description":"Why is this haiku book different from all other haiku books?

Accelerated Learning into the 21st Century contains a simple but proven plan that delivers the one key skill that every working person, every parent and student must master, and every teacher should teach: it's learning how to learn. The theory of eight multiple intelligences (linguistic, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist) developed by Howard Gardner at Harvard University provides a foundation for the six-step MASTER-Mind system to facilitate learning (an acronym for Mind, Acquire, Search, Trigger, Exhibit, and Review), and is enhanced by the latest findings on the value of emotion and memory on the process of learning. Combined with motivational stories of success applying these principles, and putting forth a clear vision of how the United States can dramatically improve the education system to remain competitive in the next century, Accelerated Learning into the 21st Century is a dynamic tool for self-improvement by individuals as diverse as schoolchildren and corporate executives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ip68OQsIcIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eye of Klemantaski","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VEVvPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Eye+of+Klemantaski&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The collected poems of G.K.

The bestselling author of Zealot and host of Believer explores humanity s quest to make sense of the divine in this concise and fascinating history of our understanding of God. In Zealot, Reza Aslan replaced the staid, well-worn portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth with a startling new image of the man in all his contradictions. In his new book, Aslan takes on a subject even more immense: God, writ large. In layered prose and with thoughtful, accessible scholarship, Aslan narrates the history of religion as a remarkably cohesive attempt to understand the divine by giving it human traits and emotions. According to Aslan, this innate desire to humanize God is hardwired in our brains, making it a central feature of nearly every religious tradition. As Aslan writes,  Whether we are aware of it or not, and regardless of whether we re believers or not, what the vast majority of us think about when we think about God is a divine version of ourselves.  But this projection is not without consequences. We bestow upon God not just all that is good in human nature our compassion, our thirst for justice but all that is bad in it: our greed, our bigotry, our penchant for violence. All these qualities inform our religions, cultures, and governments. More than just a history of our understanding of God, this book is an attempt to get to the root of this humanizing impulse in order to develop a more universal spirituality. Whether you believe in one God, many gods, or no god at all, God: A Human History will challenge the way you think about the divine and its role in our everyday lives.

David resents Elizabeth because he thinks he is too old for a babysitter, and he goes out of his way to make life miserable for her. On this particular evening, however, Elizabeth has more than a badly behaved boy to contend with. It is on this October night that Hurricane Hazel roars down on Toronto, bringing torrential rains that cause extensive flooding. David and Suzie s house is on Raymore Drive, a street that will be practically wiped out by the floodwaters. David and Suzie s parents are unable to reach the house, which means the children s safety on this most deadly of nights is Elizabeth s responsibility. She finds herself increasingly isolated. They are surrounded by rising water. The electricity goes out. The phone goes dead. Still, Elizabeth is sure they will be safe as long as they remain in the house. But are Elizabeth and the children really as \\"safe as houses\\"? Before this terrifying night is over, Elizabeth and David will have to learn to communicate and cooperate if they are to save their own lives and Suzie s. Their survival in the midst of one of Canada s worst disasters will depend upon their resourcefulness, maturity and courage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aggdZtGbQQcC&dq=Safe+As+Houses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 39 Steps","description":"Mix a Hitchcock masterpiece with a juicy spy novel, add a dash of Monty Python and you have The 39 Steps, a fast-paced whodunit for anyone who loves the magic of theatre!

He would be greeted upon arrival as the rightful heir to the throne of England. The trouble was, England already had a king. The most intriguing and ambitious pretender in history, this elegant young man was celebrated throughout Europe as the prince he claimed to be: Richard, Duke of York, the younger of the  Princes in the Tower  who were presumed to have been murdered almost a decade earlier. Handsome, well-mannered, and charismatic, he behaved like the perfect prince, and many believed he was one. The greatest European rulers of the age among them the emperor Maximilian, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and Charles VIII of France used him as a diplomatic pawn to their own advantage. As such, he tormented Henry VII for eight years, attempting to invade England three times. Eventually, defeated and captured, he admitted to being Perkin Warbeck, the son of a common boatman from Flanders. But was this really the truth? Ann Wroe, a historian and storyteller of the first rank, delves into the secret corners of the late medieval world to explore both the elusive nature of identity and the human propensity for deception. In uncovering the mystery of Perkin Warbeck, Wroe illuminates not only a life but an entire world trembling on the verge of discovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=29Q01BrDr-EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Weight of It: A Story of Two Sisters","description":"A deeply affecting memoir about the bond between two sisters and the 150 pounds that nearly separated them As young girls, a year apart in age, Alison and Amy Wilensky were almost indistinguishable. And they were inseparable: growing up in a comfortable Boston suburb, they were never far from each other's side, wearing matching dresses, playing the same games, eating the same food. But Alison began gaining weight in elementary school and by the time she was sixteen was morbidly obese. The sisters remained close, but over the years the daily indignities and affronts endured by Alison took their toll, reshaping her identity indelibly and affecting the sisters' relationship in unanticipated ways. In her late twenties, Alison underwent gastric bypass surgery, in the wake of which she lost more than 150 pounds and achieved the shape she'd dreamed of for so much of her life. It wasn't just her body that was transformed: every significant relationship in her life was profoundly altered. The Weight of It is a universal story of how we discover what makes us who we are, and how we become the people we want to be.

Actually, it is a major underlying principle found in religions worldwide. The concept of altruistic love is one that challenges the spiritual person to \\"love your enemies,\\" or to \\"love without thought of return.\\" It is a love that flows out to others in the form of compassion, kindness, tenderness, and charitable giving. Buddhists have a path of compassion, where caring for others becomes the motivating force behind existence. Hindus have a branch of yoga, the heart-centered path, that leads to enlightenment through an overwhelming love for God that takes the form of loving all of humanity. Eastern religions, such as Taoism and Confucianism, see transcendent love as essential part of true wisdom. The universal theme of love is found in all religious traditions, Buddhist, Christian, Islam, or others. As we begin realize that all religions have at their core this spiritual principle of love, we can develop a sense of common humanity. The religious tradition of agape love examined in this book will serve as an inspiration for those who are learning to grow in compassion and love for all people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nvboOK3sGeMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living with Joy: Keys to Personal Power and Spiritual Transformation","description":"With the guidance of this bestselling classic, you can learn to grow through joy rather than through struggle and pain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rkfVOavSADYC&dq=Living+with+Joy:+Keys+to+Personal+Power+and+Spiritual+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radiation Protection in Medical Radiography, 4e","description":"Enhance your understanding of radiation physics and radiation protection!

In his classic Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime, Charles Gillispie analyzed the cultural, political, and technical factors that encouraged scientific productivity on the eve of the Revolution. In the present monumental and elegantly written sequel to that work, which Princeton is reissuing concurrently, he examines how the revolutionary and Napoleonic context contributed to modernization both of politics and science. In politics, argues Gillispie, the central feature of this modernization was conversion of subjects of a monarchy into citizens of a republic in direct contact with a state enormously augmented in power. To the scientific community, attainment of professional status was what citizenship was to all Frenchmen in the republic proper, namely the license to self-governance and dignity within the respective contexts. Revolutionary circumstances set up a resonance between politics and science since practitioners of both were future oriented in their outlook and scornful of the past. Among the creations of the First French Republic were institutions providing the earliest higher education in science. From them emerged rigorously trained people who constituted the founding generation in the disciplines of mathematical physics, positivistic biology, and clinical medicine. That scientists were able to achieve their ends was owing to the expertise they provided the revolutionary and imperial authorities in education, medicine, warfare, empire building, and industrial technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6KFyBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical Process and Design Handbook","description":"Control chemical processes to get the results you want Invaluable to chemical and environmental engineers as well as process designers, Chemical Process and Design Handbook shows you how to control chemical processes to yield desired effects efficiently and economically.

Readers sense his humanity, enjoy his humor, and appreciate his insights into human nature, even into such painful experiences as embarrassment and humiliation. No matter how remarkable the life of Samuel Clemens was, what matters most is the relationship of Mark Twain the writer and his writings. That is the subject of this book.\\" from the Preface In Mark Twain, A Literary Life, Everett Emerson revisits one of America's greatest and most popular writers to explore the relationship between the life of the writer and his writings. The assumption throughout is that to see Mark Twain's writings in focus, one must give proper attention to their biographical context. Mark Twain's literary career is fascinating in its strangeness. How could this genius have had so little sense of what he should next do? As a young man, Samuel Clemens's first vocation, that of journeyman printer, took him far from home to the sights of New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, while his next vocation would give him the identity by which we most frequently know him. His choice of \\"Mark Twain\\" as a pen name cemented his bond with the river, as did such books as Life on the Mississippi and Huckleberry Finn. Then following an unsuccessful try at silver mining, Clemens worked as a newspaperman, humorist, lecturer, but also cultivated an interest in playwriting, politics, and philosophizing. In reporting the author's life, Emerson has endeavored to permit Mark Twain to tell his own story as much as possible, through the use of letters and autobiographical writings, some unpublished. These fascinating glimpses into the life of the writer will be of interest to all who have an abiding affection for Samuel Clemens and his extraordinary legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxQmDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grand Delusion","description":"This is a fun, unique book that goes deep into the great mysteries of knowing and makes it enjoyable.

People balked when Peter suggested a wholesale move to eWorking, the rise of email and text messaging, and the dotcom regime mirroring the boom and bust cycle of the industrial revolution. His predictions of the use and growth of mobile devices and communication, or use of chip implants for humans to replace ID cards, passports, and medical records, or iris scanners and fingerprint readers - were all seen as unlikely. Today they are a reality. How then will the world react to his predictions as set out in Uncommon Sense of a networked world of distributed ignorance and sharing overcoming an old world of concentrated skill and control? To everything becoming 'Napsterised' in every dimension, where storage and processing power cost nothing, and become connected without the help of the old network companies? A world where individuals create their own networks, where laws of copyright and resale, and old business models have to be changed as giant industries are dragged kicking and screaming out of the 19th Century and into the 21st? Peter Cochrane poses and answers questions, suggests solutions, and raises red flags on issues that need to be addressed. Tables, diagrams, pictures and illustrations generously support all of the text, with the most difficult aspects illustrated by simulations and other material on a CD and links to a web site with an ongoing expansion of the themes addressed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9J_RwjR06IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arizona Wildlife: An Introduction to Familiar Species (State Nature Guides)","description":"Compact yet comprehensive, The Nature of Florida takes novice naturalists through an easy-to-read basic explanation of species, field identification tips, the evolution of animals and plants, Florida''s geography and vegetation, before delving into more detailed species identification.

Mr. Darcy? No, that's just the woman director of Pride and Prejudice,\\" reports Nicholas Llewellyn Bevan, impoverished novelist and occasional (reluctant) journalist, when a TV production company trundles into his sleepy North Yorkshire valley. Amusedly he watches these glamorous invaders combine the filming of Jane Austen's romantic classic with the much less modest pursuit, off-camera, of real-life romances with the locals. Under his very nose, his bashful handsome neighbor John is plucked out of a village dance by the famously gorgeous (and wealthy) leading actress, Candia Bingham, with whom he at once falls completely in love. Our would-be hero manages only to trip over the black-booted foot of the intimidating and imperious director, Mary Dance. So he's amazed---and a little bit alarmed---when her steely eye seems to be straying his way. A witty and entertaining update on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Austen fans old and new will adore Vanity and Vexation's modern take on her sublime blueprint of the romance game complete with sex, money, and power. With an assured and respectful hand, in the context of the contemporary world, Kate Fenton has penned a riveting story with a hilarious twist. After all, it is a truth universally acknowledged that Hollywood taking an interest---better still an option---in a novelist's work is a surefire way to propel that novelist into serious sales figures and the bestseller lists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vYCzAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Say No","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpHVOCyIGDoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mazaroff murder,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pbP5mAEACAAJ&dq=The+Mazaroff+murder,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Bone Unturned: Inside the World of a Top Forensic Scientist and His Work on America's Most Notorious Crimes and Disasters","description":" A fast and exciting read. . . .

Historians have held for centuries that the majestic tapestry trumpets the glory of William the Conqueror and the victorious Normans. But is this true? In 1066, a brilliant piece of historical detective work, Andrew Bridgeford reveals a very different story that reinterprets and recasts the most decisive year in English history. Reading the tapestry as if it were a written text, Bridgeford discovers a wealth of new information subversively and ingeniously encoded in the threads, which appears to undermine the Norman point of view while presenting a secret tale undetected for centuries-an account of the final years of Anglo-Saxon England quite different from the Norman version. Bridgeford brings alive the turbulent 11th century in western Europe, a world of ambitious warrior bishops, court dwarfs, ruthless knights, and powerful women. 1066 offers readers a rare surprise-a book that reconsiders a long-accepted masterpiece, and sheds new light on a pivotal chapter of English history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YmmaIaeBUSQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daily Life in Civil War America (The Greenwood Press Daily Life Through History Series)","description":"The United States Civil War touched the lives of every American North and South at that time.

Details the author s 50 years of responsible experimentation with mind-altering substances and how Ecstasy has helped him become a better therapist ? Explains how he and his wife found Ecstasy to be the key to renewing and enriching their lives and marriage as they entered their senior years ? Describes what the experience actually feels like and provides protocols for the safe, responsible, recreational, and celebrational use of MDMA for individuals and groups In a world that keeps us separate from each other, MDMA is the chemical of connection. Aptly known in popular culture as  Ecstasy,  MDMA helps us rediscover our own true loving nature, often obscured by the traumas of life. On its way to becoming a prescription medication due to groundbreaking research on its use to treat PTSD, Ecstasy can offer benefits for all adult life stages, from 20-somethings to seniors. In this memoir and guide to safe use, Charles Wininger, a licensed psychoanalyst and mental health counselor, details the countless ways that Ecstasy has helped him become a better therapist and husband. He recounts his coming of age in the 1960s counterculture, his 50 years of responsible experimentation with mind-altering substances, and his immersion in the new psychedelic renaissance. He explains how he and his wife found Ecstasy to be the key to renewing and enriching their lives as they entered their senior years. It also strengthened the bonds of their marriage. Countering the fearful propaganda that surrounds this drug, Wininger describes what the experience actually feels like and explores the value of Ecstasy and similar substances for helping psychologically healthy individuals live a more  optimal  life. He provides protocols for the responsible, recreational, and celebrational use of MDMA, including how to perfect the experience, maximize the benefits and minimize the risks, and how it may not be for everyone. He reveals how MDMA has revitalized his marriage, both erotically and emotionally, and describes how pleasure, fun, and joy can be profound bonding and transformative experiences. Revealing MDMA s versatility when it comes to bringing lasting renewal, pleasure, and inspiration to one s life, Wininger shows that recognizing the transformative power of happiness-inducing experiences can be the first step on the path to healing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JHrSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haunted Scotland","description":"Drawing on archive materials and interviews, Roddy Martine takes us on a tour of haunted Scotland, from Highlands to Lowlands in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of the past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VL28BQAAQBAJ&dq=Haunted+Scotland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Restatement 2d Contracts and Unidroit Principles: The Texts, the Comments, and the Illustrations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5_c9AQAACAAJ&dq=Restatement+2d+Contracts+and+Unidroit+Principles:+The+Texts,+the+Comments,+and+the+Illustrations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Communicating in Sign: Creative Ways to Learn American Sign Language (ASL) (Flying Hands Book)","description":"Places ASL within the context of Deaf culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=65Z2WpyUnMAC&dq=Communicating+in+Sign:+Creative+Ways+to+Learn+American+Sign+Language+(ASL)+(Flying+Hands+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boxer: A Novel","description":"Having learned how to box while in prison, fifteen-year-old Johnny sets out to discover if he can make a decent living as a fighter in late nineteenth-century New York City.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f_dBPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Boxer:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nancy and Plum","description":"Two orphaned sisters are sent to live at a boarding home run by the cruel and greedy Mrs. Monday, where they dream about someday having enough to eat and being able to experience a real Christmas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fp43E0_Nk1wC&dq=Nancy+and+Plum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The narrative of a blockade-runner (Collector's library of the Civil War)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=deHAzQEACAAJ&dq=The+narrative+of+a+blockade-runner+(Collector%27s+library+of+the+Civil+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CNET RECOMMENDS IOLO'S SYSTEM MECHANIC 5 PROFESSIONAL.(Iolo Technologies L.L.C.): An article from: GUI Program News","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Irish Chicago (Images of America: Illinois)","description":"Uses vintage photographs to present a visual history of Chicago's Irish heritage, from the great waves of migration to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xMB8j7GQrAUC&dq=Irish+Chicago+(Images+of+America:+Illinois)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Roll","description":"Shares details of the author's marriage and recounts her struggle to cope with the tragedy that cost her the life of her husband.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DqTN8bMG2fwC&dq=Let%27s+Roll&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Dreamweaver MX","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Woman on the American frontier: A valuable and authentic history of the heroism, adventures, privations, captivities, trials, and noble lives and deaths of the \\"pioneer mothers of the Republic\\"","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9DoOAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transit of Venus","description":"The award-winning, New York Times bestselling literary masterpiece of Shirley Hazzard the story of two beautiful orphan sisters whose fates are as moving and wonderful, and yet as predestined, as the transits of the planets themselves A Penguin Classic Considered \\"one of the great English-language novels of the twentieth century\\" (The Paris Review), The Transit of Venus follows Caroline and Grace Bell as they leave Australia to begin a new life in post-war England.

Specifically, it makes a classical liberal and libertarian analysis based upon homesteading and private property rights to defend the State of Israel. As such, this work explores the history of the Jewish State, both to provide a positive case for its right to exist, and to clarify the myths surrounding its origin and development. At the same time, it deals with other relevant related subjects, such as the complex situation between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, the military campaigns against the Jewish State, the connection between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and Israel s economic miracle. The thorough analysis presented in this work intends to show not only why the voices and movements against Israel are wrong (including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, BDS), but more importantly, why Israel is an example of human flourishing and freedom that every advocate for liberty should celebrate. The Classical Liberal Case for Israel makes the practical and moral case for Israel. It is based on truths and facts that need to be repeated over and over. Block & Futerman understand that the only way to defeat a big lie is with a big truth.

They do not give us guidelines for living in an imperfect world in which the choices and decisions that we must make are seldom clear-cut. Seeking a morality based on actual experience, Held offers a method of inquiry with which to deal with the specific moral problems encountered in daily life. She argues that the division between public and private morality is misleading and shows convincingly that moral judgment should be contextual. She maps out different approaches and positions for various types of issues, including membership in a state, legal decisions, political activities, economic transactions, interpersonal relations, diplomacy, journalism, and determining our obligation to future generations. Issues such as these provide the true test of moral theory, since its success is seen in the willingness of conscientious persons to commit themselves to it by acting on it in their daily lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CrIcAjAOsE8C&dq=Rights+and+Goods:+Justifying+Social+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of an Amorous Man","description":"The Life of an Amorous Man depicts the pursuits and follies of the most glorious age of old Japan, when the new bourgeoisie, unfettered by the societal constraints of the traditional aristocracy, indulged in the free and easy life of Japan's celebrated pleasure houses.

They were the biggest and brashest icons that New York, and possibly America, has ever produced--magnificent giants that became intimately familiar around the globe. Their builders were possessed of a singular determination to create wonders of capitalism as well as engineering, refusing to admit defeat before natural forces, economics, or politics. No one knows the history of the towers better than New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton. In a vivid, brilliantly researched narrative, the authors re-create David Rockefeller's ambition to rebuild lower Manhattan, the spirited opposition of local storeowners and powerful politicians, the bold structural innovations that later determined who lived and died, master builder Guy Tozzoli's last desperate view of the towers on September 11, and the charged and chaotic recovery that could have unraveled the secrets of the buildings' collapse but instead has left some enduring mysteries.

The majority of the cases reflect the day-to-day moral struggles within the walls of hospitals. As a result, the cases do not focus on esoteric, high-tech dilemmas like genetic engineering or experimental protocols, but rather on fundamental problems that are pervasive in basic healthcare delivery in the United States: where to send a frail, elderly patient who refuses to go to a nursing home, what role the family should play in making a treatment decision, what a hospital should do when it is getting stuck with too many unpaid bills. This thoroughly revised and updated second edition includes thirteen new cases, five of which are designated as \\"skill builder\\" cases aimed specifically at persons who wish to conduct clinical ethics case consultations. The new cases highlight current ethical challenges that arise in caring for populations such as undocumented immigrant patients, persons with substance use disorders involving opioids, and ethical issues that arise beyond the bedside at the organizational level.

Shape Diet: The 14-Day Total Weight Loss Plan","description":"From one of today's most respected diet and nutrition experts: a 14day weight loss plan designed to help you change your shape for life using a new breakthrough personalized protein prescription that has worked for thousands of his patients. Dr. David Heber's groundbreaking book What Color Is Your Diet? introduced us to the Color Codebuilding a healthy diet based on colorful fruits and vegetables. His new book, The LA Shape Diet, combines the sound nutritional basis of the Color Code with his newest research from the UCLA Center for Nutrition, which shows you how to analyse your body shape, personal protein needs, and metabolism and not only lose weightbut also change your body shape. This has major appeal to the millions of Americans who may be able to lose weight but are still dissatisfied with the look of their bodiesand end up gaining the weight back anyway. Dr. Heber maintains that everyone is born with a particular shape and that this shape makes a huge difference in how you should approach weight loss. Dr. Heber teaches the difference between the shape you can change and the shape you cannot, and how to do this with the right amount of dietary protein. Based on over 3500 measurements made by his researchers at UCLA, Dr. Heber has come up with tables that estimate how much protein you need in your diet at a given height and weight, and how many calories you should consume every day. Then Dr. Heber helps you build your own ideal diet, starting with protein, then 7 colorful servings of fruits and vegetables (providing 25 grams of filling fiber), and finally whole grains. Dr. Heber explains not only glycemic index (how fast blood sugar goes up) but glycemic load (glycemic index + how much carbohydrate a food provides), which determines how a particular food affects the overall diet. He groups foods into four tables to make it easy for readers to navigate their dinner table. In a world of dietary fads and \\"one size fits all\\" pseudomiracle diets, The LA Shape Diet is the most effective, easytofollow, scientifically sound dietary plan you'll find.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKJRpu1azgoC&dq=The+L.A.+Shape+Diet:+The+14-Day+Total+Weight+Loss+Plan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sentimental Journey Through France & Ita","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6KfrXDoP3YoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Degas' Drawings of Dancers","description":"Forty-one full-page, six half-page drawings depict dancers on stage, in the classroom, and at rehearsals.

In many cultures, pregnancy is defined as a life-threatening illness, but in western culture, pregnancy is defined as normal. This reflects the role of women in western society and it affects the kinds of medical and surgical management of pregnancy that are available.

A rare combination of collaborators uncovers the changes that took place in North America, Mexico, Central America, the Andes, and Amazonia. Each section of the book has been comprehensively arranged so that a botanical description of the natural vegetation of the region is coupled with a set of case studies outlining local human influences. From modifications of vegetation, to changes in soil, wildlife, microclimate, hydrology, and the land surface itself, this collection addresses one of the great issues of our time: the human modification of the earth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1-lvDol-4CYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2182 Kilohertz: A Novel","description":"Making his living on the tugs and icebreakers of Alaska's frigid North Slope, Henry Seine dreams of life in a warmer climate, but the lure of the sea draws him back to members of his old crew as they join forces to rescue Louis Moneymaker, a scientist trapped on a melting ice floe.

Here he tells the story of a life in translation, and gives intimate glimpses of many of the Arab writers who are becoming increasingly known in the west. In the 1940s, while teaching at Cairo University, he came to know such iconic figures as Yahya Hakki, Tewfik al-Hakim, Yusuf Idris, and of course Naguib Mahfouz. Later when he lived in Beirut, that other great literary center of the Arab world, he spent time with such poets as Tawfic Sayigh, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, and Boland al-Haydari. He was already a close friend of Jabra Ibrahim Jabra from his college days at Cambridge, and later of another well-known Palestinian writer, Ghassan Kanafani. In the 1960s he started an influential Arabic literary magazine, Aswat, which published the leading avant-garde writers of the time, and in 1967 he put together the first representative volume of short stories from the Arab world. Then he really put Arabic writing on the international literary map with the establishment of the Heinemann Arab Authors series. Since then he has continued to select and translate the best of Arabic fiction, most recently the classic novella by Yahya Hakki, The Lamp of Umm Hashim (AUC Press 2004). He has also translated three books of Islamic Hadith (with Ezzeddin Ibrahim) and other books of Islamic thought, and has written a large number of children's books of Middle Eastern history and folktales.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TlXbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Memories+In+Translation:+A+Life+Between+The+Lines+Of+Arabic+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Truth About UFOs and the New World Order Connection","description":"A compelling look at the misuse of power, lies, corruptions and cover-ups Fake news, alternative facts, outright lies, fears of nuclear war, widespread surveillance of the population, mass shootings, the rise of a totalitarian state and more have led millions of us to distrust the word of government.

The Selected Poems reflects this wide diversity, and includes his youthful Songs and Sonnets, epigrams, elegies, letters, satires, and the profoundly moving Divine Poems composed towards the end of his life. From joyful poems such as 'The Flea', which transforms the image of a louse into something marvellous, to the intimate and intense Holy Sonnets, Donne breathed new vigour into poetry by drawing lucid and often startling metaphors from the world in which he lived.

The usefulness of this book is further enriched by the inclusion of permanent or semipermanent fixtures such as lighting, kitchen stoves, and floor and wall coverings, as well as strictly architectural details. A useful system of quick reference, employing color-coded tabs keyed to each feature, enables the reader to trace how particular features evolved over time. And at the back of the book, separate chapters dealing with vernacular architecture are followed by a glossary and a fully updated directory of suppliers of authentic materials as well as period and reproduction features. For this new edition, a biographical directory of architects and architectural practices has been added. Compiled by a team of experts headed by Stephen Calloway and Elizabeth Cromley, The Elements of Style is the first book on architectural styles that is comprehensive, incredibly thorough, and accessible in its presentation of individual details. Equally invaluable for authentic period restoration or simply for saying to your contractor, \\"I want one like that\\" -- this definitive resource presents literally thousands of details.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mkIsAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Elements+of+Style:+A+Practical+Encyclopedia+of+Interior+Architectural+Details+from+1485+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild New Zealand","description":"Shows and describes the plants and animals found in each region of New Zealand's wilderness areas","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBc7AQAAIAAJ&dq=Wild+New+Zealand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picture Rocks: American Indian Rock Art in the Northeast Woodlands","description":"Located along rivers, at the edges of lakes, on mountain boulders, in rock shelters, on rock ledges where the continent meets the ocean, and tucked into parks and public places, American Indian rock art offers tantilizing glimpses of the signs and symbols of a Native American culture. Picture Rocks documents all known permanent petroglyph and pictograph sites from the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the six New England states, New York, and New Jersey. Some sites are subject to disputes over their origins Indian or Portuguese? Some are ancient, and others, such as the work of the Mi kmaq, were executed in the past 200 years. Many of these sites are little known; others, like those at Bellows Falls, Vermont, are sources of great local pride and appear on city walking tours. Interspersing his own interpretations with comments from scholars and Native American storytellers, Edward J. Lenik provides a definitive look at an extraordinary art form. Two hundred illustrations include historic sketches by early Euro-American colonists, nineteenth-century photographs, and recent photographs and drawings of the current conditions of many sites.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yIQfxjbeZ50C&dq=Picture+Rocks:+American+Indian+Rock+Art+in+the+Northeast+Woodlands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet","description":"This text provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal issues concerning gender and sexual nonconformity in the United States.

While Grails is the Web framework for building Groovy Web applications, Griffon is the deskop framework for building desktop Groovy applications. Could Groovy be the new Java? It's light, fast and free (open source). This book gets you started with Groovy, Grails and Griffon, and culminates in the example and possible application of some realworld projects. You follow along with the development of each project, implementing and running each application while learning new features along the way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nhguQJToK20C&dq=Groovy+Map&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chateau of St Avrell","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VgHgNAEACAAJ&dq=The+Chateau+of+St+Avrell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Boar: the story of the Last Plantagenets","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I7ZEAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apostolic Succession:","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PzFMAwAAQBAJ&dq=Apostolic+Succession:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guerrilla Warfare: A Historical & Critical Study","description":"As the author makes clear, every book has a history; Guerrilla Warfare is no exception. Together with its sequel Terrorism (and two companion readers) it was part of a wider study: to give a critical interpretation of guerrilla and terrorism theory and practice throughout history. It did not aim at providing a general theory of political violence, nor did it give instructions on how to conduct guerrilla warfare and terrorist operations. Its aim remains to bring about greater semantic and analytic clarity, and to do so at psychological as well as political levels.While the word guerrilla has been very popular, much less attention has been given to guerrilla warfare than to terrorism - even though the former has been politically more successful. The reasons for the lack of detailed attention are obvious: guerrilla operations take place far from big cities, in the countryside, in remote regions of a nation. In such areas there are no film cameras or recorders.In his probing new introduction, Laqueur points out that a review of strategies and the fate of guerrilla movements during the last two decades show certain common features. Both mainly concerned nationalists fighting for independence either against foreign occupants or against other ethnic groups within their own country. But despite the many attempts, only in two placesAfghanistan and Chechnya were the guerrillas successful.According to Laqueur historical experience demonstrates that guerrilla movements have prevailed over incumbents only in specific conditions. Due to a constellation of factors, ranging from modern means of observation to increase in firepower. The author suggests that we may witness a combination of political warfare, propaganda, guerrilla operations and terrorism. In such cases, this could be a potent strategy for unsponsored revolutionary change. But either as social history or military strategy this work remains a crucial work of our times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ou_LtAEACAAJ&dq=Guerrilla+Warfare:+A+Historical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ring Round the Moon","description":"THE STORY: According to Atkinson (Times), a play of many moods...wistfully romantic, satirical, fantastic...To make his points about love (the author) has invented a fable about twin brothers--Frederic, who is shy and sensitive, and Hugo, who is heartl","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x5pMES2lFVYC&dq=Ring+Round+the+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roller Babes: The Story Of The Roller Derby Queen","description":"After tightening her laces with shaking hands, Lottie glanced at the other skaters, who had already rolled awkwardly around the big track. Each skater's unsteady movements made a low rumble sound that reverberated throughout the empty Armory. The pounding of skates on the wooden surface made it difficult to hear normal voices. The skaters glided and stretched their legs; up on the big track each person appeared larger than life. Lottie noticed that the guys looked so much bigger and faster than the small group of girls. Maybe, she thought, her father was right. What A League of Their Own is to women's baseball, Roller Babes is to women's professional roller derby. Set in the 1950s, Roller Babes dramatically captures the story of Lottie Karla Zimmerman's inspirational rise from the tenements of the Bronx to her stardom as the Roller Derby queen. Her road is anything but smooth as she tangles with love, loss, and the \\"bad\\" girls of the banked track. The widely watched yet underappreciated sport of Roller Derby comes to life in Roller Babes, reminding us not only of a simpler time but also of the power of the human spirit to overcome enormous obstacles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lWLdb0NW0CAC&dq=Roller+Babes:+The+Story+Of+The+Roller+Derby+Queen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Kiss","description":"She was everything a woman could be.

Clare has chosen to pass while Irene has embraced her racial heritage and become an important member of her community. The Novel examines how people pass on many different levels and in many different ways.

It is an altogether na?ve and fanciful account of human progress. Innovations emerge from a much less mysterious combination of historical, circumstantial, and accidental influences. This book explores the origin and evolution of several important behavioral innovations including the high five, the Heimlich maneuver, the butterfly stroke, the moonwalk, and the Iowa caucus. Such creations' striking suitability to the situation and the moment appear ingeniously designed with foresight. However, more often than not, they actually arise 'as if by design.' Based on investigations into the histories of a wide range of innovations, Edward A. Wasserman reveals the nature of behavioral creativity. What surfaces is a fascinating web of causation involving three main factors: context, consequence, and coincidence. Focusing on the process rather than the product of innovation elevates behavior to the very center of the creative human endeavor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wQg3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"P3 : Pipes, Parks, and Powder","description":"One of the world's most charismatic and popular snowboarders tells the story of his life and of the sport that in less than ten years has climbed to the forefront of the Olympics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ad7aAAAACAAJ&dq=P3+:+Pipes,+Parks,+and+Powder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wyoming!

Having been deemed mentally ill for his anti-war sentiments and sent for treatment, George Sherston comes under the care of neurologist Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, who allows Sherston to sort through his attitudes toward the fighting (events that have also been semi-fictionalized by Pat Barker for her bestselling and critically acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy). After six months in the hospital, Sherston leaves to rejoin his regiment. He is soon dispatched to Ireland, where he attempts to reclaim some of the idyllic fox-hunting days of his youth, then to Palestine. He finally ends up at the Western Front in France, where he is shot in the head while on a reconnaissance mission and invalided back home. As the capstone of Sassoon's masterful Sherston trilogy, Sherston's Progress whose evocation of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is not at all accidental literally brings home the unforgettable journey of George Sherston from aristocratic childhood through war hero and anti-war martyr, all the way to wounded veteran trying to move on from the Great War.

It is also the most potent practical instrument available to democratic reformers. This systematic and comprehensive study describes and classifies the 70 electoral systems used by 27 democracies - including those of Western Europe, Australia, Canada, the USA, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Japan, and New Zealand - for 384 national legislative and European Parliament elections between 1945 and 1990. Using comparative and statistical analyses of these systems, Arend Lijphart demonstrates the effect of the electoral formula used, the number of representatives elected per district, electoral thresholds, and of five other key features of electoral systems on the proportionality of the election outcome, the degree of multipartism, and the creation of majority parties. In the process he reveals that electoral systems are neither as diversenor as complex as is often assumed. Electoral Systems and Party Systems represents the most definitive treatment of the subject since Rae's classic study in 1967, based as it is on more accurate and comprehensive data (covering more countries and over a longer time span), and using stronger hypotheses and better analytical methods.

The art of the theater commanded special attention. The text in this volume is a loose collection of essays by Oskar Schlemmer, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and Farkas Moln r (who in an illustrated essay shares his vision of a total theatre space), with an introduction by Bauhaus leader Walter Gropius. Originally published in German in 1924, Die B hne im Bauhaus was translated by A. S. Wensinger and published by Wesleyan in 1961. It was prepared with the full cooperation of Walter Gropius and his introduction was written specially for this edition. From Bauhaus experiments there emerged a new aesthetic of stage design and presentation, a new concept of  total theater.  Its principles and practices, revolutionary in their time and far in advance of all but the most experimental stagecraft today, were largely the work of Oskar Schlemmer, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and their students. Profusely illustrated and startling in its typography (the work of Moholy-Nagy), the 1924 volume quickly became a collector s item and is now virtually unobtainable. Those interested in the stage, the modern visual arts, or in the bold steps of the men of genius who broadened the horizons of aesthetic experience will appreciate that this translation is available again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iv79BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James McNeill Whistler (Modern masters of etching)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vTewzQEACAAJ&dq=James+McNeill+Whistler+(Modern+masters+of+etching)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Mosaics: Indigo Blue","description":"African American interest","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gzXHAAAACAAJ&dq=Love+Mosaics:+Indigo+Blue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Windows 2000 Core Requirements Training Kit: Exams 70-210, 70-215, 70-216, 70-217","description":"Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) Exam 70-220 measures the ability to analyze the business requirements for security and design a security solution for a network based on the Windows 2000 operating system.

The Sword and the Scimitar is a saga of one of the most fanatical religious wars in world history. It is a story abounding with highly distinctive personalities - popes, saints, kings, sultans and heroes like Saladin and Richard Coeur de Lion, of the encounter of two great cultures and their cross-fertilization. It tells of the three great Military Orders, the Knights Hospitaller of St John, the Teutonic Knights and the Knights Templar. It does not disguise the savagery that accompanied the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders or the scenes of fire and carnage when the Kingdom of Jerusalem fell nearly two centuries later, and the markets of the East were so flooded with Christian slaves that a young Frankish woman might be sold for one silver coin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TRjOAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+sword+and+the+scimitar:+The+saga+of+the+Crusades&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snakes and Earrings","description":"Enchanted by the snakelike tongue of a stranger called Ama, nineteen-year-old Lui takes a walk into another side of life.

In a time of rising inequality, Walker not only survived a bitterly contested recall that brought thousands of protesters to Capitol Square, he was subsequently reelected. How could this happen? How is it that the very people who stand to benefit from strong government services not only vote against the candidates who support those services but are vehemently against the very idea of big government? With The Politics of Resentment, Katherine J. Cramer uncovers an oft-overlooked piece of the puzzle: rural political consciousness and the resentment of the  liberal elite.  Rural voters are distrustful that politicians will respect the distinct values of their communities and allocate a fair share of resources. What can look like disagreements about basic political principles are therefore actually rooted in something even more fundamental: who we are as people and how closely a candidate s social identity matches our own. Using Scott Walker and Wisconsin s prominent and protracted debate about the appropriate role of government, Cramer illuminates the contours of rural consciousness, showing how place-based identities profoundly influence how people understand politics, regardless of whether urban politicians and their supporters really do shortchange or look down on those living in the country. The Politics of Resentment shows that rural resentment no less than partisanship, race, or class plays a major role in dividing America against itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rg2ZCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Formulas-2","description":"\\"The best synastry book ever published\\" says reader from Ledeberg, Belgium.

But it doesn't have to. With the help of esteemed consultant and coach Michelle DeAngelis, life can really rock. DeAngelis serves up a combination of street-smart wisdom and cheerful irreverence as she shows readers how to enjoy the \\"ride of their lives,\\" regardless of the roadblocks or potholes along the way. By providing the specific mechanics to joy, DeAngelis shows that joy is a repeatable by-product of living one's life in integrity and of making conscious choices every day that kick misery, worry, and guilt to the curb. She explains how most people are not naturally equipped to deal with life's challenges and then introduces foundational tools and effective techniques to take readers from crappy to happy. She starts with a Joy Quotient Quiz that gives readers their \\"JQ\\" score and identifies their \\"Gap\\"--the measurable difference between what people think and what they do--which is where life sucks. She then teaches a four-step, fast-acting process that provides \\"suck relief\\" to solve everyday problems. The centerpiece of the work is DeAngelis's 10 Life-Changing Ahas. From the title to the very last line, Get a Life That Doesn't Suck is not your everyday self-help book. Through humor and real-life examples, DeAngelis explains how readers can reduce their stress, improve their outlook, and get rid of whatever is holding them back. She provides the formula for readers to make joy real and accessible so that the journey from \\"life sucks\\" to \\"life rocks\\" is worth the trip.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xfwjyn3cw8wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Love","description":"Offers a dramatic human, medical, and scientific study of AIDS and its impact that focuses on a home for destitute AIDS victims, run by nuns in the heart of Manhattan","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P1mMPwAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Afterlife Connection: A Therapist Reveals How to Communicate with Departed Loved Ones","description":"Dr. Jane Greer, a classically trained therapist, began with the belief that the bond that exists between the living and the dead is not purely a psychological one, but is, in fact, much more dynamic and empowering.

The authors view political development from the perspective of a general theory of socialization, and compare the influences of social class, intelligence, teacher attitude, and religious membership on the growth of political attitudes. The book outlines the way in which the child's political awareness evolvesfrom identification with authority figures such as father, policeman, the president, to a grasp of more abstract political concepts and the rudiments of political participation. Illuminating a topic of great theoretical concern and practical educational importance, the book is a significant contribution to the fields of political sociology, child development and educational psychology, and an important reference work for all concerned with the processes of socialization and of attitude formation in general. The Development of Political Attitudes in Children was based on a major survey, the first of its kind, begun at the University of Chicago in 1960 to as certain information about the induction of children into the political life of the United States, to describe the nature of socialization into citizenship roles, and to examine pre-adult political learning and behavior in terms of other implications for the stability of the political system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jqw0DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Development+of+Political+Attitudes+in+Children.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fat Dog Don't Run No Rabbit: Promoting change in Overprivileged Children and their Families","description":"Fat Dog Dont Run No Rabbit explains how over indulgence and over protection contribute to the development of Fat Dogs through over privilege.

'Chihuly alla Macchia' traces its development from the first small, oddly shaped, grotesquely coloured vessels, dubbed the 'uglies' by Chihuly's forthright mother when they began in 1981, to the recent flamboyant and exuberantly hued Macchia. This book reproduces in full-colour the 39 glass works and 15 drawings included in the 1993 exhibition of the George R Stroemple collection. The book is not, however, merely an exhibition catalogue. Through the extensive use of close-up details, it offers the reader a chance to experience the glasswork in an intimate manner.

This is Sylvester Stallone. Give me a call . . .\\" It was these words that would set Jim Peterik on the road to rock 'n' roll immortality. After he and his Survivor bandmates recorded \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" for the Rocky III soundtrack, the song would go on to earn a Grammy, an Oscar nomination, reach triple platinum status and become one of the most recognizable tunes in music history. But there's much more to the story of Survivor and its founding member, Jim Peterik, than meets the eye. As one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation, Peterik has cowritten songs with some of the most famous bands and artists of our time, including 38 Special (\\"Caught Up in You,\\" \\"Hold on Loosely\\"), Sammy Hagar (\\"Heavy Metal\\"), The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, and many more. Now, for the first time, Peterik is sharing his stories. Filled with tales from Peterik's life in rock 'n' roll, Through the Eye of the Tiger documents his early days of success with The Ides of March (\\"Vehicle\\"), through the often torturous power struggles within Survivor, and the giddy highs that accompany a trail of worldwide hits. From going to a party in Led Zeppelin's hotel room (and turning right back out the door) to escorting a disoriented Janis Joplin back to her hotel room after opening her show in Calgary, Peterik's accounts will surprise and delight. Through the Eye of the Tiger is more than just a memoir of a songwriting legend; it's a classic rock 'n' roll story told through the eyes of someone who has lived through it all and through the Eye of the Tiger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGQVBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Eye+of+the+Tiger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Jekyll and Hyde","description":"Dr Jekyll is a well-respected, curious scientist who tries to separate his good characteristics from his evil impulses.

In November, 1994 this posse finally gunned down an aging political establishment, giving rise in the media and elsewhere to the question, \\"Who ARE those guys?\\" In this memoir, Clif White answers that question, revealing the principles and people of the conservative movement in politics. In addition to telling fifty years of American political history and giving practical lessons for running for public office, his book is also a moving account of White's spiritual journey through an event-filled life. Clif White burst onto the national scene as the architect of the Goldwater nomination - the \\"sheriff\\" of that first conservative posse. His fascinating life story began in teaching and service in World War II, but soon turned to politics under Governor Tom Dewey of New York. After his team of conservatives took control of the national Republican Party in 1964, he next followed with the spectacular 1970 upset victory of James Buckley for the U.S. Senate in New York on a third party line, and then helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1980 - using the political team he had taught and nurtured since the capture of the GOP in 1964.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3R8hAQAAMAAJ&dq=POLITICS+AS+A+NOBLE+CALLING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crowning Glory: Reflections of Hollywood's Favorite Confidant","description":"The head hairdresser at the MGM studios offers an insider's look at Hollywood's Golden Age, and his role in the history of a great studio","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UX4AAAAACAAJ&dq=Crowning+Glory:+Reflections+of+Hollywood%27s+Favorite+Confidant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Child: Wonderfully Made: Parenting from God's Blueprint for You and Your Child","description":"The authors assert that research on personality and personality type, when informed by Scripture, is an effective tool to help family members discover and understand their uniqueness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6KxUvNCWZ4C&dq=Your+Child:+Wonderfully+Made:+Parenting+from+God%27s+Blueprint+for+You+and+Your+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Clue in the Jewel Box (Nancy Drew, Book 20)","description":"Nancy and her friends help a woman search for her missing grandson.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sWZTxQEACAAJ&dq=The+Clue+in+the+Jewel+Box+(Nancy+Drew,+Book+20)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus: Using Your Energy to Change The World","description":"A leader of the \\"Spiritual Awakening Movement\\" explains how each person can draw on the power within oneself to change the world, discussing how energy works, lessons in faith, how to find one's teachers, how to live in one's heart, how to find one's defining images, and how to decide what one really wants.

Plus he has to walk past the red church every day, where the Bell Monster hides with its wings and claws and livers for eyes.

Legislators vote along party lines and rarely cross the aisle. Political polarization is personal, too and it is making us miserable. Surveys show that Americans have become more fearful and hateful of supporters of the opposing political party and imagine that they hold much more extreme views than they actually do. We have cordoned ourselves off: we prefer to date and marry those with similar opinions and are less willing to spend time with people on the other side. How can we loosen the grip of this toxic polarization and start working on our most pressing problems? The Way Out offers an escape from this morass. The social psychologist Peter T. Coleman explores how conflict resolution and complexity science provide guidance for dealing with seemingly intractable political differences. Deploying the concept of attractors in dynamical systems, he explains why we are stuck in this rut as well as the unexpected ways that deeply rooted oppositions can and do change. Coleman meticulously details principles and practices for navigating and healing the difficult divides in our homes, workplaces, and communities, blending compelling personal accounts from his years of working on entrenched conflicts with lessons from leading-edge research. The Way Out is a vital and timely guide to breaking free from the cycle of mutual contempt in order to better our lives, relationships, and country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RXUDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Prophecies About Mysticism Hollywood and the Music Industry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKhhAAAACAAJ&dq=Ancient+Prophecies+About+Mysticism+Hollywood+and+the+Music+Industry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aberrant Elites (Aberrant Role Playing Game)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Own Home","description":"Winner of the PEN Center USA Literary Award for Creative Nonfiction From Chicago to Mexico, the places Sandra Cisneros has lived have provided inspiration for her now-classic works of fiction and poetry.

By analyzing the interactive ebbs and flows of political campaigns, Potholm uses both quantitative and qualitative analysis to understand the process and make predictions regarding the outcome. He contends that political campaigns waged in the State of Maine display a strong dynamic quality independent of the instant polls and reports that our media sources use to predict outcomes. Through quantitative analysis, Potholm shows that Maine political campaigns are underpinned by a positive sense of well being unique to the country, a character that celebrates its freedom and essence in all facets of society. Potholm dissects his study using data as well as anecdotal references to share the political and psychological dimensions of Maine politics in all of their dynamism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nG7G2r852GwC&dq=Maine:+The+Dynamics+of+Political+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crocheter's Companion","description":"Explore a guidebook with over 65,000 copies sold!

Stuffed inside a black lace stocking, the letters were hidden under the floorboards of a house in Northampton, Massachusetts, until their recent discovery. Reflecting the passions and anxieties of the moment, the letters were written by Alice Hanley, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants, to Channing Lewis, a cook in Springfield. Since the thoughts and feelings of women like Hanley have usually been filtered through middle-class reformers, her words provide a rare window into a realm of American social life seldom explored by historians. The letters are accompanied by essays that skillfully probe their larger meanings. Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz introduces the letters, placing them in the context of their time, while journalist Phoebe Rolin Mitchell recounts the story of their discovery. Kathy Peiss explores Hanley's life, her negotiation of illicit love, and her desire for respectability, re-creating a dense and textured world of home, church, and town. Historian Louis Wilson unearths the trail left by Lewis and members of his extended family in Springfield. Reviewing the experiences of African Americans in that city, Wilson clarifies the economic, social, and political position of a black, middle-aged breadwinner during the difficult years of the early twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DuWsAAAAIAAJ&dq=Love+Across+the+Color+Line:+The+Letters+of+Alice+Hanley+to+Channing+Lewis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete field guide to American wildlife","description":"A reference to birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and seashore life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eZghzgEACAAJ&dq=Complete+field+guide+to+American+wildlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhythm and Noise: An Aesthetics of Rock","description":"Analyzes rock music as an art form in the liberal tradition","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1_xDAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rhythm+and+Noise:+An+Aesthetics+of+Rock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy, Psychiatry and Neuroscience--Three Approaches to the Mind: A Synthetic Analysis of the Varieties of Human Experience","description":"The traditional separation of philosophy, psychiatry, and neuroscience into distinct academic disciplines has led to several discrete approaches to the mind.

What followed was a rigorous, pathbreaking, and enthralling exchange, which has been viewed millions of times since it was first posted on YouTube. This is intellectual inquiry at its best: exhilarating, funny, and unpredictable, sincere and probing, reminding us just how varied and colorful the threads of modern atheism are. Here is the transcript of that conversation, in print for the first time, augmented by material from the living participants: Dawkins, Harris, and Dennett. These new essays, introduced by Stephen Fry, mark the evolution of their thinking and highlight particularly resonant aspects of this epic exchange. Each man contends with the most fundamental questions of human existence while challenging the others to articulate their own stance on God and religion, cultural criticism, spirituality, debate with people of faith, and the components of a truly ethical life. Praise for The Four Horsemen  This bracing exchange of ideas crackles with energy. It s fascinating to watch four first-class minds explore a rugged intellectual terrain. . . . The text affords a different, more reflective way of processing the truly vital exchange of ideas. . . . I commend the book to those seeking an honest reckoning with their religion and those curious about how the world looks from a rigorously naturalistic and atheistic point of view.  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  The full, electrifying transcript of the one and only conversation between the quartet of luminaries dubbed the  four horsemen  of the New Atheism, which took place in Washington, D.C., in 2007. Among the vast range of ideas and questions they discuss: Is it ever possible to win a war of ideas? Is spirituality the preserve of the religious? And, are there any truths you would rather not know?

However, research on FS has generally been limited to a focus on description, or on the place of FS in L1 acquisition. This volume opens new directions in FS research, concentrating on how FS are acquired and processed by the mind, both in the L1 and L2. The ten original studies in the volume illustrate the L2 acquisition of FS, the relationship between L1 and L2 FS, the relationship between corpus recurrence of FS and their psycholinguistic reality, the processes involved in reading FS, and pedagogical issues in teaching FS. The studies use a wide range of methodologies, many of them innovative, and thus the volume serves as a model for future research in the area. The volume begins with three survey chapters offering a background on the characteristics and measurement of FS.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8vG_TjY5KfgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional, Country and Electric Slide Guitar (Book and Record)","description":"(Music Sales America).
