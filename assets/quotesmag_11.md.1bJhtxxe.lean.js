Albert Schweitzer wins that distinction hands down. In the 20th and 21st century, too much emphasis has been placed on the relationship between technological advances and the corresponding impact on society. Schweitzer simply transcended achievement by weaving a legacy of the most accomplished Renaissance Man in the last 200 years. Combining intellectual brilliance and an amazing thirst for humanitarian service, Schweitzer simply made the world a much better place. He accomplished more in one life time than anyone I can think of.The Philosophy of Civilization is a monument. This was Schweitzer's labor of love, and predictably, he produced yet another masterpiece. Reading Schweitzer should be required reading in philosophy, humanities, and religious studies at all universities and colleges in America. He should be the standard by which all GLOBAL thought is measured."},{"Title":"The philosophy of civilization","review":"This book should be more widely known.

Theirs was, therefore, a struggle which has become known as The Epic of Malta. This book has no such heroic stature.With 4 pages of introduction by a professor of history at the University of Malta, the entire history of Malta in WW2 is reduced to its bare bones. This is followed by chapters headed; Undefeated Malta, The Island and its People, Keeping Malta Supplied, Malta Under Fire and In Defence of the Island in which we find a product which is more reliant on photography than text to put over the underlying message.With text spreading almost to the four edges of every page on which words appear and many of the pictures being faded, the overall impression is one of a reasonable product being spoilt by cheap reproduction. Nevertheless, the photographic history is there and should be welcomed for that.NM"},{"Title":"Graded German Reader: Erste Stufe","review":"I am a first year German student at a local college. Initially, I was a bit shocked when I first recieved the book to realize how small the book was; however, don't let the diminuitive form scare you away. This is a great book for German students. The book is laid out in a 'Graded' fashion with increasingly more difficult vocabulary and grammer being introduced in Parts. The first couple sections of the book are fairly easy, with the introduction of basic vocabulary; however, as the book progresses the level of difficulty increased. The introduction of new vocabulary is typically done with stories and poems. At the end of each chapter, there are questions that can be answered about the stories you just read, and a review of all the new vocabulary that was just introduced. I find this to be an excellent way to pick up new vocabulary and increase my overall understanding of the German language. It really gives one a sense of accomplishment to be able to pick up a German book and start reading and be able to understand most of it."},{"Title":"Graded German Reader: Erste Stufe","review":"Graded German Reader is the best reading book for a beginning German student that I have stumbled across. It starts off with short two or three sentence blurbs using opposites: dark and light, thick and thin, tall and short, etc. (Obviously all these antonyms as well as the rest of the book are in German.) There is an emphasis on using words that are similar to English, so it is possible to pick through this first section with almost no English at all. From these it builds to one paragraph stories that use the vocabulary from the opposites section. If you have read through the opposites section and followed it several times then you should be able to pick through this section too (new vocab is defined to the sides). Finally toward the end of the book you are reading short fairy tales in German.If you are taking German classes but aren't yet able to pick up a book and read then this is the perfect way to get you to that point. I read through it at various points in German 2 and I feel that it helped me greatly when I was learning German.Also helpful to get fluent at reading German are comic books and children's books in German: Tim und Struppi=Tintin, Asterix=Asterix (but try to crudely translate a specific title into German and search for it ie Asterix und Cleopatra instead of Asterix and Cleopatra), Akira=Akira(but its mostly cussing and cool art, so not so helpful for German anyway), etc Basically find a popular English book that is at your German reading level (underestimate when in doubt) and try to find the German translation here. Buy one book from a German publisher and write away for a catalog of similar books, or look through promotional info in the back pages of the book. Then when you have more money for books you will know what you are getting into better."},{"Title":"Graded German Reader: Erste Stufe","review":"I have tried without much sucess to learn German three semesters at our local college.

In the very beginning it uses a very nice technique to introduce German words that are spelled/pronounced almost the same way as in English and are thus easy to memorize, and gradually moves on to the rest of the Wortschatz (vocabulary).It takes a while to get used to the approach, and it takes repetition of material in order to get down all the words, but personally I was pleasantly surprized with positive results."},{"Title":"Graded German Reader: Erste Stufe","review":"This really is quite good. The Crossgroves clearly put a lot of thought into Erste Stufe and it is instructive to note how carefully and well the four famous folktales from the Brothers Grimm were simplified. The fables were all new to me and I find they both invite and reward re-reading.I want to add that the vocabulary the authors have chosen seems aimed at highlighting how similar the basic vocabulary of English and German can be. You cannot go through this book without forming the opinion that the basic vocabulary of English and German must have had a recent common ancestor. This is good because it allows native English speakers to quickly build a useful German vocabulary. While the vocabulary presented is good German and instantly recognizable to German speakers, the vocabulary does not seem to reflect contemporary German as it is written in Der Speigel and Das Bild. However, when you look-up an unfamilir word up you often find that the Crossgroves have provided you with a perfectly acceptable synonom.

In it, he connects the economic and practical success of America's urban centers with the degree of socioeconomic and racial segregation present in each. The result is a blueprint that local, state and federal officials can use to reverse the troubling trends in our cities. Specifically, he calls for metro-wide planning councils, city-county consolidation, aggressive annexation by older central cities, and changes to state and federal laws to create unified cities without suburbs. The text also includes numerous interesting case studies that demonstrate what, when practiced, his ideas are capable of. Easy-to-read, fascinating, and enlightening. David Rusk is talking. Are America's city officials listening?"},{"Title":"Cities without Suburbs (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"Rusk comes to some good conclusions, such as the necessity of reducing needless tiers of government, the need to consolidate city/county/regional management, and so on, but he arrives at some of these conclusions using flawed logic.He invests a lot of time and space in the book to go over the theory of \\"city elasticity\\", by which he means the city's ability to expand its boundaries by annexing unincorporated areas or smaller municipalities. Instead of citing the work of others who use this theory, he instead has decided to omit a necessary component for supporting or debunking the theory -- a bibliography.In effect, the city elasticity theory can be in most cases nothing more than the \\"Polish blanket trick\\" -- sawing off part of a city and sewing it onto another. Gobbling up ineffectively designed or managed municipalities is a net loss for a city, yet this is not reflected adequately in his findings. Worse, he fails to come to terms with the inequities of city/suburban design, instead taking the moral low road by accepting the inevitability of suburban design. In addition, he fails to arrive at any useful conclusions about how to solve the problems of urban blight except through the city elasticity theory and engages in a sort of governmental political correctness by failing to address root causes.Ray Suarez's book \\"The Old Neighborhood\\" addresses many of the root causes of urban blight better than Rusk's work, while \\"Suburban Nation\\" by DPZ and Speck covers many of the flaws related to the inefficiency of suburban design. Finally, Jane Jacobs' \\"The Economy of Cities\\" does much to debunk some of the assumptions made in the city elasticity theory, based on economic models and history. There are other works to be cited to support or refute the basic thesis, essentially making this shortcoming inexcusable.Despite the flaws, including how some of the effects of the data points are in fact mere echoes of the causes, he comes up with a coherent set of points about reasserting the role of government in an environment that accepts sprawl growth as an inevitable path. It's just that the lack of a sizeable bibliography and the waving of hands over certain topics detracts greatly from the inevitable right answers.\\"Cities Without Suburbs\\" promises to create cities from suburbs, simply by pulling them into the city's framework. It's at best a last-resort solution for a situation where you're unwilling to admit you've lost control of events. It doesn't hold much promise for being useful in cases where the essential city fabric is more or less solid."},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"This is a great book, different from her later books.

It is so much fun to read.Mr. Carroll was well acquainted with three young sisters. The middle one (who was his favorite) was named Alice. Once, on a summer picnic, he told the girls a story he had made up about Alice. They loved it so much that he made a book out of it and got it published. The illustrator he worked with was very accommodative, and he made the pictures exactly to Mr. Carroll's liking. The real Alice had short, dark hair, unlike the original illustrations. (Robert Ingpen takes some liberties on his version, but I am IN LOVE with his dreamy illustrations). As is stated in the first chapter, \\"What is the use of a book...without pictures or conversations?\\"I love the attention to detail in this book, such as a little cup of orange juice on a bookshelf.Alice herself is a wonderful character; she is confident, but humble enough to admit that she makes mistakes. At one point she [SPOILER WARNING!] relates to another character how she enjoys playing croquet with herself, and when she cheats, she will scold herself most harshly so as to bring tears to her eyes! She is also amazingly smart, especially for being only about seven. (She states her age in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".)I would recomend this book for ages twelve and up. It just won't be enjoyable for younger ages. I tried reading it to my 9-year-old sister (who has been complimented by many people on her amazing vocabulary) and she didn't get the humor. It was written in the 19th century and the language was just over her head.Now, I have seen many cats without smiles, but I have never seen a smile without a cat.

Definitely a collector's item, just make sure your bookcase is tall enough! Amazing pictures, illustrations on every page. The inside has some illustrations and highlights, also."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Some of you could, by any chance, have watched the Animated Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. Most of you should have read Alice's Adventures, and if you did not, you are better off. If you watched both, then you would best understand the major differences between the novel and the animations. Though I am sure there are a lot more to point out, in this review, I will focus on theses three points: the change with characters, the difference in setting, and the alternation of plots.First of all, here are the major character changes! Many agreed on the Queen of Hearts being the one of the most different, and also, the Cheshire cat. The classic portrayal of characters indicated the Cheshire Cat as the property of the Duchess. In the film, there is no Duchess at all!! The Cat stands alone, and instead of staying calm and cool as the novel, it is rather playful and gets Alice into big trouble with the Queen. Not only Duchess was not even mentioned, the gryphon never showed up, and the mock turtle was totally out of the picture. The Queen is selfish and ignorant, and though she rules the kingdom, she shrinks from responsibility. That may not get you much information on why there are so many difference with the Queen, and that will go on to our second point: the settings.Settings were also dramatically changed, kind of combined with the other book, making it a total hybrid. The queen's selfishness was not mentioned directly on the original, only the screaming passion for winning. The Queen of Hearts on the film's personality was combined with the Red Queen (especially the \\"open your mouth wider\\" parts inherited from her personal lines), making clear that she wanted everyone to obey her and to make her as happy as if she could ever be. The other clear facts supporting the idea of the combination between the two books are Tweedledee and Tweedledum appearing after the caucus race, followed by the garden of singing flowers. I was clearly expecting more than this, so it will actually look like as if it WAS a two book in one film, not an in-between sidekick.When it comes to settings, it always has to do with plots. Though not mentioned above, the start and the ending have a lot to this section. First of all, it was just a pleasant afternoon, resting by her sister when Alice started to dream and saw the white rabbit hurrying by, not during the history lesson. Then, there is the white rabbit that appears more frequently than it used to in the original, even during the mad tea-party. However, the most important thing in the whole plot, is that Alice thought of this amazing world before even she started to dream, and found out it was a dream at the end of the story, BEFORE she woke up. In the story, there was no such thinking of this events and it was a surprise for her to know she grew back to her own size, and have been sleeping.Overall, there are a lot of differences mentioned in this comparison review, and despite of director effort to create a lovely animation, I think it was kind of messed out. There are some reasons I wrote down already, but it is mostly for the others which have not been. However, I DO appreciate the animator's hard efforts to even think of turning this perfect piece of writing to a film, so I guess the \\"missed-outs\\" are expectable.This was my comparison review, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any spare seconds, please put a thumbs-up on my review & share your thoughts with me. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The theme of this book is basically a mystical wonderland where the unexpected happens. She starts off by falling into a hole, and then her journey in Wonderland begins. Carroll's descriptive language is incredible and he's always engaging your imagination.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \`Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\"This is what Alice, a curious young girl, experienced one sunny afternoon. Very bored, she decided to follow a rabbit down its hole. Expecting to see the rabbit's nest, Alice was stunned when she opened her eyes and saw a teeny tiny door surrounded by teeny tiny furniture. This is just the beginning of Alice's journey to Wonderland. She encounters a mischievous disappearing cat, a larger-than-life caterpillar, and an insane Mad Hatter. Alice's adventure becomes complicated when she crosses paths with Wonderland's evil queen. The queen, jealous of Alice's looks, gentle personality, and innocence, orders that she be captured and held prisoner. Alice, united with her unusual friends, must help restore order to chaotic Wonderland by dethroning the wicked queen and returning to her own world. Does Alice find her way back home? Or is she fated to navigate through the foreign world for eternity? There is only one way to find out!Lewis Carroll, Alice's creator, brings a world of madness mixed with logic to life.

The Alice story is a lterary classic. Legendary even. Even people who haven't read a book in their life know at least something about it. They know many of the characters. Criticism of it is shocking, possible heretical.Meh. To me Alice In Wonderland is simply a nonsense story aimed at children. Nothing less, nothing more. Now, today the word \\"nonsense\\" has a perjotative ring to it, but back in the 19th century \\"nonsense\\" was pretty much a viable genre. But it's a short story, with little plot, no particular likeable characters, and filled with some of the most annoying literary creations ever. As some have said the events in the book are mostly non sequiturs, just seemingly random encounters that Alice has. It's written in rather sedate prose too, with little description of what Wonderland is actually like. In fact more information on the nature of Wonderland can be gleaned from the atmospheric illustrations by John Tenniel.I think Alice in Wonderland has survived through the years precisely because of it's vagueness and ambiguousness. People will read into what they want. It has provoked philosophical, moral, social and mathematical speculation. But I don't think there are any real hidden meanings or metaphors behind it all. It's an almost blank canvas for people to project their theories and speculations on what Wonderland is supposed to be. Something like a Jackson Pollock painting for the Victorian Age. Okay, maybe not *that* bad."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"THE weirdest book I have ever read in my entire life! It is wack!

When I was READING it, it never occurred to me, but when I downloaded \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" and found there were pics in it, it was a bit annoying.However, that being said, this is just gorgeous children's literature. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real. I love the almost stream-of-consciousness feel to the words, and of course the extremely imaginative scenes.

The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story. Surely the BBC could have done better with one of Great Britain's classics!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this version does have illustrations, they are not the original illustrations by John Tenniel, which was what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is of course a classic story that has seen many, many printings. That said, I am very impressed with this edition. The binding is excellent, the paper quality is great (even the dust jacket), the print quality is great, the cloth page-marker is a nice touch, and the size of the book is perfect: classy and noticeable without being too large. I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"What a classic! Everyone knows the story of Alice in Wonderland, made even more popular by Disney years ago. All I knew of Alice was the Disney cartoon and the artwork of Tenniel and Rackham. What I didn't know was the brilliant writing style of Lewis Carroll, the author who created Alice and her Wonderland.Carroll is one of the most clever writers I have read. I kept thinking to myself as I read this book, \\"how the hell did he come up with this?\\" The dialogue is pure genius. I loved every minute of the Mad Hatter and his tea party.The story is very short and without much of a plot, but that is what can be expected of a dream. It's sort of just a walk down the rabbit hole and through wonderland. But in that walk, we meet fascinating creatures; creatures and objects present in the real world, but with a fantastical twist.What I loved more than anything was the book itself. I got a beautiful edition of this book through Dreamhaven, published by Firefly. It was a $30 on sale for $7.95. It's hardcover, clothbound, with thick, high quality paper and illustrations that I've never seen before for Alice.The illustrations are done by Ralph Steadman. His work looked familiar and I found out that he is the artist from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I didn't know what to think of the images at first, but I liked them by the end. They are definitely geared towards a more adult audience, but then again, I forget what it's like to be a kid. He adds a certain edge to the characters. The characters become menacing and bizarre. He gives a great introduction in the book and explains why he drew each one of the images the way he did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I've been looking for these editions since a certain bookstore stopped carrying them a couple tears ago. They are small, about 4x6. So they are perfect for carrying around in your purse or bag for a bit of reading wherever you may go. My book doesn't have the picture on the cover but its almost identical other than that. (I believe the ones with cover pictures came as part of sets.) My copy does have some illustrations inside in black and white.If you want a really cute, small hardcover Alice in Wonderland, perfect for reading anytime, pick this up.***As per the reviewer above... the writing is small. Has to be for the book size! So if you need regular print, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"An occasional review will focus on this point. Alice in Wonderland is no more children's book than, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".The reason this five star book gets less stars occasionally is not because of its contents or purpose; it is because of either being mistaken for a kids book, in which case one wonders why it is forced on kids, or it is so dated that even the reader thinks it is gobbledygook.You will find the book full of references to items of the time and play on words of the time.If you fall into either of these categories then you need to first purchase \\"The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition\\"; this will clear this understandable confusion. Be aware that every sentience is a play on words for a jab at the culture of that time.I will not go through the story, as that is why you are buying this book. However I will say that it is a classic and should be part of everyone's cultural education.When you make it through this book and enjoy it the next challenge should be \\"Alice's Abenteuer Im Wunderland\\" German Translation.If you are also interested in sci-fi then try to get a copy of \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\" by Henry Kuttner.Best of Henry Kuttner \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a horrible digitalization of a book.

Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is a literary treasure for readers of all ages. The quality book binding incorporates a built-in bookmark on a ribbon that says \\"Read Me\\", in a delightful complement to this widely beloved story. Due to the coffee-table size of this edition, it may be a little physically large and heavy for younger readers to handle, and therefore is better suited for parents to read aloud to their children. No Lewis Carroll collection can be considered complete without the inclusion of this enthusiastically recommended edition of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I very much enjoyed this book because it was full of pure fun reading. Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts. This book is a bit different than the Disney movie. There are other charecters in the book that are not mentioned in the animated movie. and I think the book is more bizarre."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"So, what's a 47 year old doing reviewing a classic children's book? Well, it occurred to me as I was looking through the available books on my Kindle, that many of the free ones (yes I'm quite open to free as an option) that there were many books that I assumed I knew because I had seen movies, seen summarized in some other form or simply because they were cultural icons and \\"everybody\\" knows these books.Many I have indeed read and did read as I was younger. However, now with a Kindle and a commute, it seemed a perfect opportunity to address some of those elements lacking in my basic reading. It was in this spirit that I down loaded Alice's adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and read through it is a remarkably short period of time. Many of these free books on the Kindle, are in the public domain and have been available in text or PDF files for quite some time. A simple conversion in format is all that is required to make it available. The question I asked as I read the book, is does the experience of reading it in this format take away anything from the experience. Children's Literature in particular is often about more than just the words on a page. Of course there are often illustrations, the physical book itself takes on dimensions that are bigger than usual. This adds to the experience of a child reading the book by themselves but in particular it adds to the experience of a child being read to who can then sit in a lap or look as the book as presented and share in the experience by learning to read or reinforcing reading skills.So, for a aging kid who needs something to read to round out his cultural iconic missing links this worked just fine. However, for those seeking to have an experience with their kids in reading a classic piece of literature, I'd not recommend it in that venue.As to the story itself, there's little I can say. In some ways, it's like reading a familiar story but in others it's amazing how much can be lost or glossed over in the pop-cultural offerings that sprang from it. Reading this piece of classic literature gives you some insight not only into the time it came from, but also into the heart of childhood that is timeless and can be recaptured at least in part, if we'll pause and exercise our imagination.4 stars. Absolutely 5 stars as far as the story goes. Because this specifically addresses the Kindle edition, a drop of a star so that any considering reading this to their children from a kindle, consider what might be lost by not obtaining a more traditional copy complete with illustrations and the opportunity to share at a level one notch above what the Kindle offers in this context.Perhaps something like thisAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. Take some time and look for what will work best for you and your intended audience.bart breen"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?\\" Someone might have thought to ask that of the compilers of this Kindle edition, which lacks any of the famed Tenniel illustrations, even though they're all in the public domain and have been made available in many on-line versions. Worse, the compilers also omit Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in the golden afternoon,\\" even though it's an integral part of the book. One gets the feeling that the goal was to not make the free version truly complete, so that one would have to wind up purchasing one of the non-free editions for one's Kindle -- which is probably a better solution from the outset."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I forgot how wonderful a tale this is. It is written so well that the images almost jump off the page. Even as an adult I couldn't help but to fall under Carroll's spell."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Do you remember the first time you saw a painting by Marc Chagall? His fantastic creatures wearing hats and trousers, people kissing while floating in mid air, layers of events happening at once, and conversations between animals and flowers? If Chagall was alive and asked to illustrate Alice's Adventures, it may have looked very similar to this.Only this is better.Simple and yet very rich illustrations bounce you from page to page. They are vibrant but not overwhelming, you are curious about where the images will take you next, it makes you hungry for more. And you get more! There is a printed illustration on almost every other page of the book! There seem to be as many small images, lending themselves as nuances to Carroll's text, as there are full-page illustrations. In a word, it's fantastic.I disagree with the editorial review of the School Library Journal. While I see this book as sophisticated, I also see very young children relating to the artwork. The dream is at times spooky and frustrating like the real world can be, just as at other moments it can be a playful party. Although Alice in Wonderland may not have been originally intended for child as young as three or four years old to read, they will be enticed into trying. A child as young as four will relate to this Alice, she is a small girl with flowing hair and dresses in an easy style. Deloss McGraw has illustrated a modern and truly dreamlike interpretation of Carroll's classic. Finally we have a total departure from the formal British and more grown up Alice that John Tenniel portrayed all those years ago and has been an influence upon artists attempting it since.Albeit a short, but important side note: the size 14 - 16 font is very readable for both old and young eyes, and comes in very handy for those readers-out-loud at late bedtimes in a dimly lit room.Of all the illustrated versions there are of this classic story, this will be the version your child would first pick up from the shelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland is repeated in a very readable text and is as delightful as ever. This is not, however, a childrens' book. Barry Moser's illustrations tell the story of Alice in a different, dark and somewhat menacing way. Is the rabbit hole just the means to reach an amusing world of people and animals with strange names and stranger habits, or is it the path to a nether region where the normal rules of social conduct and the shape and size of &quot;people&quot; don't apply? If his illustrations mean anything, Moser thinks perhaps it is the latter. For example, the Queen of Hearts appears not as the crazy, but ultimately harmless, creature of a Disney movie. Moser shows her as a dark and foreboding character and by his illustartion suggests that &quot;off with her head&quot; is a real threat. The text of the book is standard Alice, but the real reason to buy it is to get Moser's illustrations. This is definitely not a book for 10 year olds. But those of us who grew up on Alice as half comedy, half light hearted spoof will enjoy this twist on a traditional tale. Moser's other illustrations of classical works such as Moby Dick and The Devine Comedy are also well worth acquiring."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have this book. It is beautifully illustrated. I do not understand the comment of a previous reviewer who complained about the number of illustrations. Nearly every page is beautifully illustrated. Every chapter is introduced with a two-page illustration. There are numerous two-page and full single-page illustrations throughout the book. I'm an adult who fell in love with this story when I saw Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This is a worthy addition to my collection of things Carroll. I recommend \\"The Wasp in a Wig\\" if you can find it. The end of this Alice... has a nice and concise description of Carroll's writing of the book, photographs of the cover and first page of Carroll's handwritten first version, and a wonderful tribute to John Tenniel, the illustrator of the first published edition who provided the classic drawings nearly all of us recognize.

Now I understand why this book has just received the New York Society of Illustrators 2001 Gold Medal for Original Art."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The treasure of this edition lies principally in its beautiful layout and thoroughly original illustrations. Strict traditionalists may find Garcia's gothlike depictions of their favourite Wonderland characters a bit off-putting, while fans of Alice looking for something distinctly different won't be disappointed. The text is Carroll's original classic, nicely set, with a whimsical unjustified right edge and pleasing gradient toned pages. This volume does not include Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, which is a pity -- it would have been interesting to see Garcia's depiction of the Jabberwocky.

I buy the Kindle editions in order to easily search for particular quotes and passages. These passages I commonly paste into writings I do on the Bible, and Lewis Carroll's works are some of my favorites, behind Shakespeare and Plato.I mention all this because unlike many other books, this edition is actually better for reading than it is for the purpose I just mentioned, because it does not have the pagination which would enable one to refer back to the original copy. In most Kindle books, you can locate the printed page number by doing a query on a word on that page. That's a bit hokey, but that's what you have to do. That trick does not work on this edition. Rules for scholarly source citations have not yet caught up with editions which are formatted especially for the Kindle.But for reading, the Kindle converters got two things very right. First, the edition has all of Sir John Tenniel's drawings. They didn't even spoil them by having them colorized, even thoughh the thumbnail picture in the Amazon header is colored. Second, formatting for poetry loses absolutely nothing as the size of the page or font is changed. This is especially important for that unique example of \\"concrete poetry\\", \\"A Mouse's Tale\\" which appears in chapter III."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"If you've never read Alice in Wonderland then you are missing out.

Reading an annotated edition was probably indispensable because without it, I probably would have concluded, like many others, that \\"Alice\\" was an unrestrained, loony, dream-like fantasy - a literal pipe dream. But being in a collegiate, analytical situation, I was expected to plumb \\"Alice\\"'s metaphysical situation for some profound truths. As even the foreward to my \\"Alice\\" version warned, it would be relatively easy to construct a psychological, social, or historical dissertation from the characters and situations 7-year old Alice encounters. In other words, one could read practically any literary theme into the work. Fun as this scavenger hunt might be, I think there's really only one significant theme \\"Alice\\" reinforces - stay young and childlike and innocent as long as you can, because adulthood is harsh and inconsistent and insane.Consider the evidence. Almost every character Alice meets in Wonderland is a pedantic, supercilious, self-important adult that treats her with impatient disdain. Almost every character gives Alice contradictory, unfathomable advice and rules, symbolically underscored by the changes in bodily size and proportions Alice undergoes. We have the declaration from the Cheshire Cat (a relatively innocuous but still didactic adult figure) that everyone in Wonderland is mad to some degree. The authoritative nature of Wonderland's adults culminates in the ultimate authority figure - the utterly but irrationally and impotently tyrannical Queen of Hearts - who screams for beheadings but never accomplishes any. The most humorous denunciation of adult rules and customs arises during the \\"climactic\\" silly trial about some stolen tarts, where legal protocol undergoes zany pretzel contortions. Throughout, the \\"immature\\" Alice sees through the pontifications and does not take Wonderland's sneering condescension lightly, especially during the trial ending when the cards exasperatedly indundate her and cause her to wake from her dream, glad to lying in the grass next to a peaceful summer stream.To be more precise, Carroll championed a prolonged childhood for little girls, since he considered young boys unmannered churls and had a barely respectful fondness for Alice Liddell, to whom he dedicated \\"Alice\\". According to the annotation's foreward, as a minister who toiled in religious privacy, he would often look from his rectory and envy Alice's and her siblings' frolicks outside. With that knowledge, \\"Alice\\" as a Peter Pan-like paean to eternal youth becomes more understandable. What also makes \\"Alice\\" memorable is the bold assertion that a child can weather the eccentricities of an \\"adult\\" world better than most adults can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"this book was very entertaing and is a reallygood classic. its price is awesome so i dont think you can go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A long fall down a deep rabbit hole lined with book selves and small bottles should cause angst in anyone.

It turns out there's no such monster in the book (or in the sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" - as far as wiki tells me).What's marvelous though is everything else that *is* in the book.

However, I would caution you that, while the story is similar (excepting one poem as far as I can tell) note that this edition is lacking in the illustrations that make this work especially fitting for children. In that respect, if you are using this Kindle ebook as a means to read the story to your children, I would recommend either a pdf version with pictures or purchasing an illustrated version (they aren't expensive at all at this point). Otherwise, if you are reading this simply to sate your own curiosity as to the actual story or to reread the tale now that you are an adult, then this version is fine and you should be able to get along without the pictures.Don't get me wrong, the pictures are a definite added bonus and classic, but I find it hard to argue against downloading this classic anyway, as, well, its free.

I think it's because I'm not a big fan of Disney's animated Alice, and that kind of put me off from reading the actual story. I also have to admit the unsavory rumors about Lewis Carroll also steered me away from reading this one.I put that aside and decided to finally read this classic. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a delight. As soon as Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I found myself swept into Carroll's lyrical and strange storytelling and didn't stop reading until the end.Alice herself is the one who captivates the reader.\\"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\"After falling down the rabbit hole, Alice encounters some strange characters, the Chesire Cat, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter among them.

They are missing out on a wonderful world that has and will endure forever. I first discovered Alice from the Walt Disney animated movie (an excellent version), and simply had to read the book, as soon as my Mom told me that it was a book (I was in Grade Two at the time).

It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed \\"curious\\" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great. Nevertheless, if you find the time, pick it up if you want to. It's a quick read and you can make your own judgment about it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story read like all the sentaces has been thrown it a blender and then reassembled into a book. The only reason I could follow any of it was because I have seen the various movie versions many many times. I not sure why I assumed that because it was a classic children's tale it would be good. The entire thing made no sense and on more than one occasion I believed that maybe because it was the Public Domain kindle edition perhaps I was missing a page or chapter. I know it was missing illustrations but it also felt like it was missing whole paragraphs. If this edition is complete than this truley is a horrible book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES the Disney classic film; and maybe (as I'm sure some of you will point out to me) that is the problem, but I think there is a bigger factor to my lukewarm sentiments towards this Lewis Carroll classic.I read this on Kindle.Now I love my Kindle (app), and I love the bountiful \`free' books to choose from, but if I can muster any amount of warning it would be to steer clear of this particular book. The reason being is that \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is a visionary piece of literature that very much requires visuals to make it work. Reading the prose in mere \`black and white' so-to-speak, without any illustrations, makes such a low impact. In fact, the story takes on a tiresome tone without the aid of John Tenniel's illustrations. The fact that the Kindle version of this story omits them is a tragedy because it takes so much away from the experience. Sadly, my first experience with this story was on the picture-less Kindle version and my expectations were not met and I was left with this sour taste in the back of my throat. Thankfully, my mother has an illustrated version of this she let me take a gander at. When you tie both Carroll's wildly imaginative themes and Tenniel's beautifully constructed pictures you have a far more captivating and memorable experience.So, I feel partially unqualified to review this book since I didn't actually read it the WAY it was meant to be read.I will say that I felt the book definitely got off to a rocky start, for the repetitive nature of Alice's constant growing and shrinking became somewhat tiring to read. I also think that Disney's decision to fuse both \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and \`Through the Looking Glass' together in their classic 1951 film was a stroke of genius, for they both truly complement one another and elevate the other. That, and it also made for a more involving and better paced film, for the events in \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' become a tad redundant, especially the dialog driven parts. I mean, I'm never one to say \\"the movie was better than the book\\" because, well, how often is that true, but some stories are better told on the screen and this is one of them. Reading this banter is far different than hearing it, and it doesn't quite read as effortlessly as I'd wanted it to.So, in the end I recommend the story (it's one that everyone should read) but don't do as I did and simply read the \`free' Kindle version. You really need to get an illustrated copy, for it makes all the difference."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"And I have to say there is no contest.The kindle version delivers all the words, but it's just not the same things without the illustrations.The illustrated version is an absolute masterpiece for all ages, absolutely entertaining....Despite the terrible terrible movie......"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I am a big Alice in Wonderland fan and this book is just beautiful.

Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts. This book is a bit different than the Disney movie. There are other charecters in the book that are not mentioned in the animated movie. and I think the book is more bizarre."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll did an excellent job when he wrote this book. The way he described everything Alice saw in Wonderland I felt I was also there.Alice a young girl is on the riverbank listening to her older sister read when she dozes off. As she's sleeping she dreams of a place called Wonderland, where people eat tarts made of pepper, and babies turn into pigs. Where Cheshire Cats are always grinning, and Hatter's have tea parties all the time.This is a wonderful, exciting, and magical adventure for all young readers, and don't think because you've seen the movie you know the whole story. The book is somewhat different than the movie, but just as enchanting."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"One of my favorites.

Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Alice is one of those books. It was a quick read, and thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, I wonder what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a child? I probably would have hated it, as the language and sentence construction is purposefully confusing. But now, at 50, although it makes no sense, it makes a lot of sense because I can see Alice's world from a parent's perspective. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a free book on Kindle and a must read for every child and grown up if you have not read it.

I recomend it to anyone sceptical."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was a pleasure to re-read this timeless classic based in a fantastical world. I've never turned away from nonsense, especially when it's \\"nonsense for the sake of nonsense\\". I do not \\"buy-in to\\" claims that this book is purely a drug-induced creative work. The language and the prose is so absurd and confusing at times that you feel as lost as Alice, which I like.I think it's important to read the works that were later \\"Disney-fied\\" so that you can see both why Disney made the decisions they did for their youthful audience, and, how the author originally intended the story to be."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved it. Be sure to read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" when you finish this one. I got so much out of this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I want to start by saying it's free, and it's hard to beat free, unless what you are getting for free is really good. This is one of those items that is just that. This story has been passed on through generations, and I would imagine is still on of the most popular stories to date. I had only seen the movies of this tale, and thought there is no way this book could be better than all of these movies made over that last 100 years. This book exceeds every movie ever made form this book and will probably be better than every movie to come. The way Carroll portrays the characters in story you feel as if you are in the Wonderland as a bystander as it's all happening. It's a very vivid story that I will read to my kids one day.With this being the free kindle edition, it didn't come with the illustrations as other editions and that was fine with me. Where as I'm sure it would be nice to see the pictures as they were 150 years ago, it's still nice to use your imagination of the way Carroll put them in words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have taken to read some classics lately and I found Alice in Wonderland as a free ebook. I read the book in a day and loved it. Though I did love the Disney movie as a child, after reading Alice in Wonderland, I find that the book surpasses the movie. I will probably reread this book again in the near future to read anything that I may have missed, because the story had me begging for more and I might have missed a few things. I loved the humor in the book and the sadness of the book. The pictures give the book more life and I recommend this to everybody."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the first time I read the book in its original version and I found Alice incredibly annoying and is just a pretentious self-centered little girl. Maybe that's what little girls do but surely it annoys me so much that I had the thought to abandon the book when I am 1/5 into it. It is always difficult to read a book when one dislikes the main character. I did finish it and it is a lovely ending. The other characters so fun and interesting - very imaginative and I can see why it is a classic. Guess it is just not my type of classic even though I love children books."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ralph Steadman's illustrations seem to be taken directly from Lewis Carroll's ingenious mind.

The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I haven't yet bought this.

My friend loved the book. Thanks."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her. The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister. She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it. Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of. This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of. Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride. I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting. I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way. This book is for children and adults alike. As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I collect Alice memorabilia and have massive sites on &lt;yahoo&gt; and &lt;photobox&gt;.And maybe I'm the only one who saw the uncanny resemblance between Alice In Wonderland and my favourite singer Virginia Astley. Even her middle name is ALICE.Her instrumental album &quot;FROM GARDENS WHERE WE FEEL SECURE&quot; is the perfect soundtrack to Alice and all the titles she used were appropriate:Summer Of Their Dreams,Out On The Lawn I lie in Bed,Its Too Hot To Sleep,Hiding In The Ha Ha,A Summer Long Since Past...the music is accompanied by Nature sounds and splashing oars. Her later songs had titles like Nothing Is What It Seems and Over The Edge Of The World,these especially fit into her version of Wonderland. Virginia Astley even LOOKS like the Rackham illustration of Alice and not only that but she lived with her family in the 70s at Moulsford,Oxfordshire,with the Thames outside the back door and only a few miles South of Alice Country.Virginia is,in fact,Alice in the Deanery garden,her latest song &quot;I Will Miss This Holy Garden&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Most children these days are exposed to the magical adventures of Alice in Wonderland through cartoon movies, such as Disney's version, but very few are exposed to the exact literature, the book that made the cartoons, movies, and every other piece of merchandise on the market today happen. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is a complete children's classic. Unlike many children books of then and now, it makes you think, something we all, especially children, should do often if not done at least once a day. Not only is this book, which follows Alice through a magical world where the verdict comes after the sentence, tea parties are insane, and Mock Turtles sob continueously, a good fantasy story to keep young (and old) minds occupied, its also a good riddle and puzzle book. With constant interruption and riddles being said throughout the book by the 'mad' charactors, its a good book to read if you want something difficult to figure out or to wonder about. The author Lewis Carroll I've learned enjoyed complicated puzzles and intentionally included many in this piece of literature. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is definately a classic that must be read if not already read. It's a good book to settle down with and enjoy, for the young, and young at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a very exciting book.

Although a rather accurate depiction of Wonderland, it cannot compare to the book (plus it muddled things together, mixing Alice in Wonderland with things originally in Through the Looking Glass). I never really took much attention to this very strange movie, but one day decided to read the book.Enter Wonderland.Absolutely no plot, no direction, no point. Lot's of silly nonsense but in spite of, or maybe because of this, it is very enjoyable. You literally never know what's going to happen next. After reading this book, I realized just how much my own dreams... Unforgettable characters, who can ever forget the cheshire cat or the caterpillar, jokes, interesting supplementary drawings, and puns keep you on your toes.This is really not for kiddies. Sure they can read it and maybe even enjoy it, but cannot fully appreciate it. A masterpiece, a classic, but more importantly, an enjoyable experience.Don't forget to read Through the Looking Glass! Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; don't pop up in Alice in Wonderland but Through the Looking Glass. Although &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; didn't appear in the movie, it's still a classic. Finally, an explanation of this ever-puzzling poem! And of course, &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; is one of my favorite all-time songs...One of those books that you can read over and over again and find something new each time. Definitely an essential. The most fun I have ever had with a book. If you've ever been cursed enough to watch the movie but never read the book, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!

It is down-to-earth enough for younger kids to enjoy, but is also full of logical jokes and play-on-words that adults can crack a smile from. After lazing off during her lessons, Alice is distracted by the peculiar sight of a white rabbit with a waist coat. She follows him down his rabbit hole, and finds herself in Wonderland, a place full of strange characters and substantial anomalies. During her adventures in Wonderland, Alice encounters all sorts of talking animals and seemingly illogical scenarios. The rationalization in Wonderland is slightly skewed, and Alice often finds herself adhering to their strange rules after hearing their unexpected but relevant justification. For example, after getting wet swimming in a pool of her own tears, Alice suggests that she and the group she's with dry off. Her acquaintance, the mouse, proceeds to recite the 'driest' thing he knows.Among other things, Alice meets a hookah-smoking caterpillar, a duchess and her cook (who is perpetually peppering soup,) a mock turtle, a deck of cards, a Cheshire cat, and 'her majesty,' the Queen of Hearts, who is always threatening to behead her subjects but never following through. My favorite aspect of the book was Carroll's witty insights to the way we perceive reality. The story made me question the world we live in, and why things that are considered 'custom' are so widely accepted, How did we even come to decide what qualifies as normal or abnormal anyway?Alice's Adventure in Wonderland was such a breath of fresh air as a book from a child's perspective, and I give it five stars because it was not only thought provoking, but funny and entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics.

It inspired me and I used to play out the story with my dolls and dad's playing cards - such fun to be had and all because of Alice in Wonderland! Alice's character is an inspiration to young and old alike - a young girl who says what she thinks and challenges authority, precocious, open-minded, and possessed of an admirable courage in the face of strange and frightening events. It is a story that appealed to me as a child and at a deeper level as an adult appreciative of the wordplay and rich symbolism contained within.As an adult who has read the illustrated versions, the Kindle title is a bonus that I can store and read at my convenience.

They've either read the book or seen the movies but none of the former publications quite bring Lewis Carroll's story to life like Camille Rose Garcia. The artwork in this story is fantastic! Every page pops and pertains to the scene being described in a nearly perfect fashion. After finishing this version I could not help wondering if I hadn't drifted off and visited wonderland myself.Now, obviously the art is one reason to purchase this book but let's not forget the story itself. Carroll pushes the boundaries of reality, leaving the reader as well as the characters themselves to wonder if what they have experienced is real.This is not your classic fairytale. There is a damsel in distress but she has to save herself. There are kings and queens but no princes to save the day. There is magic without spells and witches. There is life in everything from the animals to cards. There is chaos with a certain amount of order and a dose of fear.The story itself is imaginative and one of the reasons I enjoy books so much.

Since I have seen the movie I knew most of the things that were about to happen, but it still kept me wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This version does not include any drawings, but I am not entirely positive the original Alice had illustrations. I know 'Through the Looking Glass' did though. (Please comment if you know so I can edit review).The four star rating is for the actual story itself. It is timeless in a way, but it is short and somewhat bittersweet. I do believe that it is the better story than 'Through the Looking Glass'. In this fantastic story we follow Alice through some interesting adventures in Wonderland. We are introduced to an amazing cast of characters including the Knave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, the white rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the march hare, and several other wacky animals and other beings.I guess the bittersweet impression is because I enjoyed the characters, but they are typically brief. The Mad Hatter is a little more prominent in the story, as is the Duchess, the Knave, and the Queen; but I would have enjoyed more time with the Cheshire Cat and a few others. Also, Alice is quite petulant, and it does get a little old that she continually goes into her little asides and interrupts the stories. Still, some of her comments are quite funny.It's very good, a true and timeless classic. This is a great example of literary nonsense. It's not quite as silly as something like Candide, but more imaginative and fantastic in every way. The Kindle version is very good, and free. Win Win."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was a spectacular book I love it so much more than I love the movie so thank you for writing this book"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I'm not reviewing the story (we all know what a masterpiece it is :) but this edition is fabulous!

But the one you must get---if you can---is the 'St. Martin's Press' edition of 1990 which goes by the ISBN number 0672515237. It is a gorgeous little facsimile edition of one of the best of the first editions. Nothing can compare to the charm of this beautiful hardcover with it's colored endpapers and high-quality paper. It's not just the original illustrations that are so wonderful, but even the original typeface, dustcovers, and embossed boards. The whole nine yards. It's better than having a real first edition (which would cost a fortune), because you can give this one to a child to enjoy, or even toss it into your beach bag. A matching edition of the sequel, Through the Looking Glass, was also available under ISBN 0312803745, but I think there are none left of it now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the \\"why?\\" question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In \\"Wonderland\\", Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:\\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\" said the Cat. \\"I'd nearly forgotten to ask.\\"\\"It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.\\"I thought it would,\\" said the Cat, and vanished again.And another quote:\\"...they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M -\\"\\"Why with an M?\\" said Alice.\\"Why not?\\" said the March Hare.If you find this kind of maddening surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's \\"Wonderland\\". You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of \\"Off with his head.\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A \\"classic\\" is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"Is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I read this story in the full from only in 6th grade, and I have read it once since.

Actually, I read that Helen met a young girl at a party and was so impressed with the young lady that she became the model for this modern Alice! The girl's picture was in many UK newspapers last month! The book is filled with memorable characters - that you know are old friends but they have been given marvelous face lifts!

This version can get to be where you don't know what's happening in the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S. Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland tells the story of Alice, a young girl who follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. At the bottom, she finds herself in a room with a tiny door and a bottle labeled \\"drink me.\\" She grows and shrinks depending on what she eats and drinks, and as a small version of herself, finds herself swimming in a pool of tears. Swimming to shore, Alice and some other creatures decide that \\"'the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race'\\" (26). Alice continues to chase the White Rabbit and the White Rabbit sends her into his house for his fan and gloves. Once in the house, Alice gets into more trouble with an unlabeled bottle, quickly growing too big to move. The White Rabbit and Bill the Lizard try to get her out, and Alice only escapes by eating some small cakes. She runs into the woods and meets a hookah-smoking Caterpillar, who gives her some advice on ways to grow bigger and smaller. Next, she stops at the house of the Duchess with a pig for a baby; the pig escapes, and Alice asks the Cheshire Cat for help. Directed on to the March Hare's house, Alice takes part in the Mad Tea Party, perhaps the most famous scene in the book. Alice moves on to the Queen's croquet ground, where she encounters the Queen of Hearts and tries to play croquet with a flamingo and a hedgehog. Next, Alice encounters a Mock Turtle and a Gryphon, who tell her the story of the lobster quadrille. The book closes with a trial on the case of the stolen tarts, as the Queen accuses the Knave of Hearts. Alice is accused also, and she scatters the attacking cards, only to find herself awake on the river bank where the book began."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book that I truly enjoyed.

My favorite part is when she is with the Queen of Hearts and playing the game."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It is somewhat hard to relate to the characters as they are from vintage turn-of-the-century English society and I am not. There are many things in the book that don't seem to make sense unless you look at the characters and situations from that perspective. The best aspects of this book are the creative characters and settings; make sure if you buy a copy of this book you get one with the original illustrations. I recommend this book to pretty much everyone; although it is somewhat dated and strange, you should enjoy it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"What a boring book. First I saw the Disney-Movie from 1951... those lovable figures, like the brave Alice, the crazy Chesire Cat, the big red Queen and her tiny little king, the wild expressive story. Great. Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like \\"He said... Then she said... Then he said...\\" will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story. But what makes a book a good book? It's the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know. You can't find them in this book.

Probably not one I'll keep on the shelf, but not the worst read either..."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice the curious little girl actually fell down a well not a rabbit hole. Of course she was chasing the white rabbit in the waistcoat. The world she fell into was a wonderland of non-sense. I found no mention of the twin boys that have graced many of the other tales and movies about wonderland which I was sort of disappointed about. I did find one part that has largely been omitted from recent works. It was when Alice made her way to the Duchesses house. A frog in a uniform, which was an oddity to Alice in its self, guarded the home but she ventured further and found upon entry into the Duchesses house it was filled to the brim with pepper. The cook of the house was randomly throwing pots and pans at everything and everyone. Curiously the Duchess sat in the middle of the violent cook and the cloud of pepper nursing a baby that she thrust to Alice to care for. Funny part was when Alice gazed at the baby at first she could not decided if it was a human baby or a pig. She abruptly decided it was a pig and let it run off into the woods while she continued on her adventure. I check this book out form the library."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a truly fantastic tale told in a world of sheer lunacy and wonder. The actual characters of this novel are quite ludicrous to say the least, but the ways in which they are integrated into the plot is truly spectacular. Readers will truly enjoy the ridiculous solutions that Alice uses to some of the most trivial of problems, such as shrinking to get pass through a miniscule door. This novel is not tailored just for chilren though, as the symbolism ridicules the fallacies of society in a way that will truly interest readers for years to come. Alice in Wonderland is a rollercoaster ride that should not be missed.

However, this edition is quite poorly compiled. It really contains the bare minimum of the story. For example, the illustrations are missing. (The author seems to feel they're significant. When the first edition was printed with illustrations with bleedthrough from text on the opposite sides, he recalled every single copy.) One of the poems is missing. There is no table of contents.

It would be nice if the book included the typical acknowledgment to Project Gutenberg (which is how this edition came into being) and its small text.I do think it's wonderful that this wonderful story is available at no cost to so many people.

It's one of the most famous line from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and I think it pretty accurately sums up the entirety of the book. I traveled through wonderland and came out feeling a tad conflicted over this book. On the one hand, I fully acknowledge that Lewis Carroll developed a truly awesome story. I can't even imagine how shocking this book was when it was first published in 1865!! On the other hand, I spent much of the book feeling like I was missing out on some kind of drug-fueled inside joke.There were times when I literally had to read the same sentence 5 times because I just had no clue what he was talking about (and re-reading usually resulted in me being even more confused than after the first read through). To be fair, I know that after writing this book, Lewis Caroll spent countless hours with an artist trying to perfectly capture the essence of Wonderland. Unfortunately, the Kindle version didn't include these pictures, which I think would have clarified some of what Carroll was trying to convey through his mad mad words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

Lewis Carroll, the great author of this book, is actually a mathematician. This book has so much creativity and deep meaning. It explains the transition of Alice becoming a grown and mature woman from a young child. This book is a perfect book for all ages, preferably seven years old and older."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I'm 11 and I read this book because it was free. Funny reason, yes, but it's true. I have never read this book before now, having only watched the cartoon movie. It's an interesting story, since it is supposed to be dream like, and so fun to read, out loud or silently. I think this is a great book for young people and young-at-heart people. If you've never read it, it's a must-read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's codes in the text, or debate this or that, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \\"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\\"There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters, my preferred is the Cat! - fantastical and totally normal creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences.For more than 130 years, children love the delightfully non-moralistic, non-sense, nopn-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are almost as important as the well-loved story.And for 0,00 Pounds, Dollars, Euros to pay - what can You lose?It is a whole win-win situation!Grab, people, grab!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Point: Dreams can be life-like and life can be dream-like.Path: Originally told as a children's story while rowing on the Isis river, this story was eventually written down and published. Carroll follows an inquisitive Alice down rabbit burrows, through animal homes, flamingo croquet games, under disappearing cats, and back home again.Sources: Many have suggested ideas for possible illusions and references in this work. The most likely is that Carroll was imagining what a dream would be like in real life.Agreement: I enjoyed the musings following the book more than the book itself. While reading it everything seemed so disjointed and combobulated - which is exactly the point. After completing the book I found myself pondering reality through through the eyes of a dream.Personal App: In a dream, extraordinary happenings make sense. Perhaps reality would be a little more exciting if I were to slow down and really think about what I take for granted. There is magic all around.Favorite Quote: \\"Alice looked at the jury-box and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\\" Moving its tail in a melancholy way! That is funny.Note: It is worth it to pick up an edition with the original sketches."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I just couldn't get enough of this book. I loved this book so well I can't give it enough stars. This story and its characters was so pure and simple I could imagine myself with Alice. It was humorous...sometimes I was laughing so hard I was crying. I enjoyed this book more than words can express. This book, everything about it, was beautiful, simply beautiful. The setting was so vivid and expressionfilled. The funniest parts were when Alice met the Queen of Hearts. The were playing crochet with living animals. Then there was the time Alice was talking with the Gryphon and the Turtle. The Turtle was obviously extremely erroneous concerning education. He was describing his school to Alice, and he said \\"history\\" was \\"mystery\\" and a lot of other twisted up tales. Then there was the Rabbit, March Hare, Hatter, and the Dormouse, who alone made up a curious group. The Dormouse apparently had problems with a sleeping disorder, as he could fall asleep standing up. Then there was the Duchess, who had a baby who resembled a pig, and the silly cook who threw everything within reach at the Duchess. Another odd character (all of Lewis Carroll's characters are odd) was the Chesire Cat, who could disappear just like that. There were many others, including a courtroom full of poor fools who toppled over when Alice made a sudden move, which I did not mention. The extra bossy Queen seemed to have a problem beheading anyone for the slightest offense, while the weak King pardoned them all behind her back. As it turned out, this whole story was all a strange dream which Alice had while she was resting outside with her big sister. Anyway, this was a wonderful book, and you should read it for yourself...one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, up till now. This book had a really great impression on me, and I found myself saddened to see myself coming to the end of it. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Jim Dale could read a cookbook and it would be awesome. This audio rendition of Alice in Wonderland is well, wonderful :-)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's nearly 150 year old story has never gone out of print. It has been translated into over 120 languages, and there are over 100 different editions. This classic fairy-tale is deeply imbedded in both children and adults of the Western world.The young blonde protagonist was inspired by 10-year-old Alice Pleasance Liddell, who so loved Carroll's candid story about her that she persuaded him to write it down. He provided her with a copy that he illustrated himself called Alice's Adventures Underground. Soon after, he expanded the story adding the scenes with the Cheshire cat and the Mad Hatter. And with help from an incredible illustrator, John Tenniel, he published the first edition called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865.The book is very short. I read it on my iPhone Kindle app all in one sitting (I was on the bus for TWO hours because of Red Sox traffic). It jumps right into the story: On the first page, Alice is already falling down the giant hole where the Rabbit disappeared. Alice is a strange child and you get the impression that she often plays by herself and mostly lives in her head (perhaps she's an INFP?). She has very entertaining conversations with herself that the narrator handles beautifully:She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.The story is very similar to the Disney version that I grew up with. There were only a few minor things that Disney omitted and with good reason. For example, I could do without the completely absurd scene where a Gryphon and a Mock-Turtle tell Alice about the Lobster Quadrille.On a road trip to Colorado from Arkansas a few years ago, a friend of mine read about half of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland out loud to the rest of us in the car. The illustrations were awesome and......................the words..................................made patterns...................................................on the screen....................................................................like this.That's the way I suggest you read/hear this story. So, download the audio book or coax someone into reading this book to you.

The movie has great visuals and thus complements this text-only Kindle version."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"You cannot go by stars alone really on things like books. Especially books like Alice in Wonderland. There are people out there,(ahem see the three star reviewer) that have no imagination. This story is just a silly bit of imagined nonsense covering up deeper meanings. Anyone apposed to nonsense, or those who cannot read \\"between the lines\\" need not apply. :D cheers"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- this Alice book is charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.Alice in Wonderland is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love this book so much,I couldn't wait to get Through The Looking Glass.I like this book,because of the adventures such as:Going down the rabbit-hole,using the key,being ordered by animals,meeting the Cheshire Cat,and meeting the Queen of Hearts.Buy it,now!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll tells us a fantatic tale of a little girl who is caught in a satircal world, filled with paridy and weirdness.

At first it may seem simple and non moralistic but after you read it over more than once you can see what Carrol was trying to say and how it reflects his life. I think I enjoyed it because it is something that would never happen. Well the odds of me falling down a well chasing a talking rabbit with a pocketwatch is slim to none. Because it's unsual, quirky and comical it's fun to read and hard to put down. I'd recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My 16 year old son asked me to get this book for him from the local library; (I think he saw the cartoon).

If it's been awhile since you followed the White Rabbit and enjoyed a Mad Tea Party, do yourself a favor and read 'Alice' again"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"After Lisbeth Zwerger's work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, I had pretty high hopes for her artistic interpretation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Her &quot;Wizard&quot; was a bold, refreshing take on some very familiar characters, and stands in particular contrast to the MGM movie. But, sadly, the illustrations for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; don't offer the same interesting take on classic characters. Her version of &quot;Alice&quot; gives us the most depressed looking Alice I've ever seen. She appears to be almost drugged, and not at all the curious and engaging little girl we know. While Lisbeth Zwerger is known for sparse illustrations, here they seem almost barren at times. Her version of the Caterpillar for instance takes an almost sacrilegious liberty of giving us a modern seeming caterpillar smoking a cigarette instead of the traditional, more exotic hookah. Her artistic vision here offers us a scene more mudane than surreal. Perhaps, the artist is illustrating too many books, since this effort doesn't seem to me to be a fully realised one. I recently purchased &quot;Aice in Wonderland&quot; illustrated by Angel Dominguez (Artisan, 1996) and that's far and away a much better version. I would say buy this book only if you're looking for another &quot;Alice&quot; book for your collection. I just don't feel it's a standout addition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I bought this book for my daughter. This quality of this book tells you that it is meant to be a keepsake. It is very well printed on high-quality paper, beautifully bound, and comes with a hard slipcover.

The book is very text heavy, making it cumbersome to read aloud to a child, and a lot of the prose itself is on an adult level. Although my daughter is an excellent reader for her age, she has lost interest in trying to get through this book.

Easy to carry many of them on an MP3 player rather than carrying several books. Jim Dale is an excellent reader that really captures the characters and feeling of the stories. I've heard other readers that were quite lackluster, but this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book was great reading-it contained the entire story. The pictures were accurate representations of what was described by the author. The hard cover and the ribboned book mark make the book a great buy that will last for a very long time.

Plus, the books I had found hadn't printed the illustrations very well (they were always dark and smudged). Then I found this edition of Lewis Carroll's classic, and I was extremely pleased! Rackham's artwork left me speechless. I adored the simple pen-and-ink illustrations to the full-page paintings. This is a splendid book to own if you enjoy the original story and want new illustrations to admire."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I ordered this book for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas and was very pleased at the high quality edition I received. Specifically, I was looking for a book that would draw her into reading it with exceptional artwork and craftmanship. This is exactly what I got in this edition. One possible drawback is its size. It's a bit large for little hands and portability, but that is a small trade-off for this work of art. Also, the pages are thick so watch out for paper cuts!!! This edition is nice enough to display as an unusual conversation piece on a coffee table, or pass down to the next generation.The booklist reveiwer mentioned that the print was at times distracting, but I think he misses the point. It's meant to enhance the story. For instance, as one character falls the print spirals and gets smaller. It wasn't difficult to read and my daughter \\"got it\\" and thought it was fun!Bottom line is that if you are looking for an edtion of a beloved story that can be kept for years to come for your treasured daughter or that special neice, this is without question the one you are looking for!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the cleanest and best formatted version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on the Kindle market.

I highly recommend this version!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice - 1 star. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Unlike other versions for the Kindle, this one has the illustrations and properly formatted poems and songs.

It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I in my life don't remember reading or seeing an Alice In Wonderland movie; not a cartoon or actual person one.

I was in the mood for some classic literature too!Having never read this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather than having a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end, like the nature of the writing, things are a little bit...bizarre. We have a collection of scenes which Alive stumbles her way through with (let's face it) atrocious intro and conclusion tacked on. These are so brief (a few paragraphs) that do nothing. In fact, I know this is an older story, but the ending is awful. Maybe it hadn't been done to death in Carroll's day?Despite my contemporary complaints, I actually feel the story would be better off without the intro and conclusion, and be left as a collection of very strange conversations.Okay, there are dialogue heavy with some great images and everything is twisted and fired back and forth, but even this gets a bit...repetitive. It's easy to see why the tea party scene is so famous however, as the writing and humour here is superb. Though I have problems with this, I can recommend the book for this scene alone!In summary, it was good to read something a bit different and the language is approachable and it's all very, very silly.

He was best known, however, as a author - writing under his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" - commonly referred to as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - was first published in 1865. Alice, of course, was based on a real person - Alice Liddell, whose father was the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and the Dean of Christ Church College.Sitting by a riverbank on a warm day with her sister - who has her nose buried in a book - Alice is bored beyond belief. So, when a fully-clothed, watch-carrying White Rabbit comes charging past, commenting how it's going to be late, she's obviously a little curious. Only a moment after the Rabbit had disappeared down a rabbit-hole, Alice herself jumped right in to find out what was happening. After a long trip down, she touches down in Wonderland...though, unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the Rabbit to get away. Still, she finds the key to a door leading off the hallway she's standing in...if only she were small enough to fit through it.I vaguely remember having read it as a kid, and I liked the Chesire Cat much more now than I did then. (I've always been a dog lover, but I may have felt honour-bound to dislike all *cats* as a kid. Still, Alice could have been a more discreet in bragging about her cat Dinah to a mouse and various birds...) My favourite characters, however, were the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. A short and easily read book overall, and one that really doesn't take too long in getting through. (However, having read up a bit more about the book, there seems to have been a lot of parodies, in-jokes and hidden references written into the book - most of which were lost on me. It didn't stop me enjoying the book though)."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love it! It is just like the movie that just came out, except a lot more describtive.

It is about ayoung girl dreaming about her own world. She is chasing a funny littlerabbit. As she follows this rabbit he leads her to many different adventures! A great book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll is a great author for kids and he represents a completely new phase in children's literature. Children are children and they only have grown-up age in front of them as a limited world and a perspective, the latter of which they may change when they are grown up by remembering what childhood was for them and the tales they entertained when they were children in order to tell them to a new generation of children. Lewis Carroll leads Alice into a world where everyday objects and animals, but also strange objects and animals, mix. Everything is right and wrong at the same time. Too small or too big. Everything speaks and tells stories or sings songs that remind Alice of songs she knows but that come out strange and distorted. This whole world of wonderland is a suddenly animated pack of cards in a doll's house and doll's garden. But at the same time Lewis Carroll invests the fears and the fantasms of the child into this world. We then can have and see a father figure and a mother figure that loom high in this world and represent a completely aborted sense of justice. Alice, the child, becomes the one who puts things together and back to straightness by just dreaming this disrupted world awake. She only nostalgically remembers the fascination that was hers and the strangeness that was that world's. Waking up brings her back to normality and clears this wonderland of the menaces it contained. Lewis Carroll is a genius when he thus depicts a world of fear and frustration and shows how this world can become marvellous in real life because it is the antipodes of everyday regular society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I ordered this book twice and both times received the wrong book.

It just wasn't as magical as I imagined it would be. The movies are always so visually striking and I thought Carroll's descriptions a bit flat.Obviously, the story is a classic non-sensical tale and it is good.

Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them.I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book.

While this book doesn't have some of Lewis Carroll's more famous I did enjoy what was here, especially \\"How does the little crocodile improve his shining tale.\\"As an adult, I must admit I found it a bit weirder than I remembered. However, keeping in mind the revelation of the final chapter certainly does help keep it in perspective. Ultimately, this is a classic that kids will still enjoy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"... and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\\" Good advice for reading this book, from the Red King himself.To say that \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a classic would be to state the obvious. Published originally in 1865, it was taken from stories which the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) told to three girls, the daughters of Henry George Liddell, including Alice Liddell who is the basis for the heroine of the stories. The stories inside are wonderful and superb nonsense which appeal to readers of all ages, as long as you don't try to read too much into it. The stories are filled with all sorts of absurdities based on language, logic, math, and parody. If you obtain a copy which has notes that discuss what is being parodied, it will add to the fun, certainly, but it isn't necessary because even without the parody it is still great fun. Also, you can certainly find references online to help find the sources which are being parodied.Other than to say that the book is about Alice's adventures it would be difficult to say that there are any great lessons here, other than perhaps to not take things too seriously. At the same time there are certainly some running themes throughout the stories. Size is a key element at some times Alice is very tiny, and at other times incredibly large, and food and drink are the main triggers for these changes. Sense and nonsense is another running theme as there are those who try to make sense out of the nonsense, and others who just enjoy the ride.The book opens with Alice following the white rabbit down the hole, and plummeting deep into the Earth. She meets many characters in her adventures, like the White Rabbit, a mouse, a lizard named Bill, a Caterpiller smoking a hookah, the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare the Cheshire Cat, the Mock Turtle, the Red Queen, and many others. The adventures include her descent into Wonderland, her loss of identity with her changes in size, her babysitting a baby which turns into a pig, the endless tea-party, a very unusual croquet game, listening to the Mock Turtle's story, and of course the trial at the end.The stories clearly have long lasting influence as well. In books, movies, music, and art, there are countless examples of works based on the Alice Adventures as well as references to them. One thing those works have done is led to some confusion with regards to the Alice stories. Characters like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red Queen are not in this book, but rather in the sequel \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\"."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"i love ralph steadman. his pictorial spin with the classic tale adds a new dimension to the story. this is not your disney princess story book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Tomorrow you will enter a planet where animals talk; you may even feel a bit smaller than usual after drinking a modest drink. There is going to be a door that you may be anxious to go in but not so anxious to drink what's on the table. If you are eager to go inside that door, read Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.Alices Adventures in Wonderland, where do I originate? Let's start at the beginning, Alice walking around in the forest then she sees a cat in a tree and the next thing you know she is in a room with a miniature little door in it and a drink on the table. One sip will do it you are as small as a mouse. Now figuring out that she can now fit into that tinny tiny little door. What will Alice do in that peculiar world with talking animals and cardish people who talk? If you think this book is right for you than run down to the nearest book store and pick up Alices Adventures in Wonderland, but watch out for the queen, she may behead you!I actually have two ideal parts of this book. My first favorite part of the book is when Alice sips the potion which makes her very small. I like it because in the beginning she really wants to get in a very small door and she realizes that she can now fit in that little door. My second favorite part is when she is at the tea party with the Mad Hatter. I like this part because she is so bewildered with what is happening because it is always tea time.The part of the book that makes me chuckle is when Alice is observing the queen play croquet. I think it is amusing because she is playing with these card/people things and if they do anything wrong the queen would behead them. She thinks they are always doing something wrong so, she always is sending people out to behead them.I would recommend this to people who are gloomy or have a bizarre life because; it would probably comfort someone sad up.

Once the rabbit went down a well-like hole, she soon followed, falling down and down for what seemed like forever. At her landing, she appeared in a whole new world, with talking caterpillars, floating/disappearing cats, and food that makes you grow and shrink. Another major aspect of the rising action is when Alice ate a special cake that made her grow extremely large in the rabbit's house. It made her realize how weird this Wonderland was.I enjoyed the beginning of this book because it was very interesting how random organisms were talking, for example, a smoking caterpillar. Another interesting factor was the bottle that read \\"Drink Me\\" and the cake that read \\"Eat Me\\"; the liquid made her shrink while the cake made her grow. Once it got towards the middle of the novel, I got progressively confused. I think this book is a little too random: especially when it goes from the Mad-Hatters tea party to the Queen's croquet match. The transitions from each scene made it confusing to read because it went too fast. Another reason this book is confusing is because it was written in 1865 and some of the language is outdated.

There are many full page illustrations that are simply amazing to look at. With a detailed style that occasionally reminds me of Graeme Base, he populates &quot;Wonderland&quot; with all sorts of exotic birds and animals, some of which aren't usually included in illustrated versions of Alice, such as anteaters, platypuses, hippos, etc. But they lend an air of strangeness to this imaginary world that nonetheless seems to be appropriate. The artist has included a number of unique touches to the world of Alice, and they all fit in wonderfully with the spirit of the book. I would definitely say this book is worth buying for your &quot;Alice&quot; collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This classic tale is the best of them all!

First, it was much shorter than I expected. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected. And I had no idea how it would end. Much has been written about it and it has been over-analyzed beyond belief. I didn't read any of the commentary on it and don't intend to unless one of you sends me a convincing argument as to why I should.My expectations must have come mostly from the 1951 Disney movie. And I expected a darker movie. Maybe I should see the movie again, as and adult and see if I still think it is so dark.I would encourage you to read it, if you have any interest at all.BTW, the version I read looked different from this one, but I couldn't find it on Goodreads or Amazon.

First of all this classic is beautifully presented here. Good paper, good print always add to the pleasure of reading. This volume could well become a beloved family heirloom passed down to generations not yet born.This book like many classics should be read several times in our life time. As a child for the wonder and adventure of it all. Later, for insight into human nature including our own. I suggest we read Alice every 5 years, not that I ever did, but I wish I had.As we age, or mature if we are lucky, we glean important insights we might have missed as children. Sometimes by living, sometimes by reading. As I recently read this book, I found myself shaking my head and snorting, \\"Boy, isn't that true.\\" Insights into human nature and the lives we have led burst forth.Bottom line: A good read whatever your age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carrol has thought up a beautiful book with a wonderful storyline.

If anyone is wondering how this book relates to any of the movies it has some basis but as usual the book is much better."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"We all know what happened to poor Alice when she fell down the rabbit hole? Or do we?This is definitely not Disney's Alice in Wonderland or Tim Burton's wickedly awesome version of the tale. This is it... the real deal.I've been meaning to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for a few years now (you'd think I would've read it as a child, but nope, back then I was into Stephen King haha) and I chose this edition in particular because I fell in love with Camille Rose Garcia's illustrations. With it's fun-shaped narratives and two-page, colorful layouts scattered throughout. Originally I thought it was a shorter version of the novel, but to my joy and delight, it was the full story, so this is definitely one that I'm showcasing in my bookshelf at the moment.As for the story, well, it's complete nonsense of course, but that's the great thing about it. There are talking cats who disappear all but their grin. There are sneezing babies that turn into pigs. There are mock turtles, dodobirds, gryphons and hookah-smoking caterpillars. There is painting the roses red, a queen who won't think twice before yelling \\"off with his/her head\\", there are dormouse's with sleeping disorders who hang with nutty hatters and crazy hares. Oh, and did I mention Alice's problem with height... yea, the poor girl.Jibberish I tell you. But that's the fun of it. I would call it an organized mess. There really is no rhyme or reason to it, and that's exactly what makes it such a delight to read. Very imaginative, colorful and amusing - and I personally could not help feeling \\"curiouser and curiouser\\". I read it rather quickly too, as it's not very long.All in all, this was a very peculiar read, one that I can say is fun, whimsical and a classic that should be read at least once in your life.And one last thing, does anyone actually know:Why IS a raven like a writing desk?!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's story of the young girl Alice who chases a rabbit down a hole and discovers a completely new, beautiful, surreal, yet, dangerous world is a tale beloved by both children and adults. There are countless editions of the story available. This one is published by Templar Books and is illustrated by Rodney Matthews. The book comes in a wonderful hardcover slipcase. The illustrations that accompany the story are quite lavish and capture both the absurdity and fright that is an intricate part of Wonderland. The book includes at least one or two full-color, full-page illustrations for ever chapter as well as smaller, black-and-white illustrations of a quarter-page or less about every other page. Very young children (probably 4 and under) might not enjoy this particular edition of the story because there aren't enough \\"pictures\\". However, it is an ideal book for slightly older children as well as an edition to read to younger children. This isn't the best illustrated version of the Carroll's story, but it's not too shabby either."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"With the introduction of Tim Burton's new movie, there is brand new interest in Lewis Carroll's 140 year old dream trip down a rabbit hole. My first choice for an edition of the book (in print) is, most definitely, this volume. It is remarkably illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. Her wonderful painted illustrations imagine a troubled, hurting universe of the noteworthy characters - the Red Queen, the Dodo Bird, the caterpillar with the hookah.... Her surreal approach to art is unforgettable...rather like the explosion of emotions in first glimpsing Picasso's \\"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\\", the floating portraits of Chagall, or the folded clocks of Dali. Put in another way, the art in this volume of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" stays in your mind for a very long time. And because of that, the writing of Lewis Carroll does too.My second choice is the edition illustrated by the unbelievably talented black and white photographer - Abelardo Morell.Many will recommend the \\"Annotated Alice\\" [or even the \\"Annotated Hunting of the Snark\\"] but I think that's not the first way to experience Lewis Carroll. Second time around...yes...but \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" should be heard or read without footnotes, so that each person can interpret it individually and creatively.As for an audiobook, there is a very fine reading by Jim Dale, famous for his versions of 'Harry Potter.' Personally, I prefer the splendidly wicked audio version by Joan Greenwood ...but, alas, this is only available in cassette tape.Those who have never read the unabridged \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" will find it mind-bending...like first hearing Einstein's theory of relativity. No cheating allowed. The masterpiece has never been successfully translated into film. So, if you fail to experience it in the original, \\"off with your head.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Unfortunately, this free Kindle edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" does not reproduce the original's stylistic usage of typography. A particularly glaring example is the Mouse's tale. In the original, this poem is rendered in a series of indented lines of dwindling point size, curling to and fro across the page in the shape of a mouse tail. In this free Kindle edition, the Mouse's tale is flattened into a single paragraph, not even indented like a poem. Furthermore, this edition leaves out the prefaratory poem entirely.Unpleasantly, this edition also uses ASCII typography throughout: \\"straight quotes\\" instead of curly quotes, em dashes rendered as a pair of hyphens (--), and so forth.Read this book in a better edition, like the far superiorThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions), which unlike this edition, is complete, includes both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, illustrations (by Tenniel, Holliday, and Carroll), and annotations. (The Kindle Master Edition also does not reproduce the typographical tricks to render the Mouse's tale as a tail, though it does at least format it decently like a poem.)For a less portable version with full typographic fidelity, plus outstanding annotations explaining details of Victorian manners and culture parodied within the Alice books, I heartily recommendThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this is generally considered a &quot;children's book&quot;, Alice In Wonderland can only be fully appreciated by adults or teenagers. It contains so many private jokes, grammar puns, and other such stuff that a child would not understand it, really. I first read it when I was in first grade, a rather hard book really for first graders, and loved it incredibly. But rereading every year of my life since then (I am now fifteen) one finally can truly relish the great puns and imaginative ideas that Carroll (or Dodgson, his real name) placed within this extremely random book. Yes, there really isn't much of a single plot. It jumps from place to place. Just like a real dream. I don't understand why some people think that this is &quot;scary&quot; for little children though. C'mon, the Wizard of Oz and Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall- if little children aren't afraid of THAT, I don't what would scare them) is more frightening than this beautifully-crafted story. Note that the Queen of Hearts, though she has an insatiable urge to decapitate every person she sees, never really kills anyone- the Griffin says so. It's not frightening, rather, it's full of what little children like- randomness, smiling cats, violent-tempered queens, talking rabbits, and imaginary animals. If one is discovering this book for the first time, let it enchant you. If you are re-discovering this book, find in it the things you couldn't find before. If you are simply re-reading it for the fiftieth time (like me), then enjoy every single moment of it. It really is one of the best books I have read, right up there with- dare I say it- Colour Purple and Les Miserables. Yes, even Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an unabridged audiobook production of Lewis Carroll's classic children's storybook of a young girl lost in a magical land of fantasy. Read aloud by Grammy and Audie Award-winning performer Jim Dale, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a delightful performance that adroitly captures this whimsical spirit of the story. Highly recommended as a giftbook to listeners of all ages, as well as for public library audiobook collections. 3 CDs, 2 hours 57 minutes."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book is delightful, but I'm not talking about the story of Lewis Carrol itself. I'm talking, literally about the book -- its size, texture of pages, color of endpapers, texture of dustcover, that it has a built-in silky bookmark and so on. (This is one book in which it is the right thing to do to judge a book by its cover.) I'm also referring to the extra material, though. First are the illustrations which are really cool. Then there is plenty of commentary on the illustrations. There is also commentary on the Author, Illustrator, Foreward writer and even commentary on the typography of the book. Finally, the Foreward is amazing. I don't know if I agree with all that the Foreward writer says, but that Foreward sure helps to build your vocabulary. I've had six philosophy courses and I still had to look up dozens of words in the Foreward. Really advanced, arcane or even never-heard-of words -- why?, beats me. You would need a Ph.D. in literature to know all the words without a dictionary. So whether you're an adult wanting to increase your vocabulary or you want to buy a nice little book that is a delight itself in its physical being as a book, this is the Alice to buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Young Alice has never been a patient child. Therefore, as she is sitting along the riverbank, listening to her sister drone on and on as she reads passages from a slightly boring book, Alice begins to find her mind wandering. After all, this particular book has no pictures to capture the eye. Alice begins thinking about doing something else, making a daisy chain, or climbing a tree, but she's too lazy to leave her comfortable spot. So, as she gazes about her, she finds herself drifting off to sleep, and soon she has spotted a White Rabbit dressed in fancy garb. She begins chasing the elusive rabbit, but quickly finds herself falling down a very deep rabbit hole that she had not seen previously. Alice is frightened as she tumbles down and down, but soon finds herself in a new world. A world not filled with dirt and daisies, but, rather filled with long hallways, and houses that are smaller than Alice herself. Soon, Alice begins encountering characters of all shapes and sizes. To the confusing Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, to the riddle-loving, smiling kitty known as the Cheshire Cat; all the way to the delightfully zany Mad Hatter who loves throwing tea-parties, and the vicious Queen of Hearts. But, as Alice continues wandering through this wondrous world of magic, where animals talk and dance, and even dress in fancy clothes, she begins to wonder how on earth she will ever find a way out of this backwards environment, and back to her sister, sitting upon the riverbank. For even though lazing about on the riverbank can be incredibly boring, sometimes it is preferred when your life is in danger by an evil ruler.I do not have to tell you how much I adore the tale of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Since I was a young child I have been enamored by Alice's adventures to Wonderland, where she met an array of lovable characters who made you question the sanity of this backwards place, and the people who reside there. From the film to the pop-up books, and everything in between - Alice has been something I have cherished. Therefore, when I stumbled upon Alison Jay's newest edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I could not pass up the opportunity to call it my own. The perfect thing about this edition is that the font is quite large, which makes it easier for younger readers to enjoy the tales of Alice on their own. The second thing I adore about this edition, of course, are the illustrations. Alison Jay is a magnificent artist who has laced almost every page with full-color illustrations of Alice and the various people and things she encounters during her trip to Wonderland. From the intelligent Caterpillar, to the delicious pink-frosting covered cupcakes she shares with the Mad Hatter at his tea party; and the delightful, yet strange game of flamingo and hedgehog croquet played with the Queen of Hearts, to Alice's trial with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle. Each and every illustration is enjoyable to look at, and truly brings Lewis Carroll's words to life. A colorful new ALICE IN WONDERLAND edition, that puts a new spin on the timeless tale.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is my preferred copy of AAIW, and I have several. The quality of the illustrations is superior, because they were made from recently excavated printing blocks. The result is they reveal greater detail than I had seen before, leaving me more impressed than ever with John Tenniel's talent--as if Lewis Carroll's wasn't enough. A beautiful, beautiful book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The BLTC Kindle edition is an EXCELLENT choice - 5 stars. 5 stars is also for the original book. The free Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While the tale is the same as all other volumes of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the illustrations by Yayoi Kusama make it unusual and more beautiful than can be imagined. I actually purchased two copies; one for myself and one for my 5 year-old granddaughter. These illustrations are complete works of art, in themselves, by a very talented, creative, imaginative and, sadly, aged Japanese artist. This book will be cherished for generations to come."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I last read this magnificent book many moons ago (1962) when I had some time on my hands. I was fascinated by the story and the logic inculcated within. So now that I have a Kindle and some time I thought why not read this gem?The book of course is superb. No complaints there. The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book. With a story saturated with visual metaphors this is an unforgivable sin - even though the book is offered for free. Sometimes \\"free\\" is really NOT free because this version can drive away some of the younger crowd from reading the book. That is the highest of sins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The Secret Diary of Alice in Wonderland, Age 42 and Three-QuartersThere is an old saying:\\"In order to understand life and remain sane, you must read Alice in Wonderland at least once every year.\\"Truth in a nut shell.

This is a must read book for teenagers and adults expecialy, maybe a little difficult for children. It allows your mind to go on an adventure. I truely admire Lewis Carroll as he points out all the characters leaving the mind full of imagination. The peculiar white rabbit Alice follows in the tunnel leads her to meet all kinds of different characters.Alice gets bigger and smaller through out the whole book as she drinks and eats all kinds of things. The characters make you smile such as the Duchess, Caterpilar who smokes but is wise, Chesire the Cat , lobsters who love to dance, the Mad Hatter, The King and the Queen of Hearts. The end of the story just made me want to read it over again.

As she had a birthday coming up, I immediately set out to find the perfect hardcover edition. I already owned a copy with black and white illustrations so I really wanted something with color. Many of the books were charming but also seemed geared toward a younger audience. Then, I discovered this edition illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. I was struck by the unique drawings of what I immediately dubbed \\"Goth Alice.\\" I knew that my artsy \\"tween\\" would love this copy!(which she did!)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Camille Rose Garcia's work, in this new edition of Lewis Carrol's Alices Adventures in Wonderland, is amazing. Her characters and color pallet add even more enchantment to one of my all time favorite stories."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a magnificent edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The binding is very good quality, the pages have the gold edging, and the book itself also has the front and back cover illustrations. For me the last is important, as we bought this book for our 9 year old son, and we always remove the book sleeve covers from his books before he reads them. (Children are not always kind to book sleeves.)The pages are of high quality paper and the illustrations and print are crisp. Also, the book stays flat when opened at all times, very important for children.Best edition I have seen of this classic, and very good for children to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"One of my two-year-old daughter's favorite movies is a made-for-television version of Alice in Wonderland, so after watching the movie several hundred times I thought maybe it was time to read the book. Though I show a book cover, I actually read this book using DailyLit, a website that sends excerpts of classic literature to my email once a day, which I wrote about in another blog post.I found the book to be an enjoyable romp through a world of nonsense and fantasy, though at times a bit dour as many of the characters did not seem all that happy. I understand that Alice is a child in the story, but I still find it difficult to understand how children can be as lacking in intelligence as she is throughout her adventures - I don't recall being quite so foolish as Alice is at this age. My favorite part of the book was actually after Alice exits Wonderland and sits with her sister, telling her all about her travels. I was able to appreciate the story more once I found an entry in Wikipedia on the novel that explained much of what I did not understand, such as the various poetry recitations and songs, the real people that the characters were parodied after, the mathematical concepts explored, and the elusive answer to the Hatter's riddle, \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\" Answer: \\"Because it can produce a few notes, though... they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front!\\"Perhaps I have been disillusioned to the magic of this novel thanks to a combination of Disney's animated film and my daughter's obsession with her movie, but I would rate this book as a decently entertaining read, not one of my favorites. Though ,I am greatly looking forward to the upcoming movie Alice in Wonderland that stars Johnny Depp!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A high quality book with beautiful cover. I would have preferred more illustrations because I am reading it to my Alice obsessed 4 year old. She starts to lose interest with the text being quite adult.

Excellent purchase!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As a child, Disney's Alice in Wonderland was my favorite movie. I loved the colors and the nonsensical fun. Carroll's novel does not lack in amusement; however, the book is far more than the silly story I know from my childhood. At a deeper level, the book is full of fascinating symbolism that mirrors political strife and unraveling social norms of Carroll's time. I truly believe that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has something to offer readers of all ages, from a child's bedtime story all the way through adulthood. It's a relatively easy read, very funny, and includes no questionable content. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's classic story. Nothing more, nothing less.

Oh dear! I shall be too late, the Rabbit say to itself..and when he actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurried on and popped down a large hole, curious Alice, went after it never considering how she was to get out again.Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? She tried to curtsey as she spoke...Ma'am is this new Zealand or Australia?... \\"Curiouser and curiouser\\" cried Alice... Now I'm opening like a largest telescope...Good-bye, feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.... When suddenly thump, thump, the rabbit was still in sight as it turned the corner saying..Oh dear! Oh dear! How late it's getting... ( from the book)And it goes on and on...and on. Of course the plot and the narrative are totally nonsensical but if you let your imagination roam and let yourself fall into its spell you will be transported along with Alice to a magical world with its memorable characters such as Mad Hatter having tea parties, and the terrifying Queen of Hearts threatening to behead everyone. You will meet Cheshire the cat, the turtle, the Duchess, Bill the Lizard, the Mouse, the Dodo, the Lory and Caterpillar and many more weird characters all the while growing and shrinking from drinking lotions and potions saying \\"Drink me\\". Ultimately you will move around very fast and achieve nothing...till you wake up and realize this was all but a dream...This adventure has inspired numerous comic books, films, TV movies through countless adaptations and hundreds of editions of the book throughout the years. This story was one of the freebees on my e-reader so I decided to give it a go. Early in I missed the visual aspect I have always associated with Alice, but as my imagination kicked in and the characters came alive, it became easier to understand the humour and wits that played within the words and admit it was a refreshing experience. However my fondest memories take me back to the animated version created by the late Walter Disney and his Studios. Who ever said a picture is worth a thousand words really knew how to leave a lasting impression in a little girl's mind"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My Aunt gave me a BedBook Classics Alice n Wonderland Bedbook for my Birthday and I feel in love with the format.

It's been one of my favorite books since I first read it in high school because I had finished The Hobbit & a friend told me I had to read Alice. Like Tolkien, Lewis Carroll creates a very complete world that quickly draws you in & that you can return to at any time & feel like you've always been there. For me, I can't really remember what it was like to have not read Alice. It's very much like what a critic/scholar of Shakespeare once said of the bard \\" Shakespeare is in the air....\\" Alice is as well.....& in your head..........& under the ground..........."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I purchased two copies of this delightful book. Two, because I wanted to keep one for myself (even though I have small children, it is actually MINE! I share it with them if their extra good...!) and give one to a colleague as a thank you gift (another adult!). Nancy is a renown doll artist, with a high level of both imagination and skill. The book's illustrations are photographs of Nancy's amazing hand-crafted dolls and sets. This process creates a unique half-fantasy, half-reality image you feel as though you could step into. So, my recommendation is~ when purchasing this book as a gift, get one for yourself to get lost in as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It amuses me that this is listed as being for \\"ages 9-12.\\" Really? I read this (and the sequel) as an adult and loved it. It thoroughly deserves its status as a classic and can be enjoyed by adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I had always thought that I knew Alice's story. I had watched the 50's Disney animated movie and suffered the ensuing nightmares during my childhood and those memories stuck with me. When I actually read the book I found not so many discrepancies, as is usually the case when going from adaptions to sources, but a whole additional layer of complexity and humor. Indeed, while the movie makes a great (if terrifying) children's movie, the book makes for great entertainment for all ages.If you haven't ever read the book, and especially if all you know about the story is its many adaptions, you are selling yourself short. This is a charming, odd, and softly humorous story that is both short and captivating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Here is another excellent full-cast dramatization from the BBC; with an emphasis on the wacky, surreal aspects of Lewis Carroll's fantasy classic \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" The sound effects are used to great advantage here; especially whenever Alice (excellently portrayed by Sarah-Jane Holm) eats or drinks anything and changes size; from small to tall and back again. This adaptation even has bottles, cupboards, and food talking back to Alice!This BBC dramatization is likely to leave the listener feeling slightly disoriented; which is precisely how Alice felt in Wonderland. The cast, led by Sarah-Jane Holm, is superb; especially The Caterpiller, The Queen Of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter. As portrayed here, the celebrated Mad Tea Party with Alice, the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse almost goes over the edge into total insanity."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"my daughter thought the book is good but not to good.

It also includes an interesting introduction about the author.These things aren't included in the free versions, and I think they are worth having for $2,99."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really felt that this book jumped around too much. I could hardly keep track of where Alice was from the top of one page to the bottom, or how she moved from one location to the next. It was just hard to keep up. The entire book was just nonsense, yes I realize that's the point, but I really felt like there was nothing or little to be gleaned from it. I liked Through the Looking Glass a lot more. It too is about Alice's adventures in Wonderland and is also an imaginative little book, however Through the Looking Glass had more structure and was more interesting. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a lot closer to the Disney cartoon version than I would have thought. So I guess maybe if you liked the Disney movie this book is for you? Too much nonsense for me. It jumped around so much I just kept zoning out then I would have to reread to try and figure out what had just happened. It was definetly a struggle for me to finish. It was plotless so I never really got into the book or emotionally attached to any of the characters. In general I would say if you want to experience Lewis Carroll read Through the Looking Glass instead and just watch the Disney version and that will show you this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A Classic is a classic a classic.

I decided to read the fairy tale on the kindle as it was offered on Amazon for free. I watched the movie when I was a child and wanted to read the story behind the film. Since it is aimed at children the story is easy to read. But still recommended for adults! Once you start reading you quickly get enchanted by the exciting journey through a fantasy world full of curious creatures and places. Adults might love the dark and frightening side of the story. Indeed, Alice is totally alone and needs to survive. I really like the fantasy creatures in the book. Especially the Cheshire Cat which represents the crazy world in a very good way. One easily understands the strange feelings Alice must get while speaking to the cat.Unfortunately, the book on the kindle does not come with illustrations. I think they would help to inspire your imagination. But this doesn't take anything away from the story.If you compare the movie and the book, I think both are great. Since I have not finished the book yet I cannot make a final comment on this.

If it was enough to just know the story there would be no point in taking this book off the shelf. But it's not just about the plot but about the way that Carroll writes.

The tale of Alice and her first adventure to Wonderland, it's just spectacular. The characters are memorable, the story is interesting, and it's a great read for adults and kids alike. If you're looking for something old--in some cases something new to read--check out this timeless tale. If you like The Adventure Down The Wishing Well, By: Jason F.

It is nothing like movies make it to be, she's quirky and very intelligent for a young girl.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As much fun as I remembered. I felt like a kid again and absolutely loved it. Carroll has a great sense of humor"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Who would guess that I'd read this deceptively simple child's book as adult. Loved every nonsensical moment of it. Fantastic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"When I was a child I looked forward to my summer break. It was then that I opened my copy of \\"Alice's Adventures...\\" and dove once again down the rabbit hole. I even played Alice in a play when I was a young teen and it stands out as one of my most cherished memories.Alice is everything that I think a young girl wants to be - adventurous, clever, compassionate and even a bit funny. She is wonderful.Many editions of the book have been published over the years, and the Kindle one lacks the illustrations of some other versions. That was not a detriment to me, as I loved to imagine Alice and her adventures when I was a child. I know there are some gorgeous illustrations out there and perhaps the Kindle version can include them, but the lack of illustrations should not stop anyone from reading this book - for teh first time, or the thousandth."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Truly a classic. This story had popped up in my childhood first as a Disney movie and later as an elementary school play. However, up until now I've never actually sat down and read the book. I wasn't disappointed.If you are looking for an illustrated version, keep looking. This version is only text. It allows for the readers imagination to \\"see\\" the story. Some of the imagery is convoluted and makes this a challenge, but in a good way.Nothing is better than enjoying a good book on a dreary afternoon. The remembrance of childhood was just an added bonus."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Absolutely love this book. After watching all of the movies, each director took their parts from these wonderful books, including the looking glass."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A great classic for a great bargain price.

Not only is this book great but it was free! I would have given this five stars just the thing that puts me down on this is that you have to pay for narration on the whole book. I am a good reader but i really enjoy when somebody else is reading it to me:)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I enjoyed the book even though it was required by a class I am currently taking.

I mean it fits in the palm of my hand. And being as jam packed as it is with wondrous things the print is quite small as well. So, simply, buyer beware of that fact that I over looked."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story is interesting, but I think from a childs point of view this Kindle edition would be most facinating if it contained the orginal illustrations. Without these a child may have trouble visualizing what is happening."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book was very unique, I didn't realize the style was nonsense literature at first, however, I still really enjoyed it.

When she received them she called me right away and said how beautiful they were. I am so pleased to have such a variety of quality merchandise to choose from at amazon. These books are classic and a keepsake forever. Lily's Oma."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Absolutely the best edition of Alice. I enjoyed this story as a child, but thought it might seem like \\"a girl's book\\" to my eight year old son. Not so...due to Alison Jay's illustrations which add adventure and enchantment to the story. I'll be looking for more of her work!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I'm always amazed when I finish reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland how I feel like I just read the transcript of a dream.Everything is nonsensical, yet it makes sense; it is all completely fantastical, yet it is told so matter-of-fact that you simply must believe that Alice's adventures were nothing less than fact; the characters are so unbelievable, yet they always seem like old friends. The word structure and usage even reads, and in some cases looks, like a dream. You may not always understand why something happens the way it does to poor Alice, but like the unlikely heroine herself, you simply accept it and move on to the next adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"was the first time i actually read it, had to look up some words and phases since it is an older book set in a different time period. lol"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have read this book many years ago, I decided it would be nice to read again and it did not disappoint.

I encourage you to read this book also and see if it still means what you think it did on your first run through!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Working in retail makes a person think on the material world a little too much. I needed a whimsical fast read and immediately thought of little Alice. What a joy!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book was astonishing. I had an assignment in school to read the book of \\" Alice in Wonderland\\". At first I didn't wanted to read it cause i had seen the movie. Later on that day i read the first sentence of the book. It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand. But I reread the sentence and picture how it says it. This is such a wonderful tale to read. Children and adults will enjoy reading the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really liked reading the book it was interesting book it was a classic it was also adventures and left me on a hook.Loved it so much!!Thanks Lewis."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"In all honesty, the only reason I read this book was because it was for free for my Kindle but I am very happy I did. Yes, this book can be read by all ages and you pull something different out of the tale every time you read it. I read part of it when I was younger but it confused me too much so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance. Lewis Carroll does a great job of displaying curiosity and the unknown adventures in a child's dream world. You can choose to analyze this book (drugs, imagery, different meanings) or just enjoy the uniqueness of it all. Either way, it is an interesting, different story and an easy read, too."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Very delightful, even for a not english mother tongue...the book is a classic and for free so we just can't ask for more."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It is wonderful to discover another classic of children's literature illustrated by Robert Ingpen. It is a beautiful book. Even if you already own another copy or other copies of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you should add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Audiobook fans might recognize Jim Dale as the narrator of Harry Potter series. He has won two Grammy Awards and seven Audie Awards, and lives up to his reputation in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Dale brings to life this timeless story, giving the iconic book all the justice it deserves. Non only is his English accent comforting and accessible to American ears, he speaks with an ageless authority that instills both comfort and wonder. I can't imagine a better performance! There is something straightforward and comforting about the simple surrealism of Alice.Listeners of any age will revel in Lewis Caroll's book that defined the genre of children's science fiction. Forget the Disney knock offs - Caroll's original words are as entertaining as they were when first written, and his magical realism still delights beyond the wildest dreams of the most talented modern day writers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is one of the best Alice books I've seen in recent years. As soon as it arrived I heard people talking about the illustrations. My friends know I love Alice, and they have come to love her too. I gave this new copy as a gift. The art is fab, and the Alice image is more like the \\"real\\" Alice than the Tenniel Alice, which is very refreshing, I always think of her as real, don't you? If you haven't read Alice for a very long time, read this, dream about the little girl, pretend you are along the trip with her. Forget you're an adult for 2 hours."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was originally written in 1865 and has since been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, including theater and film. If you haven't already done so, isn't it time to introduce this masterpiece to your children?This edition is particularly enjoyable because it is presented like a large picture book, making it a great choice for a large range of ages. Sized at 9\\" x 12\\", beautiful illustrations by Oleg Lipchenko sprawl across every page, bringing the story to life. Broken up into twelve chapters, this is the perfect bedtime book. There is ample adventure and colorful characters afoot to keep children breathless and anxious for the next night's chapter.I think I was first introduced to Alice by the 1951 Disney cartoon. Like most book to movie adaptations, reading the story is so much better. Reading the book allows you to process Carroll's original text and allow your imagination to develop the characters, which makes the story uniquely yours. Here, Lipchenko's illustrations will act as a starting block, but they don't fully create the memory for you, like a movie will do.There is a reason Lewis Caroll's writing is considered a classic - it really does transcend the years. I'm so pleased that Tundra Books is offering this updated edition, so that I may introduce a whole new generation to Alice's adventures via a gorgeous book. I must point out that Oleg Lipchenko's illustrations plus Lewis Carroll's original text serves to make this a spectacular gift choice. Grab a copy and invite your own children to join the tea party and take their chances with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the demanding Queen of Hearts!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"AAW rating: 5Lewis Carroll rating: 5It appears that most of these reviews are reviewing the original book and raving about the illustrations and how wonderful the story is.

Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page.

But why only 2 such notes in the entire book?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was the cover picture of Alice and the Rabbit that caught my attention. Out of the many editions of Alice in Wonderland, I would recommend Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway Medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice with neat hair, an apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others which is good for reading because alot of other novels have very small writing which is hard to read.This book would be awesome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it is paperback. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels.You might get anothe edition of Alice in Wonderland because you think you're not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this version, then you will want to read it again and again after you finish.Written by Jenny"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I am rereading this classic on my Kindle and was happily surprised to find that it included beautiful illustrations.

The actors are top-notch as are the music and sound effects.The previous reviewer criticized this adaptation for not following Lewis Carroll's original; it's been so many years since I read the original (probably over 30 years) that if there were any changes in the sequence of events I didn't catch it. I will suggest, however, that Lewis Carroll's original be read before listening to this. There are so many whimsical and strange things taking place one after the other, and Wonderland is such a place of pandemonium (captured perfectly in this recording) that someone listening who isn't familiar with the original would probably be quite confused as to what is going on.I highly recommend this for children, families, or anyone who simply enjoys excellent audio dramatization."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"it wasn't quite what i had expected based on the fact that i had seen tim burtons new movie. i did enjoy it though but i was expecting more excitement. i would recommend it to young readers who enjoy adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I thought this book was good.

One that both adultsand children will equally like. It's filled with humor, poetry (if I'mnot mistaking this book with Through the Looking-Glass), and logical statements made by the characters that will really make you think. Some of the things they say - like the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter - will make you laugh.Carroll was truly a master in combining logic with humor. From any angle that you look at this book, you will find it enjoyable. No book, I think, has ever been so shrewd and witty. No E. B. White or Dr. Seuss book can be compared to the two stories of Alice and all her eccentric yet lovable friends."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"i really felt let down by this book.

The imaginative phrases and descriptions are enough to keep you going strong until the very end. The numerous descriptions of the different areas of wonderland is pretty cool. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"From the very beginning, the book showed its weirdness. Alice is bored on the riverbank in the company of her sister, and sees a talking White Rabbit walking by. However, she's not amazed by this, but rather by it pulling a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket. Driven by boredom, she follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole, where she falls and falls near endlessly whilst having conversations with herself. Apparently one can pick up cups and pots and place them on shelves while falling at a terminal velocity.The entire motivation for Alice's adventures is the beautiful garden past the small locked door she wishes to enter. Throughout her seemingly random changing of sizes to try and enter the garden, she meets mice, turtles, a caterpillar, a Cheshire Cat, and many other weird creatures. All of them seem to have a quite annoying wit about them that bases itself upon word puns and spellings. Accordingly, Alice's painfully simple logic and way about doing things exposes these puns just about every page. Tale to tail, Tea to the letter \\"T,\\" and other similar things. To brighten things, the Cheshire Cat's demeanor is a little different, but not by much. He, like many other characters, is quite literal and has a cloudy and recondite service to the overall story.And to top it all off, when Alice finally does enter the lush garden, she meets the Queen of Hearts who has a record of both ordered executions and empty words. When she isn't screaming \\"Off with his/her head!\\", she's playing a rather silly, disorganized game of croquet. I would attempt to identify an allegorical message about foreign countries' governing systems in this scenario, but the ridiculous nature of that chapter was just too much.There really was no clear climax, and the resolution didn't suffice--for me at least. What was the main conflict? Not being able to enter the garden? The unfair trial about stolen tarts? If the latter is indeed, then it was never resolved. Personally I believe it was identified at the very start--her boredom.Overall, the adventures weren't that adventurous, and the wit not that witty. Perhaps if you enjoy ambiguity, you will appreciate this book. It's very hard to understand cultural references from a book written over a hundred years ago. Don't read this too critically; take it with a grain of salt--or you'll dislike it like me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really wanted to like this edition of Alice In Wonderland, as I happen to admire Lisbeth Zwerger's art. Unfortunately, there were inconsistencies between the illustrations and the text which marred my appreciation.An example:In the scene where Alice encounters the rather severe and pedantic caterpillar, Zwerger takes a top-down perspective, forcing us to see the creature from above, as we would in everyday life. Zwerger ignores the fact that Alice is the same size as the caterpillar (6 inches) and viewing him from a lower position (he sits on a mushroom, thereby gaining height over Alice). The text even specifies that Alice has to stand on tiptoe to see what is on top of the mushroom. I have always thought it obvious that readers (especially young children) are meant to identify with Alice and see things from her perspective. Instead, we tower over the caterpillar, taking away the unusual perspective that Dodgson would have wished us to have. Tenniel's illustration is faithful to the the text and the child's perpsective; Zwerger's, unfortunately, is not.What is more, with Zwerger's perspective, it is difficult to imagine the caterpillar as a stern, brusque, off-putting character-- much like some adults who have little tolerance for children(\\"Who are _you_?\\"; \\"What do you mean by that?\\"; \\"Explain yourself.\\") The text mentions, among other things, that Alice is rather shy of him. From Alice's (and thus the reader's) perpective, the caterpillar is an intimidating figure. Not so in Zwerger's interpretation, where the caterpillar is not only a diminutive thing, but also a self-conscious-looking thing, puffing nervously on a cigarette.Which brings me to the most glaring and incomprehensible departure from the text: the cigarette. The story clearly indicates that the caterpillar is smoking a \\"hookah\\". Zwerger perversely ignores the details of the story and substitutes hookah for ...a ciggy! Is this artistic license, or sloppiness? Either way, a child reading \\"hookah\\" for the first time will be betrayed by Zwerger's illustration; older readers who like to think the artist should be faithful to the text will find the changes disconcerting and annoying.Together, these inconsistencies dampen the pleasure I might have gained from Zwerger's lovely pictures and Carroll's story.And this was just one picture, from the Alice book only, mind you. I haven't yet looked at those of Oz, but I am too disappointed with the first to try.For the meanwhile, the books remain in their slipcase, in a remote part of the bookshelf, while I enjoy the original and delightful illustrations by Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really liked Alice's adventures in Wonderland because it is so original!

So ou may be looking for the Ingpen edition but unable to find an Ingpen review.I fell in love with the Ingpen edition when I saw it in the store. Every page turn features an outstanding color illustration by one of the of the world's leading illustrators.In Alice she says:'what good are stories without pictures?' We can read a story without a picture, yet when we have a picture it really helps us in imagining the story, and Ingpen has a great imagination when it comes to the picture story.This is the kind of book you will leave on the coffee table just so you can show it off to your friends. Whether you are a parent or just reading it your own pleasure, I found reading it this way much better. I do own a pictureless version which I never got around to reading.Sterling publishers have published other stories with Ingpen such as the Wizard of Oz. So if you wish to enjoy a classic story and to fire your visual imagination at the same time this is a great way to do it. I passed my version along to a niece and have the occasional pang of regret for having given it away.I highly recommend it, think you will love it and hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book dimensions are appriximately 4x6 inches.

But one too many references to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" made me finally decide I need to know, first hand, what all the fuss was about.Reading a text that has long become embedded into our culture, turns things upside down. I had so long heard of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Rabbit Hole, that I feel like I know these reference when in fact, I don't. Now I do and that is what I got most of the book. Alice's plucky, no nonsense tone is a bracing counterpoint to the ridiculousness going on around her. The Queen cracked me up and I now see where Baron Sasha Cohen's Dictator comes from. As a work of literature, perhaps its charms would have been more intoxicating at age 7 but alas, I cannot turn back time.So I'm glad I read the thing but there was no transport, no insight and my general dislike for children's books and fantasy remains as fortress-like as before I began down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"awesome part one is amazing but, i have the original unbigided version in hard cover from Barns & Noble which was CHEAP!!! looking forard for the complete tales of Edgar Alan Poe i shall say nevermorep.s. i'm nine"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Have never read this classic before.

This is a timeless story that can be appreciated by all generations, and this is a beautiful gift edition that people of all ages will enjoy.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of my favorite stories from childhood. As an adult, I hadn't read the story again, until this book touched my hands. It is even better reading it as an adult because I found so much more in the story than when I was a kid. I appreciate literature more now and Lewis Carroll is one of the best. If I had kids, I'd read this to them before bed or naptime.The illustrator for this special edition of the book does a truly amazing job with the artwork for the story. Camille Rose Garcia is exceptionally talented, and I really hope that she illustrates more books like this in the future. Her artwork is edgy and gothic, which gives this children's tale a more grownup or current vibe than when it was written.I absolutely loved this edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and highly recommend this as a book for everyone to get.

When I found this edition at our local bookstore I gave the book one more try. My daughter listened as before to the 1st page , looked at the pictures and ... asked me if we can buy it! I almost cried. Finally!Even though I appreciate \\"Alice...\\" for its head-over-heal crazyness, I always thought it was probably too much for a younger child and it was up to the illustrator to breach that gap in helping a child understand.

His other works include Alice Through the Looking Glass, Phantasmagoria, Sylvie and Bruno, and Rhyme? And Reason? All of which are very creative and imaginative, but his best would have to be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book is enjoyed by most, but fantasy lovers and mature young adults seem to really love it. Once you read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you get hooked and you have to read more. Carroll paints a vivid picture of Wonderland and all of it's crazy inhabitants you find around every corner. Each chapter has a different plot and character even though the complete novel has a pretty well known main idea. Carroll keeps it interesting all through the book. You can really tell that he's trying to get the point across of the world not being perfect and it would be better if people just went with the flow. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.

I'm just so excited that Kindle is getting such specific support so early on."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love classic literature to begin with, and so I was sure I would enjoy this book. Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me. Won't read again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I never had any idea where this book was going. I know that in some cases, that may be a good thing, but I'm not so sure it was good in this case. I don't believe that there was much plot at all, nor was there much of a climax.

I had previously purchased BLTC Press's version of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". The illustrations in Wonderland were considerably lower in quality (it was published at an earlier date).

A few weeks later I was notified that the images had been upgraded (how's that for responsiveness to a customer?). I've swapped out the original for the updated version. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I was great to relive a childhood book that just shows how a childs imagination should be. A classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful piece of literature. The characters described by Lewis Carroll make the reader feel part of another world. Alice is a young naive girl who encounters some unfortunate events during her time in Wonderland. I do not agree with responders who say they did not like the book because, I honestly loved this book. All of the characters have their own unique personalities. Even if some of those personalities are strange, they are different none-the-less. This version of the book was more than helpful to me while I was reading it for a school project. The fantastic illustrations kept my imagination alive as I read along.One of my personal favorite characters is the Mock Turtle. When Alice first encounters him, he is singing about Mock Turtle Soup, which is strange because he is singing about a soup made out of his own flesh! The Mock Turtle is one of the characters that the readers will wonder how Carroll could have ever imagined. I enjoy this character because of his strange personality and even stranger way of thinking. Another character that I believe is extremely funny is the Duchess. She is mad; her baby is truly a pig; her servants are insane and her Cheshire Cat has a mocking smile! These are only two of the characters that make this story exciting and compel readers to finish the novel.I was in the musical production of Alice in Wonderland, and I loved the story so much I couldn't keep myself from reading the book! The book had many similarities and differences from the musical, but the general storyline was the same. The main difference from the book to the musical was the elimination of the minor characters. The musical did not include the lizards or the dozen animals that were washed away in Alice's pool of tears. (Just the three birds and the French Mouse!)I would definitely recommend this book to all readers! Young children will not understand all of the adult themes, but the unusual characters and great illustrations will certainly capture their interests. Furthermore, hearing one classic can get them to become more interested in other classics in the future."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Review of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Carroll is a classic fantasy that is wonderful for Middle School students who love to read.This fascinating book is about an adventurous and curious girl named Alice who follows a \\"White Rabbit\\" and mistakenly falls into a long, long hole. When she lands she is in an amazing new land called Wonderland. Wonderland is a world of crazy ideas and unfamiliar rhymes. Alice meets many new characters such as, The Mad Hatter, The Dormouse, The March Hare, The Queen of Hearts, a Duchess, a Gryphon, a footman that is actually a fish, and The Cheshire Cat, as she tries new adventures to get herself back home. She doesn't just meet these characters she also battles with them in a court case which is bizarrely unfair , she plays crochet, and even continually shrinks and grows herself. She gets herself tied up in odd situations but her curiosity carries her onward. In the end Alice discovers something truly amazing!\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a great book for children who love to be urged onward by amazing and fascinating descriptive word choices and crazy creatures. This book is not very difficult but is not easy either. It may seem like a childish book but it really keeps your mind going and thinking about what will happen next. I recommend \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" to anyone. So next time you are at the library or your local bookstore pick up a copy and check it out. Everyone will enjoy Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was the cover's picture of Alice and the Rabbit that caught my attention to get this book. Out of the many editions I would recommend the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice whith her neat hair, apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others. It is better for readers because novels usually have small fonts which are very hard to read.This book would be awsome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it it paper back. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels. I would not recommend this for traveling because it weighs more then the other paper back novels.You might get another version of Alice in Wonderland because you think that you are not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this book, you will want to read it again and again after you finish."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book is good I like it and I been reading it over and over and over again :) yeahh buddy"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the most creative story that I've read in years.

Wonderful new illustrations pair with an old classic story for a must-have addition to your home library.The hardcover version begins with Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in a golden afternoon,\\" accompanied by a beautiful illustration of anthropomorphic animals rowing a boat. I had only seen the Disney version as a child and as an adult desired to read the original, then decided to purchas this version because of the illustrations. I was not disappointed. Having been down a rabbit hole or two myself, I greatly enjoyed this nonsensical, imaginative tale. Although pinned as a children's book, the story is equally as enjoyable for the young at heart. Camille Rose Garcia's vibrant, haunting style perfectly compliments the dark whimsical story by Carroll. A full page illustration begins each chapter, numerous small illustrations are interspersed throughout the text, and there is also a two-page beauty in the middle of the book.Would love for Camille Rose Garcia to illustrate Carroll's sequel to this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll was certainly in wonderland when he wrote this story!!!!!!!

Not the best book I have read this year, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"I'm sorry but I got the feeling that this book was a rip-off of Ann B. Ross's Miss Julia stories. Both Esmerelda and Miss Julia are southern matrons with the conviction that they know what is best for all they meet. Both are basically good at heart but Esmerelda comes out on the short end of any comparison I can think of with Miss Julia. I can usually trust a consensus of Amazon reviews but this time I was mistaken."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"Esmerelda is a spunky lady in a small North Carolina town. She's not nosy, but she is willing to advise anyone and everyone who comes along. Most of her advice is directed through phone and letter to her dear friend Beatrice who is having late in life romantic problems.Her skills are put into the test when the AIDS crisis impacts this unlikely town. Her mercy and wisdom will be severely challenged as she is called upon to extend the hand of Christian love in what would be called above and beyond duty. She proves that love is love by what it produces, especially extended to strangers.***** Esmerelda is an unlikely, folksy heroine that will remind you of Aunt Bea. She is a lady from another time in the modern world who exemplifies Christianity. *****"},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"In this delightful romp through the daily life of a small-town Southern woman, Margaret A. Graham gets a chance to have some fun with her characters while poking a bit of fun at the church --- something I happen to adore. Esmeralda is an immediately likable character, an older woman who does not abide nonsense and takes utter pleasure in dispensing her always practical advice to others, even those \\"others\\" she knows will never heed her counsel. Mainly, of course, church folk.But, as Graham wisely knows, it's those very same church folk who will be the ones to rally to support people in need and distress, as the church's Willing Workers do throughout --- helping those who grieve, those who are saddled with overwhelming responsibilities, those who need a warm casserole as much as a warm hug. Esmeralda finds herself on the receiving end of their generous gifts of time and food when she assumes responsibility for a woman dying of AIDS.Throughout the book, Esmeralda writes letters to her lifelong friend Beatrice, a literary device Graham uses skillfully. Through the letters back and forth, we gain greater insight into what makes Esmeralda tick, and through her friend we eventually see a flawed aspect of her nature.Anyone who has lived in the South, the real South, is bound to be amused by Graham's ear for the \\"language\\" --- the way real Southerners express their thoughts, their choice of words, and their charming way of simply making up words. Thus Esmeralda advises Beatrice that the \\"onliest doctor\\" she needs is Dr. Scholl, seeks out a \\"notary republic\\", and quotes Charles \\"Splurgeon\\" throughout. The book also has some hilarious moments, as when Esmeralda must make up a name for the dying Hispanic woman and can only think of \\"Carmen Miranda\\" (which admittedly may not be funny to those too young to remember her), or when she tries to resolve an immigration problem, gets shuffled from one office to another in the courthouse, and finally takes it upon herself to enter a door marked Problem Resolution Office, only to discover 45 minutes later that it's an IRS office.And Graham's use of imagery shines throughout the book: \\"Her pauses are like when the washing machine stops then starts up again,\\" Esmeralda says about Beatrice. Graham has most assuredly done her share of laundry, because only someone who has listened out for the end of the cycle countless times can relate to the way those pauses sound like a person holding her breath. \\"If Clara can't climb down your family tree to the bare roots, you don't get no clean bill of health,\\" she says of another church member.But there are some missteps. Esmeralda uncharacteristically comments on the number of Christians killed and tortured around the world, something that doesn't sound like her but instead sounds like the author trying to educate her audience. Then there's the mandatory salvation scene, in which one character practically grills another to find out if she led a woman to the Lord in precisely the \\"right\\" way. That one really grated on me.Finally, toward the end of the book, Esmeralda convinces a godly man named Carl that he should cut what she calls his \\"pigtail\\" (a ponytail, maybe?) because no woman would want a man with hair like that, and, as she tells him, \\"it don't look right for a Christian man to go around looking like a leftover hippie.\\" Here's a kind, godly man, but he isn't quite up to snuff as a Christian example because he wears his hair wrong? I hope not. And I suspect there are plenty of women out there, even Esmeralda's age, who would gladly accept a ponytail on a thoughtful, caring man.Despite those and other minor flaws, what it all comes down to is this: MERCY ME is an enchanting, fun read, and Graham is an author to watch. Let's hope she has more in mind for Esmeralda."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"Esmeralda, the heroine, is an outspoken and feisty church member, never afraid of giving advice - especially to her timid friend, Beatrice and other not-so-Christian acting church members!Once you start to read &quot;Mercy Me&quot; you won't be able to put it down! Not only is it hilarious but also contains many truths about church members' behavior! Many of the characters will seem very familiar to any Evangelical church goer. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"This book was such a fun book to read. Esmeralda was an elderly character with a lot of spunk, who also went through some rough times with her husband when he came back from the war. It was so easy to love her. There was a lot of humor in this book--the church ladies following Horace to make sure the mule got a proper burial, Esmeralda giving dating advice to her friend, Beatrice, the church ladies all picking out a casket together, Maria's fake name. But with the humor, I saw a lot of &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; stuff spread throughout the book in a very subtle manner--Esmeralda taking in Maria when she was so sick, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to go out of her way to be friendly to her obnoxious neighbors, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to make sure that Carl is a godly man, Esmeralda being so kind to Horace when he was so spiteful towards her in the beginning of the book.You will love this book and the characters."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"I &quot;enjoyed meeting&quot; all the characters, they were very real, interesting and most of them were quite likable! I don't believe Esmeralda will ever allow her life to become boring. She may be a widow living alone but she does not allow herself to become &quot;self-absorbed.&quot; I am hoping for a sequel or maybe even a series. I didn't really want to put the book down until I finished it. The author gives you a sense that &quot;something is going to happen&quot; but I was still surprised at what transpired in this quaint little southern town. A great book!"},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"I have read and reread this entertaining novel about a country church and the friendship of two women. Think Jan Karon without so many characters to remember. Esmerelda, the main character, shares her wisdom, quoting \\"Splurgeon\\" [Spurgeon] and eager to help others. She and Beatrice are members of the Willing Workers Sunday school class. Then Beatrice moves away to find employment and their friendship continues with letters and phone calls. There are many other delightful characters and the plot is full of surprises. The story is touching, real and fun. This is the first in a series of three novels about Esmerelda. Each one is delightful. I own all three and have loaned them to a number of friends."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"Ms. Graham writes a simple, easy to read tale. Her main character is someone you may know (even though she's fictitious!) The book is what I call \\"Bread & Butter\\" reading: it has all the elements of a good story. leaving you contented & full even though it isn't fancy. The characters are real, with endearing personalities and faults of their own. The town is small, making us long for such a place to call home. There is faith, love, eating and fellowship in the book which confronts ugly subjects the way Christians should confront them. This book ( and her others) is moving, funny and satisfying. You will want to read them all. And you'll wish you lived next door to Ms. Esmeralda!"},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"I nearly finished this book in one sitting. It was the first Christian fiction book I'd picked up in years. I had a few start and stops over the years, as this book was sitting on my shelf for quite some time. \\"Mercy Me\\" takes off like a slow train, but as I would eventually discover, it doesn't stay there. It will draw you in and pick up pace as you continue to read. I wonder now why it sat on my shelf so long.Where other Christian fiction books may gloss over, candy-coat, or makes light of real issues in the Church (and its individuals), this book holds no punches. It is honest, enlightening, and embraces a seasoned wisdom that is rare on the shelves these days.If you're looking for something fun and light but with more depth and maturity than is common, this is your book. I plan to read every book by this author now - and buy a few for my friends as well."},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"The title \\"Mercy Me\\" caught my eye in the library one day because I have a cat by that name! (and because of the Christian group) It was a wonderful, relaxing but inspiring read that I took on vacation. Then I wound up buying a copy for my Mom, because the character in it reminded me of her. She's a hard-working, ordinary older woman who is a widow. But she's always praying for people, and helping them when she can. She winds up learning some very up-to-date lessons from the people who come into her life. Mom passed away this fall, so now I have the book back! I think I'll loan it to my daughter-in-law. Great book!"},{"Title":"Mercy Me","review":"The main character, Esmeralda, is a lady I would like to know. She doesn't have much \\"book learning\\" but she does have a whole lot of giving heart, her well thumbed copy of the Bible and a book by the famous Christian writer she often quotes. She mistakenly calls him Splurgeon which is funny, and Esmeralda uses words incorrectly to funny effect. She notes that her friend is almost \\"historical\\" with worry and grief. I enjoy these turns of phrase and how Esmeralda meets each needy person with the best Christian response of \\"how can I help you?\\". She takes someone with AIDS into her home without a backward glance and works to arrange for an adoption and lots more that I won't share here, so the book will be fresh for you. The mule on the cover has a role to play too.

The \\"facts\\"have been poorly researched and the story itself is a hodge-podge of lies,half-truths and daydreams that were related to the rather naive author by the subject of the book.I'm also a prisoner on Texas' Death Row and I knew Leslie Gosch for almost ten years before he was executed. His \\"life\\",his profound ideas and mystical insights,were his, only for the length of time it took him to transcribe them from whichever book he was reading to the letter he was writing - whether it was his \\"expertise\\" on flute-making and his knowledge of music,or his account of watching for hours while a sunflower blossomed when he was barely out of diapers. His \\"life\\",as told by Joy Elder,never happened.However,as a glimpse into the twisted mind of a little man who dreamed impossible dreams of being respected and looked up to as a wise and humble,generous and compassionate human being,it is interesting and maybe even worth a reading. You should keep a box of salt close to hand, though."},{"Title":"Lethal Justice: One Man's Journey of Hope on Death Row","review":"This is a moving book. It makes a strong case against the death penalty and will force you to carefully evaluate your own stance on the issue. After an executed man was found innocent, a group came together in Britain to begin corresponding with death row inmates. Joy saw the television show about this innocent man and joined Human Writes. She began corresponding with Lesly Gosch.This book uses the author's words and excerpts of correspondence from Lesly to tell the story of life on death row and one man's journey to self-acceptance before execution.Although it does drag a bit at times, always in Lesley's correspondence, overall it is an interesting book. It is powerfully moving and the author does an exceptional job of presenting her position convincingly."},{"Title":"Lethal Justice: One Man's Journey of Hope on Death Row","review":"I read the review by the jealous, disgruntled current Texas Death Row inmate. There are no computers on death row. I question the lacky and co-conspirator working on his behalf. I knew Leslie Gosch while I was an innocent member of death row. Though I cannot speak of his innocence or guilt, what I can say is that Leslie never bothered anyone. I cannot fathom what he did to evoke such hatred and jealously from one of his peers. This is a good book into the horrors of the worst death row in America. Ignore the vindictive ramblings of this death row inmate who needs to remove the mote from his own eye before castigating another. Great job, Ms. Elder."},{"Title":"Lethal Justice: One Man's Journey of Hope on Death Row","review":"If you need convincing that the death penalty is a bad idea and you don't care for the academic or philosophical approach, then get this book today. If you want to read a sensitive narrative written to portray what we should already know, then get this book. It's a light read in one sense, full of personal impressions, lovingly crafted to move you. Could be sub-subtitled: One Woman's Journey of Emotion to the Death Row Visitor Box.Describing the prison town in Texas as \\"America's killing capital\\" puts the whole book in a slippery context. If I weren't from the area I might appreciate it as gruesome gringo modern emo western. But what about America's medical-malpractice capital, armed-murder capital or fetus-killing capital? Not in Texas.

The aforementioned children's books provoked my interest, leading me to seek further information on this remarkable family. This book, aimed at the adult level, depicts in acute detail Dr. Lillian Gilbreth's family history, childhood, education, and motion study work. Exciting recolletions of work and travel fill this volume, which is entrancing form cover to cover. The style in which this book was written provokes thoughts of listening to a warm elderly woman, carefully sharing how a shy child became a &quot;pioneer&quot; in women's work, and a marvel in her day. There are numerous typographical and grammatical errors in the text, which are pardonable if the reader considers that these are the actual written words of Dr. Lillian Gilbreth, apparently unedited. The only other disappointment is that this manuscript was unpublished for so many decades that it has not been updated. It does not elaborate on her lasting contributions to industrial engineering today, nor does it reveal which of her children are still surviving. However, there are many useful addresses and contacts mentioned that would provide some update on the issues of industrial engineering. I would recommed this book to anyone interested in the life and work of Lillian Gilbreth or her field, as she should be an inspirational role model for all young women."},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","review":"This book is a really great read if you want to get a feel for Lillian Gilbreth's personality (which is a hurmorous, optimistic personality)or if you want to learn about her family life. But if you're writing a term paper, like I am, and trying just to get facts about her life and not cute stories about the children getting their tonsils out, then this is not the book for you. This is an interesting book, and I would recommend it, just not for the facts it gives you."},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","review":"I have not read this book, but the editorial review on Amazon's page needs updating. First of all, it is not Lillian who wrote Cheaper by the Dozen, but two of her children: Ernestine and Frank. Secondly, there does indeed exist a full biography of Lillian Gilbreth titled \\"Making Time: Lillian Moller Gilbreth - A life beyond Cheaper by the Dozen\\" by Jane Lancaster. It is readily available on Amazon, and provides an extremely detailed account of her personal life, though perhaps not much insight into the anecdotes found in Cheaper by the Dozen."},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","review":"As a city of Oakland resident, interested in 19th century life there, I was very happy to come across this book and read Mrs Gilbreth's childhood memories, visiting Lake Merritt, spending time with cousins, visiting her well to do grandfather at his grand estate (he is known as Oakland's first millionaire). I intend to share it with others I know who share an interest in Oakland's early history."},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","review":"While I agree with Ms. Collins' assessment of this book, and realize it is Mrs. Gilbreth's unedited writings, I found the book to be only a rather dry collection of memories. I guess I hoped to find another \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" or \\"Belles on Their Toes\\" for entertainment, which is a rather unfair expectation. Mrs. Gilbreth does not write to entertain. Her writing style is completely unadorned by either humor or color; she states facts alone (Frank and Ernestine must have inherited their father's humor).What did irritate me is her attitude toward her daughter, Mary. Perhaps not well-known, this attitude was mentioned in \\"Time Out For Happiness.\\" The Gilbreths buried their understandably overwhelming grief for Mary and never spoke of her again. This book confirms that fact. Nowhere is Mary mentioned after her death. Mrs. Gilbreth spoke of Mary as part of her husband's 'project' and not a living, breathing child, whose brief life should have been celebrated, not mourned. She says the services of a psychiatrist would have 'adjusted' the situation, 'but it was not adjusted, and it left a permanent scar.' As much money as they apparently had, why they did not seek psychiatric help in the aftermath is beyond me. I was overjoyed to see a picture of Mary; in fact, the pictures throughout the book are fascinating. Mrs. Gilbreth was a wonderful woman, who contributed greatly to humanity, and should be so honored. But she wasn't a writer."},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","review":"\\"As I Remember\\" is the autobiography of Lillian Gilbreth, the author and management consultant. She was the wife of Frank Gilbreth who was one of the important figures in the scientific management movement. The biography is interesting, but not impressive. The writing style was just boring.The autobiography doesn't have any major chapters or parts, instead its one long text. Interestingly enough, even though it is an autobiography, its written mainly from third person perspective. This makes it feel very impersonal. Also, the biography is like a summary of their personal journal. It just observes what has happened at a certain moment, not relating it to each other and not relating it to a certain message or life-insights. All of these make the autobiography a little bit boring to read.All in all, if you are interested in the life of the Gilbreths, this book might be worth reading. If you are looking for life-insights, a good autobiography or even historical facts on scientific management then you won't find these in this book. From that perspective, I wouldn't recommend this book. I'll rate it 3 stars... 2 for the average reader, 4 for people researching the Gilbreths life."},{"Title":"The Britannica encyclopedia of American art","review":"This is an older book with detailed descriptions and information about a lot of art.

He is my great uncle or something like that, so i wanted to find out more about him. There are many fascinating stories of espionage, and Johnson weaves the story that ends in the defeat of Hitler. Suprisingly this book keeps your attention, even for an eighteen year old. All in all I am very pleased with this book, and i recommend this book for anybody that is interested in WWII."},{"Title":"Righteous Deception: German Officers Against Hitler","review":"Issac Newton's third law states: For every action, there is an equal, but opposite reaction. This is the hidden theme within David Johnson's _Righteous Deception_. Johnson's \\"action\\" is the Allies' D-Day deception plan FORTITUDE and its tributary plan QUICKSILVER, the counter-intelligence effort to convince the Germans of the existence of the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSTAG), and that the real invasion would be aimed at the Pas de Calais. The German \\"reaction\\" centers around the activities of two key individuals: Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Hitler's Chief of German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) and Colonel Alexis von Roenne, Chief of Fremde Heere West (FHW). Johnson provides a readable account of the better known machinations of Canaris; his counter-espionage activities providing vital intelligence to the British and his key role in the General's conspiracy to assassinate Hitler, Swarze Kapelle (Black Orchestra). It was when Canaris swayed the brilliant intelligence officer von Roenne to join the ranks of the conspirator's network, argues Johnson, that a critical partnership developed between the two men.Johnson places quite a bit of emphasis upon the role of von Roenne. Other authors (Fargo, _The Game of the Foxes_, and Cave Brown, _Bodyguard of Lies_) have documented von Roenne's official duties at FHW. Their consensus, however, is that Roenne was hoodwinked by the FORTITUDE deception, credited only with purposely inflating the Allied order of battle in order to get Hitler to reinforce the Normandy area. Johnson presents an opposing thesis. Johnson argues that Roenne was well aware that the FORTITUDE/QUICKSILVER deception to invade the Pas de Calais was bogus, but instead, led Hitler on to its validity in order that the Fuhrer keep the German 15th Army right where it was not needed for as long as possible. Johnson states that Canaris and Roenne were the flip-side of the FORTITUDE/QUICKSILVER coin. Johnson concludes had it not been for the duel-role of these two men, Canaris feeding valuable informaton to the Allies, and Roenne feeding Hitler false intelligence, Operation FORTITUDE, the D-Day landings and subsequent Normandy campaign would most likely have ended in failure.This book is timely, given the criticism levelled at America's current military intelligence community. Johnson places a feather in the cap of Allied deception during Word War II, however, he also creates a strange dichotomy in the process. One the one hand, Johnson shows how the Allies were successful in pulling off the deception and eventual victory in Normandy. On the other hand, he has Canaris and Roenne portrayed as willing accomplices whispering under their cloak and dagger: \\"You did not win on your own, we let you win.\\" Whether or not one agrees with Johnson's conclusions, this book is an easy read and the author maintains his argument solidly throughout. For those wishing to delve deeper into his sources, however, Johnson does not make it easy. He relies primarily on secondary sources, biographies and memoirs of all the key players on both sides. He lists documentary evidence housed both here at the Eisenhower Library and the Bundesarchiv-Militararchiv in Germany. Unfortunately he does not cite these sources specifically in the text. Fans of World War II counter-espionage and intelligence may want to add this book to their collection for its different take and readability."},{"Title":"Righteous Deception: German Officers Against Hitler","review":"Accomplished Germans in positions of power recognized Hitler as a murderous dictator who needed to be stopped, and gave their lives in order to make it happen. This story needs to be told, and Johnson tells it well, suspensefully, thoughtfully, and in rich detail. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the German intelligence service (the Abwehr), Colonel Alexis von Renne, head of the German military intelligence service (western theatre), Canaris' assistant Hans von Oster, high-ranking officers Rommel and Claus von Stauffenberg, Lutheran Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer and other members of the &#34;Schwarze Kapelle&#34; underground made the ultimate sacrifice and change the course of history.Many American lives, including quite likely that of my father, a WWII vet who arrived at Normandy a few days after D-day, were saved as a result. This book illuminates an important narrative, a vital and noble chapter of history that is not sufficiently known to wider audiences. Reading this book was therefore not only an exciting read, but an act of homage to individuals acting with moral courage in a mad, perilous time."},{"Title":"Righteous Deception: German Officers Against Hitler","review":"The title is a little bit of a misnomer. One gets the idea you will be reading a story of conspiracy against the German dictator by German army officers. What one gets is the story of German army officers misleading Hitler and letting the Allies win at the Normandy invasion. Even this is not really proved. The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves. An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America. Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy. Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement. There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof. This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion.This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened. Not a difficult book, but the reader must understand that what is written is not always true."},{"Title":"Practical Atlas of Pseudomalignancy: Benign Lesions Mimicking Malignancy (Hodder Arnold Publication)","review":"The book is one-of-a-kind. It has collected the experiences from innumerable mistakes, near-misses and pitfalls in one of the important branches in diagnostic medicine in one tasteful book.It is easy to find your way around in. The book is well indexed. The clues to alternative diagnoses are displayed logically, but it takes you some time and thought to really appreciate what the differences are, the reasons for which is obvious: otherwise the entities would not appear in this book!I think the included look-alikes entities are well chosen. The practitioner will meet the problems often, in my experience at least monthly. Probably we do it even more often, without realising that we should have given more thought to the alternatives. Therefore it will pay to go through the book when you buy it, which you should, to be aware of what sore experiences colleagues before us have made.SO why not five stars?The quality is a bit variable between chapters, although none are poor, though! On one occasion identical pictures have been used to illustrate two different conditions. The organisation of the entities within the individual chapters is not always quite &quot;logical&quot;. On the other hand - is that possible? Probably not. The intention of the book is above all to warn us against the most common howlers with serious consequences in diagnostic pathology, and help us out. An organ system approach alone might be enough.So I may go to four stars and a moon!When you have got it, you will not wish to be without it again. The book deserves to be read to pieces.And hopefully Drs Al-Sam and Lakhani will repeat their &quot;Course on Pseudomalignancies&quot; again soon. If you are lucky, register early that is, you will get it for free!!!!!!!!!!But don't bet on that - there are many smart pathologists around that will nick your copy.Have a good time with this book and become a better and more reflective pathologist."},{"Title":"Come Over, Come Over","review":"I picked up this book on a whim &amp; I'm glad I did--it only took reading one or two of the (cartoon) frames for me to buy it.

Barry's observations may be couched in terms of her odd protagonists, Marlys and Maybonne, but they are no less telling, cutting, emotive or perceptive for that. Never have I come across an evocation of adolescence which comes close to her achievement here. She manages to touch on love, death, commitment, family, joy (and even, very lightly, incest), and have fresh things to say about each. The scenes involving school and the love-rivalry between the sisters is unique in cartooning, and perhaps in the wider realm of illustrated literature."},{"Title":"Come Over, Come Over","review":"Condition was better than advertised!

It is somewhat astonishing that a sixty-something year old man has managed to abide at such a stage of arrested development.

The subsequent book is a thinly connected hodge-podge, that might have made for several interesting magazine articles. Surely, this manuscript was not fit editorially for publication as a full book on its own merits. I concur with other reviewers who note the endless self-indulgence and juvenile tone. Let's not pretend that this book has anything to do with Zen, Buddhism or self-discovery."},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","review":"If you want to read a disjointed account of random journeys this is your book.If you want your writer to be an old man who writes, thinks and acts like a 15 year old child (and not a child in the 'zen' sense) who's just seen Porky's, this is your book.If you want a book that sounds as though it's written by a recovering alcoholic and sex addict who hasn't quite gotten the 'recovery' part and has somehow returned to middle-school humor (the bad kind, not the childlike wonder kind) and innuendo..This is your book.I don't know if the author is suffering from some kind of brain disorder or suffered a series of strokes since his first book, but this one is truly awful.Get it at the library, but get ready to set it down out of disgust and disappointment.

Then he's like Forrest Gump and that other guy riding out that storm in the middle of the Caribbean. Surviving that, he goes to Paris where we endure his wound-licking and self-indulgent whining. And somehow towards the middle of the book, he makes it back to Mongolia, on a vaguely defined quest to find . . . what?It is clear that George is adrift without his monk-friend Tsang Tsai from the first book. This narrative may very well be written for fellow mid-lifers who are in either pre- or post- crisis modes: tough to say.Anyway, like \\"Journey to Ixtlan\\", this roller coaster (or perhaps a bronco ride) of a narrative is a metaphor for what is found in the search and the journey; the destination may yet be only a mirage.As a writer, George Crane is still working out his Mojo - like a burner on the stove, one gets the feeling that he's just turned down the heat.Although the leaping around in this book is formidible, if you perservere with the guy to the end, it is a pretty decent book.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","review":"It's not really until the last few pages of George Crane's Beyond the House of the False Lama that one begins to realize just what he has accomplished with this latest effort. And that the extraordinary regret that the book was nearly over would give way to the joy of reading it again and again. For Crane does not just journey to the Caribbean, Paris, Mongolia--(and particularly to the mountain range where legend says the wind is born)--but also to those intricate, exotic locales of the heart where love and poetry are birthed out of the pressure of guilt and the panic of life just beyond one's fingertips.Where other authors gun their literary engines to race through the plot, dragging the reader by either the ear or collar to a predictable ending, Crane not only lingers to smell the emotional flowers but he bids us bend down and examine the very ground and dig a bit into the roots. And what roots! His eye for detail and the connection between soil and art, caresses and relationship, is both unerring and instructive, especially when it comes to describing a chance encounters.Crane writes the way great photographers capture light, with a deft attention to detail and the meticulous framing of each moment, with a piece of the action traveling off the page, allowing the mind to follow, fill-in what is left unsaid, undescribed. The physical sensations and his emotional emanations reverberate throughout the book via his purling, susurrating prose that both delights the mind and invokes presence and participation. Just as in Bones of the Master, this new effort is the tale of a failed journey, and as such, it makes the book that much more accessible, that much more successful. For, like Crane, we are ultimately all False Lamas seeking our own inner truth."},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","review":"While George Crane's first book \\"The Bones of the Master\\" was centered on his unique, funny and instructive relationship with the Mongolian expatriate monk Tsung Tsai, and for this reason assumed the shape of a disciple and master or to better put it a \\"buddy\\" book, this second work does not have a leading guide because we only briefly encounter Tsung Tsai at the beginning of the book. However, \\"Georgie\\" is always in search of buddies and so, leaving his routinary life in which things are not going so well, continues his encounters with rouges and border-line personalities. He travels to Key Largo, Paris and fatefully ends up in Mongolia, where fascinated by a name, that is actually a remote locality on the Winding Road (remember Owen Lattimore's The Desert Road to Turkistan), the House of the False Lama, he puts his heart in peace for what we know wont be long. I think he is now writing his third novel somewhere in Greece.This book is a delightful read but it deserves a cultural background to be fully appreciated and is written for middle age men and women. Only some points to reflect on: the Author's knowledge of Zen helps to put happenings and feelings in an ironic and off-hand perspective and many of his themes are very Zen indeed. The trip that is more important than the destination is one of the many subjects he dwells upon. The Zen culture is evident also in his poetry and style, that is choppy and lyrical at the same time. For those that remember Kant's \\"sublime\\", it is evident that Crane's deepest feelings and strongest emotions are awakened during a tempest or in the majestic scenario of the Gobi Desert and in these cases his poetic prose really reaches its best results. But indipendently of these peaks, the underlying thematic is his ageing and humanity in the sense of his unquenchable desire for women and love and the confort he gains from alcohol and smoke and drugs(?), like all people in this world. Naturally he is overindulgent with himself but in such a captivating way that we really feel he is a friend.I saw the previous reviewer focused his title on the False Lame, who is the False lama? Tsung Tsai that hasn't given the appropriate answers? The Author, that has no superior knowledge to convey? All the myths we live by? Or is just that place in that peculiar moment?A book to enjoy, to savour and appreciate with all our senses. Looking forward to number three !"},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","review":"I see that some reviewers were not impressed with Crane's eagerly anticipated sequel. I must confess that I was! For one thing, the absence of Tsung-Tsai is not as glaring as some have suggested. His spirit is still very much with Crane; it's simply that Crane has, in some sense, moved on from being a disciple to becoming his own man. I, for one, think the title reflects this. Secondly, the prose in the sequel is far superior to that of the original. Is Crane self-indulgent? Of course! But that's the point! Crane, like a true Zen master, is detached from his own behaviour, and views it with an ironic sort of amusement. Above all, Crane's novel serves as an indictment of the holier-than-thou Buddhists and other saints who are incapable of simply appreciating life for what it is. And for that, we ought to be grateful."},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","review":"George Crane spends a lot of time whining about the person he is not, rather than examining the person he is. Some interesting story telling, but the self-involvement frequently gets in the way."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I went to see Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World mainly because I liked Russell Crowe in his Gladiator role and Napoleonic naval warfare is the subject I find interesting.Be warned, these books are not simple reads or written in a way most would be familiar with. What makes them so great also makes them difficult and can turn a lot of people off of them. O'Brian uses language from the day not only among the characters, but in his narration as well. This creates, I my opinion, absolute immersion because one is forced to always read the language used in that period.Another difficulty is the strongly pervasive use of naval jargon. Many people, myself included, have begun reading the series and turned towards the rear for a glossary of the terms O'Brian uses throughout his books. You can turn and look, but you will not find one. The only clue you will get is a small picture of a ship at the beginning of every book that lists which sails are which. That's it, a small picture as a guide and you are immediately transported to the beginning of the nineteenth century.My advice is that if you like to read, you need to check these books out. You will not understand a lot of what you read for a while but it only gets easier as you go. By comparison, Milton's Paradise Lost or Dante's Inferno are much harder to get accustomed to than this series. Interestingly enough, as time passes you will begin to comprehend almost as a foreign speaker begins to understand a language when surrounded by it for long enough. On my second time through, I am reading it with a fluency achieved by many months of nightly readings in the recent past.More than anything else, these books are about a friendship. The complex and sometimes strained relationship between the two primary characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, serve as the foundation upon which all other plot points are laid. Maturin, the small, well educated, scientific and rather unattractive physician is as perfect a foil as I have encountered in literature. His presence amplifies Jack's clear role as the tall, blond, strong and dumb-except-in-naval-matters hero. Although polar opposites in many ways, their one similarity (love of music) binds them together in the unlikeliest of friendships.As I have lengthily stated, this series is driven by the characters and specifically by the two main ones Jack and Stephen. By series end, one almost feels like they are a part of this relationship. You can almost feel the heave of the ship beneath your feet as you sit in Jack's cabin strumming along on the latest Bocherini piece with he and Stephen. It is this intimacy and immersion that makes these books so great. Every turn of events is meaningful because it feels not as if it is befalling a mere character in a novel, but rather, one of your closest friends. Any who are curious should certainly give these books a try. You'll find yourself totally immersed in no time, or black's the white of my eye."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Until the very last couple of pages in this twentieth and last volume of the Aubrey-Maturin saga, I was unsure of the implications of the book's title. But I was pleased to find that Jack's &quot;flag-sickness&quot; has been appeased. With the Napoleonic wars ended, the captain of the SURPRISE has had to go to revolutionary Chile to find ways of continuing to build his reputation, this time in the development of the infant republic's navy. There is a fine ship-to-ship action against a much larger Spanish vessel, and all the usual trials and tribulations of beating around the Horn. Moreover, the recently widowed Dr. Maturin has a much larger part this time even than usual, in his slightly odd pursuit of Christine Wood, widow of the governor of Sierra Leone and a noted naturalist in her own right. A mid-life crisis? We don't know how all that will turn out, unfortunately. It's sad that there will be no more installments to the story, but this is a reasonably satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Appreciation of novels -- like music, movies, and just about every thing else -- is ultimately a subjective experience. I have loved the Jack Aubrey-Stephen Maturin novels for many years, reading (and re-reading) each new entry in the series with interest. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; may possibly be the last novel in the series, if what Patrick O'Brian said a few years ago is true. I hope that is not the case but if it is, then &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; would serve well enough as the end. I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but I will say that it advances the stories of the two central characters to new levels. I don't claim that &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; is the finest book in the series, but I found it solidly satisfying, with a good number of the typical small scenes of delight which characterize the O'Brian novels. If there is little music in this book compared to previous novels in the series, there is compensation to be found in the revival of Stephen Maturin's spirits after the sorrowful events of &quot;The Hundred Days.&quot; A new character of considerable charm and appeal makes an appearance amidst the expected familiar faces. I don't know whether I would recommend &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to someone not familiar with the Aubrey-Maturin books (those people I tell to start at the beginning with &quot;Master and Commander&quot;), but I do think that any fan of the series -- even those disappointed with the gloomy atmosphere &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; -- will enjoy this new book."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I deeply loved what is now the last book in the series.

The scene in the desert listening to lions was O'Brian's voice, pure and sweet. The rest was cloudy. I advised friends -don't waste your money.Blue at the Mizzen (an Adm of the Blue broad flag flying at the mizzen - a squadron commander -as opposed to a &quot;Yellow Adm &quot; a passed over reject) is a saga worth buying. The sweet digressions are closely edited and battle scenes longer - this book sounds more like Alexander Kent than O'Brian.From the wretched Hundred Days, a glow remains in the hearth. At his worst - and this certainly isn't - O'Brian is miles ahead of the competition.The grief over a lost friend and (a little bit) a wife gets a mention here - response to the astonished reaction to the blaise reaction in the previous book?I hope this is the last, before the embers die out completely. This is still O'Brian - not at his best - but still in the game.The jacket cover picture is the best of the series"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"The final installment in O'Brian's smashing 20-volume nautical series has an unfinished feel. In the final pages we finally learn about Jack's career move --though the answer is given away by the book's title-- and this is something he has fretted over for several books now. But many other plot threads remain hanging, most notably that of Stephen's marital status. The previous book involved the sudden, unexpected and unmourned deaths of several key characters, and this one leaves a dozen or two other secondary characters wholly unfinished. It feels as though the elderly O'Brian had meant to write another book or two to bring Aubrey and Maturin back to England for the final denouement, but perhaps his energy failed him.In any case, this is another excellent story. With Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, the \\"Surprise\\" must refit after suffering damage in a collision before making her way on her long-delayed voyage to Chile. The action and intrigue in Portugal and Chile are wonderful. As always, Stephen Maturin's wry humor, brought out by the author's sublime prose, leaves the reader smiling. Another wonderful story, but it just doesn't feel like it was meant to be the last one."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"&quot;After a last salute Jack glanced aloft--still the sweet west wind--and then looked fore and aft: a fine clear deck, hands all at their stations and all beaming with pleasure, and turning to the master he said, 'Mr Hanson, pray lay me a course for Cape Pilar and Magellan's Strait.&quot;Farewell, dear Jack, dear Stephen, and dear Patrick.

Picking up where The 100 Days left off, the pair cross the ocean, engage in middle-aged derring-do, and save the day for the twentieth time, with a spot of unexpected romance thrown in. As always the historical references are accurate; the minor failures of plot in this latest episode are easily overlooked. After all, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are men like no others in modern fiction; they fight, love, drink, indulge in excesses, mourn, spy, and get away with the loot better than anyone. They're a pair of upright Harry Flashmans, ready to rescue the damsel, make off with the gold, and free the oppressed colonials from their decadent rulers. Hornblower never had it this good."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"_Blue at the Mizzen_ is a bit of a departure from the style of many of the other Aubrey-Maturin books, in that much of it is written in Maturin's hand via letters to England. (The reasoning behind this to be explained below.) This works, giving a detail and depth to a character whose rich inner-life has largely been absent, his role as intelligence officer, physician, scientist and erstwhile companion and confidant to Aubrey overshadowing his personal proclivities.The Napoloeonic Wars endedThe Hundred Days (Vol. Book 19) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels)Aubrey, like many RN post-captains, faces the liklihood of becoming a \\"yellow admiral\\" - a promotion to flag-officer rank without a ship or squadron to command, effectively ending one's naval career. To forestall this, Maturin and Aubrey take _Suprise_ to Chile, ostensibly on a hydrographical voyage, in reality to help Chile win its independence from Spain. En route, O'Brian tantalizes readers with two new developments: a new midshipman, Horatio Hanson (the bastard of the Duke of Clarence, Prince William) and a budding romance between Lady Jenny Morris (the widow of Lord Morris, ambassador in Sierra Leone) and Maturin (himself a widower). It is frustrating that these plot points will not be more fully developed.The voyage south moves at a fast clip, and the narration of _Suprise_ on station is also brief, most of the story focusing on Maturin and Hanson - some readers will be disappointed by this, I found it a refreshing departure from the detailed \\"watch on watch\\" description of daily life at sea, and allowed me to get a better sense of Maturin as an emotional being. The single naval engagement Aubrey is involved in is also summative, and which I wish more detail was given; however, it wasn't so much a disappointment to deduct a star in my rating.Finishing _Blue at the Mizzen_ is somewhat bitter-sweet, it being the last complete novel in the series. I look forward to21: The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey (Vol. Book 21) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels), but I sense it will be ultimately unsatisfying, the mannuscript unfinished. That I won't see how things will develop between Lady Morris and Maturin and what will happen with young Hanson is similarly disappointing. However, every voyage must end, shipmates going their separate ways, the sea-stories to be regaled and revisited at some later date - and so it is with Aubrey and Maturin. As I've written on most reviews of the series, I highly recommend the books: no one writes nautical fiction like O'Brian, and very few write any sub-genre of fiction like him. Having faced foul weather, stood on the quarter-deck and in the gun-room in countless engagements, and crossed the line several times, I feel a closeness to the characters O'Brian so vividly created. Its been a wonderful, wholly enjoyable experience and one that I encourage any lover of good writing to find for themselves why there is such a passionate and loyal following to these books."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Patrick O'Brians Royal Navy is alive and well in Blue At The Mizzen.I read it as a preface to his final partial novel.

I'd read the reviews about wonderful characterization and historical accuracy, and expected a treat. Not so. Although I had read Master and Commander years ago, this was my first O'Brian in recent memory. I did not find his characters especially detailed, nor the narrative very well done. It was a good adventure story, but much of the time I was lost as to why such and such a thing was done, or who this or that person was. I'm sure having read the books in order would help greatly, and I imagine some day I will do that. At the moment, though, this book doesn't come close to Forrester for characterization, detail, and true nautical enjoyment. There is too much skipping of key points, few sensible transitions, and a giant question left unanswered at the end of the book.

This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions.

Although I enjoyed it , I wasn't really able to get into the story line very well , since the author had the habit of making clever asides referring to actions in previous novels. Now 3 years later I find that I have read 16 in the series. They must be addictive!In this novel , which is set shortly after the triumph of the allies over Napoleon at Waterloo , Jack Aubrey and his particular friend , Stephen Maturin find themselves on the way to Chile under secret orders to assist the Republican rebels in their efforts to break away from Spanish rule , locally enforced by the Viceroy of Peru. The dear old \\"Surprise\\" has been converted to a hydrographical survey vessel to provide thinly veiled cover to the mission.As a cast of characters , we are sadly missing Barrett Bonden , but have a new young face in the person of Horatio Hanson , the bastard son of the Duke of Clarence (heir to the British throne). We are given a brief glimpse of Bernardo O'Higgins , commonly accepted as the liberator of Chile.Upon arrival in Chile , Jack Aubrey sets about building and training the nucleus of a new and independent Chilean navy , a daunting task. The action line is centered about the intervention of the Spanish Viceroy of Peru , and the Peruvian navy's 50 gun ship. Aubrey boldly devises a plan to neutralize the Peruvians , and basically succeeds in his mission.In the line of personal involvements , Aubrey seems very morose and rather out of his usual sorts throughout the tale. Later , this is identified as \\"flag sickness\\" , or worry about being \\"yellowed\\". On the other hand , Maturin seeks the hand of the lovely Africa based naturalist Christine Wood. And in this vein , the novel leaves the reader hanging as to the outcome.The unfinished 21st novel is due for publication later this year ; I am hopeful that we are able to at least see where the outcome of this fine series was intended. As a final sidebar--I suggest that the reader also consider reading \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" by Bernard Cornwell as a parallel to this book.Even tho' this was not my favorite book in the series (Desolation Island or Treason's Harbor are the best) , I liked it well enough to rate it 4 stars.

There was speculation when the book was published that it might make the end of this most remarkable series because of O'Brian's failing health. However, the author was apparently well into his next novel when he passed away.In hindsight it is certainly remarkable that \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" will be the final book in the series. The series does indeed a high water mark of a sort and I must express my wish that O'Brian had picked a different title in regards to that particular point. The novel begins with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, which is also significant, for Jack Aubrey is very much a creature of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Although Aubrey and his particular friend Stephen Maturin had never been in the forefront of the war effort, it was against that larger backdrop that O'Brian set his novels. Whatever adventures lay ahead, they would most surely have been of a different cut of cloth. Consequently, while I will miss the novels that would have been followed this one, I am satisfied that there is a completeness to the epic.To underscore this idea I ask you to read the final chapter of this novel and to recognize the inherent rightness in the final words of Jack Aubrey upon the printed page.Final Note: While I give this particular novel 4 Stars the entire series.

Nor can we expect to read the like of O'Brian again, as his generation will be the last to possess the combination of erudition, intellectual curiousity and a psychic link to the past that formed the life of his novels.Read O'Brian as an antidote to the values of the present. Read O'Brian to realize that there was a time in the recent past when, for many people, friendship, honor, love, learning, loyalty and courage were present in everyday life, and when expediency was not always the best policy.Read O'Brian for what is surely one of the greatest sustained efforts in literature, for 20 volumes that together form a novel that in style, lanuage and subject matter, could have been published contemporaneously with Dickens - and is yet timeless."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"The end of a great book always produces a letdown for me so it was a double whammy to realize as I turned the last page of Blue at the Mizzen that it was book-match-series. Reflecting back on the 20 Aubrey-Maturin books that I had read and the timeless quality of the characters, plots and historical background that brought these books to life only deepened my depression. And when I considered the tracks that O'Brian artfully laid down in this book to carry him into yet additional Aubrey-Maturin books--I decided that I needed a brandy. Patrick O'Brian is undoubtedly one of the few true masters of historical fiction and a polymath with incredible literary talent."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Lord, save the tired sailors/ Their fingers numb with cold;/ And save their lonely families,/ Lord, save the foreign gold./ Lord, save our noble mission,/ For which the sea we ride,/ And save Patrick O'Brian/ Who has sailed the ebbing tide."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Like many O'Brian devotees, I've been unable to wholly reconcile myself to the last four books or so. At some point, to say it succinctly, O'Brian began working by rote, or anyway that's how things felt to me.I finished reading this final book two days before the author's death. Even before the news broke, though, I had come to accept this as the last in the series.This book isn't perfect. It sometimes panders to my reverie for the series at its height.It also, though, provides us with an incomplete, compromised, very human close to things. Maturin isn't happy, though he lives in expectation of happiness. Aubrey is older, and if he's wiser he's also not as bright a flame, so to speak, as he once was.O'Brian might have described a conversation between Cello and Violin, ending with a muttered irresolute harmony as the daylight through the stern windows faded to grey. It ended that way."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I suppose we have to see Maturin and Aubrey as representing two sides of O'Brian's own way of looking at the world - not his personality: I don't think writing leads to so crude a self-identification as that. If that's so, then it makes sense to me of the darker, less committed feeling of the last two books. The death of the author's wife after so many years of close and happy marriage is bound to have affected the way he looks at the world, and it would have been surprising if these last two books were not elegaiac and downcast, full of loss and a kind of depression. I find that thought comforting in an odd way. The books up to The Hundred Days were so nearly perfect, so engrossing, that I was taken aback by 100 Days, which seemed at first so much less persuasive. I've just finished 'Blue' and although not up to the strength of the earlier books - how could it be? - it seemed to have taken a deep breath and begun to look around again at how things are. I too thought it was supposed to be the last. If it is, then Patrick O'Brian has played his last sly trick on his readers. But it doesn't read like it. They're not real people; but an author has to have some sense of resolution in his or her head, or the act of creation remains incomplete. I hope there will be a final, calmer closing when O'Brian, too, returns to harbour"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"O'Brian can still weave his magic and #20 is one of his best in many years."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I've read the whole A/M series at least 3-4 times and just can't get enough of it.

Since all the PO'B books in the store are on cassette tape, I was thrilled to finally see one on CD and rented it immediately. I had already read this book and was keen to hear it read to me. Boy, was I unimpressed. The reader was dull, droll, awful. Aubrey sounded like a creep, and Maturin was worse.

The best yet. O'Brian has taken his voice to new heights (a statement I grieve to make, given how much I have enjoyed his voice so far), and it is truly beautiful.He began the last one as though it was the last in the series, and he has produced a book which is so elegant that it eclipses all the volumes which have gone before.Plot? Doesn't matter, though the accident at sea at the beginning has both drama and pathos.Characters? More developed than ever.

The main plot is excellant. Aubry and Maturin are indeed engaged in another worthy task envolving personal relationships, seamanship, politics and South American revolutions. The flow of the novel is great and it comes to a logical conclusion leaving us anticipating the obvious next novel where newly frocked Adm. Aubry hoists his flag and goes forth. Obryan is falling into the trench so many novelists fall into however as he assumes much knowledge on the part of his readers. He skips over many opportunities to develop many subplots and details that made his earlier novels such a delite to read and reread. Who can forget the exquisite revenge of Maturin in not only killing by dissecting his enemies; the dissertations of Maturing on women and other things. I'm not doing well at this and in thinking I'm doing the same thing as Obryan; describing the bones but the meat is thin. Charlie Cox"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Unless there is an unpublished manuscript hidden away somewhere, this is the last book written by Patrick O'Brian who recently passed away, and fittingly the last of the saga of Jack Aubrey. The Jack Aubrey character was based on Lord Cochrane (See \\"the Autobiography of a Seaman\\" by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000). While the early books in the Jack Aubrey series were quite good, the quality deteriorated in the later books (where he was no longer taking plot material from Cochrane's autobiography), and the author lost all sense of time, trying to cram too many novels into a three year period from 1812-1815. He then invented various assignments to keep Aubrey at sea, instead of going back (like C. S. Forester did with Hornblower) to fill in Aubrey's early career. I skipped many of the later books. The present tale would have been quite good by itself, but the author rambles and digresses excessively. He also seems to change location in the middle of sentences, and skips forward leaving the reader wondering what happened in the intervening time interval. The later part of the novel, when Aubrey arrives in Chile, gets back into historical context, and the novel seems to be set in 1819 and following years - Charles Tyng, in his autobiography \\"Before the Wind,\\" relates his experiences in Chile during that time period, mentioning Lord Cochran and the presence of a British frigate. Bernard Cornwell's novel, \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" (copyright 1992) also covers the action in Chile. The present novel is OK for those O'Brien fans who want the final episode on Jack Aubrey, but it is not exactly a book which holds your attention."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I have read,and bought all of the series. I was disappointed, when comparing with the others in the series. Much time is spent in describing minute details, but when it comes to action, such as the battle at the taking of the shore installation, it is all condensed into a few paragraphs. It is as if including the battle was an afterthought. Because it is a continuation of the series, it is worth reading, but is disappointing."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet \\"liberation\\" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say \\"The Far Side Of The World.\\"-- Auralgo"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Regretably Amazon only offers 5 stars. All of O'Brian's work hit 5 stars without breathing hard. Unfortunately this series is winding down, and it shows. Poor and careless editing, and careless ploting are beginning to show. If some of O'Brian's early works can reach 11 or 12 stars (on the Amazon scale) &quot;Blue&quot; only hits about 6 or 7.

Not only are the contrasting, yet inseparable, friends Jack and Stephen believable, appealing, vividly human characters, but they change realistically through time. To the reader, they appear as \\"real\\" people with \\"real\\" lives, perhaps more so than some of the the flesh and blood ephemera around us. The secondary characters, too, shine -- Killick is priceless.Research, of course, is O'Brian's other great strength. It's not only the ships, about which he seems to know everything. There's no aspect of the period -- food, dialect, religion, music -- in which he does not seem to be well versed. And he conveys this information to the reader in interesting ways, rather than encumbering the text with massive info-dumps.One often overlooked bright spot in this series is its humor. Too often historical fiction has a self-consciously grim quality. O'Brian can be grim -- crushingly depressing, in fact --but... \\"Swiving Monachorum\\".Action and battles are not, strangely, this series' strongest point. When we get them, they're great, but too often they are skipped over or told in a distant third-person viewpoint. But the worst here is still very good indeed.I would recommend reading all of these, in order, starting with the first one, right away, as soon as you possibly can. It's true that The Hundred Days marks a low point -- I agree with the reviewers who cite O'Brian's loss of his wife as the reason -- but Blue at the Mizzen, under which I've posted this review, marks a triumphant return of the author's powers."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"This final novel from Mr. O'Brian surpasses recent favorites of mine such as &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, and stands alone as my best-loved historical fiction novel. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; brings history to life as only the best novels of this fascinating genre can, the characters are vividly drawn and the setting and action are portrayed with striking authenticity. But it's the humanity and candor of those brilliant characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, that make these novels so superb. These novels will be read and admired a century from now, you owe it to yourself to read them all."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Thanks to the late Patrick O'Brian for wrapping up the series on an up note. I grew as a mariner with each book in this series from a landlubber to...maybe a ships boy. Patrick O'Brian brought this incredible era of honor, corruption and raw bravery to life for me with this historically accurate series. Now that I'm reading the memoirs of the Admiral that Jack Aubrey is based on, I'm finding that much of the action in these books really happened as Mr. O'Brian tells it."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework. His books are really informative.Forrerster follows the straight Tory ticket and O'Brian, does not.Of course the Hornblower series started in the thirties when England still had an empire.

It would have been nice to follow further adventures of his rise - alas it is not to be."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"This book is a fitting close to a masterful series. It is one of the most poignant of the series, written when O'Brian must have felt his powers waning, but only in the sense that like its predecessor it is slightly more hurried than the earlier books. And yet his powers of creative writing are still strong in this book; which evokes a strong sense of living at a time of change at the end of the long Napoleonic wars.Jack Aubrey, Captain Jack Aubrey, is a man fearful of being passed over for promotion to admiral now that the long Napoleonic wars are at last over, and however we may feel that his life would in any event be a full one, O'Brian makes us feel for him in the way that we would for a friend. Equally, Stephen Maturin, Jack's friend and companion over 20-odd novels, is on the cusp of change, pursuing in hope of marriage with changing hopes a young widow (delightfully drawn).Jack and Stephen are in the full flow of life, probably only in their late forties, when we leave them. O'Brian closes the series with affection.If you are fresh to Patrick O'Brian do not start with his book, but with Master and Commander."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"A few years ago, I happened to be traveling in Kazhakstan, and met up with a fellow westerner. We struck up a friendly conversation when I noticed he was reading an Aubrey-Maturin novel. \\"Oh yes, I love them.\\" he said, \\"But I've got only two more to go. And when I finish, I don't know what I'll do.\\" I knew exactly what he meant; at least back then we could look ahead to the indefatigable Patrick O'Brian's ongoing output.But now we're done for. I read \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" two weeks after the sad news of O'Brian's death. As I closed in on the ending, the lump in my throat had nothing to do with the resolution of the plot. And it wasn't really for the drying-up of this amazing flow of dialog and description. Like all great literature, the books will be there forever, to be re-read with pleasure and recommended to friends and family. No, it was for poor Jack and Stephen. Because by now I know well how long it takes to sail around the Horn and I could tell by the number of pages remaining that the tale would end-with the usual flurry of action-but that the two particular friends would still be standing out to sea, far from England. Like Capt. Cook, the great navigator the stories owe so much too, Aubrey and Maturin are triumphant and ever hopeful, but their bones can never rest at home.If you are a reader of the series, there is no question that you are going to read this book. The only worry is the details. Buy now, or wait for the paperback edition? I say, go for it. And be assured that O'Brian went out at the top of his form. \\"The Hundred Days\\" seemed hackneyed and tired, but \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" has all the dialog, the detail and intrigue, all the warmth of the best of the series. It isn't quite the masterpiece some of the earlier books were, but that's just because the characterizations are so familiar that it can't stand on its own. I definitely wouldn't recommend a reader new to the series begin here.It starts in the Mediterranean, returns to England by way of Madeira, and then sails for South America to do some urgent meddling in Chilean politics at the behest of Sir Joseph Banks. Along the way, we get familiar notes from Jack and Stephen and a set of bit characters, deftly drawn, and that glorious sense of being contained in a little world on the great ocean. Finally, we get to Chile and find things are quite muddled. It will take all of Maturin's cunning and all of Aubrey's dash to sort the matter out, which of course they do. But then it ends. And, if you're like me, you'll sit for awhile and think of all the times you've been transported by Jack and Stephen-and all the Surprises. You can go back, but you can't go on. It's a fine thing, but a sad thing."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"About five years ago I was introduced to the Aubrey/Maturin novels of Patrick O'Brian. I first read The Wine Dark Sea, and then I returned to the beginning of the series and promptly read all of the books in the series.In recent years, I have eagerly awaited the release of new books in the series. And, Blue at the Mizzen was worth the wait.The Aubrey and Maturin characters have evolved as individuals, as they have aged and had other experiences in life. Unlike most of the earlier books in the series, Blue at the Mizzen features Dr. Maturin to a greater degree than the brooding Capt. Aubrey whose concern over his future makes him more remote to both Maturin and to the reader. After O'Brian killed off Dr. Maturin's wife in The Hundred Days, Dr. Maturin surprisingly develops a romantic interest in a fellow naturalist, Christine Wood. Their romantic episode is odd, but given Maturin's character, that is not really surprising.As usual, a lot happens in this book, but as in the other books, O'Brian often unleashes the action in a understated or offhanded way. Events happen with little or no warning or with minimal discussion. The intelligence activities involving the Republic of Chile are not as clearly described, for example, as Maturin's South American intelligence activities in The Wine Dark Sea. As with other books in the series, the action sometimes is secondary to the activities on the ship, the relationships of the main and minor characters, and Maturin's focus on the birds and beasts that they encounter. Even so, Blue on the Mizzen was an enjoyable book that held my interest.How does it compare with the other books in the series? Good question. Personally, I liked it better than The Yellow Admiral, which spent too much time on shore. Unlike other reader reviewers, however, I equally enjoyed both The Hundred Days and Blue at the Mizzen. The early books are wonderful, but even these later books are very good.For someone who has read any of the Aubrey/Maturin novels, I would not suggest that you start with Blue at the Mizzen. Instead, the O'Brian novice should start with the earliest books in the series. For someone who has read the other Aubrey/Maturin novels, Blue at the Mizzen should be a &quot;must read&quot; book. It is the last one in the series due to O'Brian's recent death. If O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin formula is aging by book #20 in the series, it is still a fine formula that still works in #20. Blue at the Mizzen is a worthy end to the series."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Interested reader,If you are reading these reviews, chances are good you are wondering what all this stuff about Patrick O'Brian and the &quot;Aubrey/Maturin&quot; series is about. Wonder no longer.&quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; represents the last volume of what is overall a rich, wonderful collection of literature. While I've read the disappointment that some have had with the last few books in the series, I respectfully offer the view of a reader who feels touched forever by the author's hand and grateful for having read this series in the first place.Once you read &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; chances are excellent you will adopt Aubrey and Maturin to be among your favorite characters of all time. Who could not chuckle when Stephen Maturin tries yet again trying to come aboard the ship without falling overboard? Who could not envision Killick's severe expressions when Aubrey gets grease on his number one uniform, or become anxious whenever Aubrey sets foot upon land? Who could not feel the loss of a shipmate sent over the side? It is sad to note that we finally see Aubrey make his flag as we get the news that Mr. O'Brian has made his number.I believe that &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; and all the other books in the series need to be looked at by the prospective reader in total. If you have never read from this series, start with &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; and I will guarantee that if you like this first volume and continue through the series, you will be touched by a truly masterful hand."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I wasn't a great fan of the predecessor to this book (The Hundred Days) as it seemed that a lot of life had been sucked out of the series. I then re-read the set from Master and Commander to Blue at The Mizzen.While the books have changed somewhat, in that they have become less descriptive of the interrelationships between the characters, this is understandable. As Aubrey gets more senior (here for much of the time he is an acting Commodore with a small squadron) the books have to describe a much bigger naval and political picture. O'Brian excels at this.Unfortunately this means we lose some of the &quot;small ship&quot; feeling, and many of the best characters from earlier in the series are left out. Isn't this a function of life - not only Aubrey and Maturin's but also most readers? As we move on in the world relationships change and we interact with different people. In addition O'Brian would have difficulty in weaving in many old characters and maintaining the sense of historical accuracy that is important to his books (this is however not a justification for Aubrey's lack of response to Bonden's death in the previous book).Read the whole series from book one and then enjoy this and its predecessor (The Hundred Days). Both books then fall into much better context.Keep it up Mr O'Brian - you are doing an excellent job. I fervently hope that the unanswered questions surrounding Stephen and Christine Wood (as well as where Aubrey goes from here) mean that we can hope for one more (and preferably more than one) book and a couple of large fleet actions!"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I don't know whether I would recommend &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to someone unfamiliar with Patrick O'Brian's excellent series of nautical novels about Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin because, I believe, much of the pleasure to be derived in reading the book comes from our acquaintance with the main characters from previous novels. But I would have no hesititation at all at recommending it to any Aubrey-Maturin fan. A significant number of readers (not including me) of the previous book in the series, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, were disappointed in the somber tone of that novel -- an atmosphere fully justified, in my opinion, by the central subject matter. Those readers need not fear a repetition in &quot;Blue at the Mizzen.&quot; Stephen Maturin has recovered his interest in the natural world and is once again a fully engaged participant in the events around him. It has been said that this novel might be the final volume in the series (I hope not) but if it is, then the series will end on a high note. The book is full of typical O'Brian touches of elegantly described scenes and subtle characterizations. If it is not quite the equal of &quot;Post Captain&quot; or &quot;Desolation Island&quot; (but what is?) there is still much in &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to make longtime fans of the series smile with satisfaction. And if it is not the final volume, then I shall look forward with great pleasure to the next book."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Although Blue at the Mizzen is readable on its own, it is perhaps an injustice to it to do so. The book, as with any one of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels, is merely chapter 20 in what is trully an epic. Each volume/chapter is integral; there is not a single weak link in the tale. It was thus with great sadness that I read of Mr. O'Brian's recent death; Blue at the Mizzen is the final chapter.Things could be worse. Mr O'Brian, intentionally or no, has brought the resolution of many long-standing issues to his characters, though these resolutions also promise new beginings which the reader will now have to make up on his (her) own. Blue at the Mizzen is the type of novel Mr O'Brian's vast readership have come to expect: tragedy ballanced keenly with triumph, exploration of world and soul, the peculiar gains we find in loss, and the losses we face in victory. Blue at the Mizzen is a must read for anyone who has read the epic till this point. Others will still find it enjoyable, but are strongly suggested to start with volume/chapter one: Master and Commander."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"So seemingly effortless, yet so rich in every phrase --- O'Brian is again at the top of his form; not just the tale he tells, but also the way he throws off ideas, characters, and plot with brief phrases that sing together so sweetly. It's a rare fine wine, enjoyed best by those who have developed a taste for it in the first twenty volumnes. Aubrey has aged, and has grown more silent, more brooding, the aging man of action losing some of his physical prowess, his ambition, but with habits of courage so deeply ingrained; Maturin the aging philosophe, brought to life not only by his spirited study of the natural world but also by the discovery of his aging heart's new trilling at the thought of Ms Woods. God, this stuff is great!"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Patrick O'Brien once described the Napoleonic Wars as &quot;the Troy tales&quot; of the British people, playing as central a role in the national myth as the Trojan wars did for the ancient Greeks. His incomparable series, based on the vicissitudes of the professional career of Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy, who rises from humble Lieutenant to Admiral (with one reduction to the ranks and a court martial and public disgrace along the way), has become a cult among his many admirers.There are three main reasons for this. First, the naval lore and action are quite as good and compelling as the battles of C S Foresters's Horatio Hornblower. Second, these are real novels, more than rattling good action yarns, with complex characters, credible women (Diana Villiers is a grand creation) and a genuine historical sense of life ashore that reveal O'Brien's admiration for Jane Austen. Above all, the series is given life and depth and tension by the heart of the books, the friendship between Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the half-Irish, half-Catalan, who is naturalist, physician, musician and spy.At times, the reader is lost in the world of Charles Darwin and the voyage of 'The Beagle' as Maturin delights in the flora and fauna that come the way of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, the Antarctic, the South Pacific and the Newfoundland Banks. At times, one is lost in a world of culinary history, or of secret intelligence, or primitive surgery. The French enemies are drawn with intelligent sympathy, and the American naval adversaries treated with proper respect.To embark upon the long voyage of this marvellous series is to plunge into a compelling and enchanting world. I have bought half a dozen copies of the first book of the series, 'Master and Commander', to lure choice friends into this sweet obsession of O'Brien's world. My own favourite remains 'The Mauritius Command', but I know that once I begin it, I shall have to recommence the pleasure of re-reading the series. Life is too short not to surrender to the indulgence, again and again."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Even though I believe that the Aubrey-Maturin series is one of the great works of prose fiction of the 20th century, the latest (and 20th) book in the series, Blue at the Mizzen, is a disappointment. Indeed the last few books in the series (starting with the Wine-Dark Sea, have gotten progressively weaker, but even they have always had many compelling pages. The great humor, the exciting naval action, the lovely historical feel, but above all the wonderful language and psychological acuity are missing here. The female characters are, no surprise, mere plot devices. (Both Sophie and Clarissa barely figure, and the smart and beautiful Mrs. Wood, who Maturin falls for, makes little sense as a character.) But the subordinate characters in general lack interest, even the prominently featured midshipman Hansen, the bastard son of the Duke of Clarence. The local color in early 19th century Chile seems washed out, insubstantial. Worst of all, the two principals are presented pro forma, as if O'Brian is just tired of them. While there is a satisfying (finally) move up to Admiral for Aubrey, the story (with no more Napoleonic foes, and no more money worries) has run out of gas. Is this the last of the novels? Aubrey-Maturin fans will be disappointed that we have lost track of Pullings, Babbington, Mowett, and Martin completely-what happened to them? Where oh where is to Aubrey's illegitimate son, Sam Panda, last seen in nesrby Peru-and why do Jack's thoughts never run to him? This is, of course, a must-read for Aubrey-Maturin fans, but compared to the invigorating, full-blooded novels in the series, this one reads like the weak, lukewarm tea that Jack and Stephen so detest."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Well, it's taken some time, but I have finally reached, and read, the final book in the wonderful Aubrey / Maturin series. This last book was a real barnstormer, with a really fabulous final flourish for the characters you will by now know and love.I'm not ashamed to say that the final few pages almost had me in tears for the wonderful description of the two old friends in the book when they had some big news, and for the feeling of loss I was suffering from knowing there would be no more to read from Patrick O'Brian."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"As anyone familiar with the work of Jon Mellencamp may have figured out already, this last (complete) entry in the outstanding Aubrey/Maturin saga reminded me of a different Jack and Diane.\\"Master and Commander\\" (the first book in the series) was written almost three decades before \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\", and approximately 15 years of story time have passed as well. Either due to the aging of the author or of the characters (or perhaps of both), the thrill of living in their world is almost gone by the last couple of books; just a wisp of its former self.The late, great Patrick O'Brien was an immensely talented author. Most of his series crackles with historically accurate naval action that firmly pulls you into a long-ago time and place, a fascinating and intricate world that is totally gone. But even more importantly, his deep and nuanced characterizations made you really care about the people in the story, making the \\"lulls\\" between actions some of the most entertaining parts. Who could forget Jack's radiant joy at receiving his first command, or Stephen complaining, \\"Jack, you have debauched my sloth!\\", among dozens and dozens of other examples of wit and character that made a potentially dry topic come fully to life.In \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\", however, much of the joy of life and character and language and action that made so many readers love these books has faded to gray. The plot revolves around political and military maneuverings in Chile as Britain tries to quietly help the Spanish colony become independent. (This is no spoiler, as Jack and Stephen have been trying to make it over there for most of the last two books.) But neither of our main characters seem to give a fig about their mission. As a consequence, neither does the reader. That would be acceptable if the characters interacted and developed as they did throughout much of the series, but here they do neither. Jack is distant and morose, and Stephen spends his time pining for his new (and frankly unrealistic) love interest and riding aimlessly across the harsh local landscape, with little sign of their warm friendship to be seen.The characters are approaching middle age by this point, so it's unreasonable to expect them to behave as they did when the series began. They've been through too many victories and defeats and tragedies (both professionally and personally) to be the same people. But while forty year-olds don't generally grow and evolve at the same speed as younger men, they do change. O'Brien hints that perhaps now, when Jack and Stephen's long-held goals are finally within reach (raising a pennant) or already achieved (helping to defeat Napoleon), they might have started to realize that the journey was the thing after all, and that perhaps other goals are preferable now - a mid-life crisis, as it were. That seems to be a reasonable path for continuing the development of these wonderful characters, but O'Brien chose not to take it, and they're left as wooden caricatures of themselves.Their supporting cast doesn't help much. Inexplicably absent are many of their usual shipmates (Pullings, Mowett, Babbington, etc.), which is odd since it is mentioned more than once that sailors are desperate for work now that peace has come. And where is Jack's son Sam? When last they were in South America, he was quick to visit. Here, nobody seems to remember that he exists. Poor Rev. Martin, last spoken of when he sailed back for England many books ago, again doesn't even get a mention, much less a return appearance.Yes, a few newer characters are around, but they never take on much life. Dr. Jacob seems to be a more worldly replacement for Martin but never comes across as anything more than a 2-dimensional medical/intelligence aid to Stephen. Poll Skillings and Horatio Hansen have potential, but they aren't given much to do.Let me repeat, I absolutely love this series. The books flow from one to the next and have been called a single (20-volume!) historical novel, and the best I've ever read. I have read them all from beginning to end more than once and will certainly read them again. However, there's no getting around the fact that this last chapter is a disappointment.Near the end of the book, Aubrey receives a packet of letters from Sophie and tears up because he misses his family so much. It would have been much more satisfying, for both dear Jack and myself, if he would have been allowed to stop mucking around in South America and instead sail home to strike soundings in the channel of old England at last."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Coming to the end of \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" and in so doing finishing the 20-volume Aubrey-Maturin series felt like a tragedy--like losing a close friend. I held off for about a year, occasionally casting aside lesser books by others writers because O'Brian's mastery had spoiled me, then I could stand it no longer: I had to start re-reading the whole series again from the beginning, delighting again in Jack and Stephen being young men with many years of adventure ahead. The series is in my opinion the greatest work of historical fiction ever written and I foresee journeying through it a third and, yes, perhaps even a fourth time at some point in my life.Samuel Hawley[...]"},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Patrick O'Brian's \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" is the twentieth and final book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. The Aubrey-Maturin books are quite simply the best fiction I've ever read. I enjoy them so much that I find it difficult to read any other fiction now.Although there are twenty (completed) Aubrey-Maturin novels, in a sense they are one long, unending story. O'Brian tells the story of an unlikely pair of friends in early 19th century Britain: a hard-charging Royal Navy captain and an Irish physician and naturalist (and British spy). Both are devoted, for different reasons, to the fight against Napoleonic France. Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Stephen Maturin are dedicated friends, and the interplay between this unlikely pair is ranges from deep philosophical discussions to intended and unintended humor.But what really makes these novels is Patrick O'Brian's writing style. Through his words, he paints wonderful pictures and creates real characters in brilliant narratives; which is good, because Aubrey and many of his exploits are based on real-life adventures during the Napoleonic Wars.\\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" is set just after peace finally settled in Europe after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. After time spent at Gibraltar and in England, Aubrey and Maturin head to South America to help the Chilean independence movement. In the usual understated O'Brian style, he focuses much more on the people involved than the action at sea. After intrigue ashore and at sea, the book - and the series - end on the uplifting note that Aubrey can fly the blue flag of a rear admiral from his ship. The series ends there (because of O'Brian's death) , but the characters will live forever."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I have read (and re-read) as well as listened to Patrick Tull's narrations of all the previous 19 volumes in the series and still find excitement, drama, and humor that makes me laugh out loud or say Huzzay! However this book was a great disppointment. It lacked the full involvement of many characters, the humor and the light-hearted exchanges between Aubrey and Maturin. Too much was conveyed through Stephen's over long letters to Christine. Without the war, the battle scenes were boring. I'm sorry to say that after skipping through page after page I finally put the book down and can't bring myself to finish it. But I still gave it 3 stars - O'Brian is the best writer of historical fiction to date and the first 19 novels will always be my favorites. I would love to see PBS do these stories in a television series."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"While I have not read this group of books myself, I can tell you that my husband and son devoured these books and were left wanting more after completing the final book - Blue at the Mizzen. I have heard them discuss this collection at great length and I believe that they would be capable (and willing) of becoming deck hands in time of yore based on the brilliant descriptions of all aspects of the ships, equipment and food items which were sailed, implemented and consumed during those times.Even after a couple of years, they will discuss Aubrey/Maturin conversations and philosophies and have even participated in tall ship events themselves!If books can get you THAT excited about something, they must be well worth the read."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Amazon's 5 star rating system doesn't do justice to O'Brian's works. The best of them can easily earn 8.745 stars, and the poorest better than 6. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; is a solid reflective work, yet with flaws. The plot is inconsistent, and full of holes. Vast assumptions are made. Without having read the previous Aubrey/Maturin books, it would be a difficult read.Yet, a less than excellent O'Brian is still head and shoulders above anything else in this genre. On Amazon's 5 star system, I would give it a 6.73. Let's hope that O'Brian has a magnum opus to conclude the series."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"I don't know about this one--many of the earlier chapters felt to me as if someone listed all the O'Brian quirks and twists of language and then trotted out the characters and pasted them in here and there. It did not truly sing of Patrick O'Brian. I was disappointed that while Maturin seemingly narrates throughout the book, his usual curmudgeonly and unkempt personality rarely showed. It was &quot;Stephen Lite&quot;, especially considering losing Diana and dealing with a very distant Jack.(No matter how tired a contrivance it was, I always enjoyed Jack's roaring bad puns, red face and passion for puddings!) The last few books have been less engaging, too, but I heard O'Brian's voice much less in Blue at the Mizzen than in any of them. I realize the trials of age may dim that creativity we have come to expect. I faithfully finished the book (it improved later). I wish Mr. O'Brian well."},{"Title":"Blue at the Mizzen","review":"Book number 20 in the series.

But above and beyond this, it explains the tradition and folklore behind pysanky and krashanky eggs.

As soon as I opened it I was swept away by the passion and furry of the Florida panhandle. The writing was creative and fluid and a pleasure to read. I'm looking forward to this author's next novel."},{"Title":"The Passion of Belle Rio","review":"Bo May's writing is very visual and taut, and his main character, Jack McCutcheon, is a layered, complex, Ellroy-type kind of guy that you could share a drink with and never be bored. I've never been to the panhandle, but now I know what it feels like."},{"Title":"The Passion of Belle Rio","review":"Belle Rio is as comic, absurd, and violent as it is beautiful. Lead chcaracter Jack McCutcheon, a burnt out real estate lawyer from Chicago, is lost in Belle Rio - haunted by the memory of his mother, disappointed in love, and a father he never knew. His descent into the hell of the Florida panhandle reads like a hip mix of Dante and James Elroy's white jazz in dark places. In an atmosphere of drastic social change the sins of the past collide with the inevitable but uncertain future: approval of the Net Ban Amendment guarantees exclusive resort condos and expensive yacht marinas, the irreversible tide of tourism that will destroy this seemingly idyllic coastal paradise. When two hudred years of racial tensions explodes in one terrible night of hate and bitter despair, the truth is finally revealed; but no one wants to hear it. Life in paradise will never be the same. Belle is the memory of love, the gravity of passion, the inevitability of blood, and the irony of fate. Mr. May writes with style and verve"},{"Title":"The Passion of Belle Rio","review":"A friend recommended we peruse this first novel by Bo May, perhaps because we're all Nashvillians. The author's thirty years in the film industry [according to the brief bio] - including both writing and directing -- no doubt served him well in creating this drama of everyday life in a small town overlooked by prosperity along Florida's Gulf coast. Belle Rio struck us like many a backwoods village: everybody knew everybody; the women tended to be communal property; and it seemed everyone was everyone else's cousin. Most of their days were consumed by fishing or otherwise scrapping for a living; most of their nights by smokin', drinkin', druggin' and fightin'. And while the story is set in modern times, apparently integration was not that new a phenomenon; so add racial tension to the mix of hard living and redneck philosophy.Lawyer Jack McCutcheon is the character through which the story unfolds. Like Grishams' \\"A Painted House\\", there's really not that much plot in \\"Passion\\", rather more an existential inquisition and exposition of the many colorful people who made Belle Rio. From the lowlifes at the pool hall, to strip-joint managers, to the few landowners, we meet many different and interesting characters as McCutcheon plies his trade as a public defender. Many of those we meet come to violent deaths at young ages -- Rio is no paradise where people get educated and move on to better things. The seemingly ready availability of female bed partners leads to more than a few explicit sex scenes, and much of the mystery about who's who revolves around who fathered whom, be the offspring black, white, or in between. The murder of a black football player late in the story serves to punctuate the issues raised in the earlier mini-stories, leading to more than a few surprises at book's end.May certainly exposes us to a cross-cut of society that the average suburbanite may find outside their own experience. His writing is easy going, almost conversational: one can picture old people on porches just telling this story if it weren't written down. While much of the subject matter is provocative, if not disturbing, May's knack for converting visual imagery into words makes for a few worthwhile hours of entertainment."},{"Title":"After the Drought","review":"Joseph Puna Balaz is a vital and important Hawaiian poet, then (1970s) as now (1990s), so anything he writes is of interest.

In the first half of the book, the &quot;Desolation&quot; chapters explain Jack's feelings and mind more than in any other book and during an important period of his life. Some people say the book is schitzophrenic, having been started in Mexico City in 1956 and completed around 1962. However, I believe the result is not two books but half of the book being thoughts and feelings and the other half being a thoughtful man reflecting. In any case, the book is wonderful, and reading the entire novel does take some work but well worth the effort!"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Desolation Angels is by far my favorite Keruoac book.

I did not get the same amount of excitement from it as I did from On The Road. It was a satisfying read, but he did better."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Perfect, absolutly perfect. Just like Dharma Bums, I had to take my time reading this book because every WORD is so important. Kerouac is a god."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"There are usually two types of Kerouac readers. There are the \\"On the Roaders\\", as I call them. The ones that enjoy his style, his way of placing his friends' lives into the context of their own troubles, their loneliness their love-- all the while with a literary pace likened to a old pickup speeding across the straightaways of the vacant Montana backroads. And then there are the others, who like the former, enjoy the style-- but they also look for the sadness in Kerouac's writing. His ability to deconstruct people with one look (in Desolation Angels he watches a waitress in a bar and tells her entire life story in snapshot events that underlie the sad look in her eyes), to find the hidden sentiments in people's actions-- whether he's right or wrong we really don't care.Desolation Angels is the book for the second group of people. It is tortuous at times-- like his solitude atop the mountain staring Hozomeen in the face every morning which reveals Kerouac's own struggle to deal with himself and his past. But I believe among all of his novels it is the most rewarding. The book takes us to all of his major haunts- London, New York, San Fran, Paris, the Mediterranean- with many of his closest friends - Neal, Allen, Williams S. Burroughs, Joyce. There's even a small part where Kerouac is face to face with Salvador Dali.If you are looking for Kerouac-the-humanist at his best- this is the novel for you. Where the novel lacks in adventure (On the Road) and joyous affirmation (Dharma Bums) it makes up in sheer descriptive character study and sad observation, of a man trying to grapple with what he sees as the emptiness of all things, and the reality of his own personal struggles with life, love, and death."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book may come as a real shock to those whom have a preconcieved notion about what the \\"Beats\\" were all about, and it may also be a shock for those more familiar with the jubilant ecstatic life affirmations of On The Road or even The Dharma Bums.In this book Jack goes on the road (with Mom), has sex with a fourteen year old mexican prostitute, meets up with a Neal (Cody) whom is a far fly from his On the Road days and is tied down with a wife + three kids and a job, meets Salidore Dali + William Carlos WIlliams + Carl Sandburg, gets his book published, is constantly compulsively depressed, has a paradigmatic consciousness flip after a huge dose of opium, meets up with junkie Burroughs in Tangiers (whom is lovelorn over Ginsburg), and kicks Buddhism down a notch for a more hardcore return to Christianity.As others have noted, this book follows directly after the Dharma Bums and that book should be read first. What follows is Jack's experiences on the mountain which, contrary to his expectations in Dharma Bums, is almost like a nightmare prison sentence.After he leaves the mountain, we enter into the first half of the book (his return to California), which is a bit ponderous and slow (but never boring). We are treated to a tortureous description of his day of betting at a race track with Neal and Corso.The book picks up speed bigtime when he goes back on the road and then travels internationally.His prose is brilliant and poetic and his observations remarkable and I think this book is brilliant; but it is also tremendously sad, deeply frusterated and lost, spiritually drained and destitute, and there is little ecstacy to be had. By the end of the book, and with the return of his compulsive obsession with Christianity, one can really sense the beginning of his psychosis and alcoholism and mommy obsession which would spell his death by age fourty seven.I'm not sure to whom this book should be recommended- for I'm not sure whom would care about this descent of an icon for joy. It should definetly be read by those whom have read On the Road and the Dharma Bums, but also by those whom think that the counter cultural movements were all done by joy seeking thrill addicts without a care in the world. After reading this book, it would seem that caring is something that was not is short supply amongst these bands of fellow travelers on the way.Also, those whom felt that the beats were all leftist radicals, anarchists and communists would be very suprised to read in this book that Jack almost seems like a rightist in many regards. He reads a book on the atrocities of communism on the mountain, he constantly is remarking about totalitarian regimes (in particular- Russia), brings up Mao (at a time when some on the left felt he may have been a hero and the crimes against \\"reactionaries\\" hadn't yet come into light) and Castro (while others went off to visit Cuba jack said \\"I'm not concerned with the Cuban Revolution, I'm concerned with the American Revolution.\\") and even Zapata is discussed in negative diatribes. He was also a fan of Ike. He spends far more time bitching about leftist than he does about rightists. He also has some special scorn put aside for the common hipster, the mass of \\"beats\\" whom came after.Very moving, sad, beautiful, profound, funny, poetic- a treasure from a real man at the start of his turn into a caricature by the mass media. By the end, when he drags his mother to california and he doesn't have hardly a nickel, he truely does seem like a little boy lost, crushed still by the death of his brother Gerard and his father whom he found, crushed by all the love lost, by all the dreams evaporated.Evey place he goes, he believes that happiness may lie at the next stop- but once he gets there, there is only sadness once again. At first he wants to return to the mountain on which he'd felt so trapped, but by the end of the book, he just wants to return to the womb."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Wonderful novel by Jack Kerouac. We sense his deep loneliness and reevaluation of his life during his 63-day stay atop Desolation Peak in Mt. Baker National Forest in Washington State. Once down from the mountain, he sees how much life has changed once his novel &quot;On the Road&quot; is published. For those of you who loved &quot;On the Road,&quot; &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; is a book you definitely must read--it's by far Kerouac's best and most personal novel."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Somewhere in the 409 pages of this book you'll find buried a truly great work of American literature. It is hard to fault Kerouac for his devotion to spontaneous and unedited writing; though these methods imposed limitations on what he could accomplish as a writer, they also contributed to what makes his books so fascinating. If Jack had lived in Hemingway's time, he would have submitted Desolation Angels to the publisher and would have been handed back a 300 page masterpiece.The most problematic section is the first one, \\"Desolation in Solitude.\\" I understand that Kerouac wanted to convey the sheer insanity of his isolation as a lookout, but considering that he already devoted about 30 pages to this in Dharma Bums, he essentially retreads the same mystic nonsense for another 70 pages without giving much new insight into his experience. The one interesting bit that comes out of the whole ordeal is the gradual dissatisfaction that Kerouac feels for Buddhism (which, through his interpretation, seems to fall a bit close to nihilism) and his reacceptance of Christianity.But after this first section, things pick up and Kerouac delivers one painfully sad and and transcendentally beautiful insight after another (one of my favorites: his frustration at receiving a $3 jaywalking ticket on the way to a job, costing him half his day's pay-- but you have to read the way he puts it to understand, of couse). It is worth noting that Desolation Angels really is two different books written almost 5 years apart. The first half he wrote while in Mexico City (during events he describes in the second half, Passing Through), while the second half was written in Florida (I think) while he lived with his mother. Thus, Kerouac's interpretation of life radically shifts when you begin the 2nd half. He also suddenly becomes a lot more candid, talking about his life as a writer, his use of drugs, and the homosexuality of his peers in a lot more detail and honesty than he could manage before. It is also important to understand that \\"Desolation Angels\\" (part 1) was written BEFORE On the Road was published, while \\"Passing Through\\" (part 2) was written AFTER. His sudden brush with fame can probably account for this shift in perspective.I don't want to go into too much detail about the multitude of spiritual revelations within the book, as its better to hear it out of the mouth of the mystic. Reading the book, one can't help but notice that Kerouac, even when past his literary and spiritual peak, was not the embittered and impotent wreck that he's usually considered-- not based on his touching insights in \\"Passing Through.\\" He clearly has a lot of faith in humanity, and of the necessity that people act out of love and respect rather than hate and fear. Many critics quickly dismiss Desolation Angels as a \\"lesser work,\\" but I think that if you're willing the persist through the dense opening section, the rewards are nearly as profound as those of his more famous novels."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book has been described as the journal of Jack losing himself. Some critics state that when he came back down from his time of solitude on Desolation Mountain begins his spiral downward into madness, alcoholism and loss of artistic edge. I disagree - but it is most certainly a showing of a break in his persona - as he describes the beauty and horror of having nothing to do but face one's self when that's all one has. The lies you tell yourself are strong, but give way when you have no one else to reinforce them for months on end...and this may have indeed driven Jack to the edge and beyond.The pre-eminent voice of the Beat movement, who both gave it its name and disavowed his involvement, is at his most exposed and honest self in this work. This is not a book to read for a relaxing afternoon, in my opinion. This is a book that will burden you - but you'll be better for it."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Jack Kerouac's 'Desolation Angels', written about a period of his life roughly 10 years before his death, acts as a nice bridge between 'On The Road' (which was awaiting publication during the course of events described in \\"Angels\\") and a subsequent publication, Big Sur, both of which I've read.During his two month self-imposed exile to work as a fire ranger on Desolation Peak, Jack Kerouac was forced to confront many of his pre-existing or emerging demons. The location for this period of his life is especially apropos for the 'desolation' surrounding Kerouac, much of which was self-created, as he sank further into depression and alcoholism.The book covers more of his life than just the two months on Desolation Peak, but as Jack re-emerges into society, you get the sense that this 'loner' was only comfortable being 'alone' amongst others...that while he could see, smell, and wander amongst others, and feel tolerably 'isolated'...he could not stand the true isolation he could achieve, to remove himself from society altogether.Jack wanders from the American Northwest to Florida, to Mexico, to Tangiers, to California with his mother in tow, and eventually back to Florida, when his mother grows further depressed with their cross-country move after only a month.Many players from Kerouac's former novels appear in this one as well, albeit with different names...the poet 'Gregory Corso,' to whom Kerouac lost 'Mardou Fox' in \\"Subterraneans\\" is called 'Raphael Urso' in \\"Angels\\"...'Dean Moriarty,' from \\"On The Road\\" is 'Cody' in this incarnation.Kerouac's detachment from the Beat Generation, his status as their reigning 'king', his fame, and his Buddhist beliefs all come into focus during this novel, one of his finest, in my opinion. If you rode shotgun with Kerouac for On The Road, explore his life further, and you will uncover far more about this dark, troubled, but fascinating author."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I have been reading Kerouac for about twenty years (but still haven't exhausted the canon). After reading Desolation Angels I think it might still be a while.You have got to love Kerouac to get through much of this book (and I do) and it is ultimately worth the effort, but what an effort! Too much of this book is &quot;we did this, then we did that&quot; and Kerouac's lack of contextualizing all this can get to you.But there are always small epiphanies that make Kerouac worth reading. There are about six in this book, the best being his brief account of his sea voyage to Tangiers on a Yugoslav freighter in a storm. &quot;It scares a seaman to hear the Kitchen scream in fear.&quot; And Kerouac's lamentation on the unfortunate popularization of the 'cool' ethos: &quot;But all I could do was sit on the edge of the bed in despair listening to their awful 'likes' and 'like you know' and 'wow crazy'...All this was about to sprout out all over America even down to High School level and be attributed in part to my doing!&quot;Much of what makes Kerouac one of the American Big Three is that nobody else could get away with writing like this. It ain't pretty and it's often exasperating, but what a Great Soul."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Let me tell you a story. I had just come down toSan Francisco after a couple of years of bummingaround the Great Northwest. It was a Monday morningand I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determinedto scour the want ads until I found prospects for anhonest job, with the full intention of becoming morerespectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had aseat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfoldthe newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copyof &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; on the chair. I picked it up andstarted to read it. Several hours later I abandoned myfaint tries at redemption and walked over to WashingtonSquare to work on some poetry. The man can flat out write.That's why they call him the King of the Beats."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I disagree with the 5-star consensus of the previous reviewers - Kerouac's writing is not 'faultless prose', as he characterizes it himself in this novel. But 'Desolation Angels' is another fascinating glimpse into the heart of this daring and nomadic - literally and spiritually - author. One star gets shaved from my review for the unfocused, enigmatic opening section of the book, 'Desolation in Solitude'. A rethinking of 'Alone on a Mountaintop' from 'Lonesome Traveler', this section only thickens the fog in both the reader and in the author, it seems. It's not that it rambles - all Kerouac's writing does, and to point it out as a flaw is like insisting that Bob Dylan's voice sucks. Of course it does, that's the point. But Kerouac characterized the Desolation Peak experience before and did it better in 'Lonesome Traveler'.However, once Kerouac makes his descent and rejoins the world in the second half of Book One and through all of Book Two, the way that his mountaintop experience informs his perspective in places like New York, Mexico, and Europe is engrossing and surpisingly intelligent. Drawing from a wide variety of influences from St. Paul to Buddha to Hemingway, Kerouac revisits familiar places and people with a broadened and more cynical point of view. Desolation Angels is more candid, forthright, even explicit, than its predecessors about drug use and sex. But it also reveals a more exhaustive spiritual hunger in Kerouac, and leads the reader to conclude that the author, in his quest to meet God, realized he had indeed found Him.By turns a thoughtful, pensive, funny and risk-taking novel, Desolation Angels is canonical Kerouac."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"it oozes oh so slow and when it is on it is on. sometimes i have trouble with kerouac as he makes references to things that leave me scratching my head. every so often in this book i would turn back a few pages to see if i remembered what i read. i think 60% of the time i didn't. like the slow reading however, i know these pages have oozed into my subconscious. these concepts may take a few years to be fully realized.welcome to the wonderfull world of jack kerouac outside of \\"on the road\\". do i love it? i'm not sure, that's why i didn't give \\"desolation angels\\" five stars. is he passionate? no doubt. is this book well-written? not even a question.but this is kerouac to me. it's about patience and reward. this is not a fast read. in fact at times, i'll read four pages and feel exhausted. did i expect a quick read when i bought it? hell no.bottom line: was it an enjoyable read? some parts yes, some parts no. but this begs the question, is it supposed to be enjoyable? i'd say same answer. definitely thick on the emotion so in that sense, I hold it in high regard. one part of the book i was singing the prose aloud. strange, isn't it?:o)"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"If you've read On the Road, then this is a must read.

The very mention of his great cool name that just rolls off the tongue will, at a mere mention generate the most passionate explanation from any book lover, historian, critic, or a \\"lost,\\" unenlightened victim of an educational system plagued by the three letters which spell Satan; GOP.This book was written in 1965 while the Beat Generation was minglling with the hippies and Kerouac had distanced himself from his friends Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady, sadly.It's more like a diary of Kerouac's most deep thoughts while he lives by Desolation peak and in that case, it's like the Walden of the twentieth century.

Kerouac had a short relationship with Weaver in 1956 followed by a longer relationship with Johnson. In \\"Desolation Angels\\", Kerouac describes his relationship with these women from his own perspective. There is much more to the book.\\"Desolation Angels\\" is the most literally autobiographical of Kerouac's novels, with the author frequently only slightly changing the names of his friends and supporting characters. The book covers about one year in Kerouac's life, from the summer, 1956, to late 1957, just before the New York Times published a favorable review of \\"On the Road\\" which took Kerouac from obscurity to fame. The book is in two large sections (called \\"books\\") written at different times and in different styles. Kerouac wrote book one titled \\"Desolation Angels\\" in 1956-1957 shortly after the events it describes. The book is written in the spontaneous, associative stream-of-consciousness style that characterizes Kerouac's best-known work. It was rejected for publication in 1957.In 1961, when Kerouac was in the middle of a long decline, he wrote the second book of what became \\"Desolation Angels\\", titled \\"Passing Through\\" while living in Mexico. Kerouac's writing in this second book, which includes his relationships with Weaver and Glassman, is more narrative and straighforward in character than in the first book. Kerouac thought of publishing each part as separate works but decided to combine the two together. The result is \\"Desolation Angels\\" first published in 1965. The current edition of the book, which dates from 1995, begins with a valuable introduction by Joyce Johnson.The book is long, rambling, and autobiographical. It lacks a formal plot. The book is held together by themes stated in the opening section \\"Desolation in Solitude\\" and developed throughout the book. In the summer of 1956, following the events recounted in his novel \\"The Dharma Bums\\"The Dharma Bums, Kerouac worked for two months isolated on Desolation Peak in western Washington in a fire tower. He thought he would be able to use this period of isolation for meditation and gaining control of his life. He soon found himself, however, missing friends, companionship and every day activity. Kerouac reflects on his surroundings, on his family, and on his earlier life in short, stream-of-conscious sections before he comes down from the mountain to rejoin the world. A sense of religious and philosophical meditation, which includes a great deal of Buddhism, also pervades Kerouac's discussion of his time on Desolation Peak and the novel as a whole.The section of the book describing Kerouac's experiences and thoughts on Desolation Peak is overall the strongest in the novel. The remainder of book one describes Kerouac's descent from the mountain and hitchhiking through Portland to San Francisco. He spends a riotous week with his friends in the middle of the San Francisco Poetry renaissance, but the best scenes are of Kerouac and his friends having fun and walking the streets. Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsburg, and Gregory Corso, with slightly changed names, play important roles. The sense of disatsifaction and the need to move on, whether alone on Desolation Peak or with friends, is critical to Kerouac. Unhappy in San Francisco, he sets off for Mexico.The aptly titled \\"Passing Through\\", book two of the work, describes Kerouac's continued restlessnes, spiritual questioning, and dizzying journeys to Mexico, New York City, Tangiers, France, back to New York, California, and New York again. When he wrote \\"Passing Through\\" in 1961, Kerouac was famous but in decline. He was seriously troubled by the faddish attention given to the so-called \\"Beat Movement\\" which he had not intended to create. In \\"Passing Through\\", \\"On the Road\\" is accepted for publication, but relatively little is made of this. In many places, Kerouac addresses his readers directly and intimately. Thus, early in book two he cautions his readers:\\"And also dont think of me as a simple character-- A lecher, a ship-jumper, a loafer, a conner of older women, even of queers, an idiot, nay a drunken baby Indian when drinking--- Got socked everywhere and never socked back (except when young tough football player)-- In fact, I don't even know what I was-- Some kind of fevered being different as a snowflake....In any case, a wondrous mess of contradictions (good enough, said Whitman) but morefit for the Holy Russia of the 19th Century than for this modern America of crew cuts and sullen faces in Pontiacs--\\".The scenes in Mexico City, with Bill Burroughs in Tangiers, and particularly with his mother in a long, disastrous trip to California are as good as the scenes with Weaver and Johnson.This book captures a great deal of Kerouac and his contradictions. It shows a man who loved and tried to savor the common experiences of life, his friends, lovers, and food, and yet suffered from an inner loneliness and restlessness. Wherever he was, Kerouac felt he had to be somewhere else. Alcoholism and drugs and wandering inexorably took their toll. The story is told in \\"Desolation Angels\\" with strong religious overtones. The spirituality in this book is complex and unsystematized. It includes Buddhism, Catholicism and simple living in the here and now but does not reduce to any formula. I found the spiritual quest theme of this book challenging and moving.\\"Desolation Angels\\" is a difficult mixed book, with eloquent writing mixed with portions that are less successful. The work gradually won me over as a read into it. This book will be of greatest interest to readers with a strong passion for Kerouac who have read, for example, \\"On the Road\\", \\"The Dharma Bums\\" and \\"Tristessa\\". These three novels are all available in the Library of America's excellent volume of Kerouac's novels.Jack Kerouac: Road Novels 1957-1960: On the Road / The Dharma Bums / The Subterraneans / Tristessa / Lonesome Traveler / Journal Selections (Library of America)Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This is the one novel by Jack that scares the S**t out of me.

In a way, I think he was a latter-day Thoreau, both structurally (we did this and then we did that)and philosophically (y'all be cool, now) all bracketed by minute observations. I think this novel brings him full circle in a quest for spirituality (or confrontation with it). All his novels I have read (count 'em on one hand) and his poetry are excellent.

Though Kerouac is \\"depressed\\" through most of the book, sickened by the people and places and travel which he once found so necessary, he finds mental respite in his mother and her unconditionally warm spirit, among other things. Another point which Kerouac strives to raise is religion. Though he and his friends more oft than not live a wild and consumptive life, Jack still remains devoted to the idea of God and the genuine goodness of people. This book, just as all Kerouac novels, describes life with a wide-eyed vivacity unlike anything I've ever read, if only in a less sunny way."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"generation in Desolation Angels.

Its no wonder Kerouac became thesymbol of the Beat generation for millions of kats in the 50's,for even today his writing is hep, and inciteful. He couldvery easily be an icon for generations to come."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I live two counties south of Desolation Peak six miles below the U.S./Canadian border in Washington State. When I learned Jack Kerouac spent sixty-five days manning the peak's fire lookout in 1956 and wrote about his experiences there, I wanted to read them. Desolation Angels is Kerouac's account of his time in the rugged North Cascades, but I found the book to be much, much more than that.For the reader who expects to read about fire lookout culture, routines, and working for the U.S. Forest Service, as I did, Desolation Angels is a letdown. Of the six chapters in the two section format, only the first couple address Kerouac's impressions and experiences of his time on Desolation Peak and the North Cascades Wilderness. Although the \\"Beat\\" author stated the motive for his remote summer employment was to have a \\"spiritual\\" adventure--come down from the mountain an enlightened man--he intended to be paid for his time and to use this pay to fund further adventures in the country and abroad. Aside from Kerouac's frequent stare-downs with Mt. Hozomeen, participation in shortwave chatter, and a night spent recording lightning strikes, most of \\"Desolation in Solitude\\" is a lament about how he yearns to \\"...go where there's lamps and telephones, and rumpled couches with women on them, where there're rich thick rugs for toes, where the drama rages all unthinking for after all would That-Which-Passes--Through-Everything ask for one or the other?--What'm I gonna do with snow...?\\" The second chapter, \\"Desolation in the World,\\" shares his return to the world from the wilderness. Once off the mountain, Kerouac sets out to travel and seek those adventures he fantasized about during his sixty-five days on Desolation Peak: first to San Francisco, then Mexico City, off to New York, and finally abroad to Tangiers, Paris, and London.Much of the book is written in typical Kerouac stream of consciousness style--as if James Joyce had converted to Buddhism. His mystic, frenetic musings leave the reader breathless and puzzled at times, but in the midst of these bursts of \\"enlightenment,\\" Kerouac's \\"imaginary gardens,\\" (in the words of poet Marianne Moore) have \\"real toads\\" in them, stories that reveal Kerouac's true self, his insightful profiles of friends and adventures:the author's killing of a mouse in his lookout cabin, the Mexican City brothel and the fourteen year-old prostitute who charges him three pesos for her services, his description of and relationship with the beautiful Alyce Newman, the author \\"Bull\\" Hubbard, the nightspots of San Francisco and New York, the \\"jazz\\" joints, the exotic ambience of Morocco and Tangiers, and concludes the book with a narrative of the trip cross country with his mother as he moves her from Florida to Berkeley.What makes Desolation Angels a novel, I'm not sure. Kerouac's Buddhist ramblings, perhaps? The characters' \\"fictional\\" names? To me, the book is a thinly veiled cosmopolitan \\"On the Road\\": Cody Pomeray is Neal Cassady, the Beat gang's savant chauffeur; Irwin Garden, Allen Ginsburg (his book of poetry \\"Howling\\"); Raphael, the poet Gregory Corso; Bull Hubbard, William Burroughs (\\"The Nude Supper?\\"); Julien, Lucius Carr. The author's girlfriend Alyce Newman is the Joyce Johnson whose introduction is included in this edition. And Jack Duluoz is Kerouac himself.Kerouac saved the best of Desolation Angels for last. In the book's final pages the author's moving portrayal of his mother (Memere) during their cross country trip to Berkeley is most telling and reveals a devoted, loving son whose prodigal behavior and capricious peregrinations riddle him with guilt. What mother's son hasn't at times felt the same way?"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.\\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on one of Jack Kerouac's major works, \\"Desolation Angels\\", essentially a series of \`real world' job-related reflections on his time as a forest ranger in Washington state, and his subsequent \\"decompression\\" from that isolating job by travel abroad and in America with his mother in his well known spontaneous writing method at a time when he was trying to keep body and soul together, that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of Kerouac's better known works dedicated to Lowell's \`bad boy', the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers\\".And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \\"On The Road\\", his classic modern physical and literary \`search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \\"The Legend Of Duluoz\\". That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of his book of essays \\"Desolation Angels\\".Sometimes one, including a frustrated writer like Kerouac who was on to something but could not get published in the early 1950s, just has to get away from it all. And what better job that a ranger in a far off mountain range where one can think, save money, and contemplate the nature of the universe. For a while at least. Then, a social being like Kerouac (at that time) needs to get back to civilization. In this case the \\"wilds\\" of San Francisco then to Europe and North Africa. And then, along the way, has to under some mysterious internal compulsion has to fulfill his self-appointed obligation to take care of \`mere\\" (his mother) by transporting her across the country by bus to start a new life. That is the outline of the mental and physical travelogue that Kerouac, a master of this kind of descriptive writing, takes us on. In addition there are cameo appearances by many of the \\"regular\\" who we have come to know through this \\"Legend\\" saga, including the above-mentioned Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady. This one rates just below \\"On The Road\\"."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Desolation Angels is a sentimental story which takes place in the time leading up to On The Road being released.

Kerouac wasn't that great an experimental novelist, or at least not as graceful with spontaneous prose and extra-sensory perceptive description as his pier William S. Burroughs, as exemplified by the book's more incoherent and often undermanaged meanderings. As a piece of creative autobiography, however, the novel is a symbolic giant of originality, fearlessly defying traditional literary convention and organization.

This little book is GREAT and one of my most very favorite. Go for it."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I had followed this book's program for many years quite happily and successfully. For some odd reason, one trip I decided that maybe it was all just a coincidence and I really was in no danger of being jetlagged. So I didn't bother. What a big mistake! I was groggy and confused for days. Never again!One tip: Instead of taking the book with you, copy the pages for your particular trip's time zones and keep them in your carry-on bag. There are a couple of procedures you need to follow at precise times.Definitely worth the little bit of discipline for three days."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"After getting ill from jet lag after my first international business trip I stumbled upon this book. In using the guidelines Ehret recommends, my second trip was nearly jet lag free. I've used this for over ten years and now recommend the book in my international business classes I teach. Hey, great little book with big impact at less than the price of a steak dinner! What a deal!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I have used this book for 10 years and given away more copies as gifts than I can count, today is another one. Friends have ridiculed me for it but it doesn't get any easier than this. Buy this and have fun seeing the new country you are visiting while your friends are busy in recovery."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"we have used this book and the method for more than 20 years - with children from infant to adult age! You actually start following this method 3 days before your departure. It truely works!The first few pages explain how your body works, how caffein works, and how that can be used to overcome jet lag. The next 80 same pages you look up the individual time zones that apply to your trip. That's where you find the diet schedule for your personal trip. In the back you find several pages of food items and sample menues, that allow you to put your diet together according to your own tastes. Overcoming jet lag with this guide is EASY. No other supplements are neccessary!I'm buying several books, so I can give it to our international visitors!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"We have followed this Jet Lag diet for about 5 years now. We combine it with the NO-Jet Lag homeopathic remedy. We never have more than one day of slight jet lag. Interestingly, the airlines seem to use the jet lag diet strategy in the meals they serve on the plane--at least in business class."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Having used this for a round trip of UK to Australia and back via Bangkok (out) and Hong Kong (back)all the space of 12 days, I can promise you it works. My son, travelling with me, didn't follow it properly and suffered but I arrived back in the UK at 6:00am and was in the office, alert, later the same day."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"My husband and I have used the recommended program for overcoming jet lag on two trips from the US, first to the former Soviet Union a few years ago, and then just last month to South Asia. On the first trip, we were adjusted within 36 hours, this time, almost immediately! And we were well-adjusted coming home this time too!The changes in diet take some work, especially when returning, but they are well worth the effort!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"If you have to travel across several time zones and must attend an 8 AM meeting on the day following your travel, this book is for YOU! I have used this book for years. I buy copies to give to friends or relatives who are traveling. It REALLY works! Friends have used it to travel to Europe, China, or just across the U.S. It is easy to do, just look up the number of time zones you are traveling across and go to the appropriate chapter. It tells you how to change your &quot;body clock&quot; so that you are on LOCAL TIME by the time you arrive at your destination. You need to change your diet and stop drinking coffee 3 days prior to traveling, but it is well worth it. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Buy it, put it into your reference collection and don't forget about it when you travel! Great gift idea for friends who travel!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Excellent book for overcoming jet lag. I used it on a 7 day work trip to Malaysia, which is 13 hours time difference from home. The program helped immensely for adjusting to jet lag both upon arrival in Malaysia and when returning home. It is an easy program to follow and makes a lot of sense. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I recommend this book to all my sleep-deprived customers. Jet lag is NOT inevitable. In an easy to follow program Ehret shows how you can beat nature at its own game through the judicious use of food, light and exercise. The best purchase a regular traveller can make."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I've followed the advice in this book for numerous trips to Japan and Korea. It really works - I rarely have trouble with jet lag. The advice they give is not gimmicky or based on folklore. It's a matter of changing your behavior and diet a few days before you leave, and during the initial adjustment. Especially important is start acting like you're on destination time as soon as you get on the plane - just the opposite of what the airlines do. The authors explain about what is actually going on it your body as it tries to adjust. I've found their method is simple, easy and understandable."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I began using this system in 1986, based on an earlier version of this book. I've used it repeatedly on trips to Europe and Asia, and I've been able to make the best use of my first day at my destination every time. On the few occasions when I couldn't use this system (due to sudden unexpected trips), I found out how debilitating jet lag can be... like having a case of the flu, I was just &quot;out of it&quot; for a couple of days!I've given copies of this book to many friends and business associates over the years, and all have praised the results!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Over the past year, business trips have taken me around the world, with jet lag as my constant travel companion. Not anymore! I tried the program on a recent trip to Europe and experienced virtually no jet lag. After an all night flight and 7 hour time zone change, I was able to work immediately upon landing at my destination and felt great. The book will go with me now whenever I travel abroad."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Although I don't make long flights often, when I do I have used the authoritative Overcoming Jet Lag program for many years. Since it is a bit of a nuisance (requiring some discipline to start and follow the diet 3-4 days in advance) I keep my eyes out for a simple pill. Meanwhile, where I used to be zonked for about one day per time zone, now I've found I'm a bit groggy but fully functional the first day, then completely void of symptoms after that. It works. Reassuring is the technical explanation for each feature of the program -- not hype."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I used this plan for 3/4 international trips and it really works! I have always been very sensitive to even minor time zone changes and I generally need at least 6.5 hours sleep to feel pretty good - 8-9 hours is ideal. When I first heard about this plan, I figured the best it could do for me was to prevent me from feeling really lousy for the entire trip. Instead, I felt great! In 2/3 cases, I arrived at the destination in the morning and went right into a full day of work without any loss of energy. Further, it did not come back and bite me the next day or the day after. The time change became a 'non-event'. The one time I did not use the plan, I felt lousy for at least 3 days. I highly recommend this to any one who will be changing time zones as a part of their business or vacation travel! It's become a part of my travel ritual."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"I have used the program detailed in this succint little book for 10 years now, beginning with a trip from Los Angeles to Thailand. After following the program and flying for what seemed like days, I arrived at midnight. The following morning I was fully functional and alert at 10 am and suffered no symptoms. I recently used the program for a trip to London and back with no appreciable jet lag. The book explains in very simple terms how our body clocks work, and how modern studies have learned how to reset them quickly and easily with a minimum of deleterious effect. One starts the program from 1 to 3 days prior to travel, and much of the book is filled with detailed instructions for each time zone interval. It does take discipline to adhere to the program while on the plane, but with a little effort it can be done and the result is definately worth it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who travels by air. It will make your journey far more enjoyable and you will have more time to enjoy your stay instead of recovering from jet lag for days. A must read for business travelers as well."},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"We have been traveling overseas an average of once per year for the last 20 years. We started using an earlier version of the book 15 years ago, and we won't leave home without it. Even when we don't follow the &quot;rules&quot; religiously, we still arrive ready to do &quot;time battle&quot; within a day or two. For folks on a short 3-5 day trip to Europe or beyond, this book is a MUST. The folks on the airlines will look at you strangely when you ask for two cups of coffee and then insist on going to sleep right away (eastbound) with no dinner, but trust me, it works. Why waste the first day of your vacation in London, Paris, or Rome sleeping?"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Last month, I traveled 9 time zones west to Asia for a week trip. Then after being back in Colorado for 2 weeks, I flew 8 time zones east for a 5 day trip. Normally, I would be wasted most of the month, but after using the plan laid out in this book, I was alert during the day and sleep most of the nights. It didn't totally negate jet-lag but my recovery was shorter. I would give it a 5 star rating but the diet lists some rather random foods and like possum and racoon. What are they thinking someone is flying on Ozark Airlines? If I ate that stuff I would have more problems than just jet lag!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","review":"Concise yet detailed book outlines a highly effective program to beat jet lag, no matter how many time zones you may be crossing, no matter what time of day or night you are traveling.Basic theory behind the program is described well, but most of this nice, short book is a full how-to for every possible flight... time zones involved, direction of flight.Reader simply looks up the schedule that best describes upcoming flight, and follows the instructions. But don't do this at the airport the day of the flight. Diet must be altered three days in advance of travel.My family and I have been using this for 15 years, and we swear by it. The only time it hasn't worked for me is when I've tried to cheat the system (watched an in-flight movie when the book said I was supposed to be sleeping, that sort of thing).Unfortunately, most airlines do all they can to keep passengers stuck in their departure time zone (ensuring days of jet lag for all), but this book shows how necessary it is to board the plane and get right into the arrival time zone. It does take a sense of discipline to follow the program while in flight. In general the flight is not particularly enjoyable if you're following the program and are therefore out of sync with all the other passengers, BUT if you are a business traveler or don't have the luxury of wasting several days, you will find that the short-lived discomfort is insignificant!A highly useful book for the international business traveler... would make a nice gift for someone going off on a round-the-world or other long flight. (But give it well in advance of the travel)!"},{"Title":"Myth and Christianity; an Inquiry Into the Possibility of Religion Without Myth","review":"Modernity was a troubling thing for those who had to live through it. Pure, objective, unassailable science was quickly supplanting religious ideas, and paring those ideas down to what they were - mere myths perpetrated on us by those who wanted to exert social and cultural control. Or at least this was the conclusion reached by many who, with the advent of a new way of approaching universal truth, now wanted nothing to do with that old-time religion. But not everyone felt the same way. This very short book introduces the thought of Rudolph Bultmann, one of the leading German theologians of the early twentieth century and proponent of \\"demythologization,\\" and Karl Jaspers, the well-known German existentialist and philosopher. First, there is a very capable introduction by R. Joseph Hoffmann, followed by an opening statement by Jaspers, a reply by Bultmann, and then a closing reply by Jaspers. Jaspers and Bultmann both being dyed-in-the-wool Heideggerians, it is interesting to read about their intellectual justifications regarding the respective virtues and weaknesses of hermeneutics as applied to religious myth.As I mentioned earlier, toward the latter part of Bultmann's career, he started to talk about something called demythologization, in which he attempts to divest religious meaning and intent from the original myths in which they are couched. For Bultmann, the Ascension and the Virgin Birth (just to name two highly representative religious myths) mean something, but the fact that the religious content is ensconced in the language of the miraculous is a serious stumbling block for the modern man whose mind has come to see the miracle as ridiculous and impossible. Therefore, these myths need to be reconfigured - divested - of their Biblical form and given a structure which is makes getting at their meaning and significance possible for someone living in the twentieth century.Jaspers, however, sees the element of myth as indispensable from the content of religious belief itself. Jaspers claims that \\"reading\\" these myths without their mythical structures is impossible. He rejects the idea that any religion can be understood apart from its mythical origins. The topology of the origins themselves, he argues, is essential to our understanding. Religious myths are not there to provide us with a decoding project; their cutting away cannot happen without the simultaneous disappearance of any possibility of a religious message. Myth is, for Jaspers, das Umgreifende (the Great Encompassing) by and through which we can escape the worn dualities of subjectivity and objectivity, and achieve a sort of transcendence.Jaspers saw Bultmann's project of demythologization as a sanitizing one, one that failed to understand myth as an essential vehicle for apprehending and describing the transcendent. Jaspers comes close to the one that Northrop Frye constructs in \\"The Great Code: The Bible and Literature,\\" in which he suggests that modern attempts to read the Bible are often foiled because we no longer read and write in the mythical; rather, he thinks, following Vico's tripartite theory of language, that our system of writing has since taken on empirical, positivistic concerns. While Frye thinks that one cannot read the Bible without myth since it is written in myth, Jaspers respects the mythic, and asserts that the religious person must come to terms with it. Jaspers accuses Bultmann of a scientism which sees itself as being responsible for not be accused of foolish mythologies.I would like to include a word about the construction and editing of the book itself. It has a wonderful introduction by R. Joseph Hoffmann which provides one of the greatest contexts and explanations of the rise of liberal theology in the nineteenth century. However, Jaspers' first parry in the conversation includes a lot of material from his Existenzphilosophie which is completely unnecessarily for the overall understanding of the text and the content of the argument at hand. This part of the text includes explanation the reader could have done without, like \\"We cannot think unless something becomes an object for us. To be conscious means to live in that clarity which is made possible by the split between I and the object. But it also means to live within the walls constituted by the split between the I and something known to be an object.\\" And so on. If this language had been excised, the book would have made its argument in tighter, more cogent terms. Also, of the 88 pages devoted to the back-and-forth of Bultmann and Jaspers, Bultmann is allotted a grand total of 12 pages, which makes me think the editor may have had a slight bias. In any case, the substance of the debate is fascinating, but these weak points to detract from the overall rating. I would recommend a close examination of these ideas for anyone interested in the shapes and trends of liberal theology in the twentieth century, but one can probably find another publication whose editor is less clumsy in communicating them."},{"Title":"Myth and Christianity; an Inquiry Into the Possibility of Religion Without Myth","review":"Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was a German theologian and professor of New Testament at the University of Marburg. He was the author of many influential books, such asThe History of the Synoptic Tradition,Jesus and the Word, etc. Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) was a German psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher, who wrote many important books such asPhilosophy of Existence (Works in Continental Philosophy),Way to Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy, Second Edition (Yale Nota Bene), etc.The translator notes, \\"The essay 'Myth and Religion' by Dr. Jaspers ... was later published (in 1953)... Bultmann's reply first appeared (in 1954)... Dr. Jaspers' rejoinder was first published in an open letter...\\"Jaspers argues, \\"It we forget that myth is also a code language, a cipher, it loses all reference to transcendence, it becomes mere tangible presence.\\" (Pg. 14) He suggests that Bultmann \\"alternates between empirical, philological exegesis and a theological appropriation of religion. The two opposing goals, which are the historical investigation of religion and the primary comprehension of faith, do not add up to a convincing statement, but rather collapse for lack of tension and clarity.\\" (Pg. 28)Bultmann replied, \\"(Jaspers) is as convinced as I am that a corpse cannot come back to life or rise from the grave, that there are no demons and no magic causality. But how am I, in my capacity as pastor, to explain, in my sermons and classes, texts dealing with the Resurrection of Jesus in the flesh, with demons, or with magic causality? And how am I, in my capacity as theological scholar, to guide the pastor in his task by my interpretation?... When (Jaspers) says that the redemptive history... must 'be tested existentially and judged on the basis of ... the truth that arises from it in the reality of life,' I can only reply to such a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\" (Pg. 60-61)Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\"you do not go far enough... I assay the differences between us in terms of the opposition between liberalism and orthodoxy, and I conclude that your position can be defined as orthodox. The actual meaning of my lecture, however, was to asert the rights of philosophy.\\" (Pg. 72) He concludes, \\"The greatness of Protestantism... achieves reality only in exceptional individuals... who translate into action the great moral earnestness... inherent in this faith... I see hope in the liberal faith... which as such is capable of transforming the Biblical faith in all its manifestations.\\" (Pg. 114-115)Although one suspects that the two protagonists are often missing the other's point, this still a fascinating interplay between these two thinkers."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"If you haven't read the Master Li series, I definitely recommend starting with The Bridge of Birds and proceeding from there. These are wonderful, all-consuming books that you will reader faster and with more interest than anything you've yet encountered.Mr. Hughart possesses an imagination that is both rich and diverse, and blends this with a wonderful ability to tell \\"one helluva good yarn!\\"Once you've tried one of his books and discovered how good they are, I highly recommend checking out the (un)official Barry Hughart web site ... Drop Jerry a line and see if we can convince Mr. Hughart to publish more of his material!"},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"How easily Chinese history (that never was) segues into mythology. \\"Eight Skilled Gentlemen\\" is the third book in the 'Master Li and Number Ten Ox' trilogy, and these books should be near the top of everyone's favorite fantasies list.The execrable villain, Sixth Degree Hosteler Tu is on the execution block at the beginning of \\"Eight Skilled Gentlemen.\\" The executioner, who is going for the record in cleanly-performed beheadings by sword, botches this particular job for a very peculiar reason--a vampire ghoul crashes into the crowd around the execution block in pursuit of a band of frightened band of soldiers.This is just the beginning of a bizarre monster-fest (in case you were wondering who the eight skilled gentlemen were.) These are demons like you've never seen before. For instance, the first demon-deity \\"resembles a three-year-old child with red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair, and it kills by forcing its victims to strangle themselves.\\"Luckily Master Li happens upon Number Ten Ox before he finishes choking himself to death.The plot is quite complicated, but the exotic settings and oddball characters kept this reader mightily entertained. In addition to the 'Eight Skilled Gentlemen,' there is a very old, partially deaf Celestial Master and saint who has some of the best lines in the book: at the funeral of a demon-slain high muckety-muck minister of state, he glares at a row of tight-lipped mandarins, and shouts, \\"Damn fools!...If you'd given Ma's corpse an enema you could have buried what remained in a walnut shell!\\"Chinese saints seem to be much more opinionated and interesting than their European counterparts.Master Li and Number Ten Ox join up with a puppeteer and his beautiful daughter to break up a ring of mandarin smugglers who are using mysterious cages to communicate with one another. The story finally resolves itself in a wild end-of-the-world dragon boat race that pits our two heroes against the gods.I only wish Barry Hughart had continued on with this eccentric and wonderful myth of old China."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"this book weaves a tale of mystery, and there is no end to the amazing supries of Master Li's wit one of the best books i ever read"},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I have loved Mr Hugharts books more than any I've ever read. I do have a question and I hope someone knows the answer. Where is Mr. Hughart? Why hasn't he written something new? I'm always on the search for a book he's written. A talent like his needs to live on."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"Once again, Hughart has written an entertaining, humorous and engaging tale filled with history, tradition, intrigue, mystery and of course, a plethora of outlandish characters. Having read the first two books in the series, I found this to be less enjoyable than the others; the first is still the best of the three. That doesn't mean this is bad, however - I just don't think it's as good as the other two. This one goes a bit overboard in parts, such as the scene where they're disposing of a corpse by turning it into an extravagant banquet and serving it to the guests - humorous, but a bit over the top.As a student of Chinese history, I am enthralled by stories, facts and traditions from the earliest of Chinese civilizations - such as the Shang, Xia, and earlier Neolithic and prehistoric cultures. While this book is set in 7th century China, it references the pre-\\"Chinese\\" China. In fact, the main plot centers around events that took place prior to China becoming China. The intertwining of tales and customs from \\"modern\\" (A.D. 640) China with those from three thousand years earlier is very intriguing. But, I must add, I also found it confusing at times with so many characters, events and stories. Hughart has a great gift for inventing stories, but in trying to convey all that to the reader, I must admit he lost me now and again.As with the previous two books, this one tends to be a bit crass in places, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers. But the story really is fascinating and Hughart continually throws in enough facts with the fantasy that it's also quite educational."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"Mr. Hughart's first novel Bridge of Birds captured my fancy. I had no idea he had written two other novels until I happened upon them on line. Of course I immediately purchased them and I am glad. They were good, yet his first was the best to my mind. The products came on time and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I've held on to my paperback copy of this book for 20 years. I reread it every couple of years, and am happy once again to watch the magic happen. Ancient Chinese myths come to life, along with rascals, palace intrigue, beautiful maidens (and some who you don't turn your back on!.) Very few fantasy books reach this level of creativity and surprise, plus excellent plot and pace. Find this book, read it, and you'll be pleased."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"Uproariously funny in places. Does an outstanding job of blending Chinese mythology with a detective case. The characters are splendid rogues. It's a shame Hughart only wrote three books. I would have loved to see more from his pen."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"\\"Eight Skilled Gentleman\\" is a damned good read. Mr. Hughart is one of the absolute best story tellers-ever. His 3rd book in the series, I strongly recommend you read all of them, may not be as beautiful as the 1st story \\"Bridge of Birds\\", but he sure packs a lot of fantastic minutae into this one. As always Number 10 Ox plays fall guy to Master Li, our ancient sluth. There are so many twists and turns along with mythical allusions in this book as in the other two stories, that you wonder if it will be tied up in a big bow @ the end, and yes, it is. Lots of sinology, or neo-sinology along the way. Oh, if only there were more adventures. Lovely writing, lots of humanistic touches, and jibes @ Confucianism. Sly irony with a light touch."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I wanted to give this novel more than three stars, but I couldn't work up the enthusiasm. Maybe the problem lies in my expectations. After reading and loving Bridge of Birds, I looked forward to the Story of the Stone and Eight Skilled Gentlemen as the second and third books of a trilogy. I expected the second two books to grow from the delightful beginnings of the original. Instead, they are the second and third books in an aborted series, trying to repeat the performance of the incomparable first.Eight Skilled Gentlemen contains many of the same ingredients that made Bridge of Birds so successful: the wonderful setting in mystical ancient China, the mixture of mystery with fantasy, and the two wonderful heroes. But Barry Hughart offers the same dish to us rewarmed, without adding anything new. For better or for worse, this is Yet Another episode in the Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox. For what it's worth, it's better than the Story of the Stone."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"Here's what the book does have: gruesome murders, homosexuality, cannibalism, and an incoherent ending.And here's what it doesn't have: an interesting plot, well-developed characters, or an ending that doesn't make the reader regret not having tossed the book out after the first chapter."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"The following interview with Barry Hughart was conducted via mail during January-February, 2000. --J. KuntzJK: All fans of the Master Li books want to know why the series stopped after Eight Skilled Gentlemen. Can you explain?BH: The Master Li books were a tightrope act and hard to write, but not, alas, very remunerative. Still, I would have continued as originally planned if I'd had a supportive publisher: seven novels ending with my heroes' deaths in the battle with the Great White Serpent, and their elevation to the Great River of Stars as minor deities guaranteed to cause the August Personage of Jade almost as much trouble as the Stone Monkey. Unfortunately I had St. Martins, which didn't even bother to send a postcard when I won the World Fantasy Award; Ballantine, which was dandy until my powerhouse editor dropped dead and her successors forgot my existence; and Doubleday, which released The Story of the Stone three months before the pub date, guaranteeing that not one copy would still be on the shelves when reviews came out, published the hardcover and the paperback of Eight Skilled Gentlemen simultaneously, and then informed me they would bring out further volumes in paperback only, meriting, of course, a considerably reduced advance."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"This is the last book released by Mr. Hughart. It was supposed to be the third in a series of seven, but due to compensation differences, he elected not to continue writing. It's a darn shame because his novels of a China that never was are truly wonderful. The third adventure of Master Li and Number Ten Ox involves murder, mayhem, and magic aplenty, with lots of Chinese literary references thrown in. Almost makes you believe you're reading history. This story is not quite up to the same standards as his first two, but it's a matter of interpretation. I love his work and I really wish he'd start writing again."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I love all three Master Li and Number Ten Ox novels, but Eight Skilled Gentlemen is my personal favorite. This book is one to savor, from the hilarious opening chapter at a public execution to the thrilling race between the dragonboats. I join the thousands of Barry Hughart fans in *imploring* him to please publish another Master Li novel!"},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I have written about Barry Hughart before ('Bridge of Birds') and how much I enjoyed his mock Chinese, tongue-in-cheek writing. This is the third novel (and the last) in his series about Number Ten Ox and Master Li, detectives, trouble-shooters, and general mischief-makers. The middle volume, 'The Story of the Stone,' is not presently in print, although chances of finding it used are still good.The two find themselves in attendance at the Peking execution day, where the current royal execution is going for a record 1,071 clean decapitations. At the very last moment, a vampire ghoul makes a daytime appearance in hot pursuit of the city guard. This causes the Devil's Hand to miss his stroke, and Master Li jumps at the opportunity to investigate. Finding that one of the vampire's victims appears to be an august resident of the Forbidden City, Master Li confronts the Celestial Master (the wisest Confucian in the realm) and is invited to investigate what appears to be an impossible series of events.Befriending a roving puppeteer and his beautiful daughter, Master Li and Number Ten chase across China looking for clues in what appears to be a complex smuggling plot that uses magical, golden cages as telephones. However, the cages are more than etheric portables, and the present holders of them keep meeting horrible fates at the hands of weird monsters and an ape. Who these creatures are, the purpose of the cages, and what any of this has to do with the annual Death Birds Ghost Boat Rain Race are the mysteries that Master Li has to solve.This is a plot that sends the reader careening across the pages like a pinball in a bumper factory. The sense of the tale is always just beyond the reader's grasp as Hughart unfolds Number Ten's narrative at high pace. Readers who relish an orderly progression of development and characters that make dependable sense may find this a bit unsatisfactory. Hughart seems determined to exceed the more controlled chaos of 'Bridge of Birds' and this is not all for the good. I found the confusion a bit too ... confusing.This is more of a burlesque, compared to Kai Lung's wry sarcasm, but it still works. Beware taking the plot for granted, since almost nothing is really what it seems. Hughart's ability to make impossible characters work is undeniable, and he has either a vivid imagination or access to a large collection of Chinese myths. While this tale is not up to the standards of 'Bridge of Birds' it is still a genuinely enjoyable read. And a pleasant change of pace for people for those who spend too much time with weightier tomes."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"The third and final published tale of Master Li and his assistant, Number Ten Ox, is both funny and wistful. If the components of Hughart's ancient mythical China are by now familiar to readers, they are still wonderfully vivid. In this tale Master Li and Ox become entangled with high-society scams and the ghostly remnants of a shamanistic theology predating Chinese civilization. The book lacks the sheer creative majesty of Hughart's first book, the Bridge of Birds; but Birds is a virtuoso performance that can hardly be expected twice in a lifetime. Eight Skilled Gentlemen is, by comparison, merely an excellent story.This is the third book in an intended series of seven, which most regrettably was not completed. As such, Eight Skilled Gentlemen was not intended as the final Master Li story, and we are left waiting for the next marvelous case. Hughart apparently intended to conclude the series in traditional Chinese mythological fashion, by deifying his truth-seeking protagonists. He never wrote that story, but the extraordinary Li Kao and Number Ten Ox have achieved a form of immortality just the same. They are just as vivid in the final book as in the first two, and I deeply regret not having the chance to invite them over for a jar of wine or two."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"I read Bridge of Birds when it first appeared in 1984 (and I believe that title won the World Fantasy Award) and was, like all his other readers, captivated. The Story of the Stone followed with equal success. Eight Skilled Gentlemen was the third of the Master Li stories (and appears to be the last to date). It follows much the same path as the previous books - spoof Chinese mythology turns out not be quite so mythological after all, and Number Ten Ox gets to play Watson again - never quite as stupid as he appears, but nothing compared to the brilliant deductions of Master Li. What is the secret behind the wicker cages? Where does the puppetmaster and his beautiful daughter come from? Where does fake Imperial Tea fit into the plot? As usual, Hughart weaves a marvellous tapestry and wraps you in a fantasy world that is extremely real. Read it, if you get the opportunity. I cannot believe this book is out-of-print!

The grisly murder of a prominent mandarin by a mysterious ghoul provides the catalyst for this duo to go delving into China's ancient mythology searching for the answers. Along the way, author Barry Hughart creates some of the most curious and imaginative heroes and villains you will ever encounter. Just superb.Sadly, as noted by previous reviewers, this is the third and last book that the author has written in this series.

After gobbling up his three hilarious books on Master Li and Number 10 Ox, I have seen no more from him for scads of years! Mr Hughart, if you are reading this ... hop to it!

As with the Bridge of Birds and The Story of the Stone, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"In this, the final of Hughart's three Master Li books, we learn about ancient shamanistic deities and the homicidal Sixth Degree Hosteler Tu. The twists and turns are a little less surprising in this third outing, and even Number Ten Ox guesses the identity of the villain before the end. But the journey is just as magical and wonderful. Hughart has a gift for being able to tweak his cosmology - or our perceptions of it - ever so slightly, without damaging the integrity of his world. This wasn't supposed to be the last book, but since the esteemed Master Hughart has apparently set aside his labors, we can only savor the bittersweet ending of a series not halfway done. The Master Li series is in a class of its own, and I fervently pray against all odds that another volume of these 'long-lost chronicles' will eventually come to light."},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","review":"Barry Hughart's Master Li may have a slight flaw in his character, but the three novels he appears in have no flaws (except maybe they aren't durable enough.

Nothing will change until they do.-Paradigm[...]"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"White Like Me tells the story of race through the privileges of a white anti-racist activist Tim Wise. Wise goes through six phases of explaining the complexity of race and white privilege: born to belonging, privilege, resistance, collaboration, loss, and redemption. The book takes the reader through the journey of his work and life, and successfully illuminates many race issues that white Americans have blinded themselves to. Tim Wise opens the blinds on racist ideas and white privilege to leave white Americans to step into the light and face the destruction that racism has created in our society.Born to belonging expresses the intricate web of white privilege that is in every white persons life. If you have the right skin color you will be handed certain privileges without question. Whites experience race everyday because of \\"advantages, privileges, and belonging\\" that are handed to us (3). Tim Wise explains that in every instance of his life he has gotten where he is today because of privilege. White people who think they don't experience race they really do. The mere instance that they have never met a person of a different race is experiencing race itself! Everything happens for a reason in our country based on race. It influences where we live, who we know, where we go to school, and what jobs we get. Born to belonging shows that experiencing race is inevitable in our society. It makes no difference whether you are among the white privileged or the oppressed blacks because its forces are continually occurring. Whites are no longer bystanders in the fight against racism because the excuses of lack of experience are a lie. Everyone experiences race whether it is privilege or racism itself.Wise does an exceptional job explaining the tangled web of white privilege in society, and the second chapter privilege backs up his claims with several examples. He really hits home the message of the privilege he is talking about with his experiences.One of the best examples I believe is his insight on race and the attack of 9/11. Whites felt that they had been attacked for who they were and Wise states that, \\"lots of non-white folks know what it means to be attacked for who they are [and] what it's like to be terrorized\\"(58). Whites have been fed lies about America and it's greatness. The only people that it is great for are whites. Wise sheds light on the absurdity of some people's false reality. In a twisted way he writes their ignorance as almost amusing. It is nothing of the sort however because they are completely oblivious to the reality before them. The reality wasn't clear to me before reading the novel, but pointing out my denial of it has shown me my ignorance. We really have been led to believe that America is a grand country, a land of the free. There is no freedom for the non-whites because their struggle with race is constant.After being confronted with reality that racism isn't a thing of the past, Wise offers the path of resistance. It isn't easy to resist racism and a society that is based on your privileges, but it is our power to stand up for what is right. White Americans have power over non-whites because people take what we say on the subject as legitimate. After confronting the reality of white privilege there is no turning back.Tim Wise points out an important point that \\"people of color, as always, will pretty much take care of themselves\\"(98). Tim Wise does such an excellent job pointing out that African Americans don't need to be taken care of by us. People who do resistance for the simple pat on the back and to ease their guilt are wrong. Non-whites owe us nothing for our anti-racist work. We should be doing it to eliminate the \\"evil\\" in our community and fight the urge to collaborate. People should be on the path to resistance because it is the right thing to do, and not just to make ourselves feel better.Racism is not only doing harm to non-whites, but also to white Americans as well. Americans struggle to keep our white privilege because it allows us to never be on the receiving end of suffering. The gain of having power over people below us comes with costs. Wise explains the harm of these costs like, \\"internalized racist beliefs turning us into people we're not, [...] white privilege blinders whites to real dangers and makes us less safe, [...] loss of our actual ethnic and national heritages is painful\\" (146). The willingness to accept these costs just to maintain privilege is absurd. We need to fight to keep our resistance at all costs. This fight is hard though because we've been conditioned in society to have an internal bias. It is important to remember that the fight of resistance in our internal racial bias is constant, and we just have to keep beating it back.Tim Wise, and White Like Me, has allowed me to take off the blinders that I've had on. Never before have I realized the strong influences of white privilege in society. America is in a dire need for people to choose the path of resistance in the injustice of racism. Racial injustice in our society isn't going to disappear easily, but it is the mindset of people who chose resistance that can make a little difference."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"A truly insighful work of writing by Tim Wise.

Very thought provoking and challenging.

The fact that whites have been, and are currently, very successful even in countries that we never conquered (e.g., China and Japan), is proof of this.As a matter of fact, whites are even more successful in today's China than we are in the West, where we are in the majority, where we supposedly have \\"privilege\\". Indeed, in recent years, many talented whites have left the West; left democracy, their \\"rights\\", and their supposed \\"privilege\\" behind for a life in \\"authoritarian\\" China, and have indeed succeeded in China to a much greater degree than in their former countries.Why is this? It is because today's West, far from \\"privileging\\" us, is fiercely egalitarian, democratic, and is built upon a narrative of victimhood, and thus seeks to punish the skilled and talented in favor of bums and ne'er-do-wells. 300 years ago, the West's victimhood narrative said that the \\"common man\\" was a victim of his lord and his king. Now that the mobs have overthrown the kings and lords, the West's new victimhood narrative is that the \\"brown man\\" is a victim of the \\"white man\\".But the West's system is not long for this world. Right now, we are seeing the fall of the democratic West, just like we saw the fall of the Soviet East in 1989-91. The fall of the democratic West is starting in Greece, and the other Western democracies, including America, are not far behind."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"If everyone read this book, the US would be a more empathetic place to live for everyone. we might live up to the America we would like to be"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"This product came in a timely manner, was in perfect condition, and had a great price."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I purchased Wise's book as I wanted to get familiar with the opposing viewpoint; see how the liberal mind works. I expected this to be a poorly strung together book dedicated to brainwashing opposition over to his side. In a sense, it was, but Wise presents a few very compelling arguments for his position. I had to take notes while I was reading through this, but I take issue with a few remarks that Mr. Wise notes:On page 15 Wise is speaking about his grandparents, and more to the point, the homes with which they lived, \\"they nonetheless were able to afford several nice homes, in \\"nice\\" neighborhoods, all of which had been entirely white...\\"Now I could be wrong here, but it seems to be Mr. \\"antiracist\\" is assuming that black neighborhoods are not nice. I wouldn't go as far to say this is openly racist, as it can easily be misconstrued, but it's interesting nevertheless coming from someone like him.Then in the next chapter Wise says that present day whites are guilty of benefiting from white privilege. That kind of thinking makes mind-numbing sheep out of people. Imagine if your granddad went on a killing spree and was caught and sent to prison to serve 12 life sentences. He won't live that long so all of his descendants, (meaning you) must go to prison to serve the remainder of his term. Now even the US justice system wouldn't incorporate that stupid sentence.- To quote Mr. Wise, \\"The notion of utilizing assets but not paying debts is irresponsible.\\"It sickened me how Wise asserted that teachers should get hooked up to lie detectors, and if they don't espouse a liberal ideology, they would immediately get fired and sent a powerful electric shock. These are the questions Wise would pose to teachers, then my answers:-Do you believe that some students because of race or economic status were generally less capable then other students?No, I don't believe so. I think it harder for poorer students to do as well due to lack of school supplies, and/or other commitments. But bottom line is everybody has a brain in their heads, and there's no excuse why some can't hack it and some can. It comes down to ambition.-Do you think that black or latino students are less capable of economic success then whites or Asians?No that's silly. But there's quite a difference between a black person and a ghettoized black person. Just like there's Spanish peeps and there's gangsta Hispanics. The former hasn't lost their ambition or aren't trapped in the cocoon of victimology.-Do you believe that black families place less emphasis on education that whites?Well that's a loaded question. Like I said \\"black\\" people are on par with whites; it's just ghetto blacks that don't give a crap about education, and the leftists only enable that behavior by rewarding laziness with handouts. So what incentive to they have to better themselves?Let's see, dunking a known terrorists head in water is torture, but electrocuting someone, then on top of that terminating them from their career is fine? Ok, I see now. If I were Wise I would've put that paragraph where he said that at the end of the book, opposed to on page 20, because a lot will be hesitant to continue reading after they digested that nugget of wisdom.Wise put up a pretty coherent argument about black children being aware of racism, and white children having a void in their heads about racism, until he uttered this little gem, \\"When black mothers have to teach their sons to keep both hands on the wheel if stopped by a police officer, so as not to get shot- something I have never heard a white mother speak to her son.\\" What a hyperbolic assertion there! I have never heard of a black mother saying that.Then he goes on to suggest that teachers wanted to split him and his black friends up. Ok, I can kind of see that, as it was in the 70s. But none of that would happen now. Wise is trying to use events from the past to conjure up hostilities and sentiments that racism is never going to end, and in fact, that it snowballs and gets worse.Wise so vigorously asserts that whites are ignorant to \\"white privilege\\", but at the same time, he doesn't acknowledge \\"black privilege.\\" Blacks get the same or more opportunities then whites, mostly due to the racist policy of affirmative action. Wise obviously represents the sentiments of those on the liberal side, and especially the whites, who should feel ashamed of themselves. The liberals, more to the point, the leftist whites, have been plotting and scheming the Caucasian race's downfall since the 60s. This isn't even about white vs black, (racism) which the liberals and Wise will gladly perpetuate. It's about maintaining a proud and successful culture. If you want to destroy a culture, you begin at a young age. Children's b.s. detectors aren't quite up to par as of yet, so they willfully swallow what they're being forcefed daily by the leftist media conglomerates. It all begins in school. Black children are almost always pre-determined as the \\"cool\\" kids, until proven otherwise. Hip hop and rap have infiltrated our culture so our once hardworking children, disregard work and strive to get lousy grades to \\"fit in\\" with the gangstas. Hence, when graduation arrives, and they are in the real world, they have no marketable skills in order to succeed. Hence, more and more people fill up the welfare rolls and that's more relying on the government. Rap music and the like is just 1 mechanism meant to split the white race up, so in turn we are battling against one another (liberals vs conservatives vs independents vs tea partiers vs green party vs libertarian vs communist, etc, etc, etc). We are now the most divided race on this planet, and by no means should you think this is an accident. Tim Wise is merely the messenger here, wrongfully under the impression that he's fighting for the right cause. Not unlike the terrorists who wrongfully think they are \\"freedom fighters\\" doing the work of Allah.Wise speaks about all his negative reviews on this site from Neo-Nazi's, well what does he expect to happen? Does Wise unjustifiably think he speaks for the entire white race? When one puts forward an opinion in the public domain, you are bound to get some disagreements.Wise thinks he proves racism by his little hypothetical about a pill that to anybody who doesn't already know you, will make you seem black to them. He said he never heard of a white person say that they would take it. Well Tim. Let me be the first to say I would. My friends and family would still see me as white, and my employment is pretty good, even in this lackluster economy, so I probably won't be out looking for another job in the near future. And where I work, being white is chocked full of disadvantages, and hardly any \\"white privilege\\" to speak of. So I would have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain.In this book, Wise constantly is under the impression that he is some kind of hero, or more precisely an \\"antiracist.\\" As if that's something you should strive for. Anti-racist is just a euphemism for anti-white, let's call a spade a spade here. I almost threw up in my mouth every single time Wise referred to himself or other liberals as that. It's akin to calling someone in a wheelchair a contortionist.When Wise lists some examples parents can set to teach their children to be antiwhite, he insists that parents refuse to attend a church that represents Jesus as white. Well Tim newsflash: That's just about every church in America, minus the black churches.(Do I have to remind you of Rev. Wright's fiery sermons? I guess children should be subjected to similar diatribes huh?) So, you're basically telling parents to convert to liberalism and diss God. He tells us to speak up for the racist policy of affirmative action, and to refuse jobs, no matter how lucrative they are, if you know someone (based on being white).Haha, on page 121, Wise makes a comment that reeks of racism. He was speaking about a time when he met several antiwhite liberals in Seattle, and they would ask blacks what they could do to assist them. Wise says it isn't always easy to ask them, as \\"frankly folks of color get tired, exhausted even, by whites asking How can we help? Not because allyship isn't valued, but because the question reeks of helplessness, and essentially asks black and brown folk do to all of the thinking.\\" This is the most openly racist comment I have heard yet, I'm utterly shocked that no one as of yet picked up on it. Wise is implying that blacks and browns have a difficult time thinking; in laymen's terms he's saying their stupid. 50 lashes with a wet noodle Mr. antiwhite.I had to re-read this line a few times, as when I first read it, I did a double-take, I couldn't believe it. \\"While much discussion has been had recently about whether or not America should apologize for slavery- and I happen to think apologies are pretty empty absent substantive reparations and recompense\\" What?????? Wise thinks blacks deserve reparations???? I bet a great many blacks will take that as an insult. I nearly vomited when I read that sophomoric, silly assertion. Needless to say I had to quit reading after I managed to stomach that wild assertion. Apologize? I bet a great many Africans envy the American blacks and would give anything to have their ancestors brought over here as slaves.This book would be extremely relevant if it were written in the peak of the Civil Rights era, but it is simply a remnant of the past now. Wise often talks about if he were black and all the other variables in his life were the same, that things would have happened differently. Ok, I can certainly agree, but this is 2010, not the 1970s. It's a different show altogether now, and one that caters and coddles blacks. I'd say a black today has the very same if not more opportunities then a white. Let's take basketball as an example. If you are one of the captains who chooses, and there is a line of people, 9 blacks and 1 white. Who are you going to pick first? Who do you think would be the last pick? A white person must PROVE their worth first, whereas a black gets a free pass because of the fact that he is black, he is assumed to be athletic. Wise falls into the trap of thinking, \\"ohh, things were racist when I was growing up, so they just have to be moreso now!\\" All in all I would read this book with a grain of salt, in other words, don't take it as gospel. It's basically a cult manual for the disease that is liberalism. Wise clearly thinks that he is above all minorities, and doesn't really go too far out of his way to disguise his racism. He was probably banking on only the fact that minorities and liberals will read this, and he already implied that minorities are dumb, and liberals will put a positive spin on basically anything a fellow liberal says. I think the only reason why Wise is speaking like so is because of money. If a white person came out speaking about how lazy and stupid blacks are, he'd be yet another racist, and black-balled from a lucrative career. But when a white person sells out his very own race and puts them down, now that's where the money is. It won't work by someone explaining the truth to Wise, Wise has to get schooled real world style; something needs to happen that'll change his views.With that being said I enjoyed reading this book, as I relish in reading all contrasting perspectives to further solidify my stance, or if presented logically and soundly and backed up by evidence, alter my stance."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"White Like Me is written in the same dynamic and fierce manner in which its author speaks. Never sounding like a scholarly work (though those are good, too, sometimes!), this revealing introspection reads like the opposite end of a lively debate to which you, the reader, are challenged to respond.I own a precious copy of the text, which I have read a few times now, each time wishing I had the strength to put it down. As a voracious reader of race theory, I have never before encountered a white author like Wise. He writes with passion, immediacy, and familiarity. The stories he recounts about his life are never told with any air of superiority as he makes his sharp points about racist conditioning. As a black woman, it was nice to read a white male author and not feel a paternalistic hand.My hope is that many more people become privy to Tim Wise's honest self-inspection and that many who read will be personally challenged to respond in kind, by confronting their own beliefs about white privilege in our society. The book is definitely worth the buy, especially for those who are disillusioned with the way our nation's institutions and social networks operate on a surface level.If you want something subversive, engaging, and relevant, please, read this book."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"This book absolutely blew me away. So much so that I read it all in one night. Most books I've read on racism and related topics are pletty bland, but the author in this case really cuts through the high-minded theories and scholarly analysis, to provide a compelling first person account of how racism and privilege continue to shape life in America. I think this book would be good for beginners to these subjects as well as those more experienced in the relevant discussions. Although the book might strike some as pessimistic about the prospects for change, I think the final chapter in particular--which is really more of an epilogue than anything else--wraps things up really well, and gives us all hope about the possibility that we can really make a difference and change society for the better.The only criticism I have of the book is that there are several errors in typesetting and a few proofing errors too. These aren't the authors fault of course, but they are a bit distracting in places.Anyway, overall a top quality piece of work, which relies on irrefuatable logic, excellent prose, and will challenge any reader to take a hard look at the society in which we live."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"White Like Me is one of the most personally reflective books that I have ever read.

The story of his grandmother's fight with Alzheimer's and the issue it raised with race, made me reread that story 4 to 5 times. It is a small book in length of pages, yet it takes quite a while to read it, simply because you have to stop and think on almost every page.

I can't say enough about this book.Eloquent, readable, and PRACTICAL piece of work by Tim Wise. He is not condemning whites, he isn't holier than thou, and he doesn't tell whites to feel guilty for their privileges. Through his stories he shows how whites can ACT to resist racism. His humility comes through in his stories about his white male privilege throughout his entire life and it was extremely helpful to me as a white woman.He also explains the complicatedness of being a well-meaning white person who sometimes doesn't speak up when a racist joke is told, who doesn't really act to end racism, and who is only angry at racism but fearful or confused about how to act to address racism.This book is for whites of every awareness level--from those who have just heard about \\"white privilege\\" to those like myself who have been reading about it for 10 years.KUDOS, Tim!"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I read this book as a book club selection.

And he's even anticipated your unwitting and latently racist attack / defense in expressing your outrage that there is such a thing as white privelege (which you will put scare quotes around, \\"privelege\\", to say that it doesn't exist.) He knows your tricks, and he is an extremely engaging and humorous author on top of it.This is one of the single best books I have ever read and is definite must-read material for anyone living amidst a lot of racism, especially the kind that doesn't see itself as such."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"There's not too many people in today's American society that are proud to be racist; let alone willing to admit to it. As most of us have learned, we've made major strides toward equality as a country and I would assume that this is something most people are proud of. However, because of the great efforts to fight racism and the history lessons that most of America's children are taught, the majority of America's white population refers to racism as a \\"thing of the past\\". Whether or not it's a touchy subject that not many people care to discuss or honest ignorance, it is something that is very prevalent in today's world, and a major thing that whites take for granted. Tim Wise discusses similar issues in his book entitled \\"White Like Me\\" and helped to open my eyes, me being a white, middle class, suburban girl, to a lifestyle that I had been taking for granted.The book \\"White Like Me\\" reveals what it really means to be white in the U.S. today. Tim Wise opens his reader's eyes to the privileges whites are born into, how we can choose to resist racism and stand up for what we truly believe in, and also how white Americans can begin the path to redemption. As the book begins, Wise presents the reader with a question dealing with the beginning of one's life. He asks, \\"Does your life begin o the day you came into this world, or does it begin before that, with the lives of you family members... without whom you would never have existed?\\" (Wise ). This is an important question that many of us have never asked ourselves, and therefore, considered some trivial issues, such as racism, as being out of our control. Wise answers the question by stating that the story of his life begins much earlier than the day he entered this world; and the way he justifies his response makes me think the same thing. As Wise admits, none of us were born onto a \\"blank slate of neutral circumstance\\". The day we are brought into this world we inherit our ancestor's experiences whether we like it or not. Being white is one of those inherited items, and it wasn't until I read this book that I really thought about what that meant. As many of us do, I took my whiteness for granted, never thinking twice about what it's like to be part of the minority in America today and never thinking about the privileges I've received solely due to my race. Wise talks about his experiences growing up that taught him about white privilege, beginning as early as elementary school. One instance that stands out the most is one dealing with the way white children and black children are punished in a school setting. Not to mention, how often teachers discriminate against their children of color labeling them dysfunctional, lazy, or slow. Wise recalls a time when he and a friend, a black friend, were reprimanded for interrupting the class's milk break and were sent to the office. The author admits that it was this experience that gave him his \\"first experience in the way white privilege plays out in the arena of discipline and punishment,\\" when his friend was paddled for his poor behavior and he was not. He makes it clear that this was not a blatant act of racism however; the principal was simply obeying Wise's parent's wishes to not use physical force on their child, which they sent to him in a letter. The parents of the black child had not done so, and a black woman participating in one of Wise's workshops gave the rest of the white folks attending the answer as to why they hadn't done so. She began to explain the fear of many black mother's in this country today: \\"The fear that persons in positions of authority -most immediately police -may well end the life of their man-child if they misinterpret a move, a look, a glance, a comment, or a smirk\\" (Wise 22). This is something that I, and many white Americans like myself, have never had to worry or even think twice about. She further explained that, \\"...even though they aren't thrilled about allowing school officials to discipline their children in such fashions, many parents of black children feel that they have no choice. \\"A paddle, after all, or the flat of one's hand will sting, it may even bruise, but it will not end one's life the way a bullet will\\", she exclaimed (22). To many of the parents it's important to teach their children self-control at an early age in order to prevent further and or greater catastrophe down the road.Tim Wise also recalls numerous parties he attended at the homes of other white kids where there was excessive amounts of drinking and drug usage, and when the police came they only reprimanding they got was because of the loud music being played. He's quite certain that had the parties been mostly black kids that the situation would have been dealt with much differently and much more harshly. I can relate to situations like the one Wise described because I too grew up in a white suburban community where similar parties had taken place. We would build up huge bon-fires and have coolers full of beer with at least forty to fifty kids gathered around drinking, laughing, and having a good time. It wasn't rare that a cop car would roll past every now and then, but no one seemed to pay much attention to it. They never came up and arrested people for under age drinking or possession of an illegal substance, though there was plenty to go around. It wasn't that we thought we were rebellious teenagers or that we were above the law, but we were never forced to think of the serious punishment we all could have received and therefore took our innocence for granted. The innocence many of us were only granted because of the color of our skin and the neighborhoods we had these parties in. This is one of the main points that Wise stresses throughout his book \\"White Like Me\\". He wants to teach his readers that being white in this country comes with a lot of privileges that most of us fail to recognize. And one major step towards ending the constant battle of racism is for whites to acknowledge those freedoms which are routinely taken for granted.Racism has never been something that only occurs on playgrounds at schools, or a phase that teenagers go through, much like rebelling against authoritative figures. In many instances, a person's racism gradually increases as they mature and heightens as they reach adulthood. An example, Wise points this out when he talks about all of the racial profiling that took place after 9/11. He explains, \\"Immediately after that tragic day, it seemed like you couldn't find anyone other than Arab and Muslim advocacy groups willing to speak out against the notion that anyone matching the description of a Middle Eastern male should be subjected to extra scrutiny at airports, for example\\" (Wise 48). For many Americans, whites in particular, this heightened security and the \\"random searches\\", which most every person of Middle Eastern decent happened to get chosen for, brought a sense of comfort and reassurance that nothing tragic was going to happen to them. Wise points out that such scrutiny took place after 9/11 mainly because the hijackers were not white. At first hearing a statement like that might lead you to believe that I think that only because I am racist and I think that unjust treatment like that is necessary, but that's not the case. Wise made it quite clear to me when he pointed out, \\"That Arabs are being treated with suspicion after 9/11, while white men were not treated that way after Tim McVeigh's bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, is entirely, completely about white privilege\\" (Wise 48). This was a really powerful statement for me when I was reading the book. Once again, Wise pointed out something that perhaps to nonwhites is something that screams racism in this country, but to me was something that had never entered my mind. After reading it, however, I am appauled that such actions took place solely based on a person's race. In my opinion, it's situations much like this one that reinforce the barrier walls of racism that our country has established.Now don't get the impression that \\"White Like Me\\" is simply a book that points out all the privileges that most whites in America take for granted and calls us out on our racist acts that many of us overlook. In the last few chapters of his book, Tim Wise discusses how whites in this country can begin to resist and stand up to racism. Wise states that whether or not we're responsible for the creation of racist acts, \\"We clearly live with their consequences and the privileges that result - privileges that are unjust and harmful to those who don't have them (and even to those who do...)\\" (62). Although there's not one clear approach to ending racism, the author points out that we can all begin by choosing to resist it. In order for such resistance to occur, we need to make ourselves more aware of what it does actually mean to be a white citizen living in America and pay attention to how it effects our daily lives. Wise continues to say that, \\"Our world is far too complicated, and the opportunities for collaboration far too extensive to allow for perfect - or even fairly consistent - resistance by any of us. This is all the more true for those who reap so many benefits from our status as members of dominant groups: whites, men, persons with money, able-bodied heterosexuals, Christians, whatever\\" (101). This statement is not meant to discourage or insult anyone, but he admits that it's important to upfront about this topic in order to \\"own one's collaboration\\". I agree with him because it seems to me that throughout history many of our country's shortcomings were in part because of ignorance, and in another part because of someone's unwillingness to face the truth so they wouldn't look like the \\"bad guy\\".Race has always played an important role in our nation and will continue to do so. It's time for whites, as the dominant racial group, to come together and overcome our innocence. We need to recognize that many nonwhites living in America don't see this country as the \\"home of the free\\". As Tim Wise put it, \\"...by owning our collaboration we can regularly see our own shortcomings, place them within the larger context of our culture's subsidizing of those shortcomings, and then commit ourselves to doing better next time\\" (102). Sure, this sounds easy when he spells it out for us, but as many of us know it's not going to be that simple; but that's no reason to just sit back and carry on as most of us had been doing before without even knowing it."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"three quarters through the book i have been nothing but satisfied. for the first time in \\"my life\\" i have heard the truth spoken eloquently and honestly about what has and is going on with our people. and until many more think as this man does, we are in for an incredible ride in a frightening direction. thank you mr wise and all others who are willing to look down in them selves and see the horror that is."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"According to the Assessor of Property for Davidson County TN, Tim Wise lives in a house worth $639,300.

But rather racism through a personal experience.

His maternal grandfather was able to attend officer training school in the military and have a long career in the army corp. of Engineers. His paternal great-grandfather was a Russian Jew who went through many extreme hardships to get to this country in 1910 and endured anti-Semitism and anti-Slavic bigotry. However because his great-grandfather had white skin and integrated fully into American culture, discarding the ways of the old country, he was able to set up a number of successful liquor stores in Nashville TN i.e. even in the anti-Semitic South. Wise's paternal grandfather ran one of these stores in a black neighborhood in Nashville for many decades and was able to lead a comfortable life.Black people of course were excluded from officer training school, could not own slaves to accumulate wealth or establish businesses in white neighborhoods. Thus they could not pass on the wealth, prestige and other benefits to their descendants the way Wise's descendants could to him. Black Americans until the 60's were virtually excluded from such government programs as the VHA and the FHA that allowed many tens of millions of white families to acquire homes and build up their assets.Wise's mother and father, always of very modest income and whose dysfunctional relationship because of his father's alcoholism made life miserable for their son, were kept above water by financial aid from his relatively well off grandparents on both sides. In order to help Wise pay for an education at Tulane University where he was accepted in spite of having SAT scores 200 points below the admission average, his mother took out a loan with his maternal grandmother's house as collateral. His maternal grandparents, of course, had been able to by nice houses in nice neighborhoods because they were white, and were able to pass on such property with its accumulated value over the years to their grandson. Blacks had been excluded from purchasing such fine property and accumulating the benefits from it over the years as they are to a lesser extent today.At school, Wise was a slightly above average student at best and often got mediocre grades. However, he was always placed in high track classes from kindergarten onwards because it was assumed he was bright, where his black classmates were often placed in low track classes as youngsters even if they had relatively high achievement scores because it was blithely assumed they had less ability. Wise observed this attitude in teachers and counselors who treated black students with scorn and ridicule. Wise faced a more subtle attitude from teachers because so many of his friends were black. She made sure that he went to genuinely integrated schools. AT one point, one of his white teachers denounced his mother to her face for allowing Wise to associate with \\"black savages\\" and Wise's mother made sure that this teacher was removed.Wise points out how harmful white privilege is for its beneficiaries. It gives the white person a false sense of invincibility. Wise relates his experience consuming marijuana and booze during high school and in his dorm in his early years at Tulane and how he and his fellow students did so blatantly and without much fear that persons in authority would punish him, certainly not the way that black people are punished for such transgressions. Wise ran a very profitable fake ID business during his high school years but was never caught despite the obvious crudity of many of his ID's. White people feel that the dominant system in this country allows them to succeed at anything. Thus all too many white people go into depression when things don't work out and get semi-automatic rifles to shoot up their workplaces or if they are children, they steal their parent's guns to go shoot up their schools. Yet white people, or the ethnicities which are lucky enough to have themselves classified under that label, do not have their genetics or culture explored for clues as to what makes them shoot up workplaces or what makes young white college students so prone to alcohol abuse.Wise recalls how he learned about talking to working class white people in Louisiana during his leadership in the campaign to rollback David Duke's effort to become Louisiana's national senator and then governor in 1990-91.. He tried to talk to white working class people about how they should focus their anger at corporate executives and the politicians who suppress union rights rather than the Chicano immigrants, blacks and welfare recipients that demagogues like Duke and Buchanan tried to divert them to. Of course, the self-esteem that comes from feeling superior to blacks that has been such a part of white working class consciousness refuses to go away in the South. Wise quotes a man who once told him that he would be willing to work for a dollar a day if only institutionalized segregation would return.Wise advises that the best way white people can help black people in their struggle is by using their prestige in this society to protest stores that harass black shoppers on grounds of alleged shoplifting, schools that degrade black children, banks that don't loan to blacks and so on. Above all they can make black people feel a little better by genuinely accepting the truth of the stories blacks tell of the constant subtle and blatant racism in their everyday lives. Most white people, Wise observes, believe racism against people of color is pretty much a thing of the past, while blacks overwhelmingly believe it is very much a part of their lives. He points out that it is quite racist for a white person to dismiss black people's claims of racism, because it assumes that black people really don't know what's going on their lives but the white person dismissing the claims does. White people can have no idea how it is to be black in this country, especially because so few of them have any close association with black people."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Racial discrimination has always been a problem in our society. Decades ago people of color were seen as incompetent people and became slaves to the white people. But over the years as a society we have come to denounce discrimination based upon color and tried to make everyone equal. However, as much as we may like to believe that our society has come to see everyone as equal, it has not. In Tim Wise book \\"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son\\" he shows us how color the of someones skin leads to privilege or discrimination.In his first chapter is talks about how before we are born our life is already set our for us. Before we even enter the world we have already been given a race and place in society. If we are born white we will have a life of privilege. However, if we are born of a different race we will be discriminated against and have to fight for the privilege we want. It will more than likely determine how we are treated in school by our teachers, who will get in trouble with the law, who will attend college, who will live in poverty and who will not, and who obtains the good jobs and who gets the minimum wage jobs. All of these things will already be set for you because of the race of your parents. Your parents part in society is what you will be born into and that is what your life will be like before you even have a chance to grow up and have a choice of your own.Education is one place where race plays a big role in privilege. Wise talks about how his whole school experience was tainted by discrimination wether it was racialized placement of students into advanced or remedial classes, or the way extracurricular opportunities were for white students only, or the fact that dances revolved around white music, or even that the curriculum was almost completely Eurocentric (15-16). Wise even talks about a time where him and an African American student had both gotten into trouble at school one day. They had then gotten sent to the principals office to receive their punishments. In this instance privilege helped Tim because he only received a verbal warning while his friend John got paddled by the principal. Because Tim was born of a white family he was not paddled that day at school. Wise mentions another time where the fact that he was white gained him many privileges. While he was in highschool he would attend many parties where alcohol was being served and drugs were being used and that there were many times where the cops would come up on the property because of a noise complaint, and at no point at any of these parties was any one arrested for illegal drinking or drug use and it was all because it was in a white neighborhood and attended by mostly white people. If it had been a part in the black neighborhood attended by African Americans they police would have had no problem stopping the party and arresting anyone that had been drinking or doing drugs.Another privilege he received was that because of color he was not seen as a threat to anyone. One night he got lost on his way to a dinner and he never had to be afraid that anything would happen to him in this rural area because he was a white person. If it had been a black person in that area and he walked up to a house and asked for directions the people would have never opened up the door for him because they would have thought he was going to cause trouble. It is these stereotypes that people obtain before they are even born. People see a black baby and they probably think that he's going to grow up to be a trouble maker while a white baby is seen as someone that is going to grow up to be someone with a great job.Wise then goes on to his chapter about resistance. In this chapter he talks about how discrimination is always there not matter if it is obvious or not, and as white people we just fail to see it or just ignore it. But we are people of privilege so how do we know what discrimination looks like or is because as white folks we have never been discriminated against. We refuse to see what African Americans are telling us when it comes to racism. Wise says \\"whites refuse to believe what people of color say about racism in their own lives-and have refused to believe it in every generation\\" (67). We just push it off as them blowing it out of proportion or being over reactive to something. But the privileged just don't want to see it. We like our privilege and don't want to lose that part of our life and therefore refuse to accept that there is still discrimination in our society.In today's society discrimination is not out right accepted. However, discrimination behind closed doors still happens. We judge people based upon their color and not who they are. When people see a African American on the street they think to themselves keep an eye on him because he could be dangerous, while a white person would not even be considered dangerous. African Americans are watched more in stored because it is figured they will be the ones to steal and not a white kid. Then in education African American kids are mostly seen as the trouble makers in the classroom. No matter how much we try race will always be a problem in our society, and we just need to learn to see it when it is happening and step up and say something when it happens. By doing this we can work to obtain a society where there is no discrimination but were everyone is born into privilege."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"When I purchased this product and contacted the seller they were very helpful.

Both readings achieve the same end but through different means. For those who appreciate writing, I recommend \\"White Like Me,\\" but for those who need studies and statistics, I recommend \\"Affirmative Action.\\"What Tim Wise presents in his books is parallel to what he's doing in the realm of social science.

I finished the book in just a few days.I have read quite a few books on race relations, and I agree with one of the other commentators that we should not glorify this particular book given so many eloquent works have been written by the likes of Du Bois, Baldwin, etc.. That said, I believe Wise brings a fresh perspective on this issue - and I wish I could require every white American to read his book (along with \\"The Fire Next Time,\\" \\"The New Jim Crow,\\" and quite a few others).The sad truth is that the people who need to read and reflect on these works never will.

It is still sort of terrible, though, as it stands to remind the reader that much still needs to be done, in spite of the Civil Rights Movement being part of the history books. Of course, the fact that I could make such a statement betrays me to be white like Tim Wise, the author. He makes a lot of excellent points about racism, such as how being sheltered from it is part of white privilege, or the simple fact that he was only able to publish this book because of the racist mindset of this country, which grants more respect to the work of a young white man, than to the opinions of people with, say, years of personal experience with being discriminated against.Ultimately, I would recommend this book mostly to those who are new to this issue, and not just because I am interested in social justice and combating racism. White Like Me actually presents some thoughts I had never heard before, regarding the psychic burdens such mindsets place on even those who are privileged by the system. I also think there is some inherent value in the very recent nature of this book, that it talks about current versions of old problems, such as how some seemingly innocuous phrases are euphemisms for more overt racist opinions. Wise also has a lot to say about the way that white people are isolated from or unaware of racial inequalities and non-white communities being a big part of our unconscious racism. My main complaint about this book is that it seems to be a haphazard collection of essays, and therefore not a really compelling read, having no overarching structure. It is more the kind of thing that can be read in little portions, or photocopied to be used for short handouts, without needing to know or recall what was said in earlier sections."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Tim Wise tackles the issue of racism on many dimensions.

This book (and the actually billion like it) are actually published to train the gaze away from the bizarre socializations of \\"white privilege.\\" I wanted to be a college teacher (and put myself through school, from an under-priveleged white background.

I wonder if Mr. Wise ever visited Appalachia or run-down cities like Detroit where whites didn't have any \\"privileges\\" to fall back upon. Wise is deliberately directing minority angst and hatred toward whites. Meanwhile, he and his fellow Jews are conveniently able to dodge criticism by claiming that they are the world's foremost victims of the white race, which has supposedly always been anti-Semitic. Wise is a foil to condemn whites, dismiss and ignore their many contributions to civilization, and subtly promote Jewish supremacism by default because everyone else is supposedly evil or over-privileged."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I have several problems with Mr. Wise's book. First, this idea of whiteness as a privilege is your basic post-modern de-contructionism that has been thrown at every basic conception to \\"turn it on its head.\\" Its no more true than saying that blackness is an underpriviledge. I'm not goint to just adopt someone else's construction because they want me to. And I refuse to go around saying \\"wow I'm so privildeged to be a white male.\\" Its all a matter of perspective. From my perspective, Bill Gates is prviledged because he is a billionaire. I'm not goint to say that I am priviledged, because from my perspective, I'm not. Now from a black perspective I'm sure I would be seen as priviledged. But I'm not black so I don't see it that way.Second, everyone has biases and everyone prejudges. It is 100% human nature. It will always be so. Even black folks have prejudices. And in a country like ours that is race-obsesses, even blacks have prejudgements about whites. I would expect nothing less. We pre-judge as part of survival mechanisms that are always scanning for what is a threat and a danger. And let me tell you, where I live (in a large urban center), a young black male with ghetto-esque or hip-hop or whatever clothing styles and jeweley and gold teeth is more likely to be a threat. Is that always true? Of course not, but statistically, its a prejudgement that is protective of my safety. I'm not goint to judge myself for that because that is natural and almost automatic. However, if I then get to know this teenager and find-out that he's actually a really great kid and is not a gang-banger and I still fear him or have some ill-will for him because of his race, than that is straght-up racism. That is a belief about someone that defies empriical observation. We all use shortcuts to make snap judgements and assessments that are changeable once new information comes in. If we continue to hold onto those judgements in the face of new information, than we clearly have a strongly held bias or belief and that is a problem.Third, I didn't kill anyone. I didnt' lynch anyone. I'm not bad-mouthing any minorities or refusing to hire people because they are black or anything like that. I don't care. I'm just going about my business and my daily life dealing with my own stuff. Why should I feel badly, guilty or responsible for stuff thats got nothing to do with me?"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Buy the book; dump the author and his premise.Buy the book for two reasonsFirst, it's a book that belongs on the shelf of any book collector interested in U.S. Social History. When historians are writing about the \\"Fall of the American Empire\\" in a hundred years or so, this 250 page monstrosity will provide a good look into the causes of that fall.And second, this guy makes the lecture circuit and has been known to lecture in schools. If you're a parent, you need to know what kind of poison is being poured down your kids' throats.Wise succeeds, as other \\"privileged\\" limousine liberals have in the past, of dispensing what is becoming an all too common formula for social poison: guilt for whites, anger and despair for blacks. Whites have no redeeming value, have contributed nothing to civilization and should be \\"so so ashamed\\". (I know this because Mr. Wise tells me so). The poison for blacks is even more noxious. Blacks have no hope of making in this world because the whites have the deck stacked against them.It's quite a social stew when you think about it - a bunch of embarrassed whites doing a \\"mea- culpa\\" and a bunch of angry and hopeless blacks. Of course, it's not completely hopeless for the black folks.

So I took African Amercian Studies and we were assigned to read the book \\"Black Like Me\\" which was a great book(I recommend it) afterwards we were assigned this book. And I have to say I thought it was very misleading and unrealistic. IN MY OPINION I thought this book was basically trying to victimize whites and emphasize and magnify reverse racism. I didn't agree with the authors points of views at all. There are many studies that have been conducted(many by white males) proving that racism is very very alive still. Such facts like \\"A white ex con is more likely to get a job than a black with a clean record\\" and \\"names such as Tamika Jackson and Jamall Williams are less likely to get calls on their applications but names appearing to be white on the identical application were called for an interview\\" the facts are there, many people don't take the time to look for them or read them.

We still have a long long way to go.Paolo PrestonTucson, AZ"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"This book is undoubtedly the best book on race I've ever read by a white author. It moves the lens from the \\"other\\" to the \\"self\\", thus forcing the sincere, thinking white American to examine race with the focus shifted from the minority to the beneficiary of a system of privilege that still forms the foundation of this country. The most compelling aspect of the book is Wise's raw, often painful honesty as he examines himself as a privileged son in his family and the society at large. He demonstrates how white privilege is not really a privilege at all but a destructive racist system that ultimately harms the privileged themselves. I found myself moved to near tears in many passages because of the bitter truth of it. Yes, the truth hurts...but in Wise's book, he shows how that pain is only a part of the healing. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Tim Wise gets at a pervasive reality of our society that is rarely written about: the experience of privilege. This is profoundly useful. He's not a perfect writer, but the book unpacks the complexities, the social and psychological layers of privilege, in detail. There are many good texts on racism, especially from writers of color. There are lots of other areas of rank/oppression/privilege that are important to understand. But to understand what it is like to have white privilege, Wise is the guy. Thoughtful readers can extend this to deepen their understanding of privilege as it manifests in other areas of rank (gender, sexual orientation, class, etc.). Thoughtful educators can use this book to highlight the privilege side of the dynamics of race and other ranked social memberships. Privilege tends to be invisible: Wise makes it visible."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I applaud this man on his concern and understanding of institutionalized racism that STILL goes on in this country.

He tells the truth, is straight forward, and doesn't take all the credit for it. If you're concerned with changing how this society runs, then I suggest this book. Some \\"white\\" people who are oblivious to racism will not understand and might be offended due to ignorance of what really goes on. If you are NOT afraid of hearing the truth, then read this book.

I wish I could give them (us) all a copy."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Tim Wise came to speak my school in the last month and what he said made a lot of sense to me. My school is largely white and he discussed to us, in his 30 minute speech, how white privilege has blinded us from the true problem.At first I thought he didn't seem to have a point, so I went to his book to see what he actually meant. What I learned from his book \\"White Like Me\\" is that there is such a thing and that is something that has really opened my eyes to the world around me.Tim Wise writes in his book about the way that being white has benefitted all white people, even in the most subtle ways. He argues that many of the advantages that we enjoy are because of our skin color and we should be aware of that. He also discusses that racism is a system that is in effect in our lives, a thing that we are surrounded by constantly. It is something that is futile to fight, but a system that we should always be aware of and do everything in our power to work within the system.His book is well written and is filled with interesting anecdotes that support his theories. I found his book very interesting and I think is an important read for any white person in America. It makes the world that we live in just a little clearer and allow us to see the racism that is around us every day. Wise gives the reader the tools to fight the system and the knowledge to work with it."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Mr. Wise, a smart and profoundly patriotic American, has written an honest and very thoughtful and engaging book that (perhaps without him even realizing it) has moved the country immeasurably closer to the goal of overcoming the single worst scourge of American history: white racism.He has taken on, mano-y-mano, the snake coiled in the bosom of our democracy and we must all be thankful to him for his courage and honesty. At once, he has laid bare his own personal life experiences - setting them out as object lessons in how complex and difficult it is to get hands around this slippery and evil beast -- and at the same time he has cut deeply into the meat of the intellectual and psychological underbelly of the racism that is peculiarly American. THIS in and of itself is no small accomplishment. And he has done both admirably. For this accomplishment alone the book deserves five stars.But he has done much, much more in this small volume. Among the bravest and most ambitious and challenging of the things he has tackled is to try to answer the mother of all questions facing any people of conscience who at the same time benefit from illicit structures and processes in the society they create and live within: Why would those benefiting from such structures and processes ever want to dismantle them?Although all of Mr. Wise's answers to this important question are good and wise ones (excuse the pun) - (and I mean no disrespect to him when I say this): they reflect the intellectual style and depth of a civil rights activist.Mr. Wise, the activist, can be forgiven for failing to see that racism, bigotry, and all other forms of chauvinism are cancers that above all else diminish, erode and corrupt the humanity of all within the society in which they take place. He thus can be forgiven for not realizing that we need to go much, much deeper than activism or community psychology for a more satisfying and penetrating answer to this pivotal question. We need also to attack the intellectual scaffolding that the question points to - that holds up the entire structure.No one, not even whites liberal have pristine and innocent shores upon which they can stand aside (and above) to look back down into the whirling polluted maelstrom. There is no refuge or safe haven from the polluted waters of American racism. No one gets a free pass. There is no \\"get out of hell free card\\" for those trapped in the sewer of American society. You accept the tyranny of American racism, or you leave, or you take your chances and fight it, or you die either a violent or a slow un-heralded ignominious death. There are no other exits, period.I for one believe it is an illusion to think otherwise. To his credit, Mr. Wise thinks otherWise and has convincing ideas to support his beliefs.Like him, I too believe that we not only swim in polluted water in this country; but also believe that the very act of swimming in it left unchecked and unchallenged creates and sustains the water. The obvious point that Mr. Wise seems to have missed is that the humanity of us all is diminished each time whites eat the forbidden fruit of racism and non-whites acquiesce to it. It is not a matter of degree. One cannot be a little pregnant with racism. We are all white racists, both blacks and whites. The underling structure and nature of our society compels it to be so. A black Uncle Tom or Aunt Jemima is no less a white racist than is David Duke. In the same way, a white liberal is also profoundly a white racist.The best example of a society gone mad with racism is of course the thousand-year Reich of the Nazis, which as we know only lasted for 12 years. Yes, of course American racism on the surface appears subtler, more nuanced. But we are all whistling pass the same graveyard the Nazi whistled past: White racism will continue to make American whites grotesquely fat with their feigned and fake superiority. It is the nature of superiority-inferiority games that the appetites can never be completely sated. They are afterall flips sides of the same coin: One side is the carrier of insecurity; the other is infected with it.The more they eat the bitter fruit, the more they will need to eat to stay ahead of those niggers. (They are ever gaining on us? Look at the cars \\"they drive?\\" Look at the salaries they are paying those Black athletes? etc., ad infinitum)As Mr. Wise knows all too well, American racism is a well-oiled, well-rationalized 400-year old way of life. One day America's big southern barbeque eating, nigger-hating, pot-belly will just explode from the pollution, from the corruption, from the lies, from the contradictions, from the sleights of hand, foot and mouth, from the grotesque distortions of reality and human values. I fear that America seems to have become too big and too confident and too comfortable in its own personally created evil to ever be called to account?It is true, is it not, that we are the last superpower standing; the greatest democracy the world has yet produced; and yet we are still the most racist nation on this earth -- bar none?Thanks to Mr. Wise's book, I too can now see light at the end of this deep dark tunnel. We need just one or two more parents like his mother. We need one or two more Tim Wise's in the Deep South as well as in the Deep North. With just one or two more Tim wise's we might still overcome.Buy this book. No matter what you think of it, it will make you a larger, better more confident person and will make America a better country. Ten stars.

For those who think racism only comes dressed in white sheets, Wise's book provides a mirror into which all white people must look at their own role and responsibility.

A must-read for anyone who cares about the future!"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Although I agree with the vast majority of the posts regarding the quality and insight of Wise's White Like Me, I think that, as a community of readers, teachers, activists and concerned citizens who loathe racial injustice, we must take care not to exalt Wise as THE authority on race and privilege in this country (basing this on another post that used similar language). Many African American scholars and writers - W.E.B. DuBoise, David Walker, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Sonia Sanchez, Gwendolyn Brooks and Amiri Baraka - have been saying the same thing (from the black perspective) that Wise does in his book, and decades BEFORE Wise did. While I applaud Wise's courage, I think that we shouldn't fall into another white privilege trap, which is to exalt a white person for a revolutionary work on race, when this same type of revolutionary writing was done by people without privilege years ago. I would hate to think that we can only accept admissions of white privilege from whites, when people of color - who have suffered from it - took risks and challenged racism when the topic was far from vogue (dangerous, actually). There are many great thinkers and writers of color out there; read Wise, but supplement your knowledge from those who are survivors, too. Peace to my fellow activists of EVERY hue."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Tim Wise's book, White Like Me, takes a look at racism from the perspective of the whites in the United States. Through his writings, Wise hopes to be able to open the eyes of white people to the privilege that has been bestowed upon them as the dominant racial group in our society. \\"Being a member of the majority, the dominant group, allows one to ignore how race shapes one's life\\" (Wise 2). Beginning from this premise, by using examples and stories from his own life, he attempts to show just how privilege has shaped his life and what he has done for the fight against racism.Privilege, according to Wise, amounts to almost every experience that a white person has within their life. Simple things like whether or not your presence in a certain area will be questioned or larger things such as access to college educations are all related to the color of our skin at birth. People don't automatically assume you are poor or going to steal when you are in a store, they don't cross the street to avoid walking past you, and they don't assume you are selling to drugs to buy your new shoes. This is not exactly the kind of thing that there is a lot of expert research on. All the evidence and claims that Wise make concerning the subject are all related to his personal experiences and his work relating to activism. However, this being the case I feel that he does make a very strong argument; I have been able to relate to what he is saying in many of his stories.During one such story he recounts that in his youth he would go to underage keg parties and when the cops would come by they would do little except tell them to keep the noise down. There was no doubt as to the fact that kids were drinking and smoking pot, but no one was arrested and no fines were given. During this same time Wise was running a fake ID business for which he never got in trouble when he or anyone else was caught with one. Wise chalks all of this up to the fact that these homes were in white neighborhoods and that the cops weren't out to make trouble for white kids (35-7).In all the keg parties I have been to, I can say that this definitely rang true for me. I have never seen any one get arrested or even fined at a party in Milwaukee when the cops have shown up. They merely kick everyone out and even that seems like a joke most of the time, people usually just come back within an hour or so.Considering the state of the country with terrorism and national security, you'd think that law enforcement would take possession of a fake ID very seriously. If a person of Middle Eastern decent was caught with a fake ID, I'm sure they would have had a much harder time than a white person. I have known several white kids to have had their IDs taken away with not so much as even a slap on the wrist. On another note, if you go to almost any of the bars near campus, many of them knowingly let in people with fake IDs, yet nothing is done to stop it. These bars of course are packed to capacity with white kids.Resistance is where Wise is trying to lead the readers of his book. To resist racism is to act in what he calls an antiracist way. According to Wise, we all have the choice to stand up and confront racism or to back down and say nothing at all (73). This can be hard for some of us who have family and friends whose feelings are really ingrained with a racist way of thinking. Again, Wise uses an example from his life where he stood up to a person he had just met who told a black joke to a room full of white people. Instead of saying nothing to the man, which he feels is worse than saying nothing at all, Wise chose to engage the man into a reflective discussion about just why the joke was wrong.Wise goes about this subject of resistance in a way that has never been offered as an option to me or anyone I have ever talked to. To stand up and combat racism as opposed to simply ignoring it, telling yourself that you aren't a racist, or even trying not to think racist thoughts is a huge step to take. In effect you are shedding your layer of privilege and opening yourself up to the possibility of rejection or even ridicule. The most I learned from parents and school, as well intentioned as they were, was only that everyone is equal and deserves to be treated fairly. Had this combative attitude been implanted I may have been challenging the system as a younger person. We all might have, it's hard to say how many minds could have been steered away from prejudice.One of the finer points Wise tries to make in his argument is that as white antiracists, we do not fight racism for black people. We have to fight it because it is evil and we hate it, we do it for ourselves and our community (98). We must however fight to keep resistance in our lives. No matter how hard you fight against racism, it can always rear its head in your life. Since we have been learning it from such an early stage and see it all around us, its almost impossible to completely change your mode of thought. According to Wise, we don't always act in an intellectual way, sometimes we just operate on conditioning. All it takes is a situation to bring to mind a stereotype and you are working against this antiracist mentality (134). Despite the challenges that come with being an antiracist, the work is absolutely necessary. Destroying racism as a goal might never be able to be accomplished, but nothing worth having has ever been easy."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I have to agree with a lot of the harsher critics of this book. I am liberal and Wise has some valuable insights for to an audience that hasn't thought much about race. For that, fine. I'm glad he wrote the book.But the book could have been half this length (and it's not that long). Wise is so self absorbed, he is tedious. Beyond that, he has no insight into the fact that a lot of his privilege derives from being male, as well as white. He'll give examples of \\"white\\" privilege that are as much about his gender as his skin color, not to mention matters of class, as others have mentioned. The way he talks about his wife dutifully raising their two children almost by herself while he keeps writing and writing and writing was really hard for me to read. Better he should have taken over the kids for a month and let her finish the book, or, better yet, write her own. I bet she'd have a lot to say. I actually finished the book, just to see where he was going with his ideas, but I was sorry I wasted the time."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I've seen other reviews stating that all white people should read this book. I think that EVERYONE should read this book. This book addresses race and race relations in a way that is unorthodox, clear and grabs your attention. As a race/ethnicity scholar and teacher, I'm always looking for ways to get my students aware of and concerned about (this is the tough part) racial issues in the US. Most feel and think that it's not a big deal, racism is over, etc. Most students express a \\"color-blind\\" attitude. But this attitude is harmful by ignoring institutionalized racism. The issue of white privilege isn't a new one, but Mr. Wise introduces us to some new ways of thinking about it.There is a lot of material and excellent examples to take from this book, but a few really grabbed me. One is getting at how white privilge operates in everyday life and at the institutional level. The other main and often subtle important aspect is how white privilege is dangerous not only to black people and other minority group members, but to white people as well, on a psychological level. Tim Wise makes his case by appealing to white people on a gut level by appealing to their egos and sense of self without attacking them as \\"bad people.\\" And I think that blacks and people of other races can benefit by understanding how white privelege often operates unconsciously...We spend most of our lives learning to be racist and it takes a lot to unlearn all that crap. Tim Wise does his best to set us on this path."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I recently came across two of Tim Wise's books in a local book store - White Like Me and Speaking Treason Fluently. I gave them a quick scan and decided that I wanted to read them both. I work in education and have seen white privilege at work; it's a topic I care about.As I began this book, White Like Me, I found the reading enjoyable. Even better, I felt my own beliefs about racism and white privilege were being affirmed.However, I won't be finishing the book or reading anything else by Tim Wise. On two consecutive pages, Wise makes commenst that are racist to the point that he's lost credibility with me. Let me explain.When explaining why high school debate team is \\"so white\\", Wise states (p. 33) \\"The substance of the arguments made and the way in which the arguments are delivered also tend to appeal to whites far more readily than people of color, for whom the style and substance are often too abstract to be of much practical value.\\" That is a disgusting comment. To generalize that people of color would not be interested in abstract argument because it lacks practical value is incredibly arrogant, demeaning, and racist.Amazed as I was by that statement, I was willing to overlook it until I read the next page (p.34). Here Wise explains that the entire process of debate is \\"a white one.\\" He writes, \\"...whites (and especially affluent ones), much more than folks of color, have the luxury of looking at life or death issues of war, peace, famine, unemployment, or criminal justice as a game, as a mere exercise in intellecutual and rhetorical banter.\\" He then claims that being able to debate a position such as \\"whether or not full employment is a good idea, presupposes that my folks are not likely out of work as I go about the task.\\" He adds, \\"To debate whether racial profiling is legitimate likewise presupposes that I, the debater, am not likely to be someone who was confronted...\\" with racial profiling.Wise seems to be saying that because of their position in society, people of color are unable to engage in intellectual and rhetorical banter, to take equally either side of a position. He's saying that because they have experienced discrimination, they can not step outside of their own experience to discuss the discrimination from all sides. Again, Wise's arrogance is palpable.The perfect counterpoint to Wise's claims is the current debate about healt care reform. People of color, some with health insurance and some without, are debating the pros and cons of a government-run health insurance option. They are able to discuss it intellecutally and rhetorically. They are able to look at both sides of the issue. They are able to overcome the multitude of ways in which the health care industry discriminates against them.Tim Wise is clearly aware of \\"white privilege\\" and it's role in the continuing oppression of minorities. But his opinions and perspectives contain the covert and subtle racism that now characterizes much of American thought towards \\"people of color\\"."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Tim Wise's name is well-known and I have read many of his essays over the years. So as I was about to read this book, it's safe to say I had some expectations for it. The verdict: it surpassed them. In the first few pages, the book seems a bit aimless, and at various points in the book his language is a little off-putting (by that, I mean his very free use of words like F-bombs). But after the first few pages, and getting past the occasional language obstacle, he shines with it.He proves very adept at illustrating how ever-present race is in everyday life, and I don't make this point lightly. I already felt I had a good understanding of this, but some of his examples prove that wrong and show that it's present even in places I didn't think that was the case. He shares stories from his family as well as life outside of home that all drive home his points well.Most of all, as is the case in his essays, Wise gets real about race as it concerns White people. He pulls no punches, evident in several parts of the book. He makes it clear more than once that merely \\"being a good person\\", for lack of a better phrase, will never be enough to make a significant dent in racism. He points out that for White people doing this work, the rewards are not what one might expect - don't expect to be on the cover of a major magazine or the top story on the six o'clock news, and don't expect to be loved by all the way athletes and entertainers are worshiped in America. And he does a great job of showing how racism hurts White people, examples including how privilege can put us in danger or rob us of our self-determination, and in perhaps an extreme example, how it can lead the poorest of Whites to support politicians and policies that don't help them at all but profess to be anti-Black - the latter being the reason they support the politician or policy.This is a challenging book. It certainly was for me, and I haven't been a passive observer on this subject matter during my life. It made me examine myself and my thoughts on this subject, yet it also in some points affirmed that if nothing else, I may be on the right track, as there were certainly parts I identified with. It's also realistic in that the overall picture it paints is that for many reasons, fighting the rampant White privilege in America is not easy at all.All in all, this book is well worth reading, especially for a White person who wants to do something positive on race."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I have had two moments in my life over the last few years that have decolonized my thought process. Listening to Calvin Terrell and reading WHITE LIKE ME by Tim Wise. Mr. Terrell introduced me to the book and the rest as they say is history. Mr. Wise takes a complicated issue and brings common sense to the masses. I have never had so many 'light bulb' moments in one sitting. The clarity of this book was refreshing and thought altering. I have read both of Tim's books and I look forward to his next installment."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"I'm a white man married to black woman. I'm a white father of two children society classifies as black. I'm a white pastor of a congregation that is 60% black.In other words, I have to think about race a lot -- for a white man.But even with as much as I think about race I am still oblivious to some of the ways my race has privileged me in every context since my conception. And some of the ways it still privileges me every day in ways that harm the wife, children, and church that I love. And, as Wise discusses in White Like Me, ways that harm me and other whites.In \\"White Like Me\\" Tim Wise tells his own story of living as a white man in a country that privileges whiteness. Beginning with his conception and continuing to Obama's presidency, Wise writes of his life experiences and what each one reveals about the advantages whiteness affords. His storytelling is at times moving, usually humurous, and always relatable for white readers.Wise is not interested in making white people feel guilty. He is interested in helping white people see what our black neighbors see and feel every day. As such, the book is illuminating whether you have explored the subject of white privilege before or not."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"As a person of color I was fascinated by this book when I thought I had read or heard it all this author intrigued me."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"When I first opened the cover of White Like Me by Tim Wise, I was quickly captured by the magical combination of stories, soul-baring, and polemic. Then, as I proceeded on through the book, I despaired for a moment that those who need it worst would probably never read it or at least would never read it all. But as I continued, I decided that this is not true, that the ones who need to read this book the most are not necessarily those White people who have already lost their minds to the last stages of the psychosis of racism, but rather those of us who have as yet a shred of sanity that might respond to such a dose of truth. I have more than a hundred books on the socially-constructed political notion of \\"race.\\" It occurred to me as I read the closing lines of this amazing treatise, that it has now become the cornerstone of my collection. There are only a relative few monumental volumes that stand through history as quintessential statements on human existence during one age or another. One hundred years from now, if we have not obliterated everything on the earth by then, this slim book will stand with those earlier works as the clarian call that led our nation to a new dawn of hope or as the announcement of the beginning of the end. Open up, White People, it's time to take our medicine."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"There's a fundamental problem with \\"White Like Me\\": Tim Wise isn't white. He's Jewish. Ah, but Jews (or most Jews) are white, you say. Not in this sense.As used in this book, \\"white\\" is a political term defined according to Gramscian-Marxist principles. \\"Whites\\" are defined as an \\"oppressor class\\" without rights of any sort; \\"Jews\\" are defined as a \\"victim class\\". As a matter of logic, in the political sense, Jews cannot be \\"white\\". The book is an attempt to deligitimize the existence of whites, which is to say it is an attempt to legitimize the genocide of whites. How convenient of Wise to attack \\"whites\\" while maintaining an identity that is immune from attack!"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"This book was given to me and I did not finish it.What I read offended me - as a Caucasian.This Tim Un-Wise knows he is preaching to the choir of self loathing rich white folks who are left wing cooks full of guilt from what some of their ancestors did.However it also seems to make the assumption all white people should feel that way, well speak for yourself, pal.I am and I know a lot of decent caucasians with decency and courtesy who are further from racism that most black folk. Write that, pandering lyar.Making excuses like that is not helpful to the black community either as most of their problems can hardly be blamed on the folks who make welfare possible - the taxpayers."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"Funny he thinks white men have an advantage ??? That's absurd since white men have been discriminated in all fields of government and academia for the last 40 years.

The USA is toast."},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","review":"He sure knows not much about the Civil War, even that it was not a Civil War"},{"Title":"The Battle of Kursk","review":"The Battle of Kursk, Ed. Major-General Ivan ParotkinThe Battle of Kursk in July-August 1943 was the greatest tank battle of World War Two. It was most decisive in that Nazi Germany was forced into retreat until they were defeated within two years. Germany's allies began to seek a way out of the war, neutral countries revised their foreign policy. Why is this great victory unmentionable in some history books? The \`Preface' blames it on \\"bourgeois falsifiers\\", but it seems more likely that others concentrated on their own countries' battles. How much emphasis on Pearl Harbor is in other countries' histories? This book praises the Soviet troops and their army command, but I think the policies of industrialization from the 1920s was the prime cause of victory. Modern warfare depends on materiel (weapons, munitions, food, and transport). This book has 25 unnumbered chapters for its 350 pages, but no Index.The Kursk Battle used methods of counter-preparation bombardment in defensive operations. The complex and rapidly changing conditions required skill and experience for commanders, staff officers, and troops. After a gigantic defensive battle they immediately launched a counter-offensive. Large numbers of wounded were evacuated by air. By 1943 tank armies were organized and artillery divisions were improved. The lack of a Second Front in the West allowed Germany to increase their forces in the East, more than in 1941. The German leaders overestimated their forces and under-estimated the power of the Soviet troops and the prowess of their military intelligence. They prepared anti-tank, anti-infantry, and anti-aircraft defenses in depth. Strategic reserves were moved close to the front. This allowed them to join the battle in the most important sectors at the right time. There were also heavy concentrations of artillery, good fortifications, strength in great depth, and high activity.The chapter \\"Employment of Artillery\\" tells about this important force. Tiger tanks had strong frontal armor so anti-tank guns were arranged to fire at their sides . Five to ten guns were optimal for an anti-tank strong-point. Anti-aircraft artillery was as important as fighter aviation. High artillery densities neutralized the enemy's attacks. Soviet forces would attack before the artillery attack ended (a rolling barrage began at the first trenches then went to the rear). Artillery was the main striking force. The chapter \\"The Gaining of Air Supremacy ...\\" tells how the increased power in much better fighters was overlooked by the enemy. They attacked German aircraft on the ground and in the air, weakening them. Soviet massed air attacks neutralized the enemy air forces and their morale. Hollow-charge anti-tank bombs dropped by attack aircraft were effective.The chapter \\"Engineer Troops\\" tells how engineers were used for defense by a large-scale use of mine-fields and obstacles. Trenches connected strong-points and allowed hidden maneuvers. Commanders visited frontline units. Mines were used on enemy supply routes. Engineers also removed and deactivated mines and bombs, and built bridges over rivers. They also removed mines and bombs from captured cities. The chapter \\"Control and Communications\\" tells of the need to coordinate the efforts of the armies and divisions on several fronts. They were short of men and equipment. Communication was by wire, radio, and messenger. Low-power short-wave radio stations deteriorated at night. The use of ultrashort-wave radio ensured noise-free communication day or night.

A little history...A little how to...Warnings...and lots of anecdotes about others experiences"},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"This was my first Christie Ridgway novel. The storyline starts with Felicity Charm at a crossroads in her life, winning the \\"Joanie\\" for best on-air host of her GetTV shopping channel show. She is determined to turn her back on the Charm relatives who raised her from an orphan at age 4 once and for all after having made it in the glitzy world of television sales. While driving her new prize Thunderbird she gets a call from Aunt Vi asking for her help in finding her wayward cousin Ben. Insisting to herself that this is the last time she will involve herself in these family problems, she turns around and ends up losing control of her car (on a road seeded on purpose with nails by her Uncle Billy to enhance his auto repair business) and crashing into another vehicle. Alone in the desert in the pouring rain, cold, hungry and surrounded by tarantulas outside the jeep, Felicity (or Lissie as Michael calls her) takes to Michael, the stranger who seems to have brought her back to life in more ways than one.After leaving Michael and their almost sexual encounter behind when the tow truck arrives, she is shocked to find that she and Michael Magee have more of a connection through the Charm family. As Felicity struggles to try to turn her back on the backward world of Half Palm California, she finds it difficult to resist the allure of Magee, a former rock climber with more talents than she realized. It is the journey of Felicity putting behind her pre-conceived ideas about people and letting herself lead with her heart that takes the story full circle."},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"First off, I'm a rather large fan of Ms. Ridgway. Her ability to create characters that the reader can connect with and laugh with is what sets her apart from other authors.In her latest effort this does not change. We are introduced to Felicity Charm and Michael Magee. Both are characters that do a fairly good job at hiding who they really are. That is until Lissie and Michael run into each other literally. Now all bets are off, and both need to face the fact that what they thought they wanted and needed might not be exactly how they figured.Felicity comes from a family of...con-artists and scammers. She has worked real hard at getting rid of the \\"charm\\" in her life. She is a very successful shopping network hostess. She has just won the \\"Joanie\\" (this equals the golden globe in T.V. awards) and feels that she can now work on the idea of proving to Drew (her boss) that she is worthy of being a little more to him than an employee. But...all of this comes to a crashing end when she gets a call from Aunt Vi and a trip back home is put into play. On said trip home she crashes into Michael and this is truly the beginning of a new and more realistic Lissie. Or is it?Michael can't believe that his very own piece of bad karma has just crashed into his Jeep. He knows that his life is over as he knows it. He has to keep a promise and although it's not exactly what he wants a promise is a promise. Oh, and this promise does not include the sexy, sweet Lissie. Saved by a tow truck (you'll just have to get the book) Michael goes his way and Lissie goes her way...right to the same place. Now Magee is in more trouble than he ever was climbing mountains and rocks. He has a bad case of \\"Lissie\\" and she is making his life miserable. He wants her but can't have her...or can he?Magee and Felicity are great characters. The reader will truly be able to connect with them both. Neither is too pretty, or perfect and this makes their realationship all the more fun to read. They both make bone headed mistakes (just like us fellow mortals) but are able to see the truth in the end. Secondary characters such as Ashely and Jack add to this compelling storyline with one of their very own. This is not to say that this is a story steeped in reality...it's not but it's a wonderful way to escape if only for a little while. I highly recommend Ms. Ridgeway laugh and loved filled reads!Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"This was my first book that I've read by Ridgway and it definitely won't be my last.

I would have done a 4.5 stars if I could have. Great book for a fun exciting read!"},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"This book was great. I really connected with all of the characters. I loved the relationship between Lizzie and Magee. The sex scenes were awesome and Ridgway did a great job of having the sexual tension throughout the whole book. Great if you want some sex and fun."},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I read it in a day and was never bored, I enjoyed all of the characters and I wanted to see how everything ended.The Thrill of it All is the story of Michael Magee, a rock climber who feels responsible for the death of his best friend and climbing buddy, and Felicity Charm, an on air personality/host for a TV shopping network. The two meet when Felicity crashes her car into Magee's and the rest is history.I liked Felicity. I thought she was strong and independent without coming across as hard and sweet and vulnerable when she needed to be.I liked Michael and thought he was strong and flawed but also caring and masculine.They had great chemistry together. They nearly burned up the pages. I liked that the story focused mainly on them.The secondary stories of Ashley and Peter and the mystery of Ben fit nicely with the relationship between Magee and Felicity. Ashley came across as a wimpy ditz for parts of the book but redeemed herself in the end. I was also glad that Peter found happiness.Overall, this was a great book. The story moved at a nice pace, it was well written and I was never bored. Once I started, I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"I think this has been my favorite CR book of all. Title says it all, definetely a \\"thrill\\". I'll take a Michael Magee anyday!"},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"In Vegas, GetTV host Felicity Charm is thrilled when she wins the \\"Joanie\\" for her selling of electronic items. However, she has no time to bask in her glory as her California based family of nuts and con artists intercede. Aunt Vi asks Felicity to come home to Half Moon to solve the problem of her cousin vanishing. Although she prefers to avoid her family of rascals at all cost, Felicity is the troubleshooter so she drives across the desert.However, Felicity's hits a car sitting on the side of the road in an isolated area. The other driver Michael Magee insures she is okay by taking her to his nearby abode. That night they fall into each other's arms, but not long afterward she learns his secret. He promised his deceased best friend that he would take care of his widow and daughter who happen to be first and second cousins to his \\"Lissie\\" as he calls the woman who crashed into his heart.Though her family comes out of You Can't Take It With You without the charm as they use and abuse the serious minded Felicity, fans will enjoy this lighthearted romp because of the two likable protagonists. The contrast between Felicity and her family has made her feel as if she was adopted as they could never share the same DNA as she takes life seriously while they go from one caper to another. Michael becomes the equal sign between everyone, but he has made a death bed pledge that makes it unlikely that he and his beloved will forge a permanent relationship.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Thrill of It All","review":"This story was good. It was believeable and you could connect witht he people on a more humane level. Maybe that is why I really did not care for Michael most of the time. I liked him, then he was a jerk, and I didnt.

I found myself Christmas Day unable to put the book down, (before she had a chance to read it). I believe that I am an awesome father.

Have lots of activities planned. #5. Set high ideals. #6. Teach them about God. Using this guide has worked wonders, and I am very proud, and very focused to there needs, and accompolishments. However after reading this book, I almost feel like I had only scratched the surface. This book is so far outside what I dreamed possiable. You might think at this point that though it was centered tords you moms out there,however the results dads can have are just as equal. I have never in my life been filled with more love, sprit, focus, and a daily plan that was so clearly spelled out in Loren's book &quot;No Greater Love&quot;. I was so totally embrased by this book, and how easy it was to follow the techniques, and stradigies. One of the greatest tools this book offers is how important it is to stay in the moment. The morning questions, and daily questions re-frame for you what rasing extrodnary children require from me to excell the kids into greatness. Loren, I would like thank you with all the love, and sprit in my heart for writing this book and the extrodnary results my family will experience, and benifit from this amazing book, you are a very gifted soul.

And, I am here to say, Loren has written this book from the heart incorporating mothering lessons she learned from her mother, Arlene, and a passion for life which she inherited from her father, Joseph, and her mother. And, having attended her wedding in Fiji and visiting her and her family as they travel around the world, I can safely say, she walks her talk and deeply touches everyone she comes in contact with.

The pieces are very personal and autoethnographic in approach(Richardson mentions both Carolyn Ellis and Norman K. Denzen in her acknowledgments).What I appreciated most in this book is that Richardson spells out the politics and unspoken undercurrents of academic hierarchies and rivalries. Richardson is brave and forthright in speaking openly about things that are usually unspoken. She shares her feelings of failure, shame, anger, rage. Richardson describes the personal effect of the changes that occurred in universities with the introduction of a business management model, and for this reason alone I think the book should be essential reading for anyone contemplating an academic career who doesn't realise what a tense, bitter minefield a university faculty truly can be.It was interesting that I found it hard to be open to Richardson's sociological plays and poetry. I have no experience with reading poetry, or with academic prose forms other than traditional texts, so I had no frame of reference with which to approach her work. However, I enjoyed 'Louisa May's Story of Her Life' enormously: more than enough to continue to work towards a better appreciation of other texts such the script representation of the 1990 Postmodernism and Cultural Studies discussion (even 19 years later it seems unconventional).I recommend this book to anyone interested in autoethnography, sociology, cultural studies, or who is considering a career as an academic ."},{"Title":"Fields of Play: Constructing an Academic Life","review":"What a woman!

Jan Axelson's \\"Embedded Ethernet and Internet Complete\\" gives a great introduction to connecting embedded devices to ethernet and via ethernet to the internet. It would have filled some gaps in my knowledge and saved me some grief further down the track. This is an excellent introduction to creating applications using ethernet capable embedded devices such as theRabbit Ethernet Module or TINI based systems.This book shows detailed examples of building embedded webservers, including those hosting dynamic data and gathering and using user input. In similar detail, the book has very useful chapters on e-mail and FTP applications on embedded systems.It even has a great chapter comparing a number of different MACcontrollers, that I wish I'd seen before choosing the one I'm currently using (it introduced me to one I hadn't seen before - that may have been better for my application than the chip I'm using). Unfortunately, that's about where the low level stuff stops. I was hoping for some examples and tips on communicating with these MAC controllers in an embedded environment with limited RAM and ROM resources. This book didn't go down to my level there. For those who are interested in this stuff, consider also buying \\"TCIP Lean\\" by Jeremy Bentham, which misses out on most of the stuff in this book, but covers the lower levels of talking to the MAC very well (the two books are, in fact, wonderful companions without too much duplicationbetween them).All in all, a book that definitely has a place on the bookshelf of anyone considering working with embedded intenet connected devices, particularly those with limited recent exposure to ethernet device and internet protocols. For me, it fell a little short of the possibly unreachable superlative \\"Complete\\"."},{"Title":"Embedded Ethernet and Internet Complete","review":"This book does a poor job of explaining the actual protocols and structure of code. In my opinion, you could just as easily buy one of the demo boards mentioned in the book and read the documentation that comes with it rather than buying this book. Cheese whiz! Anybody can read an ad in a magazine for those Rabbit Semiconductor modules, buy one, and I'm sure you can be up and running with a minimum understanding of the hardware or the code in a short period of time.However, if your goal is to understand TCP/IP and layer two protocols, how to architect your code and optimize your hardware to meet the requirements of your particular project needs, then this book isn't going to get you there. You're better off getting &quot;TCP/IP Illustrated&quot; and even &quot;TCP/IP Lean&quot;.A good summary of this book would be: &quot;1) Buy a pre-built ethernet demo board. 2) Use the code that comes with the board and make the following function calls to that code.&quot; You could get the same info from any technical magazine ad and the documentation that comes with the demo board/module.And one parting thought. Is anybody who is willing and able to code up an embedded ethernet project really in need of an entire chapter devoted to the difference between a straight-through cable and a cross-over cable? Wouldn't that already be in your bag of tricks before attempting something like this?"},{"Title":"Embedded Ethernet and Internet Complete","review":"Recently, I took my daughter to a play about a giant. At turns, the giant was played by an actor and a 30-foot effigy. The other characters were each played both by a person and a 12-inch marionette.

Somehow, the reader doesn't notice the transitions; this vast range of information is all integrated flawlessly.The intended audience is embedded systems programmers who want to learn about networking.

The book doesn't cover more than a good TCP tutorial on Internet, however you need to pay and wait for it.The book is not \\"Internet complete\\". The book doesn't cover what internet is. It only mentions some aspects of building a net, but anything else. If you expect to read something about packets, datagrams and so on this is NOT the book for you. If you expect to learn something deeply about chips for LAN, this book is NOT for you. If you expect to know how each layer in the TCP/IP stack works this book is NOT for you. This book is for nothing.The book is not \\"Embedded Ethernet\\". Actually I needed to pay about $50 US and wait 2 weeks just to hear \\"don't get in troubles, just buy a Rabbit kit, or if you like Java get the TINI card\\". I have cards for others architectures, but none of them. At this point I hope you may guess how I felt =( . If that is the author's idea of designing embedded systems I have a big problem.I have some books about TCP/IP and Internet (english/spanish) that are each one far superior to this one, and cover more topics deeply.

I believe I own all of her books, and have used them with students, as well as finding them a handy reference at times when I had trouble recalling the details on something.All that being said, this book is a big disappointment - I'm afraid this one looks like it was \\"phoned in\\", and as others have said, the \\"Complete\\" is a total misnomer - it should be titled, \\"Embedded Ethernet and Internet Superficial and Unfocused\\". It stands in stark contrast to her \\"Parallel Port Complete\\". I hope someday we will see a dramatically revised version of this book worthy of the title \\"Complete\\" (meaning lots of details on the physical layer, the OSI stack, Internet protocols, and implementation examples with common 'P families and chip sets).It pains me to give such a negative review for a book by someone whose contributions to our field I respect, but I suppose we all have our off days, and this book appears to be proof that even someone as knowledgeable as Ms. Axelson is not immune.I will note in closing that I have just pre-ordered \\"USB Complete: The developer's guide 4th Edition\\" and trust that it will be a better reference than this was."},{"Title":"Embedded Ethernet and Internet Complete","review":"I would say this book belongs to trash category not only because it is poorly structured collection of scrappy material but mainly due to the fact it fails to fulfill its goals stated at the introductory pages - i.e., to answer questions listed therein in a complete self-consistent manner. If you want to see what the superficial knowledge is about, buy this pseudo-book jumping from one receipt to another, returning back to the discussed subject, and so on. I found too many senseless listings and script examples which are aggravated even more with surrounding text detached from any outlined solid canvas with systematic basic idea.It is not a manual, nor a guide, and it is not either a handbook. It is something like collections of notes alternated with photos of connectors (half-page each), wires, PCB boards, listings, screen-shots, etc. Diagrams are far away from being real engineering charts, protocols are obscured traces of RFC texts, and screenshots are just to be. I better stay away from misleading examples torn out (copy/paste) from miscellaneous examples out of different evaluation boards.To get a real clue on embedded internet, I would suggest to buy either the \\"Designing embedded internet devices\\" by B. DeMuth at al. (plus, you get an insight into the CAN), or \\"Networking and internetworking with microcontrollers\\" by F. Eady (plus, I2C discussed). The first one is mostly about TINI, and the second one - on CS8900 controller. Both are a way ahead in covering the embedded Ethernet stuff.

Too bad it took me that long before I discovered that most of what I was seeking was already summarized clearly and succinctly in Jan's book.Primarily, it helped me with the overall \\"big picture\\" of understanding Ethernet, Internet, and all those crazy protocols you hear about (for all I knew, NetBEUI was some sort of nautical communication). The book explains things from basic Ethernet wiring practices, through functional descriptions of Ethernet equipment (Switches, Hubs, etc.), wrapping up with byte-by-byte explanations of all those various protocols and headers.For all of you to whom TC/IP is just a buzzword, and Ethernet just a perplexing mystery, this book will be of considerable help. It connects the dots in clear concise steps. Where it doesn't go into detail, it provides websites and reference sources to follow up on.Admittedly, if you are looking for a book to provide a step-by-step guide in creating your own embedded Ethernet hardware design from scratch, this probably isn't the best book for that. Although it provides several sources for buying turn-key Ethernet hardware boards, the focus is more with process and implementation.

The frosting on the cake is E-mail for embedded systems, with a meat course of using FTP (the File Transfer Protocol).

To that end, when he discovered the person who aided Jeffries, was a woman by the name of Grace Chastain, and believing her to be Jeffries' mistress, he raided a ship she was on, captured and brought her back to his own ship where he planned to humiliate his enemy by seducing his woman.Grace had to aid the man that all thought was a traitor; she couldn't let him hang even knowing that her life would be forfeit should she be caught. When she was captured by the brooding sea captain with murder in his eyes, Grace thought the priceless heirloom necklace, given to her by her best friend, promising either great happiness or great tragedy to the wearer was certainly living up to the latter part of the legend as she was forced to resist the coarse advances of the boorish and crude sea captain.During the voyage, as Ethan finally came to believe that the woman was not who he imagined her to be and was beginning to admire her spunk and courage, the seduction he planned became his hearts desire. After one totally blissful and sensually exciting encounter, and Ethan realized she was an innocent, Grace explained away her connection to Jeffries. Totally dismayed by this revelation, Ethan would have to decide if he could lay aside his vengeance long enough to come to terms with and follow his heart's desire or let hatred rule his life.*** This was a smashing sequel to Martin's newest trilogy that started with THE BRIDE'S NECKLACE. The main protagonists torment was vividly written and forcefully brought home in this tremendously emotional and exciting adventure. Martin does an amazing job with insinuating all the nuances of betrayal, longing and sensual delight in her writing. The dialogs are smart, witty, and fresh and invites the reader in to become a part of the drama in this latest, totally stand-alone, entry to the trilogy. While I could understand Ethan's torment of loving Grace, knowing who she was, I truly would have liked to kick his (...) for his obstinacy, and wept tears of joy when the author brought him along to accept and charish the gift he'd actually been given. This is another absolutely marvelous romantic adventure by one very talented author I highly recommend.--- (...)"},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"I had a feeling when I read about Ethan in the Bride book he was going to be a very compelling character. He did not disappoint. And even though he should have been just racked with dispair and revenge he still managed to have so much heart and so many feelings. I mean this man's crew, almost all of them lost their lives due to a traitor - a traitor Ethan believes is his beloved Grace's father. How unbelievalby challenging that would be for a man, and a captain. Ethan truly falls in love with Grace and she him - it is really intense. Grace understands how Ethan must set her aside because of who she is - however their mutual friends intervene and they thus become wed. Usually when the hero tries to keep his feelings in check and not fall in love with the wife you want to bash him. In this case, it was so understandable why Ethan kept fighting his feelings. When Grace overhears the former crew member calling Ethan a traitor for marrying Grace she really does understand how impossible their marriage is. There are so many heartwrenching scenes in this book. The characters from the Bride book return and are even more endearing in this second of the trilogy. The mystery of the traitor is a good one and the way it wraps around the love story of Ethan and Grace is powerful. This is one book I highly recommend - I think it would be good to read the Brides Necklace first as I found myself rereading it while I read this one, just to get a true understanding of all the players. This is one that deserves more than 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"This is the 2nd novel by Kat Martin I read. I also read \\"Innocence Undone\\" by this author (so-so).

Unfortunately...I liked it even less.Some of the reviews noted that the book had wit, the story line was gripping, the love between the two emotional etc......I did not find any of that to be the case.The book actually started out much better than the middle and ending. Reason...at least in the beginning Ethan was a dashing pirateer who sailed the high seas, taking his rightful bounty and protecting his men. In turn, Grace was a strong, independent and thinking woman who was feisty and bold upon her capture from the pirate captain Ethan. Their early meetings had fire works, interesting dialogue and thoughtful insights as to what each was thinking about the other. They got together very early in the book physically and once they both went back to land and took up their original wealthy lives well...the story got dull.Grace suddenly turned into this boring and un-spirited miss once she got pregnant and married Ethan. Instead of taking control of her life and destiny, she seems to allow him to control everything which is at odds with the girl we first meet in the book who will do anything to save her father's life, will bribe pirates to let her go, swim across the cold channel waters to save herself etc. Where did that girl with fire and zest go? It's a mystery.In turn, Ethan turns into this dull land locked fella who constantly denies how he feels about Grace and runs from her at every opportunity once he is forced into marrying her over the child. Even after his child is born he remains cold, aloof and distant through most of the book.I don't enjoy novels that dwell only on the physical sides of relationships - sex, sex, sex. That's all this book was about - how much he wanted her physically (rarely about liking her, enjoying her, loving her, etc.). In turn, she loves him early on but, doesn't seem to fight for what she wants they way she should have. The two of them have plenty of intimate scenes but, without deep and abiding and respectful love for the other...the lust feels a bit empty.The ending of the story was neat and tidy - too perfect to really be of interest.Many fans who like her books will probably be used to this style of writing and might enjoy this read. It just wasn't for me. I wanted to root Grace and Ethan on as characters but, there just wasn't enough interest or depth to them to do that.This author is two for two so far - and that means two I didn't care for. Wish I could give higher stars but, I'll look elsewhere for writers who appeal to me more emotionally."},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"The story was so-so. At first Ethan irked me and I just wanted him to get over it (his revenge). Then nearing the end Ethan was more understanding and responsible toward his family, and he grew on me. Then it was Grace who needed a good slap! She was too impulsive and ALWAYS running off and getting into the most absurd situations . . .Now, I like Kat Martin because she is simplistic (overly so, at times) and basically gives her readers plenty of sex (honesty from this reviewer). But, the woman needs a new editor! The writing contained tons of errors, the most glaring being that she does not capitalize titles for nobility. It should be the Earl of blah, blah! At one point Grace is called Lady Sharpe (her husband's last name, not his title), names are often mixed up and countless other errors occur that just added to my annoyance and made this novel unenjoyable.Not that it was completely horrible, but it seemed like a rough draft instead of the finished product."},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"Ethan, the British privateer (and earl) who yanks Lady Grace off another vessel in 1805, makes one very dashing hero -- as long as they're at sea. The relationship that develops despite his belief that Grace is the mistress of the traitor who sold information to the French -- information that led to Ethan's long, brutal imprisonment in France -- is spritely.But once they're back in England, it's as if these two lively characters never existed. He broods. She pines. He's hostile and distant, denying himself the physical relationship he had once enjoyed. She's bored. As are we. I also read The Bride's Necklace, the first book in this trilogy, but this is probably the last Kat Martin I will try."},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"This book is the opposite of the first in the series. In THE BRIDE'S NECKLACE I had a hard time getting into the book but it got better as it progressed. THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE started out very interesting but I lost interest in it in the second half.THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE began strong. Ethan is out to seek revenge on the man who killed his crew and betrayed him. Grace is that man's daughter. Ethan kidnaps Grace off a boat and takes her hostage. They eventually fall in love.My problems with this book began with Grace herself. She starts the book out very strong and the author constantly tells us how strong she is. By the end of the book she is practically crawling around begging forgiveness. Maybe if she had started weak it would be okay, but the dramatic change in her character didn't work for me. My second issue with the book is that you just want to yell at him to get over it already. Yes, he is upset, but he needs to leave or get over it. My goodness. His brooding and her begging are enough to drive the reader crazy.If you are a fan of Kat Martin, you might like this book. I have only read the Necklace series (so this is my second book by her). I have the final book in this series, but am hesitant to read it. I am sure I will eventually, but don't think I will ever read another Kat Martin book after that. I like books with a bit more wit and humor."},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"The second story in the \\"Bride's Necklace\\" trilogy is a fine addition indeed to this series. Ethan and Grace are well crafted characters and their conflict is truly a conflict in every sense of the word.Ethan Sharpe is seeking revenge after the traitor that was responsible for ship and crew being discovered and killed by the French. He seeks the one that paid for the monsters release from prison before the hangman could seek him justice. He claims Grace from another ship with plans to turn her over to the authorities once she gives up the location of her lover. Ethan is shocked though when Grace ends up being nothing like he thought she should be. When Grace finally admits her dark secret to Ethan he backs away from her. He can never love the woman that she is with her connection to the traitor, but the problem with this is...no matter how far he sails he can't get her out of his mind nor his heart. Will he allow himself to finally find peace and happiness, or will he let revenge take a bigger piece of his soul than it already has?Grace Chastain loves Ethan against her better judgement. She knows why he has turned from her, it still doesn't change the fact that her heart is his. Will she be strong enough to see this through and help her hearts desire settle his demons once and for all?This was a very good read! Ms. Martin as deftly woven her magic here!

Although she has never met Viscount Harmon Jeffries, she cannot sit by and allow her sire to hang from the gallows for treason even if he is guilty.British privateer captain of the Sea Witch Ethan Sharpe stops the Lady Anne at sea. He proclaims passenger Grace Chastain committed sedition having abetted a traitor to escape justice. Ethan abducts her onto his ship where he demands she tell him the whereabouts of her lover Harmon. Because of a promise she made, Grace fails to correct his error. Ethan is irate with himself because he is attracted to Grace, but outraged that she freed the man who sold his previous ship and crew to the French. Most of the men died while he lingered in prison. Since she remains obstinate, he decides to seduce his enemy's lover; he succeeds only to find he made love to a virgin. As they fall in love, he learns she is the daughter of his foe.Though the Regency audience will empathize with the demons that haunt Ethan and his understandable obsession towards the heroine's father accentuated by falling in love with his enemy's \\"mistress\\", Grace's courage whether it is on land or sea makes the tale. She is fabulous, abetting her father who she never met or challenging the sea captain she loves. Though the climax is too neatly and abruptly wrapped up, the sequel to the BRIDE'S NECKLACE, THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE is an intriguing Regency romantic suspense thriller that fans will enjoy and look forward to the jewelry moving on to the next protagonist.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"This story is just like reading the Bride's Trilogy by Kat Martin.

Although, THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE is not a prefect read, it is definitely better than its predecessor, THE BRIDE'S NECKLACE.The British privateer, Ethan Sharpe, will never forget. Tormenting images make him seek revenge savagely - revenge against a traitor - the man responsible for Ethan's lost crew. Harmon Jeffries is that responsible man. He is responsible for the horrific images that still haunt Ethan. Ethan still hears his men screaming and still sees their wasted blood. No, he will never forget his destroyed ship, his lost crew, or the miserable months he spent in confinement - his scars and the limp will forever remind him. Yes, revenge will be his, but for now Ethan Sharpe will take the woman who aided the traitor, who allowed his escape. Ethan will take and have Jeffries' mistress!Though she barely knows her biological father, Miss Grace Chastain refuses to abandon the man. Whether Harmon Jeffries is guilty or innocent, he is her father and she will not desert him. Shockingly, she aids his escape. Immediately, Grace is guilty of a terrible crime and she is going to pay - pay the price set by Captain Ethan Sharpe. \\"I'm a man, Miss Chastain. Men have certain needs . . .\\"Grace is not what Ethan imagined. She is ladylike, lovely, and doesn't have the usual world-weary look of a seasoned mistress. He grows to respect her and admire her. On the other hand, Grace Chastain is foolishly in love. She gives Ethan her body, her heart, and her soul. When Grace inescapably tells Ethan she is Jeffries' daughter and not his mistress, Ethan's warmth and affection ends . . . ends until the bewitchment of the Bride's Necklace takes hold.Kat Martin does a respectable job with this story. Her primary characters are likable and the story is easy and entertaining. And although, THE DEVIL'S NECKLACE is the second book in a trilogy, the reader will not suffer the 'who are these people' syndrome.Nitpicky nuisances:- pg. 65. \\"She . . . drew back and slapped him across the face as hard as she could.

Norris writes a historical / romance book in which Laura Dearborn finds herself in Chicago from Boston. Almost immediately, she is beset by a variety of suitors. However, she is most taken by Curtis Jadwin, a sophisticated businessman who is influential on the Chicago Board of Trade.After marrying Laura, the conservative speculator, after making a nice profit on the wheat market, becomes obsessive over controlling it. As the story unfolds, his wealth grows in a short period of time and for a while he captures the market. Ultimately, though, the market corrects itself and he must save his fortune as well as his wife, Laura, whose love begins to flee from lack of attention from Jadwin.I found this book very slow at the beginning. However, once the market traps Jadwin, the book becomes exciting and the pages fly by. Laura is a realistic character, although I didn't have a lot of sympathy for her - she come off rather spoiled and hapless. Norris's point about the addictiveness of speculating on wheat futures and the power that it has over the rest of the world is evident. A solid book and worth reading by those who like that period of time or are interested in Chicago's history."},{"Title":"The pit: A story of Chicago","review":"The second novel in an unfinished trilogy (THE OCTOPUS was the initial volume), it's the story of how a man's ruthless business ambitions drive a wedge between himself and the love of his wife. Curtis Jadwin speculates in the Chicago wheat market; his successes propel him into wanting to \\"corner the market,\\" which he proceeds to do. In the wake of all that \\"desire of the moth for the star,\\" as Shelley put it, is the detritus of ruined men committing suicide, failed health, and Jadwin's own crumbling marriage due to neglect. Indeed, his wife Laura almost succumbs to the attentions of another man, Sheldon Corthell, but is brought back to her husband's side when he becomes ill. The scenes with Laura are the least successful because they are the most melodramatic. Norris felt the need, of course, to put things on an even keel again before the story's close; thus Jadwin loses all his money on a poor gamble regarding a banner wheat harvest that sends the market reeling, which brings on his illness and the loyal Laura. All's well that ends well, as the couple head West to start a new, though financially poorer, life (in 1903 it was still possible to do that). Norris is at his best in the wheeling and dealing that occurs in the Chicago exchange: the writing there is exciting and crisp. This tale of greed vs. marital love is a good one, though not as powerful as THE OCTOPUS."},{"Title":"The pit: A story of Chicago","review":"\\"The Pit: A Story of Chicago\\" was the second novel in Frank Norris's projected trilogy \\"The Epic of the Wheat\\", \\"The Octopus\\" being the first. In the event, however, Norris died suddenly in October 1902 leaving the third installment, provisionally titled \\"The Wolf\\", unwritten.\\"The Pit\\" is in many ways a very different book from its predecessor. It is much shorter, being only just over half the length of \\"The Octopus\\". Whereas \\"The Octopus\\" was mostly rural in its setting, \\"The Pit\\" is entirely urban, with the whole of the action taking place in Chicago. \\"The Octopus\\" did not have a single protagonist, with several characters, all male, taking the leading role at different stages of the book. \\"The Pit\\", by contrast, concentrates on the fortunes of a single married couple, the wealthy businessman Curtis Jadwin and his wife Laura. What the two novels have in common, apart from the theme of wheat, is Norris's socialist world view and his critical attitude towards what he saw as capitalist greed.In \\"The Octopus\\", capitalism is represented by the powerful railroad company which ruthlessly uses its monopoly on transport to exploit the Californian wheat growers. In \\"The Pit\\" Norris's target is the commodity dealers at the Chicago Board of Trade, who can make or lose immense fortunes by speculating on the price of wheat and other commodities. The title \\"The Pit\\" refers to the trading floor of the Board of Trade, but in biblical language it can also be a synonym for Hell or the grave, as in Psalm 88. (\\"I am counted with them that go down into the Pit\\"). The dealers generally have little or no regard to the hardship which they inflict on others. The \\"Bears\\", who manipulate the market by artificially depressing the price of wheat, inflict hardship on American farmers. The \\"Bulls\\", who manipulate the market by artificially inflating the price, inflict hardship on the poor in those European countries which depend upon imports of American wheat; on the commodity exchange, unlike the stock market, a \\"bull market\\" is not necessarily a sign of economic prosperity. (If Norris is to be believed, Americans themselves at this period consumed more potatoes than bread).Jadwin has initially made his fortune in property, but soon, like many other wealthy men in Chicago, becomes involved with wheat speculation, which he sees as a quick and easy way to make money. He does so not because he is in need of money- his property business already brings him enough income to allow him to live in considerable luxury- but because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of making money for its own sake and because he enjoys the sense of power which being a successful speculator allows him. The note on the back of this edition describes Laura as his \\"brutally abused\\" wife, a description which strikes me as inaccurate. Jadwin is not guilty of physical violence towards Laura, or even deliberate emotional cruelty. His one great fault as a husband is that he becomes so obsessed with speculating that he neglects everything else, even his beautiful young wife.In \\"The Octopus\\" Norris's writing shows the influence of Emile Zola, but in \\"The Pit\\" it also shows the influence of another French writer, Flaubert, especially in the treatment of Laura Jadwin, who shares many traits with the heroine of \\"Madame Bovary\\". Like Emma Bovary, Laura is a born romantic, with a very romanticised view of love, and like Emma can also be impulsive and fickle. (Unlike Emma, however, she is never physically unfaithful to her husband, although she is sorely tempted). Much of the early part of the novel deals with the courtship of Jadwin and Laura, who also has two other suitors for her hand. One of these, Landry Court who eventually marries Laura's sister Page, is a fairly minor character, but the other, a young artist named Sheldon Corthell, plays a more important role. In many ways Corthell would seem to be the ideal soul-mate for Laura, with whom he is deeply in love, as the two have many interests in common, and yet he fails to win her because, paradoxically, the two are so similar. Laura is not looking for a soul-mate but rather for a man who is the exact opposite of herself, someone strong and forceful whom she can look up to and admire. She has little interest in business itself, but sees in the dynamic businessman Jadwin the strong man whom she has been seeking, even though she is unsure whether she loves him. The opposition of commerce (represented by Jadwin) and of art (represented by Corthell) is one of the major themes of the book, with the former being seen as something \\"masculine\\" and the latter as something \\"feminine\\".Norris is sometimes described as a \\"naturalist\\" writer, but \\"The Pit\\" is not a \\"naturalist\\" novel, if by that term is meant a novel which deals with the darker side of human life, poverty, vice and crime. All the main characters are from the wealthy or well-to-do classes, and their actions, although often immoral, never stray into the criminal. As Professor Joseph McElrath points out in his introduction, Norris did not, unlike some naturalist writers, take a purely deterministic view of human nature. Rather, his is a moral universe where his characters have moral choices open to them. It is this idea of moral choice which unites the two sides of the novel, the public and the private, into a coherent whole. The two are linked by the theme of selfishness; Jadwin is driven by ruthless self-interest both in pursuit of his business aims and in his treatment of Laura (although it must be admitted that she can on occasions be just as self-centred as her husband). The book's irony is that Jadwin's ruthlessness proves to be his undoing as he finds himself unable to control the economic forces he has set in motion; believing that he can corner the wheat market, he ultimately finds that the wheat has cornered him.I preferred \\"The Pit\\" to \\"The Octopus\\", which contains some powerful writing but suffers from a less coherent structure and an overly optimistic ending. Certainly, in some respects, especially its attitude towards the role of women in society, \\"The Pit\\" is very much a novel of its time. In other respects, however, it has a great deal of relevance to modern society. Men like Curtis Jadwin are as much a part of the capitalist system today as they were a hundred years ago; he has much in common with the villain of a twenty-first century novel, John Veals in Sebastian Faulks's \\"A Week in December\\". Apart from its analysis of greed, the book also contains a fine analysis of a failing marriage, worthy in this respect to rank alongside the likes of \\"Madame Bovary\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\"."},{"Title":"The pit: A story of Chicago","review":"This is a classic novel about ego, business and financial speculation. Its about the rise of a grain trader in Chicago who gradually gets \\"bigger\\" in the business until he finally attempts to \\"corner\\" the market. The best part about the novel is how timeless it is. The observations about the practicalities of fighting the market, the realities of \\"business journalism\\", the mentality which allows these people to be unaware of the consequences of their actions and the whole lifestyle of those involved are still as true today as they were when the book was written.Norris tells the story in an evenhanded way and presents an accurate picture of the major characters rather than using them as political sockpuppets. As he did with the farmers in \\"the Octopus\\", he gives the characters a complexity in that they can be both sympathetic victims and exploiters. One of the high points for me is how he shows the bubble world of the traders while at the same time, showing the effects their actions are having in the real world and how divorced they are from the consquences of their actions.The book is also the story of a relationship and a marriage. That story is often interesting in and of itself. But at times it seems like \\"filler\\" in what would have otherwise been a small book.The best part of the book is the final confrontation in \\"the pit\\". Its a dramatic ending worthy of the story and makes the very clear point that ultimately the market cannot be controlled by any individual for long."},{"Title":"The pit: A story of Chicago","review":"Except for the language and gender roles, which date this book from its publication in 1902, The Pit could have been written about any form of speculation to which greedy executives have succumbed. The Pit happens to be about the speculation in wheat at the turn of the last century, which is appropriate given the agrarian nature of the American economy at that time. However, you could exchange any number of commodities for wheat in this story - oil, mortgages, stocks, dot-coms, and you would see the very timely similarities.Curtis Ladwin is a man who already has more money than he could ever use or need, but he's addicted to the art of the deal, and thrill of thinking two steps ahead of his competitors. To the detriment of his health, his family and his finances, he continues to chase long after the tide has turned. \\"I haven't cornered the wheat. The wheat has cornered me.\\"Frank Norris is one of my favorite novelists from this time period because his stories are still amazingly readable and relevant. Some authors from the early 1900s are almost impossible to read now, so ridden are their books with linguistic acrobatics. Aside from some melodramatic histrionics in the domestic scenes, the language that Norris uses is remarkably plain-spoken and contemporary in feel.I've only reduced the book from five stars to four because I believe it is melodramatic in the domestic scenes. I understand that these over-the-top dramatics are commonplace in novels from this period, but I have seen domestic scenes of this type written better, and I know that Frank Norris was capable of a lighter touch."},{"Title":"The pit: A story of Chicago","review":"\`The Pit' is a story of speculation on the price of wheat in the Chicago wheat exchange (the \`Pit') at a moment when agriculture was the main industry in the world.As Frank Norris tells us: speculation \`is a matter of life and death', not for the speculators (\`the fellows in the Pit don't care about the grain'), but for the farmers and the world population, because the speculators \`say just how much the peasant shall pay for his loaf of bread. If he can't pay the price, he simply starves.'The price is also vital for the world economy: \`Because of some sudden eddy spinning outward in the middle of the Pit's turmoil, a dozen bourses of continental Europe clamored with panic, a dozen Old-World banks trembled.'An \`Unknown Bull' succeeds in cornering the wheat market sending the price to dizzying heights. But his greed is also his fall. The high prices attract farmers all over the world to grow a bumper crop: \`It was as if the Wheat, Nourisher of the Nations, as it rolled gigantic and majestic in a vast flood from West to East, here, like a Niagara, finding its flow impeded, burst suddenly into the appalling fury of the Malstrom.'The rough and tumble of the \`Pit' is paralleled by a story about an innocent maiden. She also chooses the speculator, \`always cruel, selfish, pitiless, the fighter, rigorous, panoplied in the harness of the warrior', instead of the artist \`and his cult of the beautiful, soft of hand and speech, refined, sensitive and temperamental.'This novel, whose subject is still very topical, is sometimes not without a certain sentimentality and theatricality.

With its dated language and pre-PC attitudes toward sex and gender roles, it portrays a simpler time.

Laura Jadwin, nee Dearborn, tells most of the story.

This text will be particularly useful to beginning principals (hence the 5 star rating) but there is still a lot in the book for experienced principals too.I though that four approaches developed by Glickman were useful and table 4.2 (\\"Interpersonal approaches, outcomes, and levels of choice,\\" p.44) was an excellent overview of the parameters of the four approaches. The developmental nature of the four approaches can be seen in Figure 6.1:Directive control- Emergency, infrequent casesDirective-informational- Beginning of greater teacher choiceCollaborative- Collegial reflectionNon-directive- Masterful teacher, infrequent cases.Figure 6.1 Moving towards teacher control on on the leader behavior continuum.From my own experience, I don't think that the number of masterful teachers is infrequent. And, teachers needing directive control don't stay in this category for long because parent complaints and principal supervision will move them on or move them out. However, it is our job to see that masterful teachers are helped in continuing to do a great job for the kids. The four types of supervisory approaches do not represent a normal distribution but a distribution that is skewed to the right. That is, the majority of teachers across states will fit into the collabrative and non-directive categories.The book is a timely reminder about the importance of driving school change from the teacher-student interface. It is a valuable addition to all school leaders' professional libraries."},{"Title":"Leadership for Learning: How to Help Teachers Succeed","review":"The follow-up book to Developmental Supervision, Carl Glickman's Leadership For Learning: How To Help Teachers Succeed is an excellent and accessible guide packed with practical advice and fascinating insights for educators at all levels, preschool through university.

One is the doctrine that salvation is through personal faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. Our postmodern world wants to embrace the idea that all can be saved apart from personal, saving faith in Jesus (John 5:24-25; 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 10:14-17). The second doctrine that is under attack is the doctrine of eternal punishment in hell for those who are not disciples of Jesus. Even evangelicals such as John Stott reject the doctrine of eternal torment in hell.Yet this book by Robert Peterson defends the traditional view of hell. Peterson writes with grace toward those who disagree but he writes with clear and excellent exegesis of the major passages that deal with hell. He lays out a defense for hell and shows from the Bible that the doctrine was clearly taught by Jesus Himself.Overall every disciple should read this book and search the Scriptures about the doctrine of hell. It is not a loved doctrine but it is biblical and we must embrace it. If we hold to the reformation principle that the Bible is the sole place for faith and practice and that the Scriptures are the final authority, then we must embrace the doctrine of hell."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"The author gives various views of peoples' thinking on hell, 4 of which are wrong.

It is excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"Nearly everyone who has died since the creation of the world is currently in hell. They face eternal punishment and torment without relief. This does not merely refer to evil people. It is all encompassing, save the sliver of people who have been truly born again. In today's world, if you were to meet a human chosen at random from the entire planet, he has a one-in-six chance of being Indian. He has another one-in-five chance of being Chinese. These are countries where the gospel barely has a foothold. Most Christians choose not to think about the fact that the majority of the planet dies without the echo of the gospel in their country- much less in their family or in their own ears.The strength of Robert Peterson's Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment is that it confronts the Christian with those facts. It seems that most of today's Christians refuse to acknowledge the reality of hell. They have trained themselves not to think about it and have thus divorced contemporary evangelicalism from one of its main fountains of missionary impetus. Those that do contemplate the Bible's teaching about hell seem to swerve into universalism of some sort. The common church member does not understand the terrible things that the Bible teaches about hell. Peterson confronts his readers with the truth of the Bible and he does so in a polemic but thorough and convincing way.This book presents an argument for Peterson's view of hell. It is very well organized and overly fair to the opposing views. It is both convincing and careful not to overstate the point. He does not misrepresent those who disagree with him, which enables his confidence that the Bible really is on his side to be seen.Patterson establishes the truth of his doctrine of hell in both the Scripture and in church history, and then shows the down-ward trends in contemporary thinking about hell. New views are emerging and old heresies are being resurrected. As post-modernism and relativism abound, they wage war on the truth about hell.However, it is in these sections where the fairness and reliability of Peterson is seen. He treats his opponents with respect and accurately represents their views. With one view- annihilationism- Peterson said that no one person presented a strong and thorough case to defend it. So, Peterson combined the strongest arguments that had been put forth, added another one that he came up with, and thus crafted an extremely thorough defense of this false doctrine. In other words, he made their argument stronger than they were able to make it. And then he showed that even this improved argument still woefully falls short of what the Bible teaches about hell.Peterson is so convincing because he shows exactly why his opponents believe what they believe. \\"Notice that he (Hick) rejects hell on moral grounds\\" (140). \\"Again, Hick buttresses his theological assertions with a moral argument\\" (141). Time and time again, Peterson shows his readers that arguments against the Bible's teaching of hell do not have their source in exegesis, but rather philosophy and moralism. He paints the landscape as containing basically two sides- those who use Scripture and those who use their own judgment.However, Peterson does not stop there. He shows how terrible hell is, and makes the point that if it were up to us and our reason there may very well be no hell. Of course when others use their own sense of fairness to determine eschatology hell would be non-existent or \\"incompatible with love\\" (141). However, truth is not determined based on man's definition of either love or fairness, but on the word of God; which is precisely why Peterson's constant return to the Scripture showed his confidence that he was right.A glaring weakness is his treatment of babies who die (235-36). Peterson claims that the Bible teaches that the children of redeemed parents go to heaven. He uses verses that show the children of Israelites going to heaven, and concludes that this doctrine is somehow limited to the families of those in the covenant family relationship. This aside, Peterson's book is a convincing treatment of the doctrine of hell. It serves as a wake-up call to those who have trained their minds not to think about such things. It clearly draws the battle-line between truth and error and shows his readers exactly what the Bible teaches about hell. He labors to show the terrible nature of hell, and to show that if a person rejects the Bible's teaching about hell they are doing so for intellectual and moral reasons, but certainly not for biblical ones. It is highly recommended because it is careful, clear, and concise."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"My purpose for reading this book was to get a firm explaination from a believer in eternal torment not only what is the biblical proof for the nature of Hell being eternal torment, but also to explain the many verses in the bible which also describe the nature of Hell being final (\\"destruction\\", \\"perish\\", etc). This book did not satisfy either objective.It is so easy to proof-text this topic--to presuppose so many things about what Hell is and then read those things into the scriptures. Case and point from the author (p 178): \\"...I do not believe the traditional view of hell because I accept the immortality of human beings. I believe in the immortality of human beings because the Bible clearly teaches everlasting damnation for the wicked and everlasting life for the righteous.\\" This view, I believe, is the crux of the problem for \\"proving\\" eternal torment. Shouldn't a conclusion like the one this author makes drive us to ask additional questions such as, \\"does the Bible discuss whether human beings have immortality\\"? To accept that by way of a mention of eternal torment this means humans have immortality is a leap of logic and is not exegesis of the scripture.I believe the lie Satan told Eve, \\"You shall not surely die\\" is one which is still alive and well to this day. Even the author's discussion on SHEOL has no conclusion on the subject--he says it may mean the grave, or it may mean a holding place of departed human spirits. Understanding SHEOL is a key component to this discussion, and I wish he had been more thorough in his discussion. His conclusion was not based on any biblical exegesis.On the book itself, the author has some very good bible-based sections on Judgement in the Old Testament, and this is true--There is Judgement by a Holy God--but the author then makes a leap to the conclusion of eternal torment. He relies extensively on quoting other people as proof for his position. While this may be acceptable in scholarly work, the Bible needs to interpret the Bible, and we shouldn't draw conclusions on what others have concluded. Regarding his comments against Annihilationism, he again does not use the Bible to disprove those arguments but rather uses his own conclusions (which he came to in previous chapters) to disprove them.I will continue to look for resources which use Biblical exegesis to answer my questions, however, praise God that Salvation is not dependant on a complete understanding of the nature of Hell. Our Salvation comes from believing in Jesus Christ!"},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"For the purpose of full disclosure, I am an annihiltionist, one of the people Peterson says need to \\"repent and submit to God's glory by submitting their minds to the truth\\" (pg. 89). I obviously disagree Peterson's ultimate conclusions, and seldom give good reviews to books that try to prove the bible really does teach eternal torment (since I obviously think they fail). However, this is among the worst I have come across.For starters, like my title indicates, it is packed with emotional appeals and personal attacks, the kind of things my side is usually accused of. Hardly a single chapter goes by without a mini-sermon on the importance of adhering to the traditional doctrine out of compassion for the lost. He brands universalism as \\"evil\\" and literally says it is a sin to hold that belief (pg. 156). While I don't agree with universalists, not all universalists believe the doctrine because they refuse to submit to God - some actually do base it on exegesis (although I ultimately think they fail, as does Peterson). He argues against annihilationism because it will lead unbelievers to underestimate their fate, that they won't repent if they don't think they will be tortured forever. Call me crazy, but if they aren't going to repent when told of Jesus and the prospect of eternal life, then I might dare say they don't believe in Jesus! The cross is foolishness to those who perish (1 Cor. 1:18). Not everyone believes, and I hardly would think a lot of people believe but willfully choose against God because they believe in annihilation instead of eternal torment. We don't scare people into heaven - someone who, not knowing any better, \\"converts\\" out of fear and not genuine faith is going to the same Hell either way (whatever its nature).Along those lines, in the conclusion of the book, he looks at two hypothetical pastors. The one who does not preach about Hell is not only seen as a bad pastor (which I could understand - if eternal torment were true), but Peterson actually implies that he is damned, reasoning that failing to preach to his parishioners about Hell is \\"lullabying them to Hell\\" and is tantamount to leading in children to sin (cf Matt. 18:5-6). I kid you not (pg. 236-237).And though not an important point, he several times appeals directly to unbelievers. What unbeliever would read this book in the first place?EXEGESIS:Peterson does address the scriptures at times, but not successfully. Many of his points revolve around Revelation 20:10. How do we know that \\"eternal fire\\" of Matthew 25:41 refers to eternal torment? Because the Devil is eternally tormented in Revelation 20;10. How do we know that God being \\"all-in-all\\" and putting \\"all things in heaven and on earth under one head, even Christ\\" (1 Cor. 15:28 and Eph. 1:10, NIV) doesn't indicate eradication of evil? Because the end of Revelation teaches eternal torment.He makes unwarranted assumptions. Any claim of separation requires eternal existence. Why? I don't know. He just says it presupposes it. Obviously one needs to be alive at the moment of separation, but what if separation is the cause of the eternal extinction? That isn't even touched upon.Many solid annihilationist arguments are completely ignored or misunderstood. Regarding Revelation 20:10, he barely addresses any of them, for as he admits 12 years later, he didn't understand them (in \\"Fallacies in the Annihilationism Debate? A Response to Glenn Peoples\\" in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological society, 2007, free online).He argues that \\"proper theological methodology involves allowing New Testament writers to move beyond their Old testament background in keeping with the progress of revelation\\" (pg 63). In other words, in verses where the Old Testament is either quoted or clearly alluded to, it is actually improper to take into account what the Old Testament said! This explains a lot when reading his take Mark 9:48, as well as Revelation 14:9-11 (where he makes no mention of the Old testament use of almost identical language in Isaiah 34:9-10).He uses \\"weeping and gnashing of teeth\\" as proof of torment and pain, despite the fact that, despite the way that phrase is used today, it suggests sadness and anger, not pain. Look up the descriptions of gnashing of teeth in the Old Testament - they speak of anger, not pain. And weeping can mean all kinds of things.He uses the NIV almost exclusively. Generally, I like the NIV - I probably use it more than any others. However, it is not the most literal version, and they do take some big interpretational liberties, especially when dealing with eternal punishment. Compare Jude 7, Mark 9:43, Luke 16:23, and 2 Thessalonians 1:9 in NIV with any more literal version (NASB, ESV, KJV, NKJV, RSV. NRSV, etc). Peterson's arguments on these passages rely on the unique, traditionalist-friendly interpretations (not literal Greek translations) of the NIV.One chapter is devoted to the view of the church throughout history. Interestingly, he starts in the third century with Tertullian. Never mind that some of the earliest and most influential Christian leaders from the 1st and 2nd century (such as Ignatius of Antioch and Ireneus of Lyons) were explicitly conditionalists (which might give some background on the early church's view on the meaning of 'eternal fire\\" and \\"eternal punishment,\\" which the conditionalist fathers speak of).Regarding the language of destruction seen throughout the New Testament (i.e Matt 10:28), he basically argues to the effect of \\"well, the rest of the bible teaches eternal torment, so it must not be literal destruction.\\" At least other such traditionalist writings have attempted to make a serious case regarding the actual texts in question, usually by pointing to the ambiguity of the Greek words involved. As is the case in much of the book, he relies on systematic theology and the idea that what the bible says on the whole interprets passages. A legitimate practice on its face, but he takes it too far.In general, there are just simply lots of emotional arguments, the occasional non sequitur, and exegesis of prooftexts that offers nothing new. The study is shallow; seldom are any serious or strong arguments against traditionalism dealt with. It's easy to argue against universalism when you devote 2/3 of the chapter against the teaching of an individual theologian who essentially denies the deity of Christ and the authority of scripture...If you believe in eternal torment and just want to feel good about yourself and get a pat on the back from a respected theologian, then buy this book. If you, whatever your view, are looking for a serious study of scripture, run."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"Those of you who waded through Mary Baxter's &quot;A Divine Revelation of Hell&quot; realize that her cartoon version of hell is nothing like what the Bible teaches. Robert Peterson limits his teaching about hell to what he can find in the Bible, thus making his book a true divine revelation of hell. While all about us, those who claim the name of Christ are either denying its existence (universalism), or its eternality (annihilationism), Mr. Peterson sticks to his guns and gives a careful, exegetical defense of hell. Not since W. G. T. Shedd's &quot;Doctrine of Endless Punishment&quot; have I seen such a valuable addition to the literature on this subject. Besides his careful exegesis of the relevant Scriptures, Peterson also interacts with and refutes the writings of men such as Edward Fudge, John Stott, and Clark Pinnock. If you can only afford one book on hell, this is the one to buy. You will find it indispensable."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"Hell is not a pleasant subject.

Based on my experience with this book, and having had Peterson for a class, I would read any book that Peterson writes."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"Hell is a subject that is hard to deal with. This is the kind of subject most people just don't want to read in the Bible. This is the kind of subject most people seem to run screaming from because they think it is \\"mean\\" and \\"hard\\" to speak about what is true, that Hell is true. Even churches have done their best to white out all messages of the Bible concerning Hell. On the one hand, you want to know that there is some sort of justice in the universe we live in. On the other hand, you fear the idea that there will be a place for those who go into eternity lacking something. Hell is the subject that many ministers, sadly, fear studying and exploring in case of \\"scaring off\\" members of the church or \\"being intolerant\\" by members of the church. But Hell is a very important subject because it is a very real place. To read the Bible and not realize that there is a place of sentencing and judgment for those who choose to turn their backs on the Truth, you are then failing in your readings. Hell on Trial by Robert A. Peterson is an important book that all church leaders, church members, and even seminary students need to read. The book explores the very real truth that the Bible shows that there are those who will go to Hell when they die...why? Because they fail to go into eternity without trust in Yahweh through Yeshua, I say this as we are living in the Church Age heading toward to the Last Days as found in both Testaments.The point that so many people who do not believe in hell, much less not believe in the truth of Lucifer and demons and fallen angels, fail to truly comprehend what and who Yahweh is, especially what and who Yahweh is through the Son, Messiah Yeshua. On the one hand yes, GOD is love, on the other hand, GOD is also Holy. That means that GOD loves us so much that He has given us the Free Will to choose Him... remember we are a fallen race, fallen with our first father Adam and first mother Eve. He loves us so much that He makes us choose the choice: Are we going to follow the LORD? Or are we going to turn away from the LORD? If we turn toward the LORD, Yahweh, then we are accepting the Way, the Truth, and the Life. We are accepting life here and life eternal with the LORD. If we turn away from the LORD, Yahweh, then we are not accepting the Way, the Truth, and the Life. We are not accepting life here and life eternal with the LORD. On the one hand, we have Messiah Yeshua as our Savior, on the other hand, we fail what is true.Remember Messiah Yeshua is the one who taught us most about Hell. Again and again He warns us that if we do not follow Him, if we do not take up our cross, if we do not place our trust in Him, then we face everlasting Hell...remember the story of Lazarus and the Rich Man...remember the story of the faithless servant...remember the story of the wise virgins and the foolish virgins. Again and again Messiah Yeshua, who is the very visible truth of Yahweh, for He is Yahweh, tells us that in our free will we either accept Heaven with the LORD or Hell without the LORD. Furthermore, remember what Messiah Yeshua shows to the Apostle John as we read the truth in the Book of Revelation. We see that there will be a judgment for those who come into eternity without the LORD, those who think they can go into eternity and be blessed based only on their good works and not the blood of Christ. The Great White Throne of Judgment shows that there will certainly be judgment for all those, great and small, rich and poor, \\"wise\\" and \\"foolish\\" will face the very judgment of Messiah Yeshua. And they will be condemned. Why? Because all religions do not lead to the same GOD. Because all the good works we do cannot save us. Because we are sinners, plain and simple, and GOD must judge those sins of ours (if we go into eternity without the blood of Christ) because if He doesn't, then He is not a GOD of good, then He is not a GOD of holiness."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"I found this book to be very useful and informative, well written and insightful.

He mixes careful scholarship and biblical prowess to defend the traditional, orthodox, and historical view of eternal damnation. And with a pastors heart, he pleads with people to turn to Christ.

This volume is an important contribution to the debate. Peterson walks the reader through a historical-theological survey of the doctrine. This serves to reinforce what we already know to be the historical position of the church in all orthodox forms: Eternal, conscious torment of the reprobate in hell. After establishing the historicity of the position Peterson dismantles all opposition. He fairly treats the arguments to the contrary and also establishes an exegetical and biblical-theological defense of the orthodox position.While there has been dissenters on this issue in times past, universal salvation has always been outside the bounds of orthodoxy. This volume also shows the position of Annihilation to be untenable and harmful to the character of God."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"Is Hell a real, physical place, with real, physical torment for all time? Will those who do not accept Christ be thrown into Hell? This is a pressing issue in today's world, because nonjudgmental moralism is the reigning belief of the day -logical or not. Dr. Robert Peterson's response in Hell on Trial is a useful, if sometimes flawed, response to the modern lack of acceptance of God. Dr. Peterson's book is arranged in three basic sections providing an introduction, a set of witnesses, and finally a set of proofs for Hell. The witnesses are arranged historically; he begins with the Old Testament, and ends with modern false witnesses who deny that Hell exists. Along the way he visits each era of history, examining the Scriptures or contemporary writings show the importance of Hell within Jewish and Christian thinking.The first point of Dr. Peterson's book is that the idea of God judging those who don't obey his moral code is well attested in the Tanach. While the point is well taken, the words \\"judgment\\" and \\"punishment\\" have modern overtones that perhaps make them unfortunate words for describing God's interaction with the disobedient -the modern usages have overtones of unreasonableness, or even unwarranted action or belief (much like our modern misconstruing of the word faith). It's difficult to imagine what words to replace \\"judgment\\" and \\"punishment\\" with, however. Perhaps any discussion of Hell needs to be preceded by a discussion of these two words, and what they really mean in the context of God's dealings with man.At the same time, the world needs to be confronted with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, because this is just the type of action the modern worldview so strongly objects to. The message of \\"nonjudgmentalism\\" is spread far and wide, even though it is self-defeating (logic isn't a strong point of modern worldviews). Love isn't just mercy repackaged in another term, it's a packaging of judgment and mercy to the ultimate good of the object of love.The second point Dr. Peterson brings to the conversation is the doctrine of Hell is well attested by Yeshua and the writings of the Apostles. He spends one chapter in the Gospel of Matthew, one in the remaining three Gospels, and one in Acts and the remaining epistles. The testimony isn't as strong here simply because these epistles weren't normally written as systematic theologies, but either as particular theology (Paul addressing salvation in Romans, for instance), or as letters on Christian behavior and conduct (how to arrange a church, how to live with one another, the relationship between personal morality and relationship with God).The third point is that belief in Hell as a literal place of eternal torment is the historical norm within Christianity. Dr. Peterson uses two chapters to discuss this point, one from the death of the Apostles to the Reformation, the second picking up in the Reformation and moving to the modern Church. The second of these two chapters doesn't provide as strong of a witness as the first, simply because once the Reformation was in full swing, a number of teachers and systems bubbled to the surface that deny the author's central tenants on Hell. The final point is that systems determined to do away with Hell simply don't have Scriptural support, and Hell does fit into the Scriptural witness and the remaining pieces of a general system of theology.The strengths of this work revolve around its systemization of the problem in hand, both in time and in theology. While a defense of Hell from the Scriptures can be extremely strong, this is meeting the skeptics on their own ground, reducing the argument to one of hermeneutics and translations. Expanding the argument to a system of theology brings the argument back onto favorable ground. Any doctrine of Hell must stand within an entire system, including salvation (salvation from what?), justice (if some consequences are eternal, all must be eternal), and the character of God.Any doctrine of Hell must also include the general historical witness. While the Church fathers might not be trustworthy witnesses on all things (or perhaps even many things), it is only in encountering the worldviews of those outside your time that you learn to deal with divergent worldviews and systems of thought.The weaknesses of this work, however, are many. A number of unanswered questions remain after the last page of the book is finished. Why should it be that Hell isn't really described in the Tanach? This seems like a powerful argument against the concept of an eternal Hell that the author doesn't raise or address. Why should so much of what we know about Hell come from the lips of Jesus? Critics often raise the possibility that Jesus spoke about Hell only because it was in common currency at the time of the Incarnation, rather than its importance and reality. There isn't a strong or well thought out answer to this question here.Dr. Peterson sometimes contradicts himself on hermeneutical issues, as well. For instance, on page 63, he argues: \\"Second, proper theological methodology involves allowing the New Testament writers to move beyond their Old Testament background in keeping with the progress of revelation. Fudge errs by reading his supposed meaning of Isaiah 66:24 into the New Testament, where it does not fit.\\" The concept of allowing the Apostles to \\"move beyond\\" the meaning of the original text, to give the text of the Tanach meaning the original author could not understand, is problematic, at best. If we allow the New Testament authors to put words in the mouths of the Jewish writers in the Tanach, we have opened an entire interpretive process that is difficult to stop, and yet leads in directions antithetical to the defense of Hell the author is presenting.There are connectivity failures, as well, within the author's argument. For instance, Dr. Peterson does a good job of laying out the case for punishment in the second chapter, but then seemingly fails to connect this defense to the systematic approach in chapter eleven. Certainly the justice of God demands the punishment of those who break his moral code, but this idea doesn't find strong expression in the systematic view of the problem of Hell.Finally, Dr. Peterson leaves out one idea that strongly supports the doctrine of Hell, and has strong Scriptural support -the idea of eternal death. There is often, in the modern mind, the idea that only those justified by the death and resurrection of Christ are slated for eternal existence because of the terminology used: eternal life and eternal death. The problem is that life has two distinct meanings in the Scriptures, the first mean existence, the second meaning fullness. Part of the annihilationist's intuitive case is the opposite of eternal life (in the sense of existence) is destruction. But this case represents a slippage of meaning, using \\"life\\" in one sense at one stage of the argument, and another sense at another stage of the argument. In reality, the opposite of eternal life isn't destruction, but eternal death. It's difficult for the modern mind to conceive of death-in-existence because of the strongly naturalistic categories with which we use these terms.Overall, Dr. Peterson's work is a strong defense of the doctrine of Hell. It could be a stronger apologetic, but there are few apologies that cannot be made stronger with by covering additional angles, or adding on additional concepts."},{"Title":"Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment","review":"I've read this book to understand the arguments for eternal punishment.

For example, on page 133 Peterson writes:\\"the doctrine of Christ's vicarious atonement, logically, stands or falls with that of endless punishment.\\"Peterson is quoting another author here to make his point (which he does a lot). Peterson doesn't come right out and say that eternal punishment is essential Christian doctrine, but he certainly implies it and I would suspect he holds this belief. Here's the truth: Christ's atonement stands alone in its sufficiency!Another gasping moment came just in the preceding paragraph when Peterson quotes the same author:\\"Punishment satisfies justice.\\"Well, good luck trying to satisfy the scales of justice when sin is on one side and conscious torment is on the other. Sin's weight is infinite and even the most severe torment administered for eternity cannot even come close to balancing that scale. Sin's debt can only be satisfied through the Blood of Christ or death. It is impossible to satisfy justice with eternal torment (and eternal attempts in that direction are futile). Again, Peterson doesn't expressly state this belief himself, but he says it through others and it indirectly communicates his views, in my opinion. Here's the truth: the blood of Eternal Torment cannot satisfy justice, but the blood of Christ can!Matthew 10:28 (NIV)Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.Peterson directly makes the argument that to \\"destroy both soul and body in hell\\" is really to \\"experience the ruin of their whole persons.\\" He says that Matthew 10:28 is clear in its meaning and that \\"destruction\\" doesn't mean to be destroyed, but rather it means to be punished with forfeiture of all that is worthwhile in human existence. In the next paragraph he says that \\"destruction\\" really means to be thrown into hell. Peterson in a later chapter quotes another author who says \\"destroy\\" really means a \\"never-ending killing\\" (p. 99). Peterson wraps up his definition of \\"destruction\\" on page 194 where he states that it means \\"the eternal ruin of all that is worthwhile in human existence.\\"Matthew 10:28 is crystal clear in its meaning in that we are instructed not to fear man who can only kill the body, but we should fear God who can destroy us fully (soul and body). His attempts to explain Matthew 10:28 leads one to conclude that we should not fear man who can only ruin us temporarily, but to fear God who can ruin us eternally. Really? Gasp!Peterson concludes that \\"destruction\\" has to mean \\"eternal ruin\\" because it is the only way it fits with the rest of Scripture. Gasp!My shortness of breath continues on page 198 where Peterson defines \\"death\\" as the perpetual separation from God's eternal life. With this definition, irreconcilable differences are produced when immortality is a certainty for everyone and death is defined to really mean to live in a bad eternal state. Actually Peterson makes the case that no one is ever separated from God and that God is fully present in Heaven and in Hell, and that both existences are lived eternal...one joyous and one under wrath. But, I think it is safe to assume he means that death is a perpetual separation from God's eternal life in Heaven when he speaks of death. Death, then, becomes defined as eternal life in hell.The case for eternal punishment hinges on this definition of death; how ironic, then, is it that the first recorded lie ever told by Satan requires death to be defined?\\"You will not certainly die\\" (Genesis 3:4)Before reading this book, everyone will have to choose their definition of death to either mean to cease to exist or to exist under God's wrath. Was Satan's lie that we certainly will not cease to exist? Was Satan's lie that we certainly will not live in hell. You decide. As you can see, we start off with a huge problem when death is interpreted as meaning two totally different things. Gasp!This book was very enlightening and, for me, it had the opposite effect of the authors intent. Whatever your beliefs may be regarding hell, this is a good book to read. It will help to give a basis for the belief in eternal punishment, or help clarify the points of objection. There are some very serious holes in the the case for eternal punishment as outlined in this book. I had many gasping moments reading this book!"},{"Title":"Charles Olson: The Allegory of a Poet's Life","review":"Found the book to lead me on great imaginings.

There have been other non-Muslims and Muslims who have written about the travel, which is one of the five pillars of Islam (the others being profession of faith, prayer, fasting, and alms giving). All Muslims who are able are obligated to take the hajj once in their lives. There are few modern accounts of the pilgrimage, which has become commercialized and, for those who have the money, routine. Now there is a unique account, from Abdellah Hammoudi, a professor of anthropology at Princeton University, who determined that he would undertake the hajj in 1999 for the purpose of writing a book on anthropological aspects of his trip. Any pilgrim has a journey unlike any other pilgrim, but Hammoudi's effort, chronicled in _A Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage_ (Hill and Wang) is distinct. He is not a believer like his other fellow pilgrims, even the friends he goes with. \\"I am not contemptuous of religions; I believe that under certain conditions they allow for expression of major existential dilemmas and encourage reconciliation on a grand scale.\\" He grew up in Morocco, and was raised as a Muslim, which he says he still is, but a secular one. And so his journey set up conflicts from the start that he analyzes scrupulously at length, and which never really become resolved: \\"I couldn't possibly be an observer plain and simple, whether hostile and distant or friendly and admiring of Islam.\\" He also had constantly to analyze his own participation in the ritual; can anthropologists rightly study cultures in which they are themselves taking part? Can the hajj have any value if undertaken in a secular vein?These questions, and those having to do with the basic personal meaning of the hajj, will perhaps be less interesting for most readers than the stories of preparation and the travelogue of the journey, told with good humor in a readable translation from the French (by Pascale Ghazaleh). For instance, Hammoudi had to submit thirty passport-style photographs and six copies of his birth certificate. He had to fill out a file on himself, and had to enlist the help of someone who knew someone. Of course, just filling in the forms would not do; he had to give a sum of money to a government employee (\\"which we decided to call \`alms'\\") in order to lubricate the process. Once he was fully registered, he could not simply pack up and go. He had to be trained into what he was about to undergo, for violation of minor rules would invalidate the hajj and make it as if he had never participated at all. There were constant conflicts with commerce. One of Hammoudi's fellow pilgrims even says that the hajj is \\"a merchants' conspiracy.\\" There is an obsession with purchasing suitcases, suitcases that will hold other purchases that are brought back home from the hajj, souvenirs for those left behind. The commercial aspects of the hajj were only one of the disappointments Hammoudi had to face. He was continually confronted with the segregation from women, which is stricter in Saudi Arabia than in his Moroccan home. Pilgrims were eager to criticize others; one pious man pointed out, \\"Our neighbors prayed behind our women. Their prayer is invalid.\\" Hammoudi is disgusted by those who declare themselves the ones who have an absolute right to interpret the prophet's words for others. He is dismayed by the obvious differences between Shiites and Sunnis and the Wahhabi brand of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia.It sounds a troublesome way to take a vacation, indeed. Hammoudi was, however, not just moved by the sad events that gives his narrative an overall \\"Ship of Fools\\" tone. There are surges of joy he describes, such as when he visits Mohammed's tomb. He describes the circling crowd at the Kaaba and being overcome with emotion and tears, and is willing to leave behind any negative lessons he has learned. \\"Now I understood the meaning of certain statements I had often heard: \`What happiness to be here! How good God's grace is... What joy one feels at seeing all this!\\" Many of the pages of _A Season in Mecca_ have to do with an intellectual's attempts to come to an objective understanding of the many strange events which compose a hajj, but the subjectivity and ineffability of faith keep breaking through."},{"Title":"A Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage","review":"The description of navigating the Moroccan kleptocracy to get one of the visas alloted to the county is an example of Hammoudi's excellent narrative capability. Other highlights are his descriptions of the intimidating preparatory classes, the shopping sprees, an animal sacrifice, the oversold busses with the blaring religious tapes, the people he meets, the failings of tour operators and the pilgrims' reactions to them and the petty bureaucracy he encountered upon trying to leave Saudi Arabia.Not all the descriptions, though, are up to this level. For instance, I couldn't envision the run between Safi and Marwa, including the \\"gallery\\" over the path. (bleachers for watching? a place with religious art?) Are there hundreds bunched the way marathons start, or in small clusters? What of the woman who cuts the lock of his hair afterward? (Can anyone just reach out and cut anyone's hair or is it arranged?) I didn't fully understand the lodgings (esp. with his gender mixed group). He does mention an air conditioned tent, but what of the other places? Motels? Temporary trailers? How did they (the women, that is) cook in them (stoves? bunsen burners?) and what of these rest rooms (down the hall? 1 for X number people? showers?) that they lined up to use?Hammoudi is sensitive to the very second class status of women. They have all the same religious obligations as the men and have to cook too. They pray in a padlocked area. Some of the instances beg for more. For instance, he says some the women were sick because of the pills they had taken to stop menstruating (they did not want to be unclean in holy places). This is all that is written on this.The major shortcoming, however, is Hammoudi's tendency to over-intellectualize. Much of this relates to his feelings of being an outsider. A lot of it I just couldn't follow.Despite these limitations (and that this Hajj is in 1999), this is an insider's look at the pilgrimage, without any idealization or fluff. Hammoudi calls it as he sees it with refreshing honesty about his beliefs and feelings."},{"Title":"A Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage","review":"The Hajj is a fascinating topic and this book promised something possibly unique: a travelogue which attempts to reconcile the detachment of an ethnographer with the physical, mental and emotional demands of a committed participant. However, the end product is almost completely undone by long, turgid, almost unreadable and certainly incomprehensible passages written in academic gobbledeygook. Sokal & Bricmont did us all a favour by dissing this style of writing in their book 'Fashionable Nonsense'. All we now need is a fatwa from Al-Azhar University which does the same for authors like Hammoudi. Having said this, what remains is actually worth persisting with as the author does not hold back on either the negative aspects or virtues of the Hajj experience. In other words, it's a warts and all portrayal that is rather different from the sanitised descriptions of the pilgrimage in most Islam textbooks. In closing, then, the book is just about worth the effort: two and a half stars would be a more realistic rating if this were possible."},{"Title":"A Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage","review":"I'm writing this review knowing that I'm not going to do the book justice. The number one reason is that I'm far too removed from academia now and far too pressed for time to be able to follow closely and read and reread each passage. The second reason is that I read the first 141 pages more than a year before finishing the rest of the book.When I started reading the book, I was turned off by what I saw as the author's complaining about the endemic corruption of the developing world, similar to the WAWA (West Africa Wins Again) of U.S. travelogs in west Africa. The author's mentioning his disregard for ritual requirements and prohibitions and his lack of reverence for the blessing of Allah's invitation to His house pained me. And I just stopped reading the book.But from page 142 on, and I don't know if I'm imagining it, it was as if I was reading a totally different book. The participation in the rituals of ziyara, umra and hajj, no matter how \\"defective\\" the author's intention, changed the tone of the narrative. It was as if the magnitude of the crowds, the power of the stories the rituals reenacted, the landscape, the buildings, the sounds and the words of the Quran flooded over the dam of the author's preconceived research plan. But this flood was not destructive. Rather, the water initiated the germination of the seeds of Muslim identity lying in a soil enriched, not polluted, by the European-American discipline of anthropology.Now I may still be on a post Eid al-Fitr high, and I have to say just thinking about Makka is enough to make me cry (even this instant!)-May Allah azza wa jall invite us all there!-but I thought this author made me as a Muslim think about the hajj in ways I had not considered. And is there worship better than pondering Allah's signs in His messengers and His judgments?For the non-Muslim reader, I hope that the latter half of the book will bring attention to Islam as a religion rather than as a political movement.This book has by far the best description of the replacement and sacrifice of Ibrahim, Hajar and Ismail alayhim assalaam that I've read. In my brief Internet search, I came across a good article by Carol Delaney's Was Abraham Ethical? Should We Admire His Willingness to Sacrifice His Son? But Professor's Abdellah's discussion is at a whole other level.The book reminds me a lot of the only other \\"deep\\" anthropology book I've ever read, Paths Toward a Clearing by Michael Jackson.

Each time I am amazed by Cheng Tzu's ability to turn a movement I have made thousands of times into something new and amazing. I highly recommend this text to any serious student of Tai Chi. I also warn any novice student that they should start with one of Cheng Man Ching's more elementary texts. This one is difficult to comprehend if aren't already familiar with Cheng Man Ching's style of Tai Chi."},{"Title":"Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan","review":"If you're a serious tai chi practitioner this book should be in your library. Besides the invaluable knowledge it contains, this is just a very nice edition of the work. It's the only edition authorized by the professor's estate, and contains an introduction written by his wife, in addition to the translation by master Ben Lo. The cover painting of a white lotus and samples of calligraphy by Prof. Chen are nice touches, and the book is hardback and printed on higher quality you would get in a paperback edition. And the price is reasonable given the features and overall quality of the edition.But of course the most important aspect of the book is that it's one of the most detailed books on the practice and theory of tai chi ever written. Tai chi is composed of three main parts: the self-healing, martial, and medical (or the ability to heal others), aspects, and prof. Chen discusses all of these at length. For example, he discusses the physiology of tai chi, and how chi is transformed in the body to strengthen the muscles, connective tissue, and even bones, in greater detail than I had seen before in any other book. Numerous tai chi principles and practical points are also discussed and illuminated. There is enough material and food for thought here to reflect on for a long time, and I found I spent much time just trying to absorb the basic points, let alone the more advanced principles.The photos of master Chen performing many of the postures and techniques and their analyses and descriptions are also very helpful. There are 37 different postures in the long form, and each one is illustrated, and the external body mechanics, internal chi process, and martial application discussed and described. It's difficult to get all of that from a single static photo, which is why I say this book is really only for the intermediate or advanced student. (I note that the although some of the reviews here have been posted for more than five years, they only have a few votes, which leads me to believe that only the most serious students obtain and read this book, and look up reviews for it on Amazon).All is all, a true classic of the martial arts by a great master that should be read and studied by every serious student of tai chi."},{"Title":"Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan","review":"This is a beautiful edition of Cheng Man Ch&#65533;ing&#65533;s text on Chi Tai Ch&#65533;uan.

The cover has a color print of one of Cheng&#65533;s paintings, and there is an example of his calligraphy on the inside. The book is also larger than other editions I have seen, and the prints and pictures are printed larger and more clearly as well. The larger pictures of Cheng performing the Tai Chi form are especially useful.

One particularly useful section tells about the 9 levels of Tai Chi practice - essentially a benchmarking system of what specific areas you ought to be working on, and in what order, in fairly clear language.Probably not a good 'first exposure' to Tai Chi Chuan, but definitely something that a serious student would want to take a look at."},{"Title":"Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan","review":"This book is my constant companion. I've carried my original 1985 copy with me everywhere since it was first published. I should declare my bias: I was a student at Professor Cheng's school in New York starting in 1974, the year before he passed, and studied and eventually taught there until 1986. All of his senior students considered this the Bible of Professor Cheng's form long before it was ever published in English. We had classes in which Ed Young, one of the Professor's senior students, translated it for us chapter by chapter, his forehead breaking out in a fine sweat with the effort of attempting to adequately convey the Professor's meaning. ( I still have my notes from those sessions, and Ben Lo's translation compares very favorably with Ed's.) I often quote or read from the Thirteen Treatises to my students, and always recommend it as an indispensable work. In short, if there is one single most essential volume on Professor Cheng's Tai Chi Chuan, this is it--and I believe it can prove equally valuable to students of other styles and forms. I especially recommend it in combination with \\"Master Cheng's New Method of Taichi Chuan Self-Cultivation,\\" translated by Mark Hennessy (Frog Ltd., 1999)."},{"Title":"Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan","review":"Cheng Man Ching was what Westerners would term something of a Renaissance man. This is what I've determined. In Chinese culture, it was the essence of enlightenment to pursue numerous virtuous pursuits felt to advance one's spirit or soul. Master Cheng fulfilled this ideal-- he strove to master calligraphy, Chinese medicine, philosophy, as well as Tai Chi, among others.His 13 treatise(s) are the basis of this one man's perception of the world. Its foundation is, of course, qi/internal development, based on the principles of Tai Chi. But they cover a number of topics, including his perceptions on Chinese medicine, personal behavior, cosmology, Tai Chi development, and others.There were approximately 3 or 4 pearls that I will take away from this book for my own internal martial arts practice, and that in alone is of inestimable value... Perhaps there is no more than that, but I keep looking for a book that delves into detail about things-- from mechanics and techniques to stages of development and evolution. Cheng touches on these things in his treatises, but does not explore. In the FAQ section at the end, many students' questions seem to be striving for these same details, but Cheng's answer is &quot;There is no more&quot;, it is complete.That's all well and good, and it may be true. It may be that our discovery of whatever else there is must be unique and unexplained. But I still sought something deeper when finished with the book. In addition, his assertions that there is &quot;no more&quot; left me skeptical because his chapters on using Eastern medicine to &quot;cure&quot; tuberculosis were clearly based on limited insight into what TB really is. I don't think Cheng really had TB from his description. He may have had pulmonary fibrosis from a condition resembling silicosis, but not TB.That limitation is no fault of Master Cheng, but it does unfortunately color my opinion of his insights. Is there indeed something more, just no good way to explain it or expand on it given his cultural and temporal background? I don't know.A good book, and as a classic an important one that must be read. As much as anything, the pictures of his form were valuable. I learned a lot just studying those-- moreso than his descriptive text. In particular, the relaxation of his arms was evident, and something I still have difficulty with.But...

The first: Cheng Tzu's compression of the Yang family long form attains a rare perfection for which all students of t'ai chi ch'uan should be truly grateful; the second, which creates a difficulty for the reader: the student can only benefit from the treasures this book contains after several years of patient, diligent and conscientious study of the master's form.I am fortunate to have read the book before and after, so to speak, and I can attest to the refractory nature of writing on martial arts in general and chi studies in particular. The reader may think (s)he knows what is being said, but true understanding only comes from knowledge derived from prior experience. So, if you are serious in your intent, find an instructor who can trace his or her lineage back to Cheng Man Ch'ing -- there are few enough of them about -- and undertake serious study of the form for at least five years, then buy this book and reap the rewards of your efforts.Alas, there are no short cuts to the elevated mastery of form delineated by Cheng Tzu in this book."},{"Title":"Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan","review":"A nice addition to your Cheng Man-ch'ing library.

You will see Einstein as a curious boy, as a troubled student, as a young man making his way in the world, and then as a post office clerk who worked on physics when his bosses weren't looking.You will see the tide slowly turn as physicists of his day began to take this uncredentialled but highly original thinker seriously. And then the day dawns when an experiment proves that gravity indeed bends light....and Einstein wakes up famous.The book is also full of those charming anecdotes one loves to hear about Einstein, ever the absent-minded professor and &quot;dropper of conversational bricks,&quot; such as the performance in which, armed with a violin but off rhythm, the greatest living physicist is chided by the director: &quot;Einstein, can't you count?&quot;What comes through best is Einstein as a great-hearted and humble man who wanted &quot;to know God's thoughts&quot;; a man of conscience troubled by the wars and other injustices of his time and (unlike most of us) actively trying to do something productive about them; and most of all, a profound man whose central mood, known to every child but never to be outgrown in the inwardly alive adult, was his loving awe of the unknown."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"This is probably the most widely read biography on Einstein and with good reason: the author does a fine job of detailing the life of the man who pretty much dominated 20th century physics. It is a cliche now to say that his theories changed the way physicists think about the natural world, and his demeanor and politics continue to be the rage in so-called popular culture. Young students of physics usually get their first taste of advanced mathematical formalism when being introduced to his general theory of relativity, and the author, even though he is not a physics educator, actually does a decent job of explaining the concepts that Einstein was responsible for in his life work. The author does not leave out the politics of the man who continues to be known for his Zionism, and the reader will finish the book with an appreciation of the complexity of his thinking and his personal adherences to this point of view. Some readers may be perplexed on his associaton with the mustard gas researchers Walther Nernst and Fritz Haber, but put in context, as the author does with clarity, readers will see the reasons for this along with Einstein's commitment to the development of atomic weapons.The author also conveys the excitement surrounding the experimental confirmation of some of Einstein's theories, particularly the photoelectric effect and the bending of the light around the Sun. In addition, the reader can appreciate more the concern among many physicists at the time of Einstein's use of &quot;high-brow&quot; mathematics in general theory of relativity. Now of course, such concern has definitely subsided, for today's theories of gravitation are laden with highly estoric constructions from mathematics. Einstein, as the author notes, was very young when he developed his theories. Modern theories of gravitation, such as superstring and M-theories require such a high level of mathematics that physicists who make contributions in these theories generally spend many years obtaining this background. It is interesting to reflect on how Einstein would have reacted to these theories and elementary particles physics. It is also interesting to ask whether Einstein's politics would be the same if he were alive today, given the current situation in the Middle East. In addition, computers were not available to Einstein in the way there are now to all physicists. Would Einstein have taken to computers? To computational physics? His general theory of relativity is now one of the main applications of high performance computing and symbolic programming."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"Whenever they compile the list of the best biographies of the 20th Century, this book will definitely be on the short list.

The flight from Nazi Germany to Princeton, the building of the atomic bomb during WW II (he regretted this association the most in his life), and the myths that developed around his life with the public (he hated the public adulation; when he died he didn't want his house on Mercer Street in Princeton to become a shrine) also get their fair and judicious treatment. Einstein was a great scientist who had developed some of the most complicated theories in physics, and Clark is excellent in trying to explain them for the general reader. But he is best when capturing Einstein the man. Clark writes with the confidence of a master, even majestically. It's a long book and not a fast read, but the time spent with Clark and his magnificent subject is time very well spent. One even wishes for more at the end. A brilliant work."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"This book is an excellent documentary record as far as the details are concerned, and a good read. Einstein is not presented as a demigod or absent-minded genius, but as a simple human being who liked his job. Clark penetrates Einstein's mind and environment well. A friend and myself, both young wide-eyed scientists, even found it inspiring -- but don't let that put you off."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"This is an exceptionally well written biography of perhaps the greatest scientific genius in human history.Clark superbly conveys the story of Einstein\`s journey through physics,the world wars &amp; Zionism.Be warned,though:the book\`s encyclopedic nature &amp; voluminous content ensures that reading it till the end is pie in the sky for people who are not used to heavy reading &amp; deep contemplation on the topics discussed."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"It took me nearly 14 years to find this book and in the end it was entirely worth it. It is a large book which is is also a good read. There is so much on Einstein that you feel in the end you really know the man and the era in which he lived. Clark's other biographies are just as good and worth collecting if you can find them."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"This is a well- written account of the life of Einstein. It also provides explanations for the general reader of Einstein's great and revolutionary contributions to mankind's understanding of the physical world.It gives the picture of how one person from relatively humble origins rose to become the very symbol of human genius, and a cultural hero of mankind.It presents a picture of a more complicated human being by far than is contained by the popular image. It is the picture of a person of enormous dedication, of a startling power to devise in his own mind ' thought- experiments' that would lead to changing completely mankind's conceptions not only of the world but of its own powers.It is the the story of Einstein's reluctant political involvements, his devotion to peace, his great humanism, his Zionism and contribution to the building of Hebrew University, his opposition to Fascism, his famous letter to President Roosevelt that pushed the Chicago project for building the Atom bomb, his torments of conscience over his discoveries having been used in war.Most importantly it traces the scientific career of Einstein including the legendary moment of great triumph in 1919 when his general theory of Relativity was experimentally confirmed, and Einstein transformed overnight into a world- famous figure.It also tells the story of Einstein's struggle for over thirty- five years throughout the whole latter part of his life to devise a unified field theory . This is the story of a great man's frustration, and too his isolation from the great majority of his colleagues in regard to his position on quantum theory, (The famous,\\" God does not play dice with the world\\")Clark describes Einstein's fundamental attitude toward Nature and God, his closeness to Spinoza in seeing in an impersonal eternal order of nature the source of Beauty and objective scientific truth.This is a wonderful book about one of mankind's greatest creative giants."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"EINSTEIN: THE LIFE AND TIMES is the definitive and original Einstein bio. While I went round erroneously quoting its title, it is easy enough to find - and a necessity in understanding every moment of Einstein's life, work, thought and history itself.Clark is not holding back: he explains all there was for a biographer to explain, and he does it with color, vigor and courage. From here you will learn what needs to be understood and known; no silly garbage like what Einstein told his barber or his cook (Einstein had neither).Instead you will read and enjoy detail that has yet to be matched in its fullness, its richness and its deep respect for a loveable man who may have suffered from autism - it is all here, and God Bless Ronald Clark for undertaking what no one dared before him!"},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"Ronald Clark has written some excellent biographies (e.g.,Freud The Man and the Cause A Biography,The life of Bertrand Russell). He wrote in the Foreword to this 1971 book, \\"The Story of Albert Einstein, scientist, philosopher and contemporary conscience, with all its impact and influence, would fit better within the walls of a library than between the covers of a single book. For Einstein was far more than the scientist who confidently claimed that space and time were not what everybody thought... The dedicated pacifist, who after his change of stance was reviled for his apostasy, believed himself to be among those who pressed the buttons which destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki... In science the greatest physicist in three centuries, or possibly of all time, found himself after middle age pushed by the advance of quantum theory into a backwater...\\" (Pg. ix-x)Clark observes that Einstein was expelled from school at age sixteen, when he was a \\"precocious, half-cocksure, almost insolent Swabian of youth and early manhood.\\" (Pg. 20) He failed his entrance exam into college [which he took two years earlier than was customary], which was \\"entirely his own fault because he had made no attempt to prepare himself.\\" (Pg. 24) Of Einstein's employment in the Swiss Patent Office, Clark wrote, \\"in retrospect it must have been maddening for the authorities to reflect that they had taken an ordinary, if not an ugly, duckling under their wing without realizing that he would develop into the most amazing swan of the scientific world.\\" (Pg. 47)Clark notes, \\"The [First World] War thus revolutionized Einstein's attitude to the world about him. He could no longer remain isolated. He had to play his part on the side of the angels. But physics still came first... while he hoped for an Allied victory he was forced to turn a Nestorian blind eye not only to the work of his colleagues but even to the sources of some of his own money.\\" (Pg. 179) Of the famous letter (probably written by physicist Le&oacute; Szil&aacute;rd) sent to President Roosevelt urging the development of research that would lead to the atomic bomb, Clark wrote, \\"But, making 'the greatest mistake' of his life, he signed on the dotted line.\\" (Pg. 556-557)On the question of academic freedom, Einstein wrote, \\"I want to suggest that the practices of those ignoramuses who use their public positions of power to tyrannize over professional intellectuals must not be accepted by intellectuals without a struggle. Spinoza followed this rule when he turned down a professorship ... and (unlike Hegel) decided to earn his living in a way that would not force him to mortgage his freedom. The only defense a minority has is passive resistance.\\" (Pg. 598-599)In declining to accept the offer of the Presidency of the newly-created state of Israel, he said, \\"All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions. For these reasons alone I should be unsuited to fulfill the duties of that high office, even if advancing age was not making increasing inroads on my strength. I am the more distressed over these circumstances because my relationship to the Jewish people has become my strongest human bond, ever since I became fully aware of our precarious situation among the nations of the world.\\" (Pg. 618-619)When Einstein was asked by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue whether he believed in God, he replied, \\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\" Later, he elaborated on the idea, \\"I have not found a better term than 'religious' for the trust in the rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent, accessible to human reason.\\" (Pg. 413-414) He explained, \\"I cannot accept any concept of God based on the fear of life or the fear of death or blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him I would be a liar... I believe in the brotherhood of man and the uniqueness of the individual. But if you ask me to prove what I believe, I can't... There comes a point where the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge, but can never prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a leap.\\" (Pg. 622)This magnificent biography, though forty years old, is still of immense interest to anyone wanting to know more about Einstein."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"Einstein is one of the greatest scientists of the last century if not the entire span of history. He thought like no one else could think, and bent the rules of space and time that had been accepted for all of history.Einstein: the Life and Times is a complete account of the life of its famous namesake. Einstein is known for his theory of relativity which included the famous equation E = mc2. The author, Clark, reveals his life as a bit of a paradox: The celebrated scientist who shunned attention, the German-born Swiss citizen, revoked his German nationality, yet worked in Berlin for 18 years. He worked for Pacifism most of his life yet had a hand in creating the Atomic bomb. Although Einstein's life was full of humanity, there is no disputing he accomplished much.This style and an obsession for details have made the book a tough read, but rewarding to finish. This book will probably never appeal to the average American simply because of its imposing length and complexity in writing style. This book may have lost effectiveness to complication and 880 pages (This book is most certainly one of the most complete accounts of Einstein's life), but it is not deficient in value."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"This is the first book about Albert Einstein that I ever bought and it remains in my mind as one of the most difinitve and interesting biographies of Einstein that I have yet read. I just took it off my library shelf the other day and thought that I would go over it once again. As I remembered the scientific explanations were what most impressed me. I remember actually thinking that I understood Einsten's theory after reading this book. Of course, I was dreaming; but dreaming is fun too.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"Albert Einstein found his place among philosophies and equations in mathematical and scientific areas he had grown up around. He hated his strict school at the gymnasium when he was young and the army when he was older. These two deep dislikes caused him to be freer in his work and mind set, and to never be brought down by structure or criticism. His imagination and pure genius made him one of the world's most impressive thinkers, ever. Einstein was the fore-runner of his new, \\"illogical\\" physics and took much of the heat, as did Galileo when he first discovered his laws. He traveled all over the world and experienced much of the times. He finally settled in America and helped the government create a bomb to stop the fighting of World War II, the atomic bomb. As a friend, Phillip Frank knew the man personally and wrote his story because of his mysterious genius and major accomplishments. Einstein's as important as Galileo, Newton, or Kepler, and his story might even be more interesting. This book was a good read and definitely a good reference for anything to do with the genius and his discoveries."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"Prepare to feel time slow down if you approach this black hole of a book.The thesis ofEinstein: The Life and Timesis that Albert Einstein was both the preeminent physicist of our age and a saint.The first claim - Einstein's genius - is manifestly true. Einstein single-handedly established four of the foundational principles of modern physics (statistical mechanics, space-time equivalence, photon quantization, and the covariant formulation of gravitation). But Ronald Clark fails to make the case for genius, preferring in every case to document contemporary opinions rather than share the scientific excitement of the discoveries themselves. In this sense, Clark was intellectually incompetent to be Einstein's biographer.The second claim, sainthood, is manifestly false. Einstein is consistently described by his friends as inconsiderate, socially inept, and self-centered. His life after 1920 was a scientific wasteland - because of his self-imposed isolation. Outside of physics, his opinions were inconsistent, shallow, and readily manipulated. This biographer, with his frequent Socialist and anti-American embellishments, is just another in a long line of Einstein manipulators.In spite of Clark's incessant emphasis on Einstein as sui generis, the most consistent theme that emerges from the documentation of his life is the saintliness of other scientists. His fellow physicists deserve credit for recognizing, promulgating, proving, developing, and rewarding Einstein's ideas - and protecting him personally - in spite of the impediments of his personality. It's no wonder that Einstein could maintain such rose-colored pacifism when he lived off of the emotional and financial largess of the international scientific community."},{"Title":"Einstein: The Life and Times","review":"If I wanted to study physics again I would have taken another physics class. I was hoping to read a biography of Einstein, not an anatomy of his ideas. But the more I read of this supposed biography, the more I realized that Einstein didn't actually have much of a personal life beyond his physics ideas. Yes, there is some drama to his tale - becoming world famous as the physics genius, winning a Nobel Prize, being offered to lead Israel - but this book surely does not bring it out, and instead sinks into the quagmire of schizoid ideas. BORING.The book's positives: incredibly well-researched, and clearly the author knows his physics...But more on the negatives: I thought I would like Einstein after reading this book, and what I discovered instead is that I liked him less. He's a guy lost in boring, esoteric ideas that really, on a direct level, have little relevance to a healthy emotional life. Yes, people love to find the metaphorical relevance to his ideas, but frankly, I don't care for the guy much, don't care for his non-physics ideas, and don't really want to become much like him.

Sithas, the elder by three minutes, will inherit the throne when his father, the ruler of the elves called the Speaker of the Stars, passes away. The two twins are very close, but a marriage arrangement forces Kith-Kanan, (the main character) to flee Silvanesti and into the wilds. We are taken on a wild ride as Kith-Kanan's adventures twist and turn. Overall, this book is very enveloping and worth purchasing. You are shown breath-taking beauty mixed with pain, and the characters are very well-planned and described. It involves you completely, you begin to care for characters and hurt when they hurt, as few books really can do.

It gets interesting after Kith runs away from Silvenesti into wilderness. THat's all i'll say, don't want to give away anymore of the story. A worthy book of others about elfin kingdoms and all, although it doesn't contain the depth of Tolkien's books."},{"Title":"Firstborn (Dragonlance Elven Nations, Vol 1)","review":"Ok, so as far as content was concerned, this was a very decent trilogy. Still, I had to give it 3. I had several problems with these books:1.I know this should be a review of the authors, but seriously, what happened to the editorial staff? Were they all out sick? Were they drunk? Did they hire a kindergarten class to edit for them? I thought Tales of Uncle Trapspringer was poorly edited, what with the fragments, runons, confusing of its and it's, and insistence on spelling Palanthas as \\"Palanthus,\\" but the elven nations trilogy makes that book look like the masterpiece of a grammar instructor. There were sooooooo many clauses that should have been preceded and succeeded by dashes, commas- for the love of God, even parentheses- but the lack thereof really rendered the reading difficult (and this in addition to numerous spelling errors, the lack of apostrophes and commas, fragments and runons).2. Why is Sithel over 1000 years old? He's not a dragon. Elves live up to 500 years.3. The third book, The Qualinesti, seems like an afterthought with a rather boring plot. It also contains a reference to Huma Dragonbane, who, according to any DL campaign setting or player's guide, will not be born for another 4 centuries (major chronology error).That said, I did like the presence of a cleric of Hiddukel in the final book. The maker of deals, collector of souls, is a very interesting god and would make for a great story, but poor old Hiddukel is usually unfairly ignored (he's not even present in Amber and Ashes, which focuses on the power struggle between the gods of evil!).

It is very slow during the beginning. Most of the book drags on, but the good thing is that it goes by quickly. The book isn't long, only around 300 pages. But the ending gets a lot better and sets up for much more action to come.The book starts out with the birth of Kith-Kanan and Sithas. Sithas being the firstborn is destined to be the next Speaker of the Stars. The brothers have a bond that is almost unbreakable, and a love that is true. But when Kith does something that angers his family, he flees and meets friends in the outer woods. Here, he learns that life isn't the same as it is in the city of Silvanost. But, in desperate situations, Sithas calls his brother back to Silvanost and events begin to unfold that are beyond either of the twin's control.While the book does start out slow, it is good enough to keep you reading.

It is worthwhile for those fans of the story."},{"Title":"Firstborn (Dragonlance Elven Nations, Vol 1)","review":"I would certainly not call this \\"the most envisioning fantasy book of the decade\\", but it is a good book. The things I pin-pointed were:1. The editing is very poor, to the point of being distracting at times. Although this does not affect my rating of the story, it does affect the reading experience. So buyers, beware! And Wizards of Coast (or TSR or whoever) do a better job next time. Hell, I'll edit it for free if you want!2. There is something about Thompson and Cook's writing style that just does not grab me....at times I felt like they gave me too much information on things I didn't care about, then glossed over some very important things. I'm not sure how well-planned this book was.3. At times I felt like the characters were contrived and not very well thought out. I like good visual description: not just telling me what someone looks like, but giving me the feel of their presence. That's my personal sounding alarm for a good author(or authors). Kith-Kanan's speech and reactions were a little out-of-character sometimes for a ranger who is running away from his imperial heritage. Sithas was pretty well done and well-rounded, though most of the time the narration seemed to favor Kith-Kanan's point of view over Sithas'. I think it would have been more interesting to make the scenarios between the two more ambigious, rather than Sithas just being represented as a stone-cold rascist against all non-Silvanesti.4. The story's pace quickened in the latter half of the book, the political intrigue very fun to read. I think the last thirty pages crammed too much though, trying to wrap up the few loose plot-points. However, the last thirty pages did excite me enough to read the rest of the series.I liked the book overall and the concept is good. Plus, I loved Chronicles and Legends and have been curious about the rest of Krynn.

While a lot of the story is basically a generic fantasy plot--with one brother marrying the love of the other, then the other finding another, truer love (with the former still having feelings for him, of course)--it's good to get a little of the backstory for the elven nations if you're already a Dragonlance fan.

Out in the forest Kith-Kanan realizes what it really is to be an elf, he learns his roots you could say, remembering how his ancestors lived their lives. If you are looking for knowledge on elves in DL, you've got to read this. If you like humor, action, and a good plot, you've got to read this.Its required DL for the DL addict and I'm very glad and I'm thankful Wizards of the Coast reprinted it, which is what makes this next comment really ungrateful, but oh well. DID ANYONE EDIT THIS BOOK? Sorry for the caps. I know I'm picky...but it really looks like this had zero attention. You see horrible mistakes: misspelled names, paragraphs ending in a comma or no period at all, and two other things that amazed me. I saw an \\"Oh\\" spelled with a zero...example: 0h. Even worst I saw an \\"I\\" that was a one! Example: 1 went to school. That's just mind boggling bad.Final Thought: Other than the editing mistakes, which do throw you out of the story, this is classic DL. If you like dragonlance at all you are going to like this. Go get it.After Thought: Hopefully Wizards of the Coast get their acts together, the editing mistakes by a major publishing company must be embarrassing."},{"Title":"Keeping Ahead of Winter: 4100 Nautical Miles Inside America","review":"Life is a journey.

The only flaw, which I called Kurt Bruner about, was that their many references to &quot;forms available online at www.heritagebuilders.com&quot; was not true because the don't have them on that site any longer. I would have thought that having the forms pdfed on their site would have been an important support of this book... or at least a link to where the forms are."},{"Title":"Spiritual Growth of Children (FOTF Complete Guide)","review":"Whether your family is a beginner or advanced when it comes to spiritual growth, this is the best book for you. It starts by convicting parents of the need for purposeful training, then convinces them that they really can do it themselves, then tells them what their kids actually need to know, and spends the rest of the time showing you HOW to do it. The material is extremely practical and relevant."},{"Title":"Spiritual Growth of Children (FOTF Complete Guide)","review":"This book had been recommended to us to use to teach a class on the subject. It worked well for that, with some modifications. It really is best as a reference Christian parents will want to have to give them ideas on teaching their children Biblical principles from the cradle to age 12. The explanation of children's developmental stages and how that relates to their spiritual growth is clearly explained. The charts are expanded with examples in the text. The resources section and list of activities will fit most families. It is quite thorough in its approach. We made a copy available to each small group during the class; all the participants wanted their own family copy."},{"Title":"Spiritual Growth of Children (FOTF Complete Guide)","review":"What a wonderful book with numerous illustrations to encourage and assist parents in the spiritual development of children.

Among the many reloading manuals recommended to me was Lee's offering. This book provides a complete overview of the reloading process with descriptions and pictures. Unsurprisingly the author is biased to his own products, but you still get excellent information. Just remember to take any brand recommendations with a grain of salt.The rest of the book contains reloading data for a wide range of both pistol and rifle calibers. This reloading data contains (probably) the broadest range of powders for loads that I've seen anywhere. This will aid in working up loads and comparing with other manuals.The biases aside, the author does an excellent job of providing the new reloader with the information to begin and load reliably and safely. This is a must to add to your collection of reloading manuals."},{"Title":"Modern Reloading","review":"Outside of Lyman's Cast Bullet Handbook this is my go to book for reloading. It has sections on casting, reloading and every type of reloading data you could use, dipper, CCs, and weight of charges. The book is useful with all equipment and not just Lee Precision, It even has data for odd rounds like the old 32 S&W which is hard to find, and not just the 32 S&W Long. I use it a bit less than my cast bullet handbook only because I do a lot of Cowboy shooting and it has my favorite load with my favorite powder in it. The section on the 30 US (30-40 Krag) is worth the price alone."},{"Title":"Modern Reloading","review":"This is a great book one of the most comprehensive manuals I have ever seen for reloading. It is also one of the few manuals you will find that includes the fine art of bullet casting, something I have just started to get into but have got into with a vengeance.So here are some things to know if you are new to reloading and how to best understand what this book can do for you. First of all, it goes soup to nuts with how to reload and is full of autobiographical detail of the author Richard Lee. I found this to be just as useful as the data and how to info. Of course he has a bit of bias toward his own line of reloading material, but he is very candid about it and in many cases mentions what else is available even if he does not make it. I don't fault him for it because in my experience with there is a lot to like about Lee brand items. They tend to be cheap and innovative.I had questions about the data myself and called the number in the back of the book. Lo' and behold I ended up speaking with the son of the author! He was very knowledgeable and helpful.Though I think this is the best manual out there, there is still some more data I wish was published anywhere. Lee I think is the prime candidate for eventually publishing this info, so if anyone from Lee is reading this, here are my suggestions (with some editing suggestions too);-Include starting pressures for loads, currently only max pressures are listed (Hodgdon has these pressures on their website) or at least label these as the max pressures.-Lee should work up loads for all lead bullet types they have moulds for, such as the 9mm 124gr TC, not just what you can get data from the powder companies for. So Lee might have to hit the ballistics lab/range. As a Lee mould customer, I would expect to see some of their loads in the Lee charts without having to interpolate. Maybe they can get the powder companies to do it for them.-The Brinell hardness and max pressure chart was composed based only on 30.06 rifle round if I am correct. This should be revisited and perhaps an ideal BHN for each type of caliber or load should be factored. Otherwise, certain pistol loads such as 9mm seem to ask for a BHN of lead that is conventionally unattainable even with linotype.-Feasibility of adding antimony to harden lead should be elaborated on. It's availability is limited and it is very toxic and difficult to alloy correctly. \\"just add antimony\\" should not be the implied suggestion.-The heading type \\"starting loads\\" is positioned over each table in a weird way that could confuse the reader, do not confuse it with the shaded areas for maximum loads. This was a poor editing choice. For Lee to fix in a future edition, just add a heading type of \\"maximum loads\\" to the right of it, just like the Hodgdon tables themselves).-Powders by row are listed in haphazard fashion it seems, they should just be alphabetical.Don't let these criticisms deter you from using this manual! It is still the best out there!"},{"Title":"Modern Reloading","review":"The Lee reloading manual has been a great help to me in getting up and running with reloading. The format in which the data is laid out makes it very easy to choose the most efficient powder for the job at hand. Lee has sorted the data, per bullet weight, into the order of maximum velocity, and it's easy to scan down and see which powders make the most sense for that particular caliber and bullet, and which powders are obviously less efficient. The reloading guides in the front of the book are very informative - they do a great job explaining the process. I felt compelled to review this book after seeing the other reviewer's ignorant rating, based on price. This book is a great value, and chock full of useful information and data. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Modern Reloading","review":"Great resource, easy to understand, it will be used with other reloading guides as a reference for ensuring proper reloads."},{"Title":"Modern Reloading","review":"Come on, now.

The Harafish is the epic novel of the al-Nagi family who rules a particular alley in Egypt over multiple generations. (The &quot;harafish&quot; refers to the common people of that same alley). The book's chapters each encompass a generation of leadership by some descendant of the original Ashur as-Nagi, a gentle and pure physical giant, filled with pious and spirit-filled humility. His off-spring, and theirs as well, vary widely in their emulation of this great man and their stories are fascinating and quite unique. Each story's characters are vividly painted for the reader and all of the generations their good guys and bad guys. The entire book will captivate the reader and the simplicity of the read will remind you of books you read in childhood. However, the story themes are not to be thought of as childish- but rather as timeless and transcultural. Greed, piety, fidelity, cunning, love, lust, faith, and compassion all rolled together in an easily read documentary of one family's influence on many. An absolute joy to read. Mahfouz is one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"One of the world's finest writers tracks the lineage of one Egyptian family through time beginning with Ashur Al-Nagi, a giant of a man with the elements of TRUE greatness. He becomes the greatest clan chieftain in memory. As generations go by, fewer of his virtues are passed along, while his flaws become ever-more prominent in his descendants. The pursuit of a Paradise Lost consumes his descendants for generations as they lose and sporadically regain their influence in the area. Mr. Mahfouz does throw dozens of inconsequential characters at the reader, but there are more than enough extremely interesting ones in brilliant life-stories to more than compensate and quide you through time. So much so that I had to tear myself away from it because I often found that I could not put it down. A first-class novel."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"Naguib Mahfouz' 1977 novel, \\"The Harafish,\\" is an intriguing mix of allegory and saga. The term \\"harafish\\" refers to the large underclass of poor and downtrodden in an Egyptian city, presumably Cairo. The novel focuses upon the sufferings and the fortunes of the harafish and upon the history of a particular family, the Al-Nagis, over the course of generations. The story has a timeless quality with the author giving few details that identify either a specific place or a specific time. Yet, the novel succeeds in bringing the characters to life as individuals and in creating a sense of place.The book is told in ten chapters, each recounting successive adventures that befall the Al-Nagis. Each chapter is subdivided into many short paragraphs. The story moves forward with simplicity but becomes increasingly complex as it unfolds.There is a great deal of indirection in the book. The reader learns slowly by seeing and not by being told. Thus, Mafouz never explicitly explains the \\"clan\\" system at the heart of the book but rather shows the reader how it works. The \\"clan\\" is the informal ruler of an \\"alley\\" or section of a town. It can be analogized to an American gang or to a crime syndicate but enjoys quasi-official status. It accepts \\"protection\\" money, wars with neighboring gangs, keeps a semblance of order in the alley, and is headed by an all-powerful chief. Some of the religious leaders of the community are closely allied with the clan. The \\"alley\\" includes not only the many poor people, but rich and successful individuals as well, called the \\"notables\\". Most, but not all of the clan leaders ally themselves with the notables while exploiting the harafish.The chief character of Mafouz' tale is Ashur al-Nagi, a foundling who ultimately rises to the position of clan chief. Although he ultimately marries a prostitute and appropriates property that is not his, Ashur becomes a legend in the alley as a result of his compassion, strength, and protection of the harafish. His son, Shams-al-Din continues, for the most part, in the path of Ashur, but the family then deteriorates and its worst traits come to the fore. Its members, men and women, descend into murder, corruption and licentiousness. They move in and out of positions of power and are forever haunted by the fame of their illustrious ancestor. At the end of the book, another Ashur arises and restores and enhances upon the family name.Mahfouz' story unfolds with detail and with a deep compassion for the poor and the weak. There is a sense of human frailty and of the overriding force of change. There are several themes suggested by the story. First, there is the sense of decline, reminding me of charismatic figures who found religion or social movements which soon fall into torpitude. The story opens with something of a golden age with heroic figures and deeds. As it progresses, human life slips into the mundane. I also found in the book the suggestion that people tend to look too much to the alleged glorious deeds of their ancestors and judge themselves and their own potentialities falsely in their light. Mid-way in the story, one of the characters is reproached because the al-Nagi's view themselves in light of their founder, Ashur, and not in light of what they themselves can do. At the end, there is a deepening of the story. The final al-Nagi we meet, also named Ashur is said to be greater than his forbearer because \\"the first Ashur had relied on his own strength, while [the second Ashur] had made the harafish into an invincible force\\". While the first Ashur had conquered the evils of slum life, the second Ashur had achieved an even greater conquest: \\"his victory over himself\\". The second Ashur achieves a moment of spiritual awakening at the end.This is a fine book, both in its description of places, characters and societies and in the meditation it offers on the human condition.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"The story style was new to me and at first I had trouble getting used to the pace and the simple (almost childlike, unsophisticated) writing. But, you soon realize that the author is a very intelligent and perspicacious person and continually surprises you with his analysis of human beings. I was particularly struck by the manner in which he picked the defining character trait of each person and skillfully built the chapter around it. I was also impressed by the aptness and beauty of his metaphors. As I kept reading about successive generations, I began to wonder how I would end such a narrative and I couldn't come to any satisfactory conclusion. So when I reached Mr. Mahfouz's ending, I was suitably floored. In all, a very beautifully structured and written story."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"This is the tale of an extended clan, and the extended clans around them, in an Egyptian &quot;alley.&quot; The book completely draws the reader into the desert setting, which somehow transforms everything by way of prickly heat... families, rulers, poets, princes, and the main characters themselves, all rise and fall, coming and going, eternally shape-shifting, like the sands. This is a family story, and an epic, set among the village poor. The Harafish is an excellent introduction to the literary tradition of Egypt and the Arab world; for another example of excellent fiction from an Arabic culture, though a bit less traditional and more political, try reading something by Saudi expatriate Abdelrahman Munif."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"&quot;Harafish&quot; means &quot;rabble&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; in Cairene, and thisbook traces the lineage of a harafish family. From themoment that Ashur Al-Nagi is discovered as an infant by ablind holy man to his metaphysical return generations later,the story weaves the magic of everyday life into the fabricof human psychology. Each character seems so real that you'llfeel as though you, too, were part of the Al-Nagi family.The story is as bittersweet as it is gentle, and it is anexcellent introduction to the work of this Nobel-winning author."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"The place is Cairo. The time is unknown but pre-modern. There is no technology and carts and carriages get the poor and rich around (respectively). It is post-Mohammed; Muslim is a faith and not a political philosophy. There are bars selling alcohol and women are not covered. Women can and do own businesses, and manipulate their husbands into divorcing them.Ashur Al-Nagy, through a twist of fate, becomes the chief of the neighborhood. This office can be taken by force, or popularity, and entitles the holder to security payments from the rich and poor. There is vague judiciary role. The holder can really exploit the poor (the Harafish) who pay, clean the chief's house and bring food, etc.Ashur, who before chiefhood, worked hard and led an unassuming life. He had some stains: he was a foundling (probably a love child); he divorced a devoted wife to marry a prostitute who worked in a bar and he spent year in jail for acts of kindness and generosity. He served as chief with fairness and distinction. His administration is a legend that looms over the Harafish and his progeny as do the interpretations of his life and the legacies of his successive generations.Within this family saga about wealth, power, poverty and madness are parables about leadership, government, family, jealousy, sex roles, etc. To name a few: Leadership taken by force is hard to get rid of. Good leadership is rare and ususally those led have to demand it. Good government is fragile. Confined sex and courtship roles promote dishonesty and can wreck whole lives. Money doesn't buy happiness.There are some strong female portraits. One female Nagy, Zahira, manipulates herself to a position of great power.Interestingly, one generation of Nagys loses its wealth and moves to a family tomb. Cairo's City of the Dead is said to be populated by servants of the wealthy. I never thought these homeless would be fallen notables themselves.The book ends with some hope because a new Ashur has an eye to the future.I like the format of the book. Each chapter is its own story comprised of numbered substories. For those who don't know Mahfouz, this is an excellent introduction. His masterpiece, The Cairo Trilogy, is similarly a family saga but set in more modern times with deeper analysis of the characters."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"The rise and fall of generations in an Egyptian alley is the focus of Mahfouz's great parable. The story covers many themes, and evokes much thought while remaining extremely interesting. Arabic writing is great fun to read, and Mahfouz's story telling skills generate curiosity and a need to check out his other works."},{"Title":"The Harafish","review":"Amazon, in your Editorial Review Section, you've included an editorial review that essentially tells the whole book's plot.

Weldon Johnson was not light enough to pass for white (see writer Charles Chesnutt's works--who was light enough to pass--but lived as a Black man.). Many reviews give a synopsis of the book, so I won't repeat it here.

Purportedly an \\"autobiography\\", it is the story of an intelligent young man who \\"ignores the best in himself.\\" He gets his money stolen and doesn't go to college, though he's extremely talented musically. The book tells of his life, from the craps tables of New York, to high society in Europe with his \\"millionaire\\" friend. I picked this one up on a whim, and really liked it.Though extremely short, the edition I read had small font, and it is a bit difficult to get through. However, it offers some interesting insights. I particularly liked the earlier sections of the book. The narrator (who, as far as I could tell, is unnamed) is really the only main character. The other people in the story come and go; no one sticks around for very long. The narrator describes things with intelligent language and acute perception. The writing style is dense, yes, but also rewarding. The \\"race question\\" is discussed a lot; I particularly liked the scene on the train where the Texan and the Yankee soldier are debating. I can really see both sides of the argument (even the Texan's, a little bit). But, obviously, the book is not just about race.When I say it's set in the 1900s, I think it is, because the book itself makes no mention of the time period specifically, except that it's after the Civil War. The book, however, was published in 1912.There are some interesting character studies in this book too. The millionaire friend, the porter, his mother, \\"Red\\", \\"Shiny\\", etc, are all well drawn and developed.I'd never heard of this book before, and I'm glad that I read it.

As a boy, the fictional title character is sent North with his Mother to be raised in Connecticut. He does extremely well in school and is even something of a musical prodigy.But, he is stunned when one day in school a teacher asks the white students to stand, and scolds him when he joins them. He confronts his fair skinned mother and she reveals that she is indeed black and his father is a white Southern gentleman. His father later comes to visit, and even buys him a piano, but the child is unable to approach and deal with him.As a young man, the death of his mother &amp; sale of their house leaves him with a small stake &amp; he determines to attend college. Though qualified, he rules out Harvard for financial reasons &amp; heads back down South to attend Atlanta University. However, his stake is stolen from his boarding house room before he can register &amp; he ends up with a job in a cigar factory.When the factory closes, he heads North again, this time to New York City and discovers Ragtime music and shooting craps, excelling at the one &amp; nearing ruin in the other. A white gentleman who has heard him play enters into an exclusive agreement to have him play at parties &amp; subsequently takes him along on a tour of Europe.Inevitably, he is drawn back to America and to music. He tours the South collecting musical knowledge so that he will be able to compose a uniquely American and Black music. But his idyll is shattered when he sees a white lynch mob burn a black man. In the wake of this experience, he decides to &quot;pass&quot; for white--not due to fear or discouragement, but due to &quot;Shame at being identified with a people that could with impunity be treated worse than animals.&quot;Abandoning his musical ambitions, he takes a job as a clerk, does well investing in real estate &amp; meets a white woman who he wishes to marry. After examining his conscience he decides to tell her that he is black. After taking some time to confront this fact, she consents to marriage.As the novel closes, the &quot;ex-colored man&quot; tells us: &quot;My love for my children makes me glad that I am what I am, and keeps me from desiring to be otherwise; and yet, when I sometimes open a little box in which I still keep my fast yellowing manuscripts, the only tangible remnants of a vanished dream, a dead ambition, a sacrificed talent, I cannot repress the thought, that, after all, I have chosen the lesser part, that I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage.&quot;And the reader can't help but feel profoundly ashamed of a system of racial oppression that forced a man to make these choices--a wonderful novel.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I purchased this book several years back, as part of the research for my second book. I cannot recommend any book more highly. Anyone interested at all in African American life from the 1880s to the 1930s (particularly as it was lived in New York City from about 1899 to the Harlem Renaissance) should buy it. There is not a more fascinating autobiography in print anywhere! And the life of this man! He was the founder of the first high school for African Americans in the state of Florida, located in Jacksonville (the high school my own mother would attend); the first African American to pass the bar exam in the state of Florida; part of the first successful African American Broadway composing team (after he left Jacksonville and moved to New York City); composer of the lyrics to, \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" the song long considered the African American national anthem (his brother Rosamond composed the music); a consulate in Nicaragua and Venezuela; the first executive secretary of the NAACP, in which capacity he pioneered anti-lynching legislation (though he was unsuccessful in seeing it pass, the effort is described in the book, and is a fascinating lesson in the machinations of Congressional politics in the 1920s); author of groundbreaking fiction such as, \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man\\"; author of the nonfiction classic, \\"Black Manhattan.\\" The list goes on... His accomplishments, his dignity and intelligence were stunning, simply awe inspiring. And it is a real shame, an indication of how troubled our culture is, that Hollywood has never made a movie about his life, and he is barely mentioned as a key figure who shaped American culture (notice I didn't say African American culture, I said AMERICAN CULTURE).

However, the book is based on the lives of people Johnson knew and from events in his own life. Weldon's text is an example of a roman &agrave; clef.

The Ex-Coloured Man's personal struggles to reconcile his true private self with his public self in a divided and prejudiced society makes this novel an emotional and enlightening read. Johnson takes up the issue of WEB DuBois's double-consciousness, and gives it life in the form of this ambivalent protagonist."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of \\"passing\\". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can \\"pass\\" for white. Among other things, novels based on a theme of \\"passing\\" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of \\"passing\\". The earliest novel involving \\"passing\\" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, \\"An Imperative Duty\\" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage. The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled \\"Passing\\" set in the Harlem Renaissance. More recently, Philip Roth's novel \\"The Human Stain\\" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, \\"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\\" written in 1912. The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity. Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of \\"passing\\", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of \\"passing\\", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously. The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914. Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled \\"Along This Way\\" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the \\"Autobiography\\".Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world. He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the \\"passing\\" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century. The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a \\"smoking car\\" for whites on a train in the segregated South. He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the \\"race question\\" as it was viewed at the time. There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person. Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues. The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City. The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North. It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music. Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared. Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.The book also illustrates some universal themes. The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person. But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race. Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of \\"passing\\".Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This is not the type of book that will grab you from the beginning and hold you until the end. This is the kind of book that when you sit down to think about it, you'll find that you are, in some instances, like the Ex-Coloured Man.I had to read this piece for a class. Upon cracking the binding, I was not impressesd. But, as I got deeper into the story, I was captivated. This is the type of work that makes you look at your life and wonder how you would respond in the same situations (and how you had responded in the past). While Johnson didn't give you dramatic build up that writers of today give, he gave an opportuinty for individual soul exploration. I believe that was the point he was trying to make.&quot;Autobiography of An Ex-Coloured Man&quot; was not the greatest work ever written, but is was one of the most thought-provoking and challenging."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This was my first kindle book and once I started reading I could not stop.

While not a true autobio, the tale is wonderfully told and it's free....impossible to beat!"},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"James Weldon Johnson (1871 -1938) was the closest American approximation possible to a Renaissance man. He is best-known for writing the lyrics to \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\", considered the \\"African-American National Anthem.\\" He was a poet, the author of \\"God's Trombones\\" among much else (including the poem \\"Fifty Years\\" still one of the best meditations on Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation) and of the famous novel \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\\" (1912). But Johnson was much more. He served several tumultuous years in diplomatic service as American counsul to Venezuela and Nicaragua. With his brother, Rosamund, and Bob Cole, he formed part of a famed and highly-successful black songwriting and Vaudeville team in the early years of the Twentieth Century. Johnson founded the first African-American high school in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida and, almost in passing, he became the first African-American admitted to the Florida bar without attending Law School (by reading law and passing a treacherous oral examination.) Johnson was a newspaper editor and a founder of the NAACP where he took an active role in litigating against laws restricting the voting rights of African-Americans, and, in particular, worked tirelessly in support of Federal anti-lynching legislation. In the final decade of his life, Johnson taught creative writing and American literature at several universities and lived, for a time, the life of contemplation and reflection that he said had been his lifelong goal.Johnson lived an inspiring life. And in his autobiography, \\"Along this Way\\" (1933) he allows the reader to share in much of it. The autobiography is a lengthy and detailed work in which Johnson not only tells the story of his life, but he also describes a good deal of African-American history in the South, where he grew up, and in the rest of the United States during the pivotal half-century following reconstruction. We can see in Johnson's story, for example, how segregation and Jim Crow gradually but forcefully came to pervade the Southern States in the late 19th and early 20th century. Johnson also gives vibrant descriptions of life in New York City, of the growth of Harlem, and of African-American singers, actors and entertainers on Broadway -- in which he himself played a prominent role. There are chilling descriptions of lynching and of Johnson's efforts to bring this barbaric practice to an end. One of the more memorable scenes of Johnson's personal life in the book is a description of how he himself was almost lynched when he was observed talking alone to a light-skinned woman in a public park in Jacksonville. (His would-be attackers thought the woman was white.)The book is divided into four main sections, with the first describing Johnson's childhood and education at Atlanta University. Part two presents a picture of New York City and Johnson's efforts as a songwriter. Part three focuses on Johnsons counsular work in Latin America while Part four discusses Johnson's work with the NAACP. But these are only the broadest, bare-bones descriptions of an extraordinary life. Johnson combines his discussion of his public life with insightful comments on most of his writings, including his poetry, novel, his history \\"Black Manhattan\\" and his work as an anthologizer of African-American poetry and of Spirituals.There are moments in the book when I wanted to know more of Johnson's inner life. He tells us, for example, of his courtship of and marriage to Grace Nail but, with the exception of some discussion of her reactions to Johnson's diplomatic posts, we see little of her in the book. Johnson is reticent, in common with most writers of autobiography, in letting us see too deeply beyond the public figure. But at the end of the book, he offers the reader some broad reflections, centering upon his agnosticism and of his hopes and ambitions for humanity.Johnson's life focused upon his efforts to secure the rights of black people in the United States, but his life, work, and writings were universal in theme. In \\"Along this Way\\" he gives us the story of a life both active and reflective. His book is a precious work of American literature."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"One of the superb American autobiographies, and one of the great autobiographies of any period. After reading an example of this calibre it does not surprise me that I am rarely able to read biographies... second hand views, with some exceptions (Philip Horton's biography of Hart Crane, Frank Harris' of Oscar Wilde) are simply not sufficient....those exceptions being almost invariably written by men or women contemporaries who lived and loved in the same circle as their subject.James Weldon Johnson was a great American, not just a great African American, and a master stylist. This book is a pleasure to read both for its countless wonderful episodes and for the inspiring way of its prosody. He is one of those writers who makes you feel that his wonderful style is an organic product of a graceful upbringing, it is classic and yet unmannered...or rather the manner, being the grace, is the man, all inseparable. There is an additional poignancy in the narrative, especially in the childhood portion, deriving from our knowledge that the nobility of his home education is a thing entirely vanished from the American scene. He went to school, but was also in every sense home schooled. See the autobiography of Kenneth Rexroth for a similar example...\\"The years as they pass keep revealing how the impressions made upon me as a child by my parents are constantly strengthening controls over my forms of habit, behavior, and conduct as a man.\\" (Along the Way, p. 19, Penguin ed.)This is certainly one of the best examples of Childhood Autobiography in the World Literature of any age. It should at the very least be required reading in AP English for Black History Month.

He was also one of the first African-American professors at New York University, and was later a professor at Fisk University. He also wrote books such asGod's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Classics),Black Manhattan,Lift Ev'Ry Voice and Sing, etc.This novel was first published anonymously in 1912, and describes the thoughts and experiences of a man whose light skin enabled him to \\"pass\\" as white.

The unkempt appearance, the shambling, slouching gait and loud talk and laughter of these people aroused in me a feeling of almost repulsion.\\" (Pg. 55-56)\\"I have since learned that this ability to laugh heartily is, in part, the salvation of the American Negro; it does much to keep him from going the way of the Indian.\\" (Pg. 56)\\"The newspapers have already told how the practice of intricate cake-walk steps has taken up the time of European royalty and nobility. These are lower forms of art, but they give evidence of a power that will some day be applied to the higher forms.\\" (Pg. 87)\\"Was it more a desire to help those I considered my people, or more a desire to distinguish myself, which was leading me back to the United States? That is a question I have never definitely answered.\\" (Pg. 147)\\"(A)mong Negroes themselves there is the peculiar inconsistency of a colour question. Its existence is rarely admitted and hardly ever mentioned ... yet this influence, though silent, is constant. It is evidenced most plainly in marriage selection; thus the black men generally marry women fairer than themselves... the effect is a tendency toward lighter complexions, especially among the more active elements in the race.\\" (Pg. 154)\\"Can you name a single one of the great fundamental and original intellectual achievements which have raised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the Anglo-Saxon? The art of letters, of poetry, of music, of sculpture, of painting, of the drama, of architecture; the science of mathematics, of astronomy, of philosophy, of logic, of physics, of chemistry, the use of the metals, and the principles of mechanics, were all invented or discovered by darker and what we now call inferior races and nations.\\" (Pg. 162)\\"(T)he main difficulty of the race question does not lie so much in the actual condition of the blacks as it does in the mental attitude of the whites; and a mental attitude, especially one not based on truth, can be changed more easily than actual conditions.\\" (Pg. 166)\\"As yet, the Negroes themselves do not fully appreciate these old slave songs... but the day will come when this slave music will be the most treasured heritage of the American Negro.\\" (Pg. 182)"},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"A sensitive, yet heartwrenching, story which illustrates the ridiculousness of judging a person by his racial ethnicity. Too bad our government still feels compelled to put us all in little boxes whenever we fill out a form. Will we never be rid of the idiocy of it all?"},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"For a long time I've often wondered why anyone would want to be white (not being one myself). I never had the desire. I know what it feels like to be discriminated against simply because of my ethnicity. These days, there are so many people of mixed blood, and yet a person with one white parent and one black parent is still considered black, always wondered why. This book doesn't explain that but it brings up a lot of things to think about. And it might start a serious, deep discussion about what it actually means to be white, or to be black, etc., why must we categorized our ethnicity? He doesn't make excuses for himself, he doesn't shift the blame to anyone but himself. He takes full responsibility for what happens to himself. Which is refreshing. And you can understand why he chooses what he does in the end (especially given the time period the book was written in). I ended up feeling sad that he has given up half of who he is, half of his own history, half of his ancestry, and that his kids will miss out on that delight too. I still don't understand that mental problem people about one drop of non-white blood excludes you from being considered white, just makes no sense to me. Blood is blood. And these days, if you've ever had a transfusion, you might be getting blood for some other race. Anyway, the book brings up some good things to think about, to talk about, to explore a little further with people not of your own race just to see from their perspective."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"A powerful little novel, packs a lot of substantive issues into a tight and thoughtful narrative.There are three main things this work tackles:1] Exploration of racist conditions in early 20th century United States. Quiet but potent, such a scenario inevitably causes us to what's shifted from this account, and then what hasn't. For a portion of the book this issue seemed almost too light, too much a matter of verbal prejudice rather than more fundamental realities--but it came full force near the ending, with a vivid narration of a lynching.2] Debate concerning such racism. Here the work is less succesful, and seems to a greater extent dated and less useful. The larger approach is credible enough but the exploration of racism as a component of southern pride and regional nationalism feels incomplete. The arguments analyzed here are major racist tenets, but they don't get at some of major overlapping motifs behind abhorrence. Even more deficient are the counter arguments against racist definitions of blacks and black culture. The intent is certainly laudable, but the actual speeches given--largely pointing to black music as a self-evident sign of accomplishment rather than degradation--miss a lot and close the book on assessment in a way I doubt was applicable even in the author's time.3] Attempted opting out of this issue. This element is where the book shines, showing the systemically inhumane treatment of blacks, and the ambivalent and muddled human response to this. Faced with long odds and no prospects of racial equality, the protagonist chooses--as the title indicates--to pass as white and give up efforts for a wider struggle. Not an heroic choice, but eminently understandable, and puts a far more tangible face on the many characters real and fictional who did sacrifice deeply in a question for human justice."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Teaching this novel to 10th graders in Chicago has not been the easiest task but the storyline is the draw...that and my constant reminders that \\"This is the hardest book you will read all year...it's a book I read in college...If you can get through this book you can get through everything else we do this year!\\" And it's true...most students did well in the unit and the course which forces them to step outside their confort zone when looking and talking about the origins of race and racism. I use this in conjunction with RACE & MEMBERSHIP (by Facing History & Ourselves- collection of readings related to Eugenics Movement in USA) and with the film, \\"Imitation of Life\\" (the color version, not not the original black and white). Be mindful that it's high-end vocabulary as the author, like many Black writers of the day, sought to not only show that the main character wanted to impress those he came in contact with but that the author himself may have been trying to prove his own intelligence in writing the novel.

Johnson's novel (hidden in the form of an autobiography) graphically looks at relations between the races in American. The nameless main character is born in the South to an African-American mother and a white Southern aristocrat. He and his mother move to Connecticut when he is very young, allowing Johnson to show us the benevolent face of pervasive racism of the United States. Johnson avoids the easy &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;evil&quot; view of the oppressed vs. the oppressors. Instead, the narrator becomes a permanent outcast, returning to the South upon the death of his mother and then to the ragtime era New York City. The style of the novel is clear and extremely readable--and very current. The end of the novel dives deep into the issue of racism, causing both black and white readers to question their long-held assumptions about who they are and who they appear to be to others."},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This is a tragic book in a lot of ways. It is a reminder that America has not fullfilled her promise to all of her children. It would be great to read a book like this as an object lesson in the bigotry of the past. We have made some progress but there is still much to be done. James Weldon Johnson produced a wrenching tale. That it is somewhat autobiographical adds to the ambivalent narration. First the narrator feels shame in his heritage but then grows to accept himself and feel pride in who he is. This tells a tale that America is often loathe to hear but it is important nonetheless. The aspect of a mulatto man passing for white is sad. One should be allowed to feel pride in multiethnicity. This is a horrible stain on our culture that so many people had to live in denial of who they really were. This book is a valuable document of America's dark side. I would hope that it experiences a much deserved revival now that evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings has reopened the discussion on this sad piece of our history.

We see the narrator has he grows, as he discovers his heritage, as he loses himself to his desires, and as he finally realizes the course of his life.__________________________________________It was seriously the LAST paragraph that did it for me. Honestly, I had no idea what I really thought of the book until I read the last paragraph. It was crazy, going on a journey like this one and getting so acquainted with the characters, and still being unsure of how I felt. It had amazing writing, great characters, and awesome facts to back up the culture - and still it was missing something. It was just...empty. Despite all the facts and character development, despite all the places the narrator went and all the people he met, I felt that he didn't do anything. He waltzed through life with rich people, as a gambler, as a traveller, always searching for something more, always selfish. Even when he finally decides to do the right thing, he gets distracted. I wanted him so badly to do something worthwhile.Seriously, the LAST paragraph, maybe the last two paragraphs, but really the very last, turned the whole book around and took me by surprise. And while before I wasn't sure if I would recommend it, now I know that I would recommend it highly. It frustrated me, it made me feel, and it surprised me. Great book!Favorite character: the \\"girlfriend\\" or the \\"widow\\". A tie between them.Favorite aspect: Everything. But to name just a bit of it: foreign language, the way the narrator describes different cities and how the people in them live, the talks about mulatto folk in the South and in the North....

I could rattle off dozens of reasons why I did not like this character (in the end of the book, the biracial resolved that he would live as a person. However people precieved him, that is what he would be. He ended up living just as a white man.) but that would take days, so I won't."},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce's Secrets of Astrology: Planets, Signs, Aspects and Sojourns","review":"I have always found it interesting that Cayce, a devout Christian, channels information about reincarnation and astrology. The author says Cayce was surprised too!The most fasinating part of this book is the discussion on planetary sojourns. Cayce says that while we are in our Life-between-Life state our soul makes sojourns in other realms within our solar system. Most often mentioned are: Mars, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Mercury and Arcturus. Not that we have a physical life on these other planets but we enter into the vibration of consciousness of that realm. The readings say that the soul must pass through each realm to evolve into the correct vibration to become \\"one with the Father.\\"When we reincarnate we bring with us the experience of these sojourns.He says these experiences are influences in our lives while astrological signs or aspects are urges. They say in astrology \\"The Stars impel,they do not compel.\\" Edgar Cayce's readings confirm this. Over and over again, the readings emphasize that man's free will always takes precedence.I really enjoyed this book. It's well organized and easy for a layman to read."},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce's Secrets of Astrology: Planets, Signs, Aspects and Sojourns","review":"A great book to delve into for anyone who is interested in both astrology and/or what Mr Cayce has to say about things."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"I received this book for Christmas 2003, by the 26th I only had 40 pages left. If you are looking for a book to improve your mathematical ability, this is not for you. If you like to think and wonder why things are the way they are, then this is the book for you. I found myself reading one section after another, chapter after chapter. From the reasons why pyramid schemes are destined to fail, what is the best way to pack boxes of belongings when moving house, when do you take the money and leave 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' and many more fascinating and thought provoking ideas and concepts. I liked the book so much, I bought the previous book 'Why do buses come in threes?' the same day I finished this one - and I have already read one third of that one and it is not even New Year yet. This book would make the perfect gift for anyone who likes to think! So if you think they think, I think you should get it!"},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"The sequel to another book by the same authors, Why do buses come in threes?, this book is not quite as strong as its predecessor, but it still has plenty of interest.The first chapter discusses the calendar and how it came about, including why there are seven days in a week, how those days got their names and why there are twelve months in a year, though it omits to mention how those months got their names. The second chapter is devoted to conmen, illustrating some of the tricks they use to deprive people of their money. Sadly, there will always be plenty of gullible people around who are eager to part with their money if they delude themselves that they are going to get rich quickly. The third chapter is about what makes a hit single. I expected that this would provide an analysis of the way charts are compiled, but it's actually an analysis of musical patterns, though the authors acknowledge that formulaic music id dull.Other chapters describe how to pack things as tightly as possible, how to make decisions that give the best chance of success, whether it is quicker to use the stairs or wait for a lift, weather forecasting (in my experience, this is much better than it was twenty or thirty years ago), epidemics, taximeters, meeting partners, detecting fraud, sporting underdogs, bad karaoke singers, proving things beyond doubt and spin doctors. There's also the chapter that gives the book its title, in which the authors explain that measuring string isn't always as easy as it may seem.As with the previous book, this one is great fun but I noticed that political voting wasn't featured in either book. I know that whole books have been written on the subject but it would have been nice to see a chapter here, especially as Brits have to cope with different voting systems for parliamentary and European elections.Overall, this is a hugely entertaining book worthy of five stars, but if you haven't got the first book and you only want one, buy that first. It won't surprise me if, having read it, you decide to buy this one anyway."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"I bought this book on a whim, not knowing whether it would be as good as some people say, or if it would bore me to death. I'm glad I bought it! I'm a college student, and I must say that this is a very interesting book to read. This book has opened my eyes to so many things I have not noticed before! Why do guys avoid using urinals next to each other? What are pyramid scams and how did they bankrupt a country? And many more questions... The book is written in a humorous and down to earth style, and the best thing is that the mathematics of it are very easy to understand. This is a book you will definitely enjoy! You should also check out \\"Why Do Buses Come In Threes?\\", which is a prequel to this book."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"If you have a couple of hours to spare and are intrigued by apparently simple problems that turn out to be more complex than they seem, then Rob Eastaway and Jeremy Wyndham's book How Long Is A Piece Of String? would be an engaging way to fill the time. This is a carefully constructed book, with each of its sixteen chapters occupying about ten pages. There is just enough space to introduce an idea, pose a couple of questions and then deliver suitable solutions. The style is a little polemical, since there is not much space for the reader to investigate. But overall the material is well thought out and offers one or two surprising ideas.Each chapter poses a question. How Long Is a Piece Of String, Am I Being Taken For A Ride, What Makes A Hit Single, Is It A Fake are just a few examples. In Am I Being Taken For A Ride the authors explain the logic of the taxi fare. It's ironic that as the chapters go by they themselves have something of the air of a driver eyeing the customer in the back with an associated, \\"And another thing...\\"The authors consider chance in game shows alongside how soon a drunk will fall into the ditch. Their analysis of how predictable sporting contests might be might itself also explain why I gave up watching tennis decades ago. They examine fractals and make a tree and then conclude that numbers quite often start with one. You may find this last revelation surprising. I did.All right, it's populist stuff, but there is enough mathematics to keep the specialist interested for a couple of hours. The book is strangely but usefully illustrated and some of its explanations are extremely well presented. It's undoubtedly a worthwhile read. Oh, and How Long Is A Piece OF String? Well, as Richard Feynman famously answered, it depends on the length of your ruler."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"The thrust of this book was exactly the same as that of \\"Innumeracy\\" (i.e., you can use simple mathematics to resolve a lot of things that you might not heretofore have been able to work out). The only problem was that the examples here were not quite as interesting as those in the Paulos book. Some of the examples, in fact, were identical.This book was just as easy to read as the aforementioned book, and it can be finished in about 3 hours. It's one of those reads that you can follow and understand the reasoning, but it's not clear that you could work out from first principles. That's the last (minor) criticism of the book: We could have done with an example or two at the end of each chapter for the reader to work out (although that might have vitiated the aim of making an easy to read book)."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"This is a follow-up to the earlier, excellent, \\"Why Do Buses Come In Threes?\\". While the earlier book focused on those annoying little mysteries of life, this asks a set of different questions, many related to tough decisions such as how conmen get rich, or \\"should I phone a friend?\\"The answers, like before, lead us through a gentle, humorous exploration of mathematics and its relevance to everyday life. Along the way we explore (among others) geometric progression (why all pyramid schemes eventually fail), the geometry of stacking, fractals, chaos theory, the mathematics behind taxi meters, and various uses and abuses of statistics, both to detect and commit fraud.The two messages of this book are that mathematics is important, and that it's fun. It's in the same vein as the work of Martin Gardener, but with a British slant.To aid casual readers or those who've previously found the subject forbidding the maths is kept at a fairly simple level. Most of the time the concepts are communicated in words and simple graphs, but key equations are included and explained for completeness. The text is easy to read and the illustrations clear and amusing. Although aimed at those new to the enjoyment of maths, it's also a good memory jogger for those with a bit more background.I thoroughly recommend this book, and also the authors' earlier volume."},{"Title":"How Long Is a Piece of String?","review":"\\"How Long Is A Piece Of String?\\" is a book about the mathematics that underlies everyday life. Written by the authors of \\"Why Do Buses Come In Threes?\\", it's a quick, interesting read.In chapter 12 - \\"Is It A Fake? Number tests that can detect the fraudsters\\" - the authors provide this nugget of information:\\"Everyone knows that typographical errors (called typos by those in the trade) are sometimes difficult to spot, so a printer might ask two proofreaders to read through independently to look for errors.Suppose the first reader finds E1 errors and the second finds a different number, E2. They now compare their results, and discover that some of the errors, a number S, were the same ones. How many errors might they expect there to be in total?There is a way of making a good estimate, known as the Lincoln Index. This says that the total number of errors in the manuscript will be roughly:Expected Errors = (E1 * E2) / SFor example, suppose the first reader found fifteen errors and the second twelve, and that ten of the errors were found by both. The Linoln Index predicts (15 x 12) / 10 = 18 errors in total. Of these only seventeen have been found so far - ten found by both readers plus five more that only the first reader found and two more than the second found.\\"It occurs to me that this could be an interesting experiment in bug estimation.Have two testers spend some time trying to find all the bugs in a piece of code, keeping the list of bugs found hidden from each other. Then use the Lincoln Index formula to estimate how many have yet to be found.I'll have to look for an opportunity to try this and see how well it works in the real world."},{"Title":"Animal Care and Veterinary Science (Career Resource Library)","review":"This book is filled with information that's relevant for anyone who's considered working with animals.

As an aficionado of mystery (Ruth Rendell is another of my favorites), I give this book a five star rating. In terms of twists and turns it's right up there with Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris and Mercy by David L. Lindsay. It also has a deeply Floridian atmosphere and a few moments of black humor, a la the late lamented John D. McDonald. Don't make any immediate plans if you get ahold of this book; you won't want to put it down. A word of warning to the faint of heart: this is a medical thriller and has a few very dark moments.

Hall; keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Red Sky at Night (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Although NOT for the faint of heart or squeamish this incredibly powerful and visceral thriller cements James W.Hall's place as one of the absolute best writers around. His ability to create incredibly complex characters and so throughly convey the trials they have to endure give so much emotional depth to his novels that simply classifying them as thrillers or mysteries does not do him justice. Combine this with his gift of being able to transport the reader to the point of actually feeling as if you are there in the Florida Keys and you have the makings of a great novel. My only warning would be don't start this book if you have other plans (you'll postpone them!) or want a good nights sleep.

They are a special treat after what can be depressing days at work. Again, Hall has painted a remarkably clear and alive vision of the Florida keys. The very three-dimensional characters come alive on the page. I've always preferred Hall's villains to his heros, though in this book he makes the heros more interesting. Hmm. The quirkiest character, Pepper, is wonderful, but none of the characters here achieve the literary legend status of the villainous lovers Dougie and Elvira in what I consider Hall's best book, &quot;Bones of Coral.&quot; OK, I'm ready for his next book!"},{"Title":"Red Sky at Night (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"When eleven dolphins, who were part of a healing experiment, are found decapitated in theFlorida keys, amateur detective Thorn, who swam with the victims, decides to investigate.Instead of solving the case, Thorn is attacked and left paralyzed from his waist down. To getaround, the now bitter Thorn has to use a wheelchair. The pain is so unbearable, Thorn seeksmiracle cures from the fringe elements of medical science........His search for a cure takes him back to his childhood friend, Dr. Bean Wilson, an embitteredresearcher running a pain-relief clinic in the Keys. Thorn quickly realizes that there is somethingwrong with the clinic and that the dead dolphins are linked to the research going on there. Whathe does not know is that the clinic also experiments on real people, discarding the failures bytossing them into the ocean. How can Thorn hope to be a thorn in the researcher's side when heis confined to a wheelchair and his foes know how to make or ease pain beyond humancomprehension?.....RED SKY AT NIGHT is an exciting medical thriller that raises serious ethical questions involvingmedical research. The support cast is tremendous and the Florida Keys make a dynamite settingin the hands of an artist like James W. Hall. A paralyzed Thorn elicits reader empathy as he goesthrough various psychological stages (anger, denial, bitterness, and reluctant acceptance even ashe improves). However, his deadly foe, Bean, comes across more like a caricature of Dr.Cyclops, a poor fifties movie villain than a crisp unethical nineties killer, taking a bit away fromthe novel. But check out his assistants. They more than make up for the lackluster Bean.This reviewer recommends this novel to fans of action-packed, taut medical thrillers.

This is a good thing. Thorn is like a force of nature, and is used to best advantage in stories like this, in which he's drug, unwilling, into heroism by his anger and his sense or right and wrong.This novel uses the character's nature to advantage, as did Hall's first two novels.For Hall fans, this should be a hugely satisfying book."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Night (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Not to be one-upped by Randy White or Carl HiaasenJames Hall has created another cast of less than typical characters for this latest Thorn escapade.He has allowed Thorns love interest to survive twonovels and has once again taken all of us south Florida mystery fans to the places we've been and the intigue we wished we had been part of.Perhaps one day we'll see Thorn,Doc Ford and Skink take on the bad guys!!!!"},{"Title":"Red Sky at Night (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I can't help but think that James W. Hall was wronged and wounded way back when and uses that pain to fill the souls of his characters (especially Thorne) with enough angst and weltschmerz to overflow the banks of Lake Okeechobee. This particular adventure was too heavily laden with suspense-impeding character histories. I really didn't care about how the mad doctor lost his legs in Viet Nam and certainly didn't need to know about Pepper's love affair with her father. Further, these extra tidbits come at points in the novel when the reader wants the plot to resolve itself, to keep the pace flowing as fast as the speedboats the characters are chasing each other in, not to slow it down. And as much as Hall's antagonists are fun to hate, relishing each one's well deserved demise as they happen, this time around the gruesome comic book style deaths were too much. This novel reminded me of the martial arts action pictures of the 1970s - ludicrous storyline, loads of gratuitous gore and half-assed existentialism posing as philosophical profundity."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Night (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Maybe I'm just not a lover of crime suspense type novels, but I really had to push myself to finish this book.

She was a red neck assistant to Dr. Bean Wilson,who was hoping to find a cure for phantom limb pain. He himself had lost his legs in Vietnam and was experiencing excruciating pain in his missing legs. After finding out that dolphins were somehow able to take pain away, he begins experimenting on disabled veterans, who are going through the same pain. Unfortunately, to do the experiments, the doctor needs the spinal columns and brains of dolphins. The patients aren't living through the treatments though, and Thorn, Key West's local private eye, gets into the middle of it all. He is involved in a scuffle which leaves him paralyzed and in the care of Dr. Bean, his childhood friend who would like nothing better than to try out his antidote on Thorn.

He defends the proposition that logic must be valid because its denial is self-defeating. On the otherside, he rejected the idea that theism could be deductively proved. Therefore, he challenges Thomism's belief of a deductive approach, and finds that it cannot be validly proved.Natural knowledge of God's existence doesn't take a person very far, not far enough. Thus, he centers on an evidentialist, experiential approach. Here he latches onto systematic consitency, the lack of internal contradiction coupled with external agreement in one's experience.He proposed in other works and this that one's apologetic approach should mirror the times, as he stated: &quot;an apologist must play it by ear.&quot;"},{"Title":"An introduction to Christian apologetics: A philosophic defense of the Trinitarian-theistic faith","review":"Edward John Carnell (1919-1967) was an ordained Baptist minister, who also served as President of Fuller Theological Seminary from 1954-1959, and then as professor of Apologetics.The keyword to Carnell's approach is \\"systematic coherence.\\" He sought to find \\"a successful union of the ideal and empirical worlds,\\" and notes that \\"every man is a philosopher of a sort, and must pass judgment upon the whole course of reality. But the only proof he can offer, both for his system of philosophy and for the actions which flow from it, is systematic coherence ... It is this framework that the Christian offers proof for his system: it sticks together ... God is absolute consistency. And the will of God has been revealed in Holy Writ.\\"As presented by Carnell, \\"Three problems wait for the philosopher's solution. First, truth, must be located. Secondly, a rational universe must be plotted. Finally, these two must be so united that they will provide a basis for trust in personal immortality.\\" \\"Having no perfect system of thought while we walk by faith and not by sight, the Christian suggests that a rational man settle for that system which is attended by the fewest difficulties.\\" However, he further says that \\"Logic can be the means by which the Spirit leads a man into faith, but it is the Spirit, not logic, which finally seals the faith to the heart.\\"He admits that \\"This is not a formal demonstration of God's existence: it is simply proof by coherence. The existence of God is the self-consistent hypothesis that the mind must entertain when it views all of the evidence which experience provides.\\"Philosophical approaches to Christian apologetics are somewhat \\"out of fashion\\" these days (cf.

Assistant bank manager John Clarke heads off to work as per usual, and contends with broken windshield wipers, the temptations of adultery, the task of confronting his boss, the need to buy a wedding anniversary gift, and the sneaking suspicion that everyone around him knows something he doesn't. Meanwhile, his wife Margaret attempts to conduct her normal business (walking the dog, a visit to John's father, a jog), in an attempt to keep the terror of an impending breast clinic exam at bay. Their teenage daughter Ann bunks off from school to ride in a van with three evangelical Christian classmates to a \\"hoe down\\" out in the country. Alas, the van does not cooperate fully, and her holier-than-thou companions exhibit rather lax moral discipline. Adolescent Stephen is distracted from his normal routine, and ends up on a bus with a strange wino. Stephen's imagination blurs the boundaries of reality and dream, and his meanderings take on an almost deranged quality. Finally, Raymond the dog's inner thoughts are rendered in fantastic and hilarious detail, as he contends with an empty food bowl, tantalizing scents, a mocking squirrel, and finally, freedom. It's a very gentle story, one in which each family member encounters choices and obstacles, and negotiates them in their own way, arriving back home at the end. On the whole, the book isn't particularly noteworthy, although the sections written from the perspective of the dog are very funny and will appeal to dog lovers.

Thus I can hardly credit the first review that criticizes it and refers to \\"abundant\\" resources that the authors have overlooked.Since Albania was shut out from the rest of the world for many years by one of the most repressive communist regimes in the world, it is perhaps not totally surprising that there aren't many English language resources on Albanian culture. The few recipes I've found on the web seem to mainly include close cousins of Middle Eastern staples such as Imam Bayaldi, khufta or tarator sauce.Since this is the only current source of Albanian recipes and there aren't many Albanians in the US, this book will have to do until something better comes along. From the excerpts on this site, the book appears to have some interesting recipes, but little discussion of Albanian cuisine in general. The fragmented nature of Albanian history is probably reflected in their cooking, as the region has been repeatedly invaded and occupied by its neighbors over the millenia.

Furthermore, it comes hardcover, something it hardly merits.There are some interesting recipies, but a lot are very, very basic. And if you're not interested in eating brains and entrails, a good number of the recipies will turn you off a bit.Two and a half stars would have been a lot more appropriate."},{"Title":"Best of Albanian Cooking: Favorite Family Recipes","review":"Being an Albanian I was really excited when I came accross this book, not because I needed the recipes, but because I was happy to see that people would get exposed to a cuisine that is misunderstood or not known at all. I agree with most of the reviewers that it is not well written. The instructions are vague, and I understand why. To this day when I call my mother for a recipe she never has the exact amounts of ingredients she puts in her dishes, or the exact cooking times. Regardless, I think the selection is limited, not representative of the best dishes, and overall lacking in quality. It is hard to try to create recipes of Albanian food as most of them are known by mothers who have learned by watching their own mothers, smelling the food, seeing it and the colors it acquires when it is ready. Cooking in Albanian homes is an experience and activity that brings people together, so it is hard to exactly pin down the recipes. For a recipe to work it should affect all of the senses; smell, taste, sight, and memory.For the adventurous cook it will be a fun book to add to a collection, however, keep in mind that most probably the recipes will not work well unless you have seen and helped prepare the food several times."},{"Title":"Best of Albanian Cooking: Favorite Family Recipes","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this recipe book.

Erroneous content consists throughout the text, mainly as a result of authors' lack of culinary knowledge (turkey stuffed with chestnuts - never heard in Albania!!!)."},{"Title":"Design of Marine Facilities for Berthing, Mooring and Repair of Vessels","review":"....it is a very comprehensive book of the topic.

Yes, it is possible to make a living as a poet, no matter what your mother told you. But you must remember two important points if you want to make a living as a poet: first, you will not make a living at writing poetry. Second, you must do something no one has ever done before.This book is full of examples of people who make a living (or part of a living) as poets, and the ways they do so. And none of them make their living by sitting in their garrets inscribing verse. They all find ways to get out into the community and sell themselves, AS POETS, as a commodity that people are willing to buy.The Poet's Diner. Poetry tours. Youth poetry expositions. Poems and poetry writing as theatrical performances. Poetry pubs. Cowboy poetry. These are just a few of the ways poets break out of the poetry ghetto and make their literary calling pay. For poets who make a living, as much creativity goes into the way they sell themselves as into how they write the actual poems.Gary Mex Glazner derives part of this book from his own experiences as a paid poet, and part of it from interviews with other poets. Naomi Shihab Nye, Sherman Alexie, and poetry showman Bob Holman all weigh in with ways that they've made poetry pay its own way in their lives. These comments are informative and instructive if you want to get a little cash back from your investment of yourself in your poetry.The one thread that comes up time and again in this book is that you can't make a living as a poet if you just do what everybody else does. You need to break free and establish yourself as an individual. Because only when you begin to sell yourself will you be able to sell your poetry.This book is full of ways in which poets have turned themselves into profitable commodities. You probably won't be able to do exactly the same thing they have done, but if this book is able to spark your imagination in ways that help you establish your own identity, then it has certainly done its job.At the very top of this book Glazner is very clear: \\"This book will bring you no closer to the muse.\\" But if you study this book, and take its precepts to heart, it may make you more able to hear the muse. And when you hear her, she will help you do something nobody has ever done before. Then you will make a living as a poet."},{"Title":"How to Make a Living as a Poet","review":"I can't go on enough about this book. This book has been my \\"bible\\" since it was first printed - referencing its wisdom periodically.Gary Glazner is a genius when it comes to rethinking the concept of being an artist. This book brings the profession of the Bard back into the mainstream and shows us it's O.K. to love what you do, serve your community and maintain a lifestyle worth living."},{"Title":"How to Make a Living as a Poet","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like this book when I read it, but I loved it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has ever dreamed of becoming a full-time poet and making a living from their craft.Not all of these ideas will fit your personality, but Glazner definitely thinks outside of the box. He gives examples from other poets' lives as well as his own and you are never left without something to cogitate or meditate on. Read it twice. You'll love it."},{"Title":"How to Make a Living as a Poet","review":"A complete rip-off that bets there are enough wannabe poets out there to sink their bucks into this bit of self-indulgent garbage."},{"Title":"Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery","review":"The detective of this San Francisco-set mystery (and that is a big part of the charm) is Angie, a woman with enough money that she doesn't need to work, which is a good thing because she's not very good at holding down a job despite her ability as a cordon bleu cook. Angie is engaged to a homicide detective. Her mother is planning their engagement party, and the fact that the party is a secret from Angie is driving her crazy -- she's trying to find out where the party is, the theme, etc. But the real mystery plot involves what's going on in a Greek waterfront restaurant. Angie's neighbor and friend Stan \\"discovers\\" the restaurant and falls in love with a pregnant woman associated with the restaurant. She turns to Stan for help and Angie gets involved. Before they know it, they're involved in some puzzling things going on at the restaurant, including trouble coming from the baby's father. THen there's Angie's father, who is being stalked by an employee but doesn't want his wife or daughter to know -- so the father seeks out the help of Paavo, Angie's fiance.As you can tell, there's lots of stuff going on in this book, enough so that the reader moves around among multiple plot lines. It's not difficult to follow, however, in part because the characters are such...characters. Larger than life and likeable, except for the villains.I intend to read more in the series -- although there are enough in the series that I will be busy for a while."},{"Title":"Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery","review":"With a full schedule to juggle, Angie has little time to plan an engagement party; so she leaves that to her mother, soon regretting the decision as she frets over what her mother will do to the party. That is the least of her concerns soon, as murder, a stalker, a missing new mother, a harried neighbor and the dreaded color purple keep Angie's life interesting. Her neighbor, Stan, seeks solace for his heart broken state over Angie and Paavo's approaching wedding and his loss of free food, by courting a lovely waitress, who happens to be very pregnant. When she suddenly gives birth, Stan becomes her savior, until she vanishes and the child's father is killed. Going to the authorities to investigate would put the baby into the hands of CPS- but there's always Angie, who kind of has police credentials because she has helped out her fiance' before on his police cases. Right? Right. Paavo has his own worries. Someone is scaring Angie to death, and it could become the real deal if he doesn't catch the stalker.**** Angie Amafali's saga is always so much fun that you can't help but smile when a new entry comes along. It has all the warmth and zaniness of more famous books, but less angst to weigh it down. Her romance with Paavo has a reassuring quality in a very unreassuring world. As always, the adventure continues in the back with recipes to inspire you to imitate one of Angie's safer hobbies. This is a Christmas gift to give yourself. ****"},{"Title":"Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery","review":"Meet Angie Amalfi, chef and freelance food critic.

Now Angie must help the woman and Stan out of a murderous baby smuggling ring.**** A slow start but by the end it was a worthwhile read! Angie and Stan's antics are enough to capture any reader's attention. ****Reviewed by K.

Is the reader supposed to like Angie and identify with her, or dislike her, or what? She's irritating in that she can't hold a job but acts like the world owes her something. She sponges off her parents, but thinks she deserves to live in luxury. It's impossible to imagine that any man would put up with her for long. But Paavo is an appealing character, as are Angie's family members, her neighbor Stan, the other police officers that Paavo works with, and Angie's friend who owns the gift shop. This book is an improvement on others in the series: it has less Angie and more of everybody else."},{"Title":"Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery","review":"Angie Amalfi and friends never disappoints.

She put the whole affair in her mother's hands so that she can be in charge of creating her wedding. Her next door neighbor Stan is depressed because Angie is getting married to homicide detective Paavo Smith while he failed to get past being a friend in her mind.At a Greek restaurant, Stan sees waitress Hannah and is immediately smitten. They get to know one another, but he quickly concludes that Hannah fears a waiter who happens to be the father of her unborn child. When Hannah goes into labor, Stan takes her to the hospital and after the baby is born he brings them into his home. When the father is killed, evidence points towards Hannah as the prime suspect, but others had a motive to murder the waiter. Stan with Angie pushing her way at his side seeks the identity of the real culprit.COURTING DISASTER is a great romantic mystery in which the baby scenes provide immense humor (tissues to wipe the tears of laughter unless you are a new parent - then its sympathy pains). The romance between Angie and Paavo is growing stronger as each begins to accept the eccentricities of their future partner. Stan's desperate inquiries to prove his beloved innocent takes a spin when Angie tries to come to the rescue in an electrifying climax that will long be remembered. Courting the bestseller list, Joanne Pence has written a winner deserving an award nomination at the minimum.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery","review":"Joanne Pence's Angie Amalfi continues delighting this reader with variations on plugging in her talent as a trained (trapped?) gourmet chef, and through humorously portrayed angst on this-and-that, especially around her mother's interjections of suggested direction.In COURTING DISASTER Angie frets over an engagement party Serefina (her mother) is planning in high profile secrecy. Angie is consumed with desperation to discover the diddly details of her mother's choices of color schemes, etc., related to this upcoming party.I was absolutely taken by surprise and overwhelmingly impressed with the way Angie's well-fed angst over the perfection of her party's ambiance, carried on entertainingly throughout the novel, was concluded in the denouement. Do check out how everyone's Dressed To The Nines? But, from which base number system are they making their debuts? That is the question. Or, one of the many which are answered absolutely.From the first page to the last, this mystery was more sophisticated that most offerings in this genre. The burgundy complexity sneaks up on a reader who's been fooled into feeling he's in the book only for the exquisitely executed \\"let's party\\" escapism. All within the justification of escorting a villain to his or her payment of karma, of course.The opening of the novel does a moody-blues, literarily stylish, sensitive step-in as Angie's seemingly superficial friend, Stanfield Bonnette, drags his psyche through a self-pity soliloquy, moaning with such gregarious gusto that temptations of Prozac would be magnetically repelled before they could find an ozone hole for access to mental persuasion. After a few pages of this, Stan has taken the reader into a submarine dive into the murky depths of his unusual character; there's more to him than even he would admit.The Classic opening scene of antique detective fiction describes with sensual sleaze the quintessential dumpy motel room's open window on a red-neon-light blinking to a slow-two-step, keeping rhythm with the hero's nearly dead heart ... beat. The essence (sans motel room ambiance) of that type of urban-fringe, jazzed-up-depression, turning downtrodden into a sought-after art form, is captured in Stan's sensitive soliloquy. Thumbs up for a great Act One, Scene One, Pence!And kiss my joined finger tips in salute for the performances of the generous collection of characters reeking in \\"Perfecto\\" personality quirks, and the read-aloud-and-share dialogue dances. Of course the women in the plot are delightfully or dingily feisty and varied in temperament, depth, and essence; but the coup beyond coups in this novel is that every male in the plot is an unusually rich, complex example of that gender of the species. Each is potently, yummy male, yet uniquely one-of-a-kind.The contrast of enlightened-macho-styles between Angie's fiancee, Paavo, and her father is especially well done. I was absolutely entertained by every word, gesture, and action exchanged between those two as they bungled from antipasto antipathy into side-glancing, no-admitting-it thoughts of, \\"maybe-I'm-gonna-like-you-after-all ... or ... then-again-maybe-not\\" intimacy.There are too many sub-intrigues and character sets to begin to describe the multiplicity of duplicities woven into one of the tightest, densest, most luxurious carpets of Persian (Excuse, Italian) perfection to be found metaphor-ed into fiction.- There's Stan and his truly varied (and insightful) relationships with several women, including Angie, and none of these connections come close to superficiality, except maybe the wise avoidance of \\"tap-dancing\\" with Nora.- There's the sensitively and realistically explored social issue of baby's born, sold, or delivered to unworthy or incapable parents, contrasted to a fresh look at true parenting, out-of-the-box but in the ball park of \\"Yes, that'll work,\\" providing the contented conclusion, \\"This child's lucky.\\"- There are issues of intimacy, approach/avoidance complexes therein, along with \\"how-to\\"s on getting there between friends of either gender combos, between parents and children, between heterosexual partners, among every-which-way of one-on-one dances through life.How does Pence deliver this amount of intrigue and intensity through a legitimate mystery, filling in the blanks of that genre, yet using it as a cover for a literary mainstream novel?She does it with the pizzaz of light, fun humor and the panache of a visceral awareness of how spirited people get \\"up close and personal\\"; how they relate and grow satisfyingly close, simultaneous to working the kinks out of life's hard-lines and hardships.Well done, Pence!! You appear to be one of those alfalfa type authors who taproots her work 40 feet into the earth, and grows along with her talent in mineral rich soil.With Respect,Linda G.

First, the book is INCREDIBLY hard to follow since they constantly refere to earlier figures and algorithms simply by giving a number for it(not even a lousy page number), and you have to spend 75% of the time searching for it, only to find another one listed 2 sentences later. You would think they could have at least been courteous enough to provide a page number. Still it doesn't beat question 7.24 which states, &quot;use the algorithm&quot;, the algorithm as it turns out is printed 20 pages earlier, but I suppose that they figured you have the ability to read their mind and should have known that. Seconly, they butcher the Java language. They just use sloppy code and static objects wherever possible, which is the polar opposite of what Java is supposed to be about, but then again, given the wretched state of the rest of the book, this comes as no surprise. Well, since I only have a limited space to fill, I'll bring it to a close. Do NOT under any circumstances consider purchasing this book, a dancing dog could teach you more about data structures and algorithms!"},{"Title":"Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design and Analysis (Addison-Wesley series in computer science)","review":"Note that the Preface starts with &quot;This book is intended for an upper-division or graduate course...&quot; and should be seen as such. In my School, we have more emphasis than average on algorithm analysis, so we are able to use this book at 3rd-year level (final year of our degree), but without a strong background, the book would fit a graduate course better. Some of the criticisms relate to use of pseudocode and inadequate diagrams. The latter is maybe a criticism of an introductory book, but is not applicable to an advanced book. Eye candy fools the reader into thinking they understand more than they do. Pseudocode as used in the book should not be a serious problem for more advanced courses. Detail is not left out to the extent that is sometimes the case in pseudocode. In any case, I worry about students who expect to be spoon fed. If you have to derive your own algorithm, the details aren't all provided for you -- you need to work them all out. I do however find it strange that in the 3rd edition, the authors changed to a Java-like pseudocode but didn't adjust array indexing to 0.My only reason for not giving the book a 5 is that I have found a number of errors in the string matching algorithms. But even this is not unusual in algorithms texts; I would hope all readers would test (if not prove correct) any textbook algorithm before using it. Another thing I do not quite agree with is the relatively informal treatment of solving recurrences (using recursion trees) -- I would prefer that more formal approaches like the characteristic polynomial method were used.On the whole, this book has a good balance between breadth and depth. Other than the bugs introduced in the string matching algorithms and the inadequate conversion to a Java-like notation, it is a significant improvement on the 2nd edition.I recommend it strongly for courses where students already have a good algorithms background, and are ready for a more advanced course.The last book I used, Fundamentals of Algorithmics by Brassard and Bratley, was much harder for my students. It developed a lot of mathematical material that was not used much in subsequent examples, and they found explanations hard to follow."},{"Title":"Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design and Analysis (Addison-Wesley series in computer science)","review":"This book reads worse than a man page. Having taken the class from one of the authors, I now know why. Take the advise of the other reader, and don't buy extra firewood.

And they eventually found those &quot;harder&quot; books in lib, and loved them. The key reason is, those books explained everything clearly. (In almost the same number of pages.)The key problem as I see is, the authors just understood the materials in a certain way, but not thoroughly, and not able to explain it in a clear way. Only a person who has already know all the stuff can figure out what are the authors talking about in some part of the book.Now I believe, in order to write a good textbook for students, at least you should be a master in this area.If some of my words hurts, I am sorry.

They might be one page turn away, but very often they are a few pages, or even chapters away!The only reason I would keep this book is for the list of topics it covers."},{"Title":"Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design and Analysis (Addison-Wesley series in computer science)","review":"The second edition was arguably the best undergraduate text on algorithms. But unfortunately the 3rd (current) edition is a major disappointment. On the positive side, the coverage of graph algorithms was expanded; on the negative side, is everything else! The explanations are consistently worse than in the second edition. The description and explanation of Quicksort is particularly bad, in fact it's so horrible it should be ripped out of the book and thrown away. About the only use the book now has is as a source of exercises for professors to assign to their students -- fortunately, the exercises are almost entirely the same as in the second edition and are still the best set in any algorithms text.I have only one thing to say to the author; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"},{"Title":"Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design and Analysis (Addison-Wesley series in computer science)","review":"I am a CS major and I was required to get this book for my Algorithms class, I wasn't too dissapointed with it but I didn't see much in it either. The major flaw is this book would have to be the code, I know it is a algorithms book and code shouldn't matter. I like the idea of psuedo java code. But the fact that the code is much more complicated than it has to be can make it tough for some people to follow it. Also throughout the book there are a lot of &quot;refer to blah&quot;, and blah is a couple chapters back. So you spend a minute looking for blah and when you finally find it you forget why you are looking at it.The book does have a good but quick intro to the math needed throughout the rest of the book, but it might be a little too quick for some. For almost every algorithm there is a thorough explanation, proof, and whatever else is needed.All in all this isn't a bad book but you could probably find better."},{"Title":"Computer Algorithms: Introduction to Design and Analysis (Addison-Wesley series in computer science)","review":"This book really didn't give much at all.

But here's the reason my department chose it as our textbook: Because the other books are relatively hard and deep for the students.But here is the response from the studnets at the end of the semester, no matter it is an A student or C student: They hate this book, since they can not get much information after spending hours and hours on it. And they eventually found those &quot;harder&quot; books in lib, and loved them. The key reason is, those books explained everything clearly. (In almost the same number of pages.)The key problem as I see is, the authors just understood the materials in a certain way, but not thoroughly, and not able to explain it in a clear way. Only a person who has already know all the stuff can figure out what are the authors talking about in some part of the book.Now I believe, in order to write a good textbook for students, at least you should be a master in this area.If some of my words hurts, I am sorry.

I suppose if there is isn't a theological underpinning how does one discern where time is cyclical (like Buddhism) or linear with a beginning an an end (Christianity). I found Pieper's insights re the anti-christ and the end of time very valuable, the idea that the anti-christ will appea pre-eminently ethical and rational."},{"Title":"Native American anarchism: A study of left-wing American individualism","review":"Eunice Schuster's book titled NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM is an earlier introduction to libertarian/anarchist thinking. Readers should note the difference between anarchy and anarchism. As this reviewer mentioned elsewhere, a better phrase for anarchism is voluntary mutualism. These terms are important to understand the book.Mrs. Schuster began this book with a section of the Antinomians and the Quakers who resisted the persecution of the Puritans. One example that Mrs. Schuster examined was Anne Hutchinson who defied Puritan repression and authority. Anne Hutchinson advocated freedom of religion which was anathema to the Puritans. As an aside, the notion that the Puritans came to North America for freedom of religion is false and does not stand historical scrutiny. The Puritans legally murdered Catholics and Quakers. Anyone who was Catholic, Quaker, even Anglican, etc. literally risked their lives. Readers should note that the North American Puritans were among the very last to execute people for witchcraft. How this is freedom of religion is beyond logic. Anne Hutchinson was told during one of her \\"trials\\" that because she was not in England, that she was free by such occurance. However, as H.L. Mencken wrote,\\"The Puritans did not come to North America for freedom of religion. They came to practise a more restrictive from of their own religion that they could not get away with in England.\\" Mencken also wrote if someone showed him a Puritan, they showed him (Mencken) an s.o.b. Mencken also wrote that a Puritan is someone who went to bed and worried that someone somewhere was happy. Another of Mencken's comments was that, \\"John Calvin is the father of Puritanism which is to say the worst obscenity ever hoisted on Western Civilization.\\"Mrs. Schuster made favorable comparisons between the Antinomians and William and the Quakers. Basically, Mrs. Schuster argued that the fight for complete freedom of religion was the beginning of libertarian anarchism. Given the religious repression in North American and some areas of Europe, this was Mrs. Schuster's point of origin.While Mrs. Schuster mentioned other religious dissenters including Noyes, she next focused on what she on what she called \\"scientific anarchism.\\" She examines William Greene's ideas re private banking expecially his book titled MUTUAL BANKING (1850). She also gives readers a good background of Josiah Warren's economic theorizing and his \\"time stores.\\" Warren successfully operated these times stores in Cincinatti, Ohio. Basically workers got labor notes for their work, and exchanged these for the goods and services they wanted.Mrs. Schuster also gave readers an introduction the legal and political ideas of Lysander Spooner who was a jurist and critic of the U.S. Constitution. Spooner argued that U.S. citizens were not legally obligated to adhere to the U.S. Constituion since no one could be compelled to adhere to a pact or contract that they did not sign. Mrs. Schuster cited Spooner's private post office who operated at less than one-fourth the cost of the U.S. Post Office until the authorities closed the business.The last chapter was titled \\"The Great Disillusionment\\" in which Mrs. Schuster cited two events which she thought hampered libertarianism/mutualism. These were the Haymarket Tragedy in Chicago, Illinois (1886)for which the anarchists got blamed even those who were self admitted libertarian/ancharists were only in favor of peaceful reform and referred to themselves as peaceful revolutionaries and were not even remotely involved. The other event was Wolrd War I and the political repression during and immediately after this war. Immediately after the war there was labor violence because of broken promises of government and business leaders to raise wages after the war if blue collar workers did not insist on wage increases during the war. Wages remained the same while almost overnight, prices more than doubled when World War I was over. Anarchists got blamed for this violence based on no evidence, but they were convenient scapegoats. Benjamin Tucker who was probably the best known of the late 19th. and early 20th. century libertarian anarchists had intelligent comments on these events esepcailly the Haymarket Tragedy. Readers would do well to read the sections of Tucker and then read his essays and books which covered every conceiveable aspect of individual and civil liberties.As a friend commented, Mrs. Schuster may have taken \\"a running start' by her early sections on colonial and early U.S. religious dissenters who may not have been within the definition of anarchism/libertarianism. Another friend suggested that Mrs. Schuster did not fully comprehend the economic thinking of the libertarian/archists. Mrs. Schuster made a strained comparison between Anne Hutchinson and Emma Goldman which does not exist.In spite of the above criticisms, this book has merit. This book was part of the Smith College Studies in History and was published between 1931-1932. The fact this book was published in the 1930s when historians did not have more comprehensive access to sources that were known after World War II, makes it a good introduction to the topic. Whatever criticisms of this book, they are compensated by the fact the book has an excellent bibliogrphy and a good index."},{"Title":"Native American anarchism: A study of left-wing American individualism","review":"(First of all, it should be pointed out that &quot;Native American&quot; in the title does not refer to indigenous inhabitants, the book was written before that term had come into use. It refers to anarchism that had not been imported from elsewhere.) This gives a good summary of several different anarchist traditions in America, starting with antinomianism among colonials and later religious non-resistants, up to the anarcho-individualists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. The last chapter compares them with the imported anarcho-communism of Emma Goldman etc. The book is short and treatment is often summary, but it makes a good introductory guide."},{"Title":"My Daniel","review":"Prairie girl Julie Creath adores her older brother, Daniel, idolizing him over three generations. These two enjoy a unique and intense bond of love--the only surviving children of a Nebraska farm family, living in a primitive soddy. But the youth has grand dreams: to find his own dinosaur skeleton and sell it for a small fortune, thus saving the family farm. Bones and Bravery are all he needs--plus the devotion and quick wit of his little sister.Noble aspirations truly, but naive Daniel is soon to be initiated into the dirty business of dinosaur hunting, excavating and profiteering. He is unprepared for unscrupulous men who lie, deceive, cheat and even commit murder for gain and fame. Three gutsy kids try to protect their amazing creekside discovery, but beware the snakelike antagonist with deadly dreams of avarice.Mostly flashbacks, the book engages in time-shifting--a literary seesaw which keeps readers alert as we glide between Present and Past in the same chapter. Young Julie's passionate memories of that fateful summer are intertwined with her long-savored trip to a city museuem with her grandchildren, to whom she confides the entire tale. This spunky Grandmother has a private agenda, as she saves Dinosaur Hall for the last. Will she bring a little sourvenir of her girlhood, as she seeks to put closure on a painful wound which has haunted her all her life? What emotions and memories will be\`resurrected as she confronts the reconstructed skeleton? This is an emotionally exciting, dramatic read, pervaded by grim foreboding.

Daniel, Julis's brother, finds dinoasaur bones, but has trouble with a greedy paleontologist that is trying to take the bones for himself. During the commotion Daniel gets hit by lighting and is killed. Then Daniel's pa takes over.

It is a harsh read, with many unlikable characters and disturbing images. That being said, the heroes are so well written that you can't help rooting for them as the story unfolds. You know right away that it is to be a sad story but it takes you to a time and setting in a very compelling way. It deals with real life issues very head on and it is told through such loving eyes that we both found ourselves teary at the end. Lovely book, would recommend for older, more mature kids and adults as well. Simply beautiful story."},{"Title":"My Daniel","review":"Given that there is no information about the product on Amazon, I thought I would add some information:Comes on 4 CDs that run for 4 hours.About the book:Julia Creath Summerwaite is 80 years old and far from her Nebraska prairie home. But when she goes with her two grandchildren to the Natural History Museum, she once again becomes the young tomboy who helped her brother Daniel on his quest to find a dinosaur in the vast grasslands surrounding their sod home. Wandering through the museum, Julia brings Daniel to life as she tells her grandchildren of his irrepressible dinosaur fever and shares with them her fierce dedication to her brother. The old woman's poignant narrative is told through a magical blend of past and present that highlights the grandchildren's growing fascination with her adventure. As they hear her vitality and wisdom, she draws them, step by step, toward Daniel's dream. Pam Conrad, the award-winning author of Prairie Songs and over a dozen other beloved children's novels, creates a heartwarming celebration of timeless memories in My Daniel.About the narrator:Narrator Barbara Caruso is an accomplished actress and critically acclaimed audiobook narrator.

This is not \\"Little House on the Prairie.\\" In fact it's not a pioneer story at all, but a book about death, dying, the agony of grief, the bittersweet comfort of memories, and the importance of family ties. Given most publishers' current mania for hitting kids between the eyes with mature issues, they've succeeded here. Perhaps one day they'll again realize that kids want to escape reality with excitement, mystery, and adventure, not be bombarded with mature themes, or complex social issues. Espeically irritating were the jumps between modern and olden times so frequently that the reader was never drawn into either period. No sense of atmosphere was evident."},{"Title":"Airlines Remembered: Over 200 Airlines of the Past, Described and Illustrated in Colour","review":"Have you ever wondered what had happened with all those glorious airlines from days when flying was a personal event? This book might give you answers, both on well known giants of the past like BOAC, Pan Am, Eastern Air Lines, MSA and charters like Scanair or Sterling; ; you can also find information about niche market airlines like Peoplexpress, Panair or MGM Grand Air. You'll be reminded (or learn) that some like National Airlines, disappeared from the skies because they have been too successful -- and acquired by larger ones; some have been swept away by changing geopolitical scenes, like Interfulg or EuroBerlin or some that were plainly short on cash for necessary fleet renewal. Each airline has dedicated page, with fine quality 3.5x5.6&quot; color photo and annotated history of airline operations, growth and their closure. Texts are not overly detailed but they do provide an essence. Although paperback, it was has been printed on high quality paper; it is both great coffee table book, and valuable historical reference. I highly recommend it to any commercial aviation history enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit has been around for six years now, and has become a popular deck for readers who like to experience a sense of magic and story as they move through a reading. Special and unique features of this kit is the sections of spells and meditations which lead the reader through various exercises in utilizing the tarot imagery and dragon energy to perform sacred rituals and visualizations. For instance, a spell for prosperity involves lighting a gold and a green candle, placing the three cards: Ten of Pentacles, The Empress, and the Ace of Pentacles on an altar, then softly affirming, \\"Good vibrations, prosperity, success and money, come to me. All good things grow, no fear or strife, prosperity comes into my life.\\"Created by D. J. Conway and illustrated by Lisa Hunt, published by the well-established company, Llewellyn Publishing, this deck offers delicate, storybook graphic images using soft colors, delicate lines and an old book illustrative approach to each card's visuals. Lisa's artwork draws into the days of old, when dragons were a common part of the world's trajectory and belief system.The Celtic Dragon Tarot deck has the same basic structure as more traditional tarot decks with 78 cards in total in four suits, Pentacles, Cups, Swords and Wands, with a couple of departures. The authors correlate Wands with the Air element, and Swords with Fire. They also portray the Magician as a powerful woman, and the High Priest (male) replaces the High Priestess. As well, the Devil (Number 15 Major Arcana) is called Chains in this deck. The icing on the cake, of course, is the strategic use of dragons on each and every card. The back of each card has a marble like finish with a delicate celtic knot design.The Celtic Dragon Deck is unique, offering delicate beautiful illustrations which embody the sacred energy of the various dragons with noble, artistic figures and ancient Celtic surroundings. For instance, the Fool is a young Celtic blonde fellow, dressed in a traditional tunic, breeches and high boots, with his proverbial staff in his hand. He walks through a thick wood, and meets up with four young dragons, one blue (Water), one yellow (Air), one red (Fire), and behind him, one green (Earth). Between the branches of the trees, one can see the eerie peering eyes of the full grown dragons watching him carefully. Or the Empress, is illustrated as a lovely, joyful middle aged woman dressed in a long celtic royal dress, clutching a bouquet of roses, with a huge laughing smile on her face, as she gazes into the eyes of a laughing mid sized green dragon. They both look like they enjoy each other's company very much. Her mate, the Emperor is portrayed as a wise handsome middle aged man, leaning in a relaxed manner against the reclined figure of a huge blue Water dragon. They both fondly look on at the Emperor's two young children, a son and daughter, both playing happily with tiny baby dragons.The Lovers is an interesting card, showing two dragons gazing at each other instead of a man and woman. One dragon is yellow and lies on the bank of a stream peering into the eyes of a half submerged blue Water dragon. Similarly, the Hermit is a huge Green dragon perched on a rock face, deep in thought as he reads sacred transcripts. His lair is surrounded by various Celtic petroglyphs carved into the rock faces.Conway and Hunt include a 240 page full sized book that features interpretations, tarot spreads, information about the dragons, and the aforementioned spells and meditation sections.I highly recommend the Celtic Dragon Tarot - it makes the perfect gift for yourself or a loved one. It will appeal to the taste of many, especially those drawn to Celtic lore and Dragons in particular."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"This deck is astounding. The artist does a wonderful job portraying the images and ideas in the tarot deck. I feel that this deck defiantly represents a part of the Tarot that has been missing for years.On the other hand... the book stinks. I barely flipped through it and noticed that the book doesn't do any justice to the deck itself. I actually (no joke) took the book and taped the card defiation section closed because the cards are so expressive I don't want my perceptions of what they represent to me altered.Overall, this is definalty a great and amazing deck.

This is one of the most beautiful decks I have seen. The symbolism and meaning is ripe -- right down to hidden faces in rocks and colors in the background. It can be an excellent deck for both those who are analytical and those who just prefer to let the imagery spark their imagination and intuition.The only criticism that I have about this deck is that I question the claim to Celtic nature.

Out of the five decks I own, it is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"From the authors of Shapeshifter Tarot, this is another home run. Tarot is correlated but emphasis is Celtic and chock full of dragons. Cards are works of art in themselves and to the intuitive, there is a greater depth of meaning.

You can divine alone or with friends."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I own several tarot decks but this one is by far my favorite.

He loves dragons and celtic lore, so both in one deck would be great! I was disappointed in the art work and he is having a hard time connecting to them.

But it's disappointing.While charming, Conway's card interpretations lack the depth and complexity that would make this set compelling for me. There are no reversed card descriptions. So right away, you're getting a watered-down interpretation. I have the sense that Conway does indeed know what she's talking about, but this may not be her best effort.Another problem: Some of the cards are really lovely, but some are just tepid. I'd blame cheap printing for a lot of this. I'm sure the artwork looked fine before it went to the printer, but a great many of the cards are just too pastel, too wispy looking. Not \\"ethereal,\\" but just plain weak. I have 20-20 vision and a magnifying glass, and still cannot see all of the details on all of the cards. Pictures in the book are sort of gray, lack contrast.

Not recommended for narrow minded people."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"Well, first the negative. I agree that the book lacks information for beginners. The card descriptions and stories are well written but information about divining is very lacking. It details four different spreads but only offers roughly a one page explanation of each. Beside this point I'm fairly fond of most of Conway's writings. As far as Tarot readings I've found that Tarot in Ten Minutes by R.T. Kaser is very useful.The cards themselves are amazing. I'd highly recommend them to anyone. Very beautiful and the place values are clearly written. One thing to note. The Hierophant in this deck is renamed the High Priest and the Devil is called Chains. This was explained as the original names having nothing to do with Pre-Christian Celtic Spirituality. Also this deck features the Sword suit as Fire and the Wands as Wind. I prefer this layout but some people might disagree with it if they are used to more traditional decks. All and all I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I'll admit up front that I am not what you would call a devotee of the tarot. I had always known what they were and the general nature of how they are used, but it wasn't until I read the Illuminatus! trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea that I picked up any real interest in the habit. Even now, I only have a casual stake in the cards--it isn't something that I do every day, nor do I think I can find the meaning of my life in a deck of cards. I do this for fun, and I think that gives me a little bit different perspective than some people might have. The first thing that you'll notice when you open the box is that the cards are beautiful. My complaints about the book which will follow notwithstanding, this set is worth the price for the cards alone. The only objection I could hope to muster is the fact that my particular pack was apparently mishandled by the US Post Office during shipping and the cards arrived warped--it's been quite an expirament trying to get them straight. The book, however, is another matter entirely. I'm not sure who D.J. Conway is, exactly, but I'm sure she's not for me. This book commits the twin sins of speaking to too narrow an audience and apparently being written entirely for commercial gain. The section containing interpretations of the cards really is laughable. It reads as though they took a set of the production notes Conway made before the project and decided to add them to the accompanying book to make it a little bit beefier. The guys in the marketing and editing departments of Llewellyn should be ashamed of themselves for that--they've done exceptional work in the past (most notably the Robin Wood deck), and they really dropped the ball in that area of this product. Of course, that's not the only problem with the book--far from it. The new age movement may be very nice for everybody who's involved in it, but this woman makes the entire thing sound slightly absurd. The writing is almost like something I would expect to hear in an old Cycle of the Werewolf movie--a mix of gypsy mystique and a little bit of Celtic history which ends up sounding more absurd than authoritative. Further, the majority of the book outside of the section detailing what the cards are supposed to symbolize has a lot less to do with the actual practice of tarot than you might expect. Chapters on candle magic and constructive meditation don't really cut it for me--if I'm buying a book relating to the tarot, I'd like to deal with the tarot. Now, I should note that this next problem does not show up in the cards at all, but I also couldn't help feeling a little excluded by Conway's tone in the writing. I understand that a substantial cross section of the tarot reading population are women, and further that they may be of Wiccan or Goddess oriented backgrounds, but some of the writing in her book goes so far as to leave men feeling slightly excluded from the practice. Every time she related men and women in the same context as positive and negative energy, the position of the negative and the male descriptor always synched up. It may all be in my head, but I was a little annoyed. One thing about the cards that I don't particularly like is the approach that some things that Conway did in the design seem to indicate. For one thing, I'm strongly against the association of wands with air and swords with fire. I can see how it would make sense on a superficial level to some people, but I'd like to think that I at least understand the basis of the elemental associations of the tarot deck and the appropriateness of the fire/swords association is nothing more than superficial. Fire is an energy that can be directed both to help man and to hurt him, much like our own creative energies, while air is something which is necessary to our survival, but which is all but impossible to control, which fits well with the negative associations tied to swords. Why anybody would want to switch the two is beyond me. Beyond that, Conway also states that the cards here should only be read in their upright positions. That strikes me as a little odd--generally people who only want to read the cards upright are either seeking to simplify their spreads or to make them a little bit more optimistic, since there are generally more positive spins you can put on upright cards than you can on reversed ones. Overall, it all combines to give me the feeling that, while Conway may have a very superficial understanding of what she was trying to do, that the deeper design just wasn't there when this deck was put together. Fortunately, that's not represented in the cards themselves. Considering all the objections that I have to the deck's designer and author, I think that four stars should indicate just how enthusiastically I recommend the deck itself. While I personally prefer to use a more traditional set for my spreads, these cards could easily be used for yourself or for clients, and they do speak well to me, and, I think, to most people. While I wouldn't say that this particular deck will have as broad an appeal as, say, the basic Marseille or Rider-Waite, or even the Robin Wood deck, so long as you aren't opposed to fantastic art and imagery in your cards, this is an excellent pickup for the collector or the regular practicioner."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"This a amazing tarot deck, artwork and the descriptions given on the books are just evoking; the cards were fully understood by the one who made this deck come to life. I am a Draconic follower, apprentice and metaphysical practitioner and this deck is my first tarot deck. My approaches to divination in the past were almost null and first times and first impressions come just once and are unique. This Celtic Dragon Tarot Deck came to me as events in life are ment to struck your life in the precise moment. This was my precise moment and my precise deck. I can feel the energizing joy transmitted by those splendid astral beings in every card and description from this deck. The Guide's just enchanting, with the accurate descriptions of each card, that with time and use will evoke a greater scire. This deck is not to be used for reversed tarot reading. If you are indeed born to scire and follow the dragon path, this will make a fine and gorgeous piece to acquire. And if your a collecting tarot decks or you are a dragon lover this will make a elegant and fine piece for your collection, just as the Arthurian Legend Tarot Deck. May fortune and draconic grace shine upon thee. With my love for all dragons."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I am a major fan of Ms Conway's writings and insights. And the art work &amp; symbology is gorgeous. But one piece of heavy handed propoganda is making the going slow. Polarity. Or the theory that everyone MUST have a male to compliment the female &amp; vice versa in all magickal workings. The deck is fine, but the companion book is, again, heavy handed."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I am sixteen years old, and I have been reading the Tarot for three years. This deck is very special, and you can feel it the first time you hold it.I can honestly say this is a very attractive deck. Each card is beautifully illustrated and acts as a doorway to the untapped potential of the Tarot.The book that comes along with the deck is very informative, and gives a few lessons on candle magick, and how to tap into the vast knowledge of these astral enigmas that are thought of by many as fairy tale creatures. It includes step by step instructions, candle color properties, and a list of stones to add a bit more &quot;magick&quot; to the spells and readings. It deserves five stars.I strongly believe that you shouldn't order decks. Search for your own special and personal deck. Try to feel for it, and it will call and draw you in. This is just something that I believe everyone that wants a Tarot deck should know. Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I absolutely love this book. The interpretations are veryaccurate. The deck that goes with it is truly beautiful!

The incorrect descriptions themselves weren't even descriptive enough. I printed out the traditional descriptions and taped them inside the book for each card for travel purposes. Alot of information in this book was useless to me. Alittle &quot;beginner&quot; information to meditation. More &quot;beginner&quot; information to Tarot and a few spreads. Other than that, some spells and candle magic that I don't bother with.But on the up side, the art is beautiful and so colorful that cards sometimes speak for themselves. This was the only deck I could find that wasn't too bland and unattractive to me. Not every card in this deck gives you it's meaning just by the artwork. Which makes it alittle difficult to identify immediately with each card since images aren't memorable with it's true meaning and may take alittle more time to memorize.However, either way, all my readings have been accurate with this deck. I like this deck enough that I gave it 4 stars. I believe that this deck, despite the book, is a worthwhile buy."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"Love this tarot deck..Lovely illustrations as well as an easy guide to all card meanings."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"Readings, especially intuitive readings, are so easy with these cards.

The art of the cards is also extremely awesome. The book that accompanies it is also very helpful. The pictures of the cards are next to the text that describes their art and meaning.

Talk about amazing illustrations and the meanings are pretty clear as well. The book helps a lot. Although I wish it could go into more detail like the Crowley handbook, I am still more than satisfied with this deck and its explanations. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks now, and it has yet to give me a wrong reading. Its terrific. Also, I don't reccommend to begginners of tarot. Thogh this deck is great, you should have a bit more experiance. But, if you already own this deck, than my suggestion is to research tarot in general. It might help you get a better feel. Any questions, feel free to email me."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"This was my first deck of tarot cards. I enjoyed reading the book, and the cards are just beautiful!

The colors are too washed out, her descriptions are different from those of other decks, sometimes seeming contradictory, and it drove me nuts that she kept referring to \\"Jupiter's rings\\" - it's SATURN that has rings, not Jupiter. She just lost credibility with me."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I'd like some feedback from some folks that have actually done readings with this deck. I bought this deck over the weeknd, and the more I look at the cards, the more I like them. But the authors state that they are only to be read in their upright positions. I've been studying Tarot off and on for about a year, and while I admit that reversed cards can be difficult to deal with, totalling excluding them seems a bit unnatural to me. I find it awkward to shuffle the deck in such a way that all the cards come up Upright. It lacks something. Has anyone read with this deck, but ignored the &quot;do not reverse&quot; admonition?One word about the accompanying book: I like it well enough, though after using a book like Anthony Louis's &quot;Tarot Plain and Simple,&quot; the card meanings seem a bit simplistic at times, and, in my opinion, there is something of an overemphasis on Wiccan philosophy. Just stick to the basics without the mumbo-jumbo."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"Upon delivery I discoverd the book was a paper back instead of the hardcover as indicated in the web site. Other than that the content is very good."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"i just bought this deck to replace an old deck that was ruined by water, and while i'm pretty happy with the cards themselves, the book and explanations are severely lacking. i do not like the switch of swords &amp; wands, or the renaming of a couple cards. i'm not into dragons in a magick sense, so all the stuff about them was pretty heavy handed. but the part that made me put everything back in the box to return it is where the author said this deck is not meant to be read in reverse. that seems really unnatural to me, and although this may sound &quot;hokey&quot;, it severed any beginning connection i had with the deck. unfortunately, i couldn't skim through the book before i spent the money on the deck.i recommend the deck for the beautiful artwork but i feel it's better to look at then to actually use."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I really hate this deck, it's an insult to dragons everwere. For One she knows nothing about dragons and seems to have this fantasy notion that dragons are like herself; feminists and believe all men should dress in little skirts. I'm frankly sick of D.J. Conway and her attempts to understand things she knows absolutely nothing about!Perhaps if she bothered to make these cards more like the classical dragon deck I would be more impressed."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I love dragons so this was like meeting up with a best friend I hadn't seen in ages. When I opened the package, my eyes were filled with soft, yet very evocative images. While I may call them soft, they are definitely not too feminine so men shouldn't be turned off by this deck.The deck itself felt really good in my hands. You can tell this was a labor of love. The cards were slightly firm, yet easy to shuffle. The lamination is just right. The artwork on the cards is absolutely beautiful but this is so much more than just another one of those 'pretty' decks that are all flash yet have no substance. These cards are filled with haunting stories all their own and you don't necessarily need to read the companion book to get caught up in the tales. Lisa Hunt is a wonderful artist and her knowledge of dragons and tarot really shines through here.The book is filled with useful information on interpretation and there are some spreads to help you get started. In addition to this, there are even dragon spells, meditations, and a small section on candle colors, their uses, and stone powers is also included. The author, D. J. Conway weaves each of the cards into a very informative, yet not overdone explanation of the symbolism, and then gives a brief, but well thought out divinatory meaning. The only drawback I've found is that the book does not include a reversal section with the divinatory meanings. It's only a minor flaw though.I have used this deck since it first came out and let me tell you, it's stood the test of time, unlike certain other decks where the lamination begins to peel or wear off almost immediately. I've found the Celtic Dragon Tarot to be an excellent tool for meditation as well as reading. I always have this deck on hand for my fellow dragon fan clients. I highly recommend this deck to anyone from novice to expert and of course, to any dragon fan."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"For three years I have tried to get the Tarot to speak to me. After purchasing several decks and reading everything I could on the subject, this Deck was the &quot;one&quot;. The artwork is thought-provoking, the accompanying book is excellent! I love this deck! My very first reading with this deck scared me silly! But it was very accurate and for the first time I felt that I was &quot;intune&quot; with the cards. If you are a dragon lover then this is the deck for you! After purchasing and using this deck I've found that some of my other decks are starting to &quot;talk&quot; to me. I would recommend this Deck to anyone that is having trouble getting the cards to &quot;speak&quot; to you."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"Like another reviewer here (I think) I fell in love with these cards upon first sight, without even seeing them in person or touching them, something I rarely do with Tarot cards. Usually I handle them and view in person first -but- this time I did not and did not need to. They are beautiful and I was not dissapointed when I opened the box. I am not even really drawn to dragons or anything (although I do love fantasy and sci-fi stuff)but for some reason these just seemed right and I needed a different type of theme deck to break up the monotony of my current decks. The pictures are sort of muted and fuzzy, almost like looking into a dream; they are not as minutely detailed as some other Tarot decks but the meanings and everything still shines through and they are very warm feeling, the dragons are on every card and help convey the meaning and atmosphere of each. There are no borders on the cards, so it just flows over the card to the edges which I like. Overall a very good deck, better than the other dragon deck out there and I like it better than the other &quot;Celtic&quot; decks I've seen, this one is more user-friendly and easier to understand for those of us not familiar with Celtic lore or Celtic decks."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I own 2 Terot decks since I'm not a professional, but this deck connects to me and knew me so well in even my first reading. You don't even need to be a dragon lover to enjoy this deck. I especially love the book-- it has a picture of each card by it's description, a paragraph about the beautiful artwork, and the meaning of the card. As a beginner, this deck is really helpful in understanding the cards. In the back (this is what I love) there are chants and candle spells. There are also ways to call upon your own dragon. It is one of the greatest decks with so much imagination behind it. I doubt I'll be getting many more decks because this deck has such a connection with me...

I believe Lisa Hunt was correct; in her introduction she speaks of how the synchronicity and flow of the whole project was amazing. For me, the magic still holds, and there is something liberating to the spirit and enlivening somehow in using this deck, and studying it. It certainly portrays a world I would like to live in, and I love both author and artist for bringing into the world the \\"possible dragon!\\"I also like the sections at the end about candle magic and oh, the meditations! Some have complained about both the presence of these and their quality, but having done a pathworking meditation just last night, I have to say that to me there is an authenticity to what she puts forth. Also, these sections are not very long, and don't detract at all from the straight Tarot parts of the book. But yes, to me they augment that.The deck is going to be easy to read with, and I like the physical size too.

The book could have been more extensive in tying to offer a minimum spectrum of divinatory meanings for each card. I personally believe this deck will be of great use to quite experienced tarot readers, who know the traditional imagery so well, they do not need to actually look at the pictures in the cards to be reminded of their meanings; and to the tarot collector, who does not necessarily need to ask the cards for guidance."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I'm a collector of tarot decks and have many both novel and genuine: this one, sadly, most definitely falls to novel.The art is beautiful and the intentions clear- but if you are looking for a genuine tarot deck, this one is not for you.

Conway and illustrated by Lisa Hunt, the Celtic Dragon Tarot is celtic themed tarot which focus on dragons of the celtic variety. The beautiful imagery, brings this cards to life, which work well as a Tarot and/or a meditation tool. This is a deck that anyone can easily pick up.The picture within each card fades into a gray-marbleized border. The same marbleize texture is used on the back of the cards with a three dragon celtic like sigil in the center.These deck is labeled in English at the bottom. The Major Arcana are numbered from 0 to 21 also at the bottom. A thing to notice is that, three of the cards has been renamed:The Hierophant -- The High PriestWheel of Fortune --- The WheelThe Devil -- ChainsOf the Major Arcana, I like Death the most, which in my opinion is an exquisite example of Lisa Hunt's artistry. Death shows a dragon painfully shedding its skin, a radical change, which matches perfectly the meaning of this card.On the Minor Arcana, Wands and Swords associations are reversed. Wands are associated to air and Swords to fire. Cups and Pentacles maintain their usual association to water and earth, respectively. The suit symbols are subtly incorporated within the imagery of each card.This deck comes as part of a set with a companion book: A guide to the Celtic Dragon Tarot. The book is divided into the following sections:Introduction: The Magick of Dragons1. Using The Celtic Dragon Tarot2. Guide to the Cards3. Major Arcana4. Minor ArcanaTarot LayoutsDragon Tarot Candle SpellsMeditationsThe Introduction talks briefly about the dragons, and the mythology and lore about them. Using the Celtic Dragon Tarot is a two page chapter that briefly discusses the correspondences on the cards and the following chapters. Guide to the Cards is a four pages quick reference chapter for the cards. On the Major Arcana and Minor Arcana chapters, there are nearly two pages of information per card. The first page contains a black and white image of the card, name, and keywords, and the second page has the name, a description of the the card, and divinatory meaning. The Tarot Layouts chapter contains four layouts: The Expanded Celtic Cross (13 cards spread), Influence of the Elements (5 cards spread), Past Life, Present Influence (9 cards spread), and Path to a Goal (11 cards spread). The final chapters, Dragon Tarot Candle Spells and Meditations, shows how to use the cards for magick and meditation.I recommend this deck for tarot collects who like celtic or dragon themed decks.

Very much worth having, even if you don't intend to use them - the artwork is beautiful on it's own. Perfect gift for anyone with a love of dragons."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I am new to learning tarot cards. This deck and book are very good. Everything is explained in detail. Large print and pictures.Each card has its own page with detailed written explanations. Great for learning. Has a few tarot layouts towards the back of the book and some spells for cards and candles."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"I must admit, i was skeptical at first when i got this deck...I have used the &quot;Shapeshifter Deck&quot; by the same author and was not impressed... The Shapeshifter cards were a work of art in themselves, but they just didn't speak to me.The Dragon deck has a life and energy all of its own.It immediately took form and in its own way started speaking.The pictures are very fantasy based, yet within the realms of fantsy they have very clear insight to provide answers to questions asked.I have noticed that this deck has a very &quot;healing effect&quot;...When reading for other people, this particular deck has a &quot;medical flare&quot; to it... Tuning into people's physical and emotional problems right to the core.The cards alone have a pleasant energy when you hold them in your hands. It is a very sweet deck, and one that &quot;likes to be used&quot;. Definately a deck that likes to be put to work....I love it =)"},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"One thing is for sure - these ladies love their dragons! The cards are decorated with this in mind, and their love for these wonderful magical beings overwhelms the actual meaning of the cards themselves - which makes me hesitate in putting them to any practical use. At times the art work is beautiful, true, but more often then not it is cartoonish. Also the artist has strong views of a pro-femine nature to the point that the illistrations of men are of a poorer quality then those of women - or the male figures are shown in an unflattering manner. This subtle but certainly sexist view also shows itself in the written book that comes with the cards. The book is written in a narrow minded and sudo-spiritual manner which is muddled and unclear. Also it gives instructions that appear incorrect, based on my experience with the tarot. (I.E. Do not read the cards in the reverse position, and the extra additional cards to be added to the celtic cross reading for clerifiaction, as well as some strange description of certain cards themselves.) If you like picture of dragons - get this set. If you don't - DO NOT get this set."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"My cards arrived in perfect condition and very promptly which was great. I love Lisa Hunts art which was the main reason for my purchase. I find the meanings of the cards a little harsh at times and the way DJ Conway like to swap swords and wands a little strange. I do love the magic she brings though, in the way of meditations and spells, really gives it so much more....and I do love dragons. All in all I like this deck and book and happy to have them in my collection."},{"Title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot Kit","review":"This deck communicates wonderful dragon energy!

It examines the questions, 'Is death really that bad if there is a heaven?'. It has a mormon slant being written by one of its most famous leaders of the last part of the 20th century.

I was really looking forward to reading it - I love stuff like this and read quite a bit as a diversion from business, fiction, and science reading.Unfortunately I don't share the same level of enthusiasm for this work as the other reviewers here. While there were times the columnist/blogger/casual-essayist style was entertaining, at many points I found it a bit like listening to someone working hard at making connections because he could, not because they really were all there. If I were speaking with the author at a party, I'm uncertain I would listen to him speak about one of his convergences for very long - not because he lacks education and depth and has some cool ideas - it's just that some of them strain to much to convergence. Is it really convergence when someone forces two things together rather than discovering the intersection?I guess it felt like naming cloud images. Fun, but not for long, and sometimes no matter how hard you try, the other person can't quite see the pattern you see. But I am only one voice out of many, so take my perspective in stride."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"It is difficult to read Lawrence Wechsler's latest book without spinning off into realms of thought that defy description. The well known art historian and writer has gathered a series of essays that while not confined to art commentary still manage to reference 'art' on every level in which it influences our lives, our observations, and our deja vu!EVERYTHING THAT RISES: A BOOK OF CONVERGENCES begins with the postulate that recognized or not, images rise and fall with some sense of continuity no matter how disparate or how separated in time - or even how ironically dissociative! To even summarize the contents of this book would seem a disservice to the potential reader: the joy in reading Wechsler's erudite yet lighthearted writing must be experienced in the manner in which he lays out his plethora of ideas.But for teasers, Wechsler's 'conversations' and musings find similarities in such seemingly unassociated images as comparing a Myerowitz color photograph of the 9/11 firefighters resting with an anonymous black and white photograph of Union Army engineers in a nearly identical pose from the Civil War! Rembrandt's painting of the Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp from 1632 is paced side by side with an uncanny photograph from the 1967 black and white photograph of Bolivian soldiers gathered around the slain Che Guevara and the similarity looks as though the latter image was posed with Rembrandt's painting as model!But these are only two examples of the art related convergences Wechsler addresses. Other forms are from observed cloud formations, political posters, old and new landscapes, etc - or in Wechsler's words 'uncanny moments of convergence, bizarre associations, eerie rhymes, whispered recollections'. The beautifully illustrated book is well designed, richly interesting, and quite unlike any other volume that challenges our senses. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 06"},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"Lawrence Weschler has collected convergences throughout his life. With EVERYTHING THAT RISES: A BOOK OF CONVERGENCES, he offers his thoughts on these resonations in a series of essays that are both personal and universal.Weschler has a distinct knack for seeing in the floating lips of a Man Ray painting or in a photograph of a solitary cloud the backside of a nude Venus but his ruminations are much broader than art history. His agglutinating mind embraces poetry, Einstein, cuneiform tablets, prisons and politics. He skillful links these seemingly disparate subjects with one common element - his human response to them.The connection of imagery and ideas seems strangely familiar even if one has not previously considered these particular images juxtaposition. It might be human nature to find strange correspondences between things but few have the breadth of knowledge to link such wide-ranging subjects and fewer still would describe them with Weschler's easy elegance. His musings offer delightful possibilities rather than prescriptions and he stops short of any forced conclusions.Of particular interest are Weschler's his discussion with photographer Joel Meyerowitz, who documented the World Trade Center site, in which he finds the beauty and stylistic echoes of Vermeer and early Civil War photography. Also moving is Weschler's changing response to a photograph of a father and daughter as he and his own daughter reach the relative ages of those in the photograph.This pleasing volume is bound (with the customary McSweeney's care for design) in black cloth and features color reproductions of the paintings or photographs mentioned in the essays. It is an aesthetic delight to read. The short essays make it an ideal work to pick up and set down and I suspect I will return repeatedly to this unique book."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"Weschler says, in his introduction, that his publisher heard about one of Weschler's notebooks, one full of ideas that had not yet been put into print. The result is this lovely volume, a loose collection of gentle and wide-ranging speculations, most often driven by some kind of visual analogy.In some, the parallel elements are clear. For example, p.9 shows, a cavernous ruin excavated during cleanup after the World Trade Center attacks. On the same page, it also shows a work by Piranesi, in his Carceri d' Invenzione (forgive my Italian: that may be \\"Dungeon of Invention\\"), with the same harsh but ambiguous lighting. There are certainly similarities in the two structures and compositions, but deeper similarities lie in reading each as a technological hellhole. Other sets of pictures, including the portraits on p.62, elude my sense of analogy. That's OK. This is a personal and unpolished set of musings coaxed into publication, possibly before its ideas had ripened fully, and I'm happy to have it be what it is.I keep trying to liken this book to James Burke's \\"Connections,\\" but the connection keeps not working. Burke's work is generally taut, sustained, fast-paced, and more or less rigorous in tracing the lineage between successive ideas. This book is unapologetically scattered and subjective. Ideas link to each other along circuitous routes, and with wider concerns than Burke's focus on technology. Weschler's softer topics include \\"Women's Bodies\\", in which he addresses his subject lovingly, but as a marvel and a mystery - well, don't we all? At least, all of us who aren't women?His best writing, however is in the chapter on \\"Political Occasions.\\" It describes the freeing of Eastern Europe and especially Poland during the 1980s and 1990s. He creates a dichotomy between the Polish regime and the Polish people, whom he idealizes in wonderful ways. If I take Weschler at face value, the Poles are a people who have uniquely integrated their arts, politics, and lives, based on examples in graphics, poetry, theater, and literature. (I also respect their rich mathematics, but Weschler is an artist.) As citizen-artists, they subvert their oppressors with the words of the oppressors, in subtle displays of thaumaturgic judo.This is a book that I've wanted to see for a long time. Other books give beautiful examples of scientists reaching out from science into the subjective studies, and execrable examples of artists trying to do the same. This, instead, shows an artist reaching out towards science and politics within his cast of mind, and succeeding brilliantly.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"For its strange and compelling originality, I gave this book five stars. Author Lawrence Weschler's visual connections are unlike anything I have ever been exposed to. And it was because of this work, that when I was compiling photos for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary, that I began to notice family photographic \\"echoes.\\"A picture of my 1-year old brother in his stroller, mouth wide open in toothless glee, reaching toward the camera, echoed a photo taken at family gathering 45 years later in which the only things different are the chair in which he sits and his gleaming teeth. His body language, his expression, even his adult-sized outstretched arm are the same as the boy from the stroller.These sorts of echoes are commonly seen in your standard \`grip-and-grin\\" shots at traditional events such as birthdays and weddings. But in one-off photos like the baby/adult ones of my brother, there's something more at work. Did a buried memory surface when a similar photographic situation arose that caused him to echo his own pose from 45 years before?That might explain the same person subconsciously reacting to a similarly presented situation, but it fails to explain completely separate scenes, at different times, featuring a random set of people or circumstances that nonetheless are captured in an eerily identical composition to each another by artists not known to one another.Not all the connections in this book are photographic. Weschler includes geographical, artistic, scientific, and architectural connections, too, in which human behavior could not have influenced the outcome. This is a provocative look at an unusual and inexplicable phenomenon of things that converge between time and place."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"Once Weschler started seeing relationships between images from disparate sources, he started seeing such relationships, and others (between stories and images, stories and stories, etc.) everywhere. He began to write these 'convergences' up over the years in a series of essays which eventually were collected and published by the good folks at McSweeney's.Some of the connections seem a bit of a stretch and, at first, simply coincidence. Many may be coincidence, but the characteristics that tie these images and stories together are often numerous and repeated across centuries, leading Weschler (and this reader) to conclude that there are, at least, certain characteristics shared by these tools for passing on human experience which contribute, at least in part, to their power and timelessness.The first essay, related to 9/11, is a bit too easy, since the emotional impact of this recent event remains strong in most, if not all, of us. But that doesn't minimize the value of what Weschler has to show us in these images (and their stories). After the first three essays, I was sold on the premise and felt that I was reading a book that provided a very special way of looking at the world and its images. Like any collection of essays not originally written as a single work, there are some which don't stand up quite as well as others, but overall, these are a fine collection of observations on today, history, art, image, and how humans percieve their world and the events that surround us.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"I love Weschler's writing and the subjects he writes about, especially on art. He has an interesting way of looking at things, bringing together history and art, broadening our understanding of the visual world we live in. A great book that will get you thinking!"},{"Title":"EVERYTHING THAT RISES","review":"Lawrence Weschler has a powerful mind. The essays in this collection cover such divergent topics as art to politics. The author, however, finds was to connect seemingly unrelated works. The essays are a camera into a very thoughtful mind who looks at the world and tries to connect it to himself and tries to connect the edges to each other.I personally had purchased this book and was reading it during a time of poetic writer's block and I found the essays so thought provoking that I produced at least 3 new pages of writing.The only drawback is that a few of the essays are a bit dated. I am referring here to primarily those on Solidarity. I feel to really understand those in better detail I would have to do some more research on that time in our history.This is a great intellectual read and is a pleasure for the eye as well with great photography and artwork within its' hardcover pages."},{"Title":"Police Officer, 15 Edition (Civil Service/Military)","review":"Most of the stuff in this book is some of the things you would hear from a law enforcement officer, like I do (dad is a cop and I will be the 1st female in the family).

It tells you what your training will probably be, and gives you tips on how to do some physical training, with alot more information on other things. So, if your getting into law enforcement, I can say this is a right book to get. But if you know a police officer asks them for some insight on the field, too.AND FOR ALL THE WOMEN OUT THERE IF IT'S YOUR DREAM OR THIS IS THE PROFESSION YOU WANT TO GO IN TO I COMEND YOU, FOR I AM A WOMAN, AND I BELIEVE IF YOU FEMALE OR MALE GO FOR YOUR DREAMS AND THE THINGS YOU WANT IN LIFE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Creation and Evolution: Clear Reasons to Doubt Darwinian Evolution (pamphlet)","review":"Another extremely well written and very helpful resource from Rose Publishing.

It show problems such as working single mothers who's relationship with their kids fall apart. How the street changes peoples views and expectations. It also gave examples of what people will do when they wants something bad enough. It showed this by giving examples of wives that had their husbands leave them and in order to support their selves they turned to prostitution. Other examples are showed that only way to get rich in Harlem was to do something that might not be considered moral or legal.I would consider it more of a slap in the face to society that we let things like this happen. That if you didn't live on the right street you wouldn't ever be able to escape your future to be what that street wanted you to be. Bud the young boy in the book can't esape the fact that he will be in and out of the law the rest of his life.I feel like I learned something about human nature when reading this book, and that even though I don't come from a poor section of Harlem I still have problems that I have to face. We all have problems just not the same ones. This is shown when the rich family suffers a loss and the way that they deal with it. We all need to watch or reactions to situations so we don't make them worse.I enjoyed the book even though the flashbacks can sometimes take away from the narration, that the beginning starts slow, and the ending is sudden and shocking."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Overall my reaction to Ann Petry's novel, &quot;The Street&quot; was a positive one. I thought she did a good job of portraying life and the struggles one faced during the 1940's as not only a black person, but a woman as well. I found the storyline a bit hard to follow because she used a lot of detail in explaining everything, but at times the detail also added a great deal to what she was trying to protray to the reader. I thought the novel started off a bit meandering, but I was still pulleed into the storyline, wondering how Lutie would deal with the crisis that came along and what choices she would make for herself and her son. As I read the novel, I felt as though I could really relate to the hardships and struggles Lutie faced, the fear she felt, and the uncertainty of every decision she had to make. If you can follow along with the details and flashbacks that at times makes the storyline seem wandering, then I would recommend reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is a masterpiece. Not only is it beautifully written and structured, it has real content--the effect of racism on the lives of black people trying to make a living in America. Petry's characters come to life and stay with you long after you've read it. This is a rare book."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This is a beautiful, if somewhat depressing, novel. What a shame Ann Petry is no longer with us to write more. I read it for our bok group and am really looking forward to the discussion. Living near the area of the story made it even more poignant... things have changed since the 40s but the book still speaks!"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"\\"The Street\\" by Ann Petry is a remarkable novel, a tour de force in its examinations of what life was like for African Americans in the 1940s. Petry's depiction of Harlem is disquieting and poetic, her story woven with threads drawn from real life. The main character, Lutie Johnson, is an \\"every woman\\" who struggles to improve her life despite the forces that are holding her down.Lutie Johnson is a single mother trying to rise above the life that fate has dealt her. She is separated from a husband who could never find a job and did not appreciate his wife going off to work, and she is trying to raise their son to want more than the life that white people expect from him. She finds an apartment of her own on 116th Street in Harlem, and even though it is a dirty, filthy trap, it is a place of her own where she could maybe save enough money to get to somewhere better. But Lutie soon learns that the street has other plans for her and that evil lurks at every corner. Anything she tries to improve her situation is thrown back in her face, and as the novel builds towards a certain doom, Lutie must make a decision to stand firm or compromise everything she has always believed in.What makes \\"The Street\\" so unique is Ann Petry's use of personification and metaphor to bring her setting to life. The \\"street\\" that traps Lutie and her son is a character that lives and breathes, that pursues and traps them. Petry's examination of racial dissonance and inequality is intelligent and poignant. She paints a grim picture of what it was like to be African American and poor. Much as with Richard Wright's \\"Native Son,\\" readers know that no satisfying happy ending could await Lutie Johnson, who is very much a victim of her environment. Yet it is an environment that is forged by segregation, an environment that could exist on any street in New York, not just in Harlem. It is an environment that sadly still exists today, which makes Petry's novel a timeless classic, and perhaps a prophetic warning."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"For me it was a delightful read. Unlike other reviews of this book, I loved the detail in the first chapter. The wind was compared 'the Powers That Be.' People are driven by this wind, causing them to have to bend or humble themselves, not unlike the powers that be. Because of the strong wind they are unable to stand straight and tall. The wind (or powers that be) causes one to bend, forcing them to humbling themselves simple to survive. Poor people have little control over the condition of their lives, similar to the lack of control over the elements. Also, I love the character development. However, given Lutie's character, and her love for her son, I beleive the ending was out of charachter for her."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Ann Petry did an amazing job in her novel, &quot;The Street&quot;, portraying the life of an African-American woman in the 1940's making a life for herself in Harlem. She uses a great amount of detail and flashbacks to show the setting of Harlem with Lutie as she lives through these tough times. And although the descriptions and flashbacks really add to the novel, the reader should be very attentive when reading otherwise they'll get lost in a flashback that they might think is the present. Even though the book begins at a very slow pace, by the middle of the book, it was difficult to put down and just when things seem to be okay the book's ending is very abrupt and took me by surprise, which took away some of my enjoyment of the book. But overall, Petry did a tremendous job of taking her readers to Harlem and living this young woman's trying life."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Ann Petry's the Street is a moving and somewhat distubing novel. I enjoyed reading this book. Ann does a great job of portraying lower-class life in the 40s to the reader. The emotions of the characters in the book soon became mine. Ann uses a lot of details and flashbacks. At times they can be a little confusing, but they are generally helpful to describe what the characters are feeling. One thing I didn't like about the book is that it ends a little too abruptly. Otherwise this book is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Ann Petry's novel The Street was a good book in my opinion. There were many good things about the way it was written. I really liked the storyline the book was supposed to follow, but at times The Street seemed very lengthy on subjects that didn't do much to add to it. The most prominent example of these would be the flashbacks used throughout the novel. Granted, they give the reader useful information about what's happened to some of the characters in the past, they seem to come at some of the worst possible moments. Honestly, I liked the book and enjoyed learning about life for the lower classes in the 1940's, but if I hadn't been asked to read this book for class I would have put it down before it ever got a chance to get my attention. It just took too long to actually get me to want to keep reading. It wasn't until almost halfway through it that I actually got into the story. The Street is a good novel and worth reading, but I wouldn't put it too high on your reading list."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I enjoyed reading The Street. It allowed me to see through the eyes of a struggling african american. It provided a way to see and understand more clearly some reasons for racial divisions. The ending of the book was also a surprise. Its sudden twist with no happy ending reminded me somewhat of the ending of the novel Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"this is one of the better books out there for young peopl"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is about an African American mother and her struggles to fight poverty while raising her eight year old son. The book starts out slow and continues this way. Although the author picks up the pace of the book in a few places these are few and far between. The book as a whole brings a good message but is so riddled with over detailed flashbacks and descriptions of characters and settings that this message is hard to follow and is sometimes lost in the detail. If you want to read this book do it while consuming large amounts of coffee or while you have a case of insomnia it's the only way you will get more that a few pages."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is for the paranoid. This book of eighteen chapters had a one main theme. Everyone was out to get her. She was ruined because a man couldn't have her. She missed her big break because the a man wanted her. There where some other topics. They lead back to men wanting her. The final chapter was aburpt but expected.The are many redeeming quality of this book. She explained economic and racial conditions at this time of history. The book was full of vivid imagiary and indepth charchaters. The novel dicated a chapter to each person, or family. This made the reasoning for the ending clear."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Ann didn't do a very gbood job on keeping my attention. She went into way too much detail and there were many times that I just completely lost all interest in reading it. It just keep going and going. The only good part about this book us the topic on black and white relations. I'm sure that there is a little truth to this."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I gave this book two stars because I am not big on reading books that include every detail of every second. I realie that when writing fiction books you must show a lot of detail to make the reader feel as though it is a real place or time but, when the main characters breakfast is describe to a &quot;T&quot;, that is getting a little dicouraging. Ann Petry did write a good book, better than I could of wrote and I would recommend reading it to others but, I would never read it again. The ending left a little to be desired as well. When a book makes it hard for you to stay interested and then kind of leaves you hanging at the end it makes it hard to give it a good review."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book gives deep insight to the lives of Afro-American people in the 1940's. Ann Petry went into a lot of depth on the reasons for the actions of the main character, however I thought that she went into too much detail when describing most situations, while other points were not described so that the reader can understand the main character's actions. At times, she would go into so much explanation that the reader would lose track of what is happening in the book. She used flashbacks to help explain the main character's thoughts, but in doing this, she lost the reader. The flashbacks are helpful in explaining, but are a little excessive. Yet other information, such as the influence that the grandmother and father, is not explained to the reader until later in the book. The main plot of the book did make the reader understand what it was like to live in the 1940's, but it could have been done with much less explanation."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book was a long winded tail. That documents the life struggles of a poor colored woman. The story was overly dramatic and I felt no real connection between myself and charactors in the book. The book is so slow and excedingly discriptive, that you can read ten pages and get nowhere. A positive aspects of this book are found in the under lying story. A story of a white upper class family, that shows not only do the poor struggle in life but we all do at times. This portion of the story helps to give a little more valitety and balance, in that it give you a look at both sides of life. I do think that petry's story was heart felt and meaningful to her but it has no real appeal to those who don't want to be depressed."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"i didn't like this novel for two reasons: primarily it is incredibly overdramatic and secondarily, it's basically 400 pages of whining about being poor. i feel that the use of flowery language has covered up a very poorly thought out book."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I can't believe the amount of time wasted on reading this book. It ended terribly. The whole time I'm thinking she'll get out of the street, but no in an abrupt end the author turns her into a murderer who deserts her child. Yes, it does a good job of explaining the way the world looked from the Black point of view... but I don't think anyone would want to be represented by the main character. I am so disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"About a year ago, I was given this novel as a gift. My busy work and life schedules prohibited me from reading it until a few days ago. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. What a wonderfully written story. This novel is a must read. I am still devastated and heart broken over the ending but a story doesn't have to have a happy ending in order to be good. Ms. Petry writes such vivid and colorful descriptions. The picture she paints educates the reader to the reality of life in the 1940's for black people. This one will touch your heart and soul. You will cry and ask yourself repeatedly if Lutie and Bub will ever be able to leave 'The Street'. I strongly recommend giving this one as a gift to someone you know. I know I am."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"A certain vein of American naturalism describes in relentlessly stark terms the hopelessness and misery of urban poverty; examples include Stephen Crane's \\"Maggie,\\" Frank Norris's \\"McTeague,\\" Sinclair Lewis's \\"Sister Carrie,\\" Richard Wright's \\"Native Son.\\" You can add to that sterling list Ann Petry's 1946 novel, \\"The Street.\\" If you're looking for novels that with uplifting characters or happy endings, then naturalism might seem like the Lima beans you had to eat before dessert. All these works portray characters who are victims of circumstances and whose choices in life are limited. As Petry said in an interview published in the NAACP newsletter The Crisis, \\"In 'The Street' my aim is too show how simply and easily the environment can change the course of a person's life.\\" And, it should go without saying, a horrible environment is more likely to change it for the worse.The \\"environment\\" figures nearly as a separate character in this novel. The \\"Street\\"--that, is the squalor of a block in Harlem--reflects, limits, and defines everyone who lives there. The newcomer to the neighborhood is Lutie, a mother struggling to raise her young son, Bub; she left her husband who, unable to find work because of his race, took up with another woman while Lutie worked as a maid in the suburbs. Lutie's new neighbors include Mrs. Hedges, who runs a brothel; Jones, the building super who pretty much loses his mind lusting after the new tenant; and Min, his current live-in girlfriend. Each is of a type: Lutie is idealistically principled, Bub is perilously naive, Mrs. Hedges is jadedly street-smart, Jones is menacingly vulgar, Min is irrationally jealous. Yet these characters transcend their types through their interactions with the surroundings: both by their ongoing struggles to make something of the little available to them and by the improbability that they ever might get ahead.Through the wonder of Petry's prose, it is the Street (116th Street during wartime, to be precise) that commands our attention; it seems to have its own personality; it does things to people. Lutie thinks to herself, \\"you're afraid that this street will keep [Bub] from finishing high school; that it may do worse than that and get him into some kind of trouble that will land him in reform school because you can't be home to look out for him because you have to work.\\" Later she wonders, \\"What would the street do to her?\\" And this Street seems unique and alive: When Mrs. Hedges \\"referred to it as 'the street,' her lips seemed to linger over the words as though her mind paused at the sound to write capital letters and then enclosed the words in quotation marks--thus setting it off and separating it from any other street in the city, giving it an identity, unmistakable and apart.\\" The Street becomes a neo-gothic monstrosity; only someone like Mrs. Hedges, who has surrendered to its lack of charms, can possibly survive its lethal influences.Petry's prose somehow manages to be simultaneously unadorned and poetic; that is, she tells her story in a straightforward manner yet each sentence is as evocative as it is sparse. And her characters are wholly believable and her plotting is relentless (the pacing of her novel belies its 450-page length). Yes, this novel is \\"depressing\\" but, above all, it is real."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"\\"The Street\\" is about African American single-mom Lutie Johnson who lives in Harlem in the late 1940s, with her 8 year old son, Bub.At the start of the story, she is somewhat optimistic, feeling that with hard work she can overcome poverty. However, it seems that in order to make ends meet, she has to work long distances from her family, and deal with the harsh racial aspects of the time that are keeping African Americans from \\"moving up.\\" Hence, her marriage falls apart, and Lutie begins to feel that money will solve all her problems....even racism.It is a blessing and curse that Lutie is described as very beautiful, so practically all men (no matter their race) fall for her, and only have their interests in mind.Lutie changes from an optimist to a desparate cynic by the end of the novel.And, even though the novel ends on a somewhat sour note, I personally had the feeling that Lutie, not exactly an angel by the end of the novel, could eventually find happiness in the crazy world she put through."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Professionals say our environment is a major part of what we become later in life. Lutie Johnson didn't need a psychologist or social worker to tell her these words. Deep down in her heart she knew 116th street would never make her. It could only break her. Everyday her constant thought is how to get away from the streetbefore it's destructive powers destroyed her little boy, Bub. Sadly, her environment is a major battle she can never win. I learned that no matter how hard I try to remove myself from a thing, a person or a place I won't always be the victor. The sad truth is there are times when I will become the conquered and not the conqueror. Ann Petry's The Street is a strong novel. She pulls no punches. She writes about racism, poverty and the cruelty of the human heart. After closing her novel, I discovered life isn't for the weak. Life is for the strong. Without human strength the street will follow you wherever you go.artistpages/petryAnn\\"And as the train roared into the darkness, Lutie tried to figure out by what twists and turns of fate she had landed on this train. Her mind balked at the task. All she could think was, It was that street. It was that______street.\\""},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This is another one of those books I discovered by accident. If you are the kind of reader that appreciates excellent, well written fiction that speaks of the Black American experience, then I highly recommend. It was a great read.That Super was creepy as all get out. I was just reading the book, and I was scared of him.These are some very powerful words:\\"Most of the women had been marketing, for they carried bulging shopping bags. She notices how heavily they walked on feet that obviously hurt despite the wide, cracked shoes they wore. They've been out all day working in the white folks' kitchens, she thought, then they come home and cook and clean for their own families half the night. And again she remembered Mrs. Pizzini's words, \\"Not good for the woman to work when she is young. No good for the man.' Obviously she had been right, for here on this street the women trudged along overburdened, overworked, their own homes neglected while they looked after someone else's while the men on the street sung along empty-handed, well dressed, and carefree. Or they lounged against the sides of the building, their hands in their pockets while they stared at the women who walked past, probably deciding which woman they should select to replace the wife who was out working all day.And yet, she thought, what else is a woman to do when her man can't get a job?\\"**Note to fellow readers: Not to give any of the story away. I was annoyed at Lutie for only taking part of the money at the end. I thought she deserved all Boots had on him."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Petry's novel was recommended by an African American literature professor of mine. And with good reason--it's a classic of African American fiction.The reader's heart breaks for these characters as they grapple with the suffocating strictures in an unforgiving, ruthless white supremacist America. Even so, the characters are not one-dimensional saints. Life is ugly in the American ghetto.I would recommend this author and novel for anyone moved by better-known African American literature or teachers of literature. The US school system must do a better job exposing students to more African American authors, as they play a crucial role in exposing harsh realities of our nation's social history."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The street is about a young woman trying way out, for her and her son. All Lutie Johnson want is a good life for her and young son.The two end up living in a bad apartment, after they move out from living with her father, an his bad new girlfriend. The super at their new apartment had eyes for Lutie to her horror. The story takes place in the 40's.Though I didn't like the choice Lutie made at the end regarding her son, Don't miss this old classic about a woman just trying to survive."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Living on 116th Street isn't an easy and the detailed life of Lutie Johonson proves this. Living as a single mother with a young son, Lutie strives to give herself a better life by moving to the street. Her daily struggles and the people in her life show what the street has to offer. The book gets off to a slow start, but soon the characters emerge and the book is hard to put down. The use of imagery and vivid detail allows you to feel as if you live on the street too. This book gives you a better understanding of life and how things aren't always fair."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I really liked this book because it has good moral to it, or underlying message. The book paints a very realistic picture in the reader's mind of what it might have been like to be a minority living in the ghettos of New York back in the 1940's. It is also very realistic in that the ending isn't always happy in real life, and what's expected doesn't always happen. Ann Petry's style in this book does a very good job of getting the reader involved by being very descriptive with details, but there are a few points in the book that are too involved with detail which seems to drag on and delay the much anticipated plot. Overall, it's a good book and one that I found exteremely hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I recently read &quot;The Street&quot; by Ann Petry. The book starts out explaining how Lutie Johnson is surviving her meager life on the street IN DETAIL. She then goes on to describe the apartment building she moves into, the super, Mrs. Hedges, and of course she eventually describes the &quot;Street&quot;. After she explains Lutie and her neighbors, Ms. Petry goes on to give a profile of a Bar and Grill, it's owner, his right hand man, and a casino. So chapter after chapter this book becomes one profile after another of everything Lutie encounters. Each chapter, Ms. Petry describes IN DETAIL each character, their history in flashbacks, and also any place Lutie goes. So when the ending comes, there's no climax, there is no development up to the conclusion, it's just there. The ending pretty much leaves you hanging. The development of the conclusion, the climax, and the actual conclusion were all contained in one very compact chapter. Ann Petry concentrated too much on details of the characters and places of her book and not enough on the plot."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"i remember finding this book at the library and at first I got it because of it's title. But it is so truthful of oppression (racial , sexual,classicism , black - on black ) , hard economic times , ambition , middle class dreams, the finest. i recommend this book to anyone who is still confused about how oppression works. :)"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I am currently reading this novel for my Black Women's Writing course. I am surprised I didn't know this was out there and equally pleased with the work itself. To reiterate on the comments about the book being spot on, yes I believe it is an honest portrayal of what it must have been like to come of age,AND raise a son on a street such as that in Harlem. People responded negatively to The Color Purple as well, since it dealt with incest and rape within our own community. Well get over it. We can't confront these problems if we're not willing to pull the rugs off of them and see them for what they are."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"One of the most moving novels I have ever read. Petry's novel displays naturalism at its finest. More than that, it is an enjoyable, easy read! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The book &quot;The Street&quot; by Anne Petry was an interesting book in itself, however, it was hard to decide how accurate it was in its depiction of Harlem. This is primaryily due to the fact that it is rather extreme, and not knowing how much Anne acctully knew about Harlem. Besides this, it was a readable book, and is well worth reading. At first, it doesn't seem like it is going to be a great book, but as you go on it does indeed become more appealing to read."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I thought that this book was really well written. The great description that the author goes into made me feel like I knew the characters personally and wasn't just reading about them. By the end of the book, I knew the characters so well that I felt could accurately predict how they would react to the given situations they faced in the book. Whether it was Lutie or Mr. Jones, I almost knew what their actions were going to be before I read them. That understanding of the characters helped me get into the book and keep me interested in every page. The book is quite depressing at times but that is necessary to express the ideas of the story. What Lutie faced everyday in the story is what a lot of people face in real life. It was the truth and reality of the book that appealed to me and is also why I would highly recommend this book to all of you."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is nice & thick; I was so happy because I figured it would be a good long book to read.So I read, read, and read some more & I wasn't stunned or shocked until the last 5 pages of the book; that's when everything peaked. No exaggerations.Sorry to say I was disappointed..."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Petry captures the pulse of the black experience with accuracy and emotion. With each character she demonstrates how trapped life can become no matter how hard a person is trying to lift him or her self out of a situation. The character development was impressive and the ending was a complete surprise but believable. A must read."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"\\"The Street\\" is spellbinding and so well-written it must be the envy of many writers. I could not put the book down, and I disagree with all those who complained about \\"too many details\\" or \\"boredom.\\"And yet, the book is relentlessly grim, where everything is so highly staked against the heroine--sometimes deliberately by the author--that she has no chance in a thousand years to improve her lot. Dostoevsky certainly writes about characters as depressed as Petry's Lutie, but his writing is not depressing; on the contrary, it is uplifting and illuminating. \\"The Street\\" is downright depressing in a hard, stony way. It is as if the author's fist breaks through the pages to hit the reader's face again and again.S. Spilka"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"To me, this book was both good and bad. A good, thoughtful story and a lot of detail, but often too much detail and the story crept along very slowly in some parts. In other parts, I felt I had to read quickly so I could find out what was going to happen. There were many flashbacks and side stories that help one see exactly what is going on in each character's mind, but sometimes the extra detail distracted too much from the main story. I often asked myself, &quot;Where's this going, and what's happening to the other people now?&quot; Some flashbacks would slow the story down quite a bit, and when they were over, it felt like I was jolted back into the main plot. Some stories would end suddenly or not go anywhere and it felt like Petry was rushed in writing this. The flashbacks were not all bad, however. They were very helpful in understanding what each character was feeling, thinking, and in some cases why they felt that way. The details in these good flashbacks were well thought out and very clear. They really helped the story move along and made for worthwhile reading. After completing this book, I felt that there was a lot more to be explained, like the story wasn't supposed to end where it did. Sometimes endings like that make a story better though. This wasn't the best book I've read, but it was still a good one and worth checking out if you've got time."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I listened to the out-of-print audio version on cassette, magnificently read by Lynne Thigpen (The Chief in Carmen Sandiego). The last tape was broken - gah - so I was forced to finish the book in paperback. The spoken word was much more powerful, but the brutal force of this story cannot be denied in any format. The supporting characters - Mrs. Hedges, Mr. Jones, Boots, Min - each have their own tortured tale deftly told, and each is defeated by the vicious racism of the times. Petry has written the urban version of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", minus any redemption or hope. An afternoon in the life of Bub, a young boy left on his own while his mother(despite her obvious intelligence and drive) ekes out a paltry living as a file clerk, has him making a game out of watching starving dogs moving slowly and painfully through heaps of trash.This would also make a powerful film - Spike Lee or John Singleton, attention should be paid!"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Overall, &quot;The Street&quot;, by Ann Petry, is a very entertaining and thoughtfully written book. The first few pages of the novel are a bit slow, but the pace and creativity picks up as one delves deeper into the writing. Although the plot is sometimes overburdened by excessive detail, it flows smoothly from one scenario to the next with only flashbacks breaking up the timeline. The only disappointment that I found was the abrupt ending. Although this may be a device used by Petry, it is rather sudden and doesn't seem to be as fulfilling as the rest of the text. Other than a few flaws, the book is very touching and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This novel was a gripping story of poverty and distress. It was very descriptive, and it gives the reader an in depth look on life in the city. Although Petry overendulges into her detail many times throughout the book, if one can hold on to the topic at hand, while taking in the details of what is given to them, you almost feel as though you are in the story yourself. This conflict of losing track of yourself comes into play often with the flashbacks, and the elaborateness of them. The best way to avoid getting lost, is to wait until after the flashbacks are over to put the book down. This is not hard to do, for once the relatively slow beginning is through, it is a challenge to stop reading."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I thought this book was very powerful. It had a meaning to it, that you didn't have to search for. It pulls together topics like violence and poverty from several different perspectives which make you appreciate the things you have and makes you more aware of what is out there in the world. It is an easy book to read, because at parts it is hard to put down. The Street is a compelling novel in which many students should read. Although I was given this book as an assignment, I am glad I read it, because it makes you more aware that no one is perfect, and that everyone has problems, even the richest of the rich. All in all, it leaves you with a good feeling."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This novel is an interesting and sad portrayal of the life of African-Americans in the 40s. It is also has shockingly close relationship to the current situation of African-Americans in society. I believe this book is eye-opening and enlightening although the ending is so tragic."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The Street, by Ann Petry, is a worth-while read. While reading The Street, you are able to view the surroundings around the main character, Lutie Johnson, through not only her thoughts, but also those of other characters. The street is a character in itself, in this story. It is to blame for all of the problems experienced by the people that reside in the buildings that line its sides. Problems that range from lack of money, to sexual frustrations, to utter lonliness, all of which are lined with the feeling of total hopelessness. Most of these problems revolve around the main character, Lutie Johnson, in some way. She has been forced to move to this street, because she has no money, her husband is cheating, everyone believes she is compiled of every stereotype that exists, and her son needs a better place to be. You feel for the poor lady as hope after hope and dream after dream are shattered as each day goes by."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The bases for this novel is very intriguing even though I had trouble getting into the book at the beginning. Ann Petry spends to much time on details that, to me, have no barring on the story. I kept getting lost and confused in the details she gives. Even though I got lost a long the way I still developed strong feelings for the characters. It also gave me a little insight into a world I know nothing about."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function B(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-a179c061"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/11.md","filePath":"quotesmag/11.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/11.md"},z=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(H)]))}});export{D as __pageData,z as default};
