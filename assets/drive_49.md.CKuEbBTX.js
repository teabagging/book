An Embarrassment of Mangoes is a delicious chronicle of leaving the type-A lifestyle behind -- and discovering the seductive secrets of life in the Caribbean. Who hasn t fantasized about chucking the job, saying goodbye to the rat race, and escaping to some exotic destination in search of sun, sand, and a different way of life? Canadians Ann Vanderhoof and her husband, Steve did just that. In the mid 1990s, they were driven, forty-something professionals who were desperate for a break from their deadline-dominated, career-defined lives. So they quit their jobs, rented out their house, moved onto a 42-foot sailboat called Receta ( recipe,  in Spanish), and set sail for the Caribbean on a two-year voyage of culinary and cultural discovery. In lavish detail that will have you packing your swimsuit and dashing for the airport, Vanderhoof describes the sun-drenched landscapes, enchanting characters and mouthwatering tastes that season their new lifestyle. Come along for the ride and be seduced by Caribbean rhythms as she and Steve sip rum with their island neighbors, hike lush rain forests, pull their supper out of the sea, and adapt to life on  island time.  Exchanging business clothes for bare feet, they drop anchor in 16 countries -- 47 individual islands -- where they explore secluded beaches and shop lively local markets. Along the way, Ann records the delectable dishes they encounter -- from cracked conch in the Bahamas to curried lobster in Grenada, from Dominican papaya salsa to classic West Indian rum punch -- and incorporates these enticing recipes into the text so that readers can participate in the adventure. Almost as good as making the journey itself, An Embarrassment of Mangoes is an intimate account that conjures all the irresistible beauty and bounty from the Bahamas to Trinidad -- and just may compel you to make a rash decision that will land you in paradise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2H-pDrKb0E0C&dq=Mangoes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magnus, Robot Fighter 4000 A.D.

However, it wasn't until her own brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer that she realized she understood very little about the emotional and spiritual aspects of caring for the terminally ill. To fill this gap she turned to the unique wisdom on death and dying found in Tibetan Buddhism. In this book Coberly offers sound, practical advice on meeting the essential needs of the dying, integrating stories from her long career in nursing with useful insights from the Tibetan Buddhist teachings. In the West, death is viewed as a tragic and horrible event. Coberly shows us how this view generates fear and denial, which harm the dying by adding unnecessary loneliness, confusion, and mental anguish to the dying process. Tibetan Buddhism focuses on the nature of death and how to face it with honesty, openness, and courage. In this view, death is not a failure, but a natural part of life that, if properly understood and appreciated, can offer the dying and their loved ones an opportunity to gain valuable insight and wisdom. Coberly argues that the Tibetan Buddhist outlook can be a useful antidote to the culture of fear and denial that surrounds death in the West and can help caregivers become more fully present, fearless, honest, and compassionate. Sacred Passage highlights two very practical teachings on death and dying from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and presents them in clear, nontechnical language. Readers learn about the \\"eight stages of dissolution leading to death,\\" a detailed roadmap of the dying process that describes the sequence of physical, psychological, and spiritual changes that occur as we die. Coberly also presents the \\"death meditation,\\" a contemplative exercise for developing a new relationship to death and life. The book also includes a lengthy, annotated list of recommended readings for added guidance and inspiration. Topics include: ? How the terminally ill can experience emotional and spiritual healing even when they can't be cured ? Why Western medicine's relentless focus on curing disease has led to inadequate care for the dying ? What to expect during the dying process ? How our fear and denial of death harm the dying ? Techniques to help caregivers promote a peaceful environment for the dying and their loved ones ? How to meet the changing physical and emotional needs of the dying ? Helpful advice on what to say and how to behave around the terminally ill","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MMcdAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A question of proof: A Nigel Strangeways mystery (Popular library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nature Printing: With Herbs, Fruits & Flowers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dear Lover: A Woman's Guide to Enjoying Love's Deepest Bliss","description":"In Dear Lover: A Woman's Guide to Men, Sex, and Love's Deepest Bliss, David Deida explores every aspect of the feminine practice of spiritual intimacy, from sexuality and lovemaking to family and career to emotions, trust, and commitment.

In works such as The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! Faulkner drew powerfully on Southern themes, attitudes, and atmosphere to create his own world and place--the mythical Yoknapatawpha County--peopled with quintessential Southerners such as the Compsons, Sartorises, Snopes, and McCaslins. Indeed, to a degree perhaps unmatched by any other major twentieth-century novelist, Faulkner remained at home and explored his own region--the history and culture and people of the South. Now, in William Faulkner and Southern History, one of America's most acclaimed historians of the South, Joel Williamson, weaves together a perceptive biography of Faulkner himself, an astute analysis of his works, and a revealing history of Faulkner's ancestors in Mississippi--a family history that becomes, in Williamson's skilled hands, a vivid portrait of Southern culture itself. Williamson provides an insightful look at Faulkner's ancestors, a group sketch so brilliant that the family comes alive almost as vividly as in Faulkner's own fiction. Indeed, his ancestors often outstrip his characters in their colorful and bizarre nature. Williamson has made several discoveries: the Falkners (William was the first to spell it \\"Faulkner\\") were not planter, slaveholding \\"aristocrats\\"; Confederate Colonel Falkner was not an unalloyed hero, and he probably sired, protected, and educated a mulatto daughter who married into America's mulatto elite; Faulkner's maternal grandfather Charlie Butler stole the town's money and disappeared in the winter of 1887-1888, never to return. Equally important, Williamson uses these stories to underscore themes of race, class, economics, politics, religion, sex and violence, idealism and Romanticism--\\"the rainbow of elements in human culture\\"--that reappear in Faulkner's work. He also shows that, while Faulkner's ancestors were no ordinary people, and while he sometimes flashed a curious pride in them, Faulkner came to embrace a pervasive sense of shame concerning both his family and his culture. This he wove into his writing, especially about sex, race, class, and violence, psychic and otherwise. William Faulkner and Southern History represents an unprecedented publishing event--an eminent historian writing on a major literary figure. By revealing the deep history behind the art of the South's most celebrated writer, Williamson evokes new insights and deeper understanding, providing anyone familiar with Faulkner's great novels with a host of connections between his work, his life, and his ancestry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in Australian totemism (Oceania monographs)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G9ptAAAAMAAJ&dq=Studies+in+Australian+totemism+(Oceania+monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cardmaster Adventure Design Deck (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Game)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a80aAwAACAAJ&dq=Cardmaster+Adventure+Design+Deck+(Advanced+Dungeons+and+Dragons+Game)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Bookworms Library: Stage 1: 400 Headwords Pocahontas","description":"The books are graded at six vocabulary levels, ranging from 400 words (Beginning) to 2,500 words (Advanced.)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aXWazgEACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Bookworms+Library:+Stage+1:+400+Headwords+Pocahontas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lessons from the Heart of American Business: A Roadmap for Managers in the 21st Century","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Breast: One Woman's Cancer Story","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Duck Gods Must Be Crazy: More Stories of Waterfowling Obsession","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Skreemer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The cooking of China (Foods of the world)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Laban for Actors and Dancers: Putting Laban's Movement Theory Into Practice: A Step-by-Step Guide","description":"First Published in 1993.

James J. Braddock was a once promising light heavyweight. But a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to coincide with the Great Crash of 1929 and Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him. Gould looked out for the burly, quiet Irishman, finding matches for Braddock to help him feed his wife and children. Together, they were about to stage the greatest comeback in fighting history. Within twelve months, Braddock went from being on the relief rolls to facing heavyweight champion Max Baer, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A brash Jewish boxer from the West Coast, Baer was heavily favored but Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders, and when he emerged victorious against all odds, the shock was palpable and the cheers were deafening. In the wake of his surprise win, Damon Runyon dubbed him  Cinderella Man.

With Tongzhi, you will come to understand the variations of same-sex erotica in different Chinese societies. Examining past and present treatment of the subject, including instances of discrimination against homosexuals, Tongzhi explores same-sex eroticism in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and explains the variations of categories and experiences of tongzhi in these countries. Just what is Tongzhi? Tongzhi is the most popular contemporary Chinese word for lesbians, bisexuals, and gay people. The word, which has very positive historical references, was a Chinese translation from the Soviet communist term comrade. It was appropriated by a Hong Kong gay activist in 1989 for the first Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in Hong Kong by its organizers, who wanted to employ an indigenous representation of same-sex eroticism. The term 'homosexual was inappropriate because of its use as a medical term denoting sickness and pathology. Within a few years, tongzhi became a widely used term in Hong Kong and Taiwan and is often used interchangeably with the English term gay. But terms such as gay, lesbian, and queer are Anglo-Saxon in origin, with specific histories that cannot capture the indigenous features of Chinese same-sex relationships. Tongzhi implies and includes much more. S/Mers, transvestites, and other fetishists who are members of the Chinese sexual counterculture who may be quite heterosexual are also tongzhi. And the term has meaning beyond the sexual: it embodies a strong sentiment for integrating the sexual (legitimizing same-sex love), the political (sharing the goals of fighting heterosexism) and the cultural (reappropriating their Chinese identity). Tongzhi brings you fascinating insight into: the history of same-sex eroticism in China coming out in Chinese society how colonialism has affected sexual nonconformists in this region racial and sexual dynamics in Colonial Hong Kong the cultural politics of being a tomboy/girl in modern Hong Kong  queering the mainstream  with tongzhi identity politics sexual/cultural diversities and differences among contemporary Chinese societies . . . and much more! Tongzhi shows how culture influences identity and demonstrates how you can develop relevant strategies for successful activist movements. Discussing political movements for gay/lesbian/bisexual rights and the societal implications of same-sex eroticism, this intelligent book provides you with a clear understanding of the attitudes toward and meanings of being tongzhi today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mLUs9DSLacC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HOOSIER SCHOOL-boy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S6A3AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abstract Sunshine","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No Dignity for Joshua: More Vital Insight into Deaf Children, Deaf Education and Deaf Culture","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Owned and Owner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kVGsQgAACAAJ&dq=Owned+and+Owner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Ride","description":"\\"Citizen Kane does Adventureland.\\"  The Washington Post The outlandish, hilarious, terrifying, and almost impossible-to-believe story of the legendary, dangerous amusement park where millions were entertained and almost as many bruises were sustained, told through the eyes of the founder's son. Often called \\"Accident Park,\\" \\"Class Action Park,\\" or \\"Traction Park,\\" Action Park was an American icon. Entertaining more than a million people a year in the 1980s, the New Jersey-based amusement playland placed no limits on danger or fun, a monument to the anything-goes spirit of the era that left guests in control of their own adventures--sometimes with tragic results. Though it closed its doors in 1996 after nearly twenty years, it has remained a subject of constant fascination ever since, an establishment completely anathema to our modern culture of rules and safety. Action Park is the first-ever unvarnished look at the history of this DIY Disneyland, as seen through the eyes of Andy Mulvihill, the son of the park's idiosyncratic founder, Gene Mulvihill. From his early days testing precarious rides to working his way up to chief lifeguard of the infamous Wave Pool to later helping run the whole park, Andy's story is equal parts hilarious and moving, chronicling the life and death of a uniquely American attraction, a wet and wild 1980s adolescence, and a son's struggle to understand his father's quixotic quest to become the Walt Disney of New Jersey. Packing in all of the excitement of a day at Action Park, this is destined to be one of the most unforgettable memoirs of the year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6PnoDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dangerous+Ride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caminos Activities Manual (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t1h6QgAACAAJ&dq=Caminos+Activities+Manual+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E-Commerce","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"World As Laboratory: Experiments With Mice, Mazes, and Men","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nissan Sentra and 200SX, 1995-1999 (Haynes Repair Manuals)","description":"Every Haynes manual is based on a complete teardown and rebuild, contains hundreds of \\"hands-on\\" photos tied to step-by-step instructions, and is thorough enough to help anyone from a do-it-your-selfer to a professional.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JI3_ugEACAAJ&dq=Nissan+Sentra+and+200SX,+1995-1999+(Haynes+Repair+Manuals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters from the Leelanau","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Monster Trap","description":"Lavishly illustrated with Dean Morrissey's spectacular oil paintings, The Monster Trap will delight fans of his earlier works, as well as anyone who has ever wondered just what it was they heard under their bed or deep in their closet in the middle of the night.

James was an eminent scholar who spent his entire adult life in the academic surroundings of Eton and Cambridge. His classic supernatural tales draw on the terrors of the everyday, in which documents and objects unleash terrible forces, often in closed rooms and night-time settings where imagination runs riot. Lonely country houses, remote inns, ancient churches or the manuscript collections of great libraries provide settings for unbearable menace, from creatures seeking retribution and harm. These stories have lost none of their power to unsettle and disturb. This edition presents all of James's published ghost stories, including the unforgettable 'Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad' and 'Casting the Runes', and an appendix of James's writings on the ghost story. Darryl Jones's introduction and notes provide a fascinating insight into James's background and his mastery of the genre he made his own. --!

They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979. It also includes updates on those individuals covered in the first edition; changes in status, short reviews of books published since the first edition through December 31, 2008.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7dSx1CEeLOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Van der Steen's cats","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0edKkgEACAAJ&dq=Van+der+Steen%27s+cats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The essential unity of all religions,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Decorative Doorways Stained Glass Pattern Book: 151 Designs for Sidelights, Fanlights, Transoms, etc. (Dover Stained Glass Instruction)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"World Killers (Sentinels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Reluctant Dragon","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"21st Century Fitness: Your personal guide to getting younger as you grow older.","description":"21 CENTURY FITNESS(R) Your guide to getting younger as you grow older 21st Century Fitness is the first evidence-based formula of exercise and nutrition for staying young.

In places like Steventon Parsonage, Godmersham Park, Chawton House and a small rented house in Winchester, Worsley discovers a Jane Austen very different from the one who famously lived a 'life without incident'. Worsley examines the rooms, spaces and possessions which mattered to her, and the varying ways in which homes are used in her novels as both places of pleasure and as prisons. She shows readers a passionate Jane Austen who fought for her freedom, a woman who had at least five marriage prospects, but--in the end--a woman who refused to settle for anything less than Mr. Darcy. Illustrated with two sections of color plates, Lucy Worsley's Jane Austen at Home is a richly entertaining and illuminating new book about one of the world s favorite novelists and one of the subjects she returned to over and over in her unforgettable novels: home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hVInDwAAQBAJ&dq=Jane+Austen%3B:+A+biography,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Energy Landscapes: Applications to Clusters, Biomolecules and Glasses (Cambridge Molecular Science)","description":"A self-contained account of energy landscape theory aimed at graduate students and researchers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YQrB6s3LALEC&dq=Energy+Landscapes:+Applications+to+Clusters,+Biomolecules+and+Glasses+(Cambridge+Molecular+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder","description":"What do you do when a three-year-old with autism falls on the floor kicking and screaming?

A Republican president seeks reelection in the afterglow of a war many view as unnecessary and imperialisttic. He is bankrolled by millionaires, with every step of his career orchestrated by a political mastermind. Religious extremists crusade against the nation s moral collapse. Terrorists plot the assassination of leaders around the world. And a lonely, disturbed revolutionary stalks the President. . . . It all happened. One hundred years ago. It all comes to life in The Temple of Music. A vivid, gripping historical novel of the Gilded Age, The Temple of Music re-creates the larger-than-life characters and tempestuous events that rocked turn-of-the-century America. From battlefields to political backrooms, from romance to murder, The Temple of Music tells the tales of robber barons, immigrants, yellow journalists, and anarchists, all centering on one of the most fascinating, mysterious, but little-explored events in American history: the assassination of President William McKinley by the disturbed anarchist Leon Czolgosz. The Temple of Music brings to life the intrigues and passions, the hatreds and loves of a rich cast of real-life characters, including Emma Goldman, the passionate anarchist who forsakes her personal life to fight for workers  rights and free love; her imprisoned lover, the failed assassin Alexander Berkman; corrupt kingmaker  Dollar  Mark Hanna, whose fund-raising and strategizing foreshadowed how modern presidential campaigns would be run; William Jennings Bryan, the populist orator and chief political rival of McKinley; flamboyant newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst; self-appointed morality czar Anthony Comstock; steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie; and Carnegie s iron-fisted manager, Henry Clay Frick. At the center of this tableau is William McKinley, the president, and Leon Czolgosz, his assassin. McKinley rises to the presidency almost by accident, floating on the money and political clout of Mark Hanna. Sober and unimaginative, McKinley s personal life is marked by drama and tragedy, the unstable wife he loves, and enemies he cannot imagine chief among them, Leon Czolgosz, a lonely immigrant and factory worker who plots the most spectacular protest in an age of spectacular protests McKinley s assassination at the 1901 Buffalo World s Fair. Sweeping in scope, The Temple of Music is a rare literary achievement that intertwines history and fiction into an indelible tapestry of America at the dawn of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vO1EhuMVQrwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Gather in Christ: Our Identity as Assembly","description":"A look at what it means to gather as an assembly for worship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S98EfQwzf44C&dq=We+Gather+in+Christ:+Our+Identity+as+Assembly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can I Have a Stegosaurus, Mom?

Combining art, politics and design to visually stunning effect, Hargrave and his followers created a maverick but uniquely English form of modernism, one which harked back to a mythical past but also looked forward to a futuristic Utopia when mankind would be freed from the tyranny of work and war. A product of his turbulent times, Hargrave believed in ritual, ceremony, symbology and the 'resolute imagination' of the creative individual as the keys to a better world.The book draws on the extensive visual archive of the Kibbo Kift, held at the Museum of London, comprising graphic designs, photographs, ceremonial objects, banners, costume, regalia, log books and archive material, much of which has not been seen in public since the 1920s and 1930s. The collection includes many striking photographs by Angus McBean, official 'Kin Photographer' in the late 1920s. Designing Utopia also touches on Hargrave's career as a writer. In his novels, as with his graphics, Hargrave's imagination drew from the fragmented modern world of mass culture, advertising and film he saw around him and re-cast its elements in ways that suited his convictions about social order.Hargrave and the Kibbo Kift have been under-explored by cultural historians. But their time has come. The story of the Kibbo Kift has strong resonances with twenty-first century debates about art, politics, individualism, anti-capitalism, nature and the environment. It is also a story about English youth adapting to a new century, new ideologies and a new sense of possibilities in a global world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RCzisgEACAAJ&dq=DESIGNING+UTOPIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mole & the Baby Bird","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"West Point: Points West.

Dominating the glorious, raw beauty of the little island is the majestic Killakeet Lighthouse, which for generations has been the responsibility of one family, the Thurlows. However, Josh Thurlow, the Keeper's son, has forsworn his heritage to become the commander of the Maudie Jane, a small Coast Guard patrol boat operating off Killakeet.

Then his life is complicated by the arrival of the beautiful Dosie Crossan, who has journeyed to lonely Killakeet to escape the outside world and perhaps find a purpose in life.

One of the U-boats is captained by Otto Krebs, a famed and ruthless undersea warrior.

Word of the fracas spread, and soon enough Life magazine was on hand to tell the world, with sensational (albeit posed) pictures of the outlaws. And then the  Hollister riot  made its way into the movies, immortalized in Marlon Brando s  The Wild One.  What was the reality behind the myth? Through interviews with the surviving members of the Boozefighters, current member Bill Hayes and club historian Jim  JQ  Quattlebaum take readers right into the fray for a firsthand account of what happened in Hollister, and the formation of the Boozefighters, where the outlaw biker culture truly began.

In so doing, it serves as a resource to graduate students learning about career development and career counseling, counselors and psychologists providing career counseling to racial and ethnic minorities, and psychologists and counselors doing research on the career development of these diverse groups. In recognition of the value of both culture-specific and culture-general information about the vocational psychology of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, the book has a dual focus. The first eight chapters are devoted to culture-specific information about career development and vocational behavior. The final two chapters synthesize and integrate the materials presented in the eight culture-specific chapters. The text has been divided into three sections. The first section focuses on career theory and research with racial and ethnic minorities. It consists of a review of the relevance and utility of various career theories and models from mainstream vocational psychology to our understanding of the vocational behavior and career development of racial and ethnic minorities -- African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians. These chapters also summarize other theories from ethnic minority psychology that add to our understanding of minority career development. Finally, they review the existing empirical literature on the career development of these groups and provide a critique of this literature with recommendations for future research. The second section focuses on assessment and intervention with racial and ethnic minorities. The inclusion of the assessment dimension is very important because assessment is such a large and significant component of the career counseling process with these groups. The chapter authors offer guidelines and recommendations for providing career interventions with racial and ethnic minorities. In presenting these guidelines, they also address some of the cultural factors unique to each group that may serve either as facilitators or as inhibitors in the career counseling process. The third section includes commentaries, suggestions, reactions, and syntheses of the previous sections from scholars in the field of vocational psychology. These authors identify and examine the common principles, problems, and themes running across the chapters, and offer suggestions for advancing the field of racial and ethnic minority vocational psychology. This book will become both a valuable source of current information about the vocational psychology of racial and ethnic minorities as well as an inspiration for future research into the career development and vocational behavior of these culturally different individuals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bp0AAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coachella Valley, California: A Pictorial History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VrU7AAAACAAJ&dq=Coachella+Valley,+California:+A+Pictorial+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Years Later","description":"Shares the stories of six people who experienced traumatic events, from a woman who became a health advocate after losing 340 pounds to a hero who saved a burn victim on September 11th, only to discover that two family members had died in the tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nF-9AgAAQBAJ&dq=Ten+Years+Later&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History Of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Hostess Cookbook (#06798)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I1rMNAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hostess+Cookbook+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King of Paris","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Raised in America and having become familiar with Western Christians, Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as Western theological scholarship, both through his upbringing and his involvement in the modern Ecumenical Dialogues, he developed a critical and highly original Eastern Orthodox approach to Christian theology. He identified his approach with the Christian Roman ecumene that was centered in Constantinople, New Rome. His views on Christian Romanity and Roman Orthodoxy have earned him the title of Prophet of Roman Orthodoxy and have given rise to a school of committed followers and to much discussion. This book is Romanides' first Outline of Orthodox Patristic Dogmatics, which is published for the first time in the original Greek and in English translation. It represents a concise introduction into his understanding of the basic tenets of the Eastern Orthodox Faith and its fundamental differences from those of Western (Augustinian or Franco-Latin) Christian theology. It covers such doctrines as God's relation to the world, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the doctrine of Christ, the doctrine of the Church, the Church's Holy Tradition and the restoration and perfection of humanity in and through this Tradition. It will serve as an introduction into this theologian's original vision of Patristic Orthodoxy, which is the basis of his reappraisal of Christian theology and history. Its value lies in its concise, coherent and comprehensive character.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U50KAAAACAAJ&dq=An+Outline+of+Orthodox+Patristic+Dogmatics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Pacific","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Wailing Wind","description":"Officer Bernadette Manuelito found the dead man slumped over in the cab of a blue pickup abandoned in a dry gulch off a dirt road, with a rich ex-con's phone number in his pocket . . . and a tobacco tin nearby filled with tracer gold.

The distinctive roundel, colour-coded maps and Johnston typeface have become design classics, recognised and imitated worldwide. Opening in 1863, the first sections were operated by steam engines, yet throughout its long history the Tube has been at the forefront of contemporary design, pioneering building techniques, electrical trains and escalators, and business planning. Architects such as Leslie W. Green and Charles Holden developed a distinctively English version of Modernism, and the latest stations for the Jubilee line extension, Overground and Elizabeth line carry this aesthetic forward into the twenty-first century. In this major work published in association with Transport for London, Tube expert Oliver Green traces the history of the Underground, following its troubles and triumphs, its wartime and peacetime work, and the essential part it has played in shaping London s economy, geography, tourism and identity. Specially commissioned photography by Benjamin Graham (UK Landscape Photographer of the Year 2017) brings the story to life in vivid portraits of London Underground s stations, tunnels and trains.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FxytDwAAQBAJ&dq=Stories+from+the+Tube&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Arrow","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Taking Care of Moses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What Child is This?: Unveiling the Message of the Manger","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gold Shoe","description":"Of all things, a blizzard isn t what Tasha Endicott expected.

Johnson discharged the first shot through a hole in the wall of his log cabin. When the Mounties returned with reinforcements, Johnson was gone, and The Arctic Circle War had begun. On Johnson's heels were a corps of Mounties and an irregular posse on dogsled. Johnson, on snowshoes, seemed superhuman in his ability to evade capture.

This principle that we vaguely apply to our lives and our work is actually the key to Christian ethics, to influencing our culture for Christ, and to infusing our ordinary, everyday lives with the presence of God. For when we realize that the \\"mundane\\" activities that consume most of our time are \\"God's hiding places,\\" our perspective changes. Culture expert Gene Veith unpacks the biblical, Reformation teaching about the doctrine of vocation, emphasizing not what we should specifically do with our time or what careers we are called to, but what God does in and through our callings even within the home. In each task He has given us in our workplaces and families, our churches and society God Himself is at work. Veith guides you to discover God's purpose and calling in those seemingly ordinary areas by providing you with a spiritual framework for thinking about such issues and for acting upon them with a changed perspective.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sOVRgSZL6PYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fast Track One-Day Detox Diet","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sterling Silver Flatware for Dining Elegance: With Revised Price Guide (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1QDAAAACAAJ&dq=Sterling+Silver+Flatware+for+Dining+Elegance:+With+Revised+Price+Guide+(A+Schiffer+Book+for+Collectors)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sacred fire: The story of sex in religion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Classic Carret: Common sense from an uncommon man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Towards Zero","description":"Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard struggles to find the person who penned the details of a vicious murder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f6nZfXKX_VEC&dq=Towards+Zero&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Ronan's well (Waverley novels)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"From a college window","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nXIQAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goat in the Garden (Animal Ark Series #4)","description":"Houdini the goat gets in big trouble, and Mandy and James vow to save him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aM4bwsawrcUC&dq=Goat+in+the+Garden+(Animal+Ark+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandpa's Hammer","description":"After the death of his wife, a young girl's grandfather loses interest in life until he observes volunteers building a home for Habitat for Humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YkcsOwLxreQC&dq=Grandpa%27s+Hammer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burned (Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers, No. 6)","description":"When Frank and Joe Hardy must track down the mastermind behind an illegal international CD burning operation that employs teenagers, they begin with Julian Sanders, their classmate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3_AVQKYmfYAC&dq=Burned+(Hardy+Boys:+Undercover+Brothers,+No.+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moods of the Sea: Masterworks of Sea Poetry","description":"Poems by Milton, Keats, Longfellow, Melville, Hughes, Shelley, Byron, Whitman, and others, describe the characteristics, legends, and essence of the sea","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HiNaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Moods+of+the+Sea:+Masterworks+of+Sea+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counterprobe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ironies of War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Explosives Engineering","description":"This graduate text, and Cooper's companion introductory text ('Introduction to the Technology of Explosives'), serve the same markets as the successful explosives reference by Meyer, now in its 4th edition.

The original Ingmar Bergman influenced a generation of film scholars and cineastes after its publication in 1969 and remains one of the most important volumes on the director. This new edition of Ingmar Bergman, edited by film scholar Barry Keith Grant, contains all of Wood's original text plus four later pieces on the director by Wood that were intended for a new volume that was not completed before Wood's death in 2010. In analyzing a selection of Bergman's films, Wood makes a compelling case for the logic of the filmmaker's development while still respecting and indicating the distinctiveness of his individual films. Wood's emphasis on questions of value (What makes a work important? How does it address our lives?) informed his entire career and serve as the basis for many of these chapters. In the added material for this new edition, Wood considers three important films Bergman made after the book was first published-Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, and From the Life of the Marionettes-and also includes significant reassessment of Persona. These pieces provocatively suggest the more political directions Wood might have taken had he been able to produce Ingmar Bergman Revisited, as he had planned to do before his death. In its day, Ingmar Bergman was one of the most important volumes on the Swedish director published in English, and it remains compelling today despite the multitude of books to appear on the director since. Film scholars and fans of Bergman's work will enjoy this updated volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r0eRAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Definitive Guide to Shot Glasses","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQvRAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Definitive+Guide+to+Shot+Glasses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City Of Boys: Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Where Rivers Run","description":"ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TRAVELERS had crossed the Oregon Trail during the gold rush of 1849.

The RAF's first monoplane fighter, it dragged the Air Force into a position where it could defend Britain in her 'hour of need'. The true workhorse of the RAF, the Hurricane came into its own in the hot summer months of 1940 valiantly defending the skies above Britain. Outnumbering Spitfires three to one, the Hurricane also downed far more enemy aircraft. Without the obvious elegance of the Me 109 or the Spitfire, the Hurricane was nonetheless beloved by its pilots for its ability to simultaneously take a battering and inflict serious damage from its remarkably stable gun platform. This stunning new book reveals the Hurricane in all its glory  from fascinating first-hand accounts from the men who flew her to the truly breathtaking images from John Dibbs of the Hurricanes still in flight today.

Jacqueline Kennedy's selection of Oleg Cassini to design her personal wardrobe as First Lady was one of those moments, not only in fashion history, but political history as well. As creator of the \\"Jackie look,\\" Cassini made the First Lady one of the best-dressed women in the world and a glamourous icon of the Kennedy era. During the thousand days of the Kennedy administration, Cassini designed over 300 outfits for Jackie Kennedy--coats, dresses, evening gowns, suits, and day wear. He coordinated every aspect of her wardrobe, from shoes and hats to gloves and handbags. For the first time, Oleg Cassini offers a fascinating and comprehensive view of his role as Jackie's personal couturier. His international background allowed him to fit comfortably into the Kennedy poltical dynasty, and offered him unprecedented access to both Jackie and John Kennedy as a designer and a trusted friend. From the details of his long-standing friendship with the Kennedy family to his first meetings with the First lady to his thoughts on Jackie's clothes and their legacy, Cassini's recollections are far-ranging and informative. Cassini's original sketches are accompanied by 200 color and black-and-white photographs of the First Lady as she tours India, France, England, and Italy, shows off the White House, and hosts state dinners and family gatherings. Public moments as well as private ones capture the great elegance and charm of one of the most admired and emulated women in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Am9qHZ8th8C&dq=A+Thousand+Days+of+Magic:+Dressing+Jacqueline+Kennedy+for+the+White+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embedded Controller Hardware Design (Embedded Technology Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Movies' VIDEOSCOPE: The Ultimate Guide to the Latest, Greatest, and Weirdest Genre Videos","description":"Hailed by Entertainment Weekly as \\"the best movie critic in America,\\" Joe Kane, The Phantom of the Movies?, has been a noted genre-film authority for many years.

In his thorough analysis of today's investment landscape, former Treasury Department official Michael T. Jacobs shows that this \\"effective owner\\" approach takes the guesswork out of investing and reinvents the relationship between corporations and shareholders. In contrast, the current Wall Street Rule - to sell stock whenever its performance displeases you - actually undermines your returns.\\" \\"Most investors speculate on stock prices, either buying and selling or paying mutual funds to buy and sell. Such shuffling produces dismal results compared to the overall market; each year three out of four money managers return less than the market average. The real beneficiaries of the Wall Street Rule are the investment industry and company executives who don't want to answer to owners. Jacobs shows that simply by investing for long-term growth, you can beat 95 percent of mutual funds. Even better, in the last decade companies with large effective-owner shareholders earned triple the market average.\\" \\"With Break the Wall Street Rule investors of any size can become effective owners. In clear language Jacobs explains how small shareholders can utilize the power of institutional investors. There are guidelines for choosing companies structured for the benefit of their shareholders, not to insulate their executives from shareholders. Other chapters describe how to assemble a portfolio and how to calculate whether a stock has paid you back enough.\\" \\"Many books explain when to buy stocks or which stocks to buy. Break the Wall Street Rule shows how real gains come from what you do once you own a stock. You can use the power of new SEC proxy rules to maximize your returns. You can ensure that management works for shareholders by supporting directors and resolutions that protect your interests, such as connecting pay to performance. Owning only $1000 of stock lets you propose your own shareholder resolutions; Jacobs illuminates the rules and realities of this process. As shown at Sears and GM, shareholders and boards can affect how major corporations are run. In sum, the effective owner philosophy of Break the Wall Street Rule will revolutionize the way you look at stock-market investing.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

This edition is based on the first English book edition for the stories and the first American edition for the  Author s Note  for The Shadow-Line,  Typhoon,  and  The Secret Sharer.

To help readers navigate, the editor includes a glossary of nautical terms as well as diagrams of the kinds of ships that appear in the stories.

Who loves us? And why? Is love really a mystery, or can neuroscience offer some answers to these age-old questions? In her third enthralling book about the brain, Judith Horstman takes us on a lively tour of our most important sex and love organ and the whole smorgasbord of our many kinds of love-from the bonding of parent and child to the passion of erotic love, the affectionate love of companionship, the role of animals in our lives, and the love of God. Drawing on the latest neuroscience, she explores why and how we are born to love-how we're hardwired to crave the companionship of others, and how very badly things can go without love. Among the findings: parental love makes our brain bigger, sex and orgasm make it healthier, social isolation makes it miserable-and although the craving for romantic love can be described as an addiction, friendship may actually be the most important loving relationship of your life. Based on recent studies and articles culled from the prestigious Scientific American and Scientific American Mind magazines, The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain offers a fascinating look at how the brain controls our loving relationships, most intimate moments, and our deep and basic need for connection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5QnkhRsHoQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carl Sandburg","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scrying For Beginners (Llewellyn's Beginners Series)","description":"Explains how to \\"see\\" with the mind's eye using scrying, teaches different techniques using water, crystals, mirrors, and oil, and exposes the scrying secrets of Nostradamus and Dr. John Dee","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BStz86-MZo4C&dq=Scrying+For+Beginners+(Llewellyn%27s+Beginners+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Court of Public Opinion.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yjm46JSQxm0C&dq=In+the+Court+of+Public+Opinion.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of \\"Mr. Circus\\",","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2C9_MAEACAAJ&dq=The+story+of+%22Mr.+Circus%22,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Differential Geometry, Gauge Theories, and Gravity (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics)","description":"Emphasizing the applications of differential geometry to gauge theories in particle physics and general relativity, this work will be of special interest for researchers in applied mathematics or theoretical physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lr8zo2caBWYC&dq=Differential+Geometry,+Gauge+Theories,+and+Gravity+(Cambridge+Monographs+on+Mathematical+Physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The needle's eye: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Plautus: The Merchant.

The answers given to Hennessy's astute, perfectly tailored questions remind a reader how exciting poetry can be, and how writers create, through language, the world as we have never known it. These adventuresome interviews will stir anyone who cares about the making of art.\\" ---Bernard Cooper, author of Maps to Anywhere Editor Christopher Hennessy gathers interviews with some of the most significant figures in contemporary American poetry. While each poet is gay, these encompassing, craft-centered interviews reflect the diversity of their respective arts and serve as a testament to the impact gay poets have had and will continue to have on contemporary poetics. The book includes twelve frank, intense interviews with some of America's best-known and loved poets, who have not only enjoyed wide critical acclaim but who have had lasting impact on both the gay tradition and the contemporary canon writ large, for example, Frank Bidart, the late Thom Gunn, and J. D. McClatchy. Some of the most honored and respected poets, still in the middle of their careers, are also included, for example, Mark Doty, Carl Phillips, and Reginald Shepherd. Each interview explores the poet's complete work to date, often illuminating the poet's technical evolution and emotional growth, probing shifts in theme, and even investigating links between verse and sexuality. In addition to a selected bibliography of works by established poets, the book also includes a list of works by newer and emerging poets who are well on their way to becoming important voices of the new millennium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=spVFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The metropolis of tomorrow,","description":"The metropolis of the future   as perceived by architect Hugh Ferriss in 1929   was both generous and prophetic in vision.

Traveling into space and even emigrating to nearby worlds may soon become part of the human experience. Scientists, engineers, and investors are working hard to make space tourism and colonization a reality. As astronauts can attest, extraterrestrial travel is incomparably thrilling. To make the most of the experience requires serious physical and mental adaptations in virtually every aspect of life, from eating to intimacy. Everyone who goes into space sees Earth and life on it from a profoundly different perspective than they had before liftoff. Astronomer and former NASA/ASEE scientist Neil F. Comins has written the go-to book for anyone interested in space exploration. He describes the wonders that travelers will encounter weightlessness, unparalleled views of Earth and the cosmos, and the opportunity to walk on another world as well as the dangers: radiation, projectiles, unbreathable atmospheres, and potential equipment failures. He also provides insights into specific trips to destinations including suborbital flights, space stations, the Moon, asteroids, comets, and Mars the top candidate for colonization. Although many challenges are technical, Comins outlines them in clear language for all readers. He synthesizes key issues and cutting-edge research in astronomy, physics, biology, psychology, and sociology to create a complete manual for the ultimate voyage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sXAfDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thin Tear In The Fabric Of Space (Iowa Short Fiction Award)","description":"The Thin Tear in the Fabric of Space gathers stories about coping with grief, trying to love people who have died, and more broadly leaving old versions of the self behind, sometimes by choice and sometimes out of necessity. In each of the nine stories, Douglas Trevor s characters are forced to face uncomfortable realities. For Elena Gavrushnekov in the title story, that means admitting after the death of her beloved that she still longs for contact with other human bodies. For Peter in  Central Square,  it is realizing that, like his deceased father before him, he is drinking himself to death. Unable to confront his incapacitated mother and the memory of the plane crash that killed his father, Edwin Morris in  Saint Francis in Flint  is compelled to acknowledge that his saintly aspirations are not what they appear to be, while Sharon Mackaney in  The Surprising Weight of the Body's Organs  struggles with uncontrollable outbursts of rage in the wake of her young son s death. In moments of great pain and loss, when self-expression seems impossible and terribly useless, the characters in these stories nonetheless discover the tenderness of others. In  The River,  the narrator finds that the friendship he has forged with a French girl with whom he can only just communicate has bred intense, almost intuitive compassion, while in  Fellowship of the Bereaved,  the disconsolate brother of the deceased sister who occupies the empty center of the story uncovers not only anger in his parents but also empathy and humor. As these characters persevere in their own lives, they do so mindful of, and humanized by, the experiences of having seen people they know and love slip unexpectedly into the thin tear in the fabric of space: that quiet chasm that so resolutely separates the living from the dead.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vAJqep7xKkcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Onions and their allies: Botany, cultivation, and utilization, (World crops books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nds for Nt","description":"\\"NDS for NT\\" allows system administrators to run Novell Directory Services on mixed Microsoft NT and Novell IntranetWare networks.

Lebanon's current challenge is also the challenge of a whole region, the Middle East, where the fate of minorities, including Eastern Christians, reveals the prospects of democracy, pluralism and political participation. Carole H. Dagher, a journalist for Lebanese media as well as an academic, presents an insightful account on how Christian and Muslim communities emerged from the sixteen year-old Lebanese war, what their points of friction and their common grounds are, and what the prospects of Lebanon's communal representation system and pluralistic society are. She describes the central role played by the Holy See and John Paul II in bridging the gap between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon, and analyzes the impact other countries such as Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia have had on the power game and, conversely, the impact of Christian-Muslim interaction on the future of the Arab-Israeli peace process.

In 1908 Montgomery produced her first full-length novel, titled 'Anne of Green Gables'.

This preoccupation has left its mark on the law. The twentieth century saw the creation of laws that protect your right to control your public image, to defend your image, and to feel good about your image and public presentation of self. These include the legal actions against invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. With these laws came the phenomenon of \\"personal image litigation\\" individuals suing to vindicate their image rights. Laws of Image tells the story of how Americans came to use the law to protect and manage their images, feelings, and reputations. In this social, cultural, and legal history, Samantha Barbas ties the development of personal image law to the self-consciousness and image-consciousness that has become endemic in our media-saturated culture of celebrity and consumerism, where people see their identities as intertwined with their public images. The laws of image are the expression of a people who have become so publicity-conscious and self-focused that they believe they have a right to control their images to manage and spin them like actors, politicians, and rock stars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jHJqCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sillwee Wobbert and Wheezing Will in the Big Game","description":"Second book in Sillwee Wobbert Picture Book series on health issues.

Having a great idea isn't enough to launch a multi-million-dollar business. Let's face it, investors don't put money in ideas. They need concrete evidence that they'll get return on their investment, and a good business plan gives them such information. Do you have a hard time figuring out how to get a business plan down on paper? Are you tired and confused by all the business jargon, just wanting a straightforward how-to guide outlining exactly what you need to do? Business plans are the heart and soul of a successful company - they give you focus and operational clarity that can kick major mistakes to the curb. No matter how good your business idea is, you will need a plan to create a solid foundation before going on the market or trying to get investors on board. Did you know that even science says you need a business plan to make your startup a success? One study found out that companies with a business plan grow 30% faster than competitors! In addition, startups with a business plan achieve more sustainable success in the long run. So, what's the secret to writing a business plan like a seasoned pro or a Fortune 500 company CEO?

This is a very important and well written work which sheds light not only on A. B.

This is a historical treasure.\\"\\" --Vinson Synan, Dean Emeritus Regent University School of Divinity \\"\\"Simpson has long deserved an in-depth study. A pivotal turn-of-the-century figure who never found full acceptance in any wing of American evangelicalism, this prolific Canadian nonetheless profoundly influenced popular evangelicalism and Anglo-American Pentecostalism. Nienkirchen makes careful use of long-unused primary sources to illuminate Simpson's relationship to early Pentecostalism. The result is a suggestive work that offers perceptive insights into early Pentecostalism and the context from which it emerged.\\"\\" -- Edith L. Blumhofer Project Director Institute for the Study of American Evangelicalism, Wheaton \\"\\"Nienkirchen provides a splendid study of the relationship of A. B. Simpson to Pentecostalism. This book demonstrates wide knowledge of primary materials and great care in documentation (with about one-third of the text devoted to footnote material). Nienkirchen clearly delineates the major elements in Simpson's religious thought and gives attention to the most significant ways in which his thought changed. His major interest in this book focuses on the ways in which Simpson influenced the formation of early Pentecostalism. Pentecostals accept some elements of Simpson's teaching and rejected or modified others, but Nienkirchen argues persuasively the case for Simpson's importance in understanding Pentecostalism; moreover, he clearly illustrates specific ways -- both direct and indirect -- in which that influence was felt in the complex story of early holiness-pentecostal relationships.\\"\\" -- William Pitts Professor of Church History Baylor University \\"\\"Charles Nienkirchen has supplied those interested in the history and theology of American Evangelicalism, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, or the Pentecostal movement with an invaluable reference tool and an interpretive lens through which to understand them.

Since then, gay and lesbian detective fiction has been one of the fastest growing segments of the genre. It incorporates gay and lesbian cultural elements and offers crossover appeal. Its authors call upon a century of development in the mystery genre, while providing new, more accurate images of lesbians and gay men than generally found in mainstream literature and popular media. This groundbreaking study of gay and lesbian detective fiction examines mystery series and historically significant stand-alone novels published since the early 1960s. Part I is an overview that describes how these novels make gay and lesbian life visible and forge new, powerful images. It also examines how they fit into the larger history of mystery fiction. The series analyses in Part II are grouped according to the type of main character (police officer, private investigator, amateur sleuth, etc.). Each section discusses main and secondary characters of that type, characteristic themes for the group, and more. The analyses of individual series cover main characters, themes, plot points and other elements. Comments from authors interviewed for this book play a central role in those analyses. Part III lists series-spanning themes (e.g., homophobia, the closet, gay marriage) and the novels and series that address each of those themes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kb7ABgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Puppy to Dog (How Living Things Grow)","description":"Describes the characteristics, life cycle, diet, and behavior of dogs, using a golden retriever as an example.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpj8sBTAu8C&dq=From+Puppy+to+Dog+(How+Living+Things+Grow)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Climax at Midway","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A scrap book printed and bound,: In which various subjects are discussed, in poetry and prose, by different persons at different times and under ... \\"from grave to gay, from lively to severe.\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-SyzGwAACAAJ&dq=A+scrap+book+printed+and+bound,:+In+which+various+subjects+are+discussed,+in+poetry+and+prose,+by+different+persons+at+different+times+and+under+...+%22from+grave+to+gay,+from+lively+to+severe.%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ftce English Middle School","description":"Unlike other test preparation material, our FTCE Middle Grades English teacher certification study guide drills all the way down to the focus statement level, providing detailed examples of the range, type, and level of content that appear on the test.

Quiet streets, breathtaking mountains, and one of the lowest crime rates in America. But that's about to change. Real estate speculator Max Shapiro has been cleaning the San Francisco mob's money for three decades. Then the hammer drops-- he's dying of cancer and is on borrowed time. Resentful of the mob's hold and not wishing to die with an IV hose in his arm, Max tells the mob he isn't paying any more tribute, hoping they'll send someone to kill him. While vacationing in Aspen, however, Max gets a call from his doctor. Good news. Max isn't dying after all. But it's too late to call off the mob's killers. Max's only hope is the enigmatic Cole Springer-- an ex-Secret Service agent with a penchant for creative thinking-- broke and in danger of losing his Aspen nightclub. Shapiro needs a bodyguard and Springer needs money, so they cut a protection deal. Enter Gerry \\"Knucks\\" Nugent, a cerebral and deadly hit man in the midst of a midlife crisis who has been sent to kill Shapiro. A mob boss dies in 'Frisco, there is a struggle for power, and an emergency cache of three million dollars ends up in the hands of Nicky Tortino, a merciless Bay Area crime lord. The shift in the underworld command sends shock waves rippling across the western United States, affecting even Shapiro and Nugent. Meanwhile, Springer's active mind runs to larger themes than merely protecting Shapiro, and he begins to formulate a scheme to save Shapiro and get his hands on the three million. Springer's scam depends upon recruiting Nugent, and Nugent is widely feared-- even by his ruthless bosses on the West Coast. Bay Area underboss Nicky Tortino travels to Aspen to get Shapiro to launder the three million, and also to have both Springer and Shapiro killed. The law closes in and Springer is running out of time and options.

Drawing inspiration from the history of Myal, Kumina, Revivalism, and Rastafari, Hodges develops a critical language for the discussion of a wide range of Jamaican texts, both oral and written. Beginning with traditional proverbs and Anancy stories, Soon Come explores healing rituals, possession rites, and miracles in Revival hymns; the seminal poetry of Claude McKay, Una Marson, and Louise Bennett; the Rastafari-influenced reggae of Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Bunny Wailer, and Ras Michael; the dub poetry of Linton Kwesi Johnson and Mutabaruka; and the groundbreaking work of Dennis Scott, Anthony McNeill, and Lorna Goodison. What emerges is a profoundly hopeful vision of Jamaican poetry as an ongoing ritual that engenders the future even as it reimagines the past. Written in a lively, accessible style, Soon Come will appeal as much to the general reader as to the academic, to the serious Bob Marley fan as much as to the student of New World religious traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sB5F7ek7hHEC&dq=Soon+Come&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attic","description":"Attic follows a young woman named Kay who has joined a cult-like organization that sells magazine subscriptions in small towns.

Or more invigorating on a crisp, cool afternoon in autumn than a picnic in the country with sharp English cheeses; crusty white peasant bread; vegetable, cheese, and apple tarts; and Thermoses of steaming warm tea? Or a better way to celebrate the ripe berries of summer than a dessert party tea in the garden with lemon-curd tartlets, raspberry shortcake, raspberry sorbet, sugar cookies, and tea served in flowered china cups? A cookbook and style book, Having Tea includes a range of stunning locations with recipes, menus, table settings, and serving ideas for tea. There are formal and elegant teas that ring in the winter holidays with rich dark fruitcake, shortbread, brandy snaps, and sherried English trifle; a tea for one in the study with spicy ginger Bundt cake and a plate of cookies; and tea for two in a loft, with slow-scrambled eggs, cornmeal muffins and apple butter, and panfried tomatoes sprinkled with fresh tarragon. Each menu provides suggestions for the ideal tea to suit the meal. Since the American style of tea drinking originated in England, Having Tea goes to the source to show two classic English tea rooms, tea at the Savoy Hotel in London, and a tea dance at London's Waldorf. In addition, there are special sections on the history and different varieties of teas, selections of teapots and tea services, and directions for brewing the perfect pot of tea. A final section, the \\"Tea Larder,\\" offers ideas for tea trimmings from honey to mint or ginger, tea sandwiches, and a directory of mail-order sources for tea. With approximately fifty recipes for tea sandwiches, crumpets, scones, cookies, and cakes as well as hearty tea-time meals, Having Tea will make you want to make having tea part of your day.

In this dazzlingly written, acutely nuanced account, Andrew Wheatcroft tracks a deep fault line of animosity between civilizations. He begins with a stunning account of the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, then turns to the main zones of conflict: Spain, from which the descendants of the Moors were eventually expelled; the Middle East, where Crusaders and Muslims clashed for years; and the Balkans, where distant memories spurred atrocities even into the twentieth century. Throughout, Wheatcroft delves beneath stereotypes, looking incisively at how images, ideas, language, and technology (from the printing press to the Internet), as well as politics, religion, and conquest, have allowed each side to demonize the other, revive old grievances, and fuel across centuries a seemingly unquenchable enmity. Finally, Wheatcroft tells how this fraught history led to our present maelstrom. We cannot, he argues, come to terms with today s perplexing animosities without confronting this dark past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SD_Cyz-XW3sC&dq=The+Infidels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saturday Night.

I remember the day I realized I couldn t play a white guy as well as a white guy. It felt like a death sentence for my career.  When Chad Sanders landed his first job in lily-white Silicon Valley, he quickly concluded that to be successful at work meant playing a certain social game. Each meeting was drenched in white slang and the privileged talk of international travel or folk concerts in San Francisco, which led Chad to believe he needed to emulate whiteness to be successful. So Chad changed. He changed his wardrobe, his behavior, his speech everything that connected him with his Black identity. And while he finally felt included, he felt awful. So he decided to give up the charade. He reverted to the methods he learned at the dinner table, or at the Black Baptist church where he d been raised, or at the concrete basketball courts, barbershops, and summertime cookouts. And it paid off. Chad began to land more exciting projects. He earned the respect of his colleagues. Accounting for this turnaround, Chad believes, was something he calls Black Magic, namely resilience, creativity, and confidence forged in his experience navigating America as a Black man. Black Magic has emboldened his every step since, leading him to wonder: Was he alone in this discovery? Were there others who felt the same? In  pulverizing, educational, and inspirational  (Shea Serrano, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Basketball (And Other Things)) essays, Chad dives into his formative experiences to see if they might offer the possibility of discovering or honing this skill. He tests his theory by interviewing Black leaders across industries to get their take on Black Magic. The result is a revelatory and essential book. Black Magic explores Black experiences in predominantly white environments and demonstrates the risks of self-betrayal and the value of being yourself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_7FYEAAAQBAJ&dq=Black%27s+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Breastfeeding Cafe: Mothers Share the Joys, Challenges, and Secrets of Nursing","description":"Chemistry for CSEC is written by experienced science teachers and authors for students studying for the CSEC general proficiency exam.

Wall Street Journal The New York Times bestselling author of The Rational Optimist and Genome returns with a fascinating argument for evolution that definitively dispels a dangerous, widespread myth: that we can command and control our world Human society evolves. Change in technology, language, morality, and society is incremental, inexorable, gradual, and spontaneous. It follows a narrative, going from one stage to the next, and it largely happens by trial and error a version of natural selection. Much of the human world is the result of human action but not of human design: it emerges from the interactions of millions, not from the plans of a few. Drawing on fascinating evidence from science, economics, history, politics, and philosophy, Matt Ridley demolishes conventional assumptions that the great events and trends of our day are dictated by those on high. On the contrary, our most important achievements develop from the bottom up. The Industrial Revolution, cell phones, the rise of Asia, and the Internet were never planned; they happened. Languages emerged and evolved by a form of natural selection, as did common law. Torture, racism, slavery, and pedophilia all once widely regarded as acceptable are now seen as immoral despite the decline of religion in recent decades. In this wide-ranging, erudite book, Ridley brilliantly makes the case for evolution, rather than design, as the force that has shaped much of our culture, our technology, our minds, and that even now is shaping our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TFzVBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marnie","description":"Marnie, a compulsive thief and liar is caught.

Ambrose. Indeed, his entire adult life was devoted to the single-minded pursuit of a military career. Upton was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Fifth United States Artillery on May 6, 1861, the day of his graduation from the United States Military Academy, and by age twenty-five he had risen to the rank of major general. He distinguished himself in battles at Spotsylvania, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, and Charlottesville, in Sheridan s Shenandoah Valley campaign, and in Wilson s celebrated cavalry raid through Alabama and Georgia at the end of the war. After the war, Upton traveled abroad as an observer for the army, an experience that resulted in his first book, The Armies of Asia and Europe. He also served as commandant of cadets at West Point and finally as commander of the Presidio in San Francisco. He was highly respected as a military tactician, and his Infantry Tactics became a widely used resource. Despite his successes, the ambitious Upton felt that his military talents were insufficiently recognized. His last book, The Military Policy of the United States, which advocated a number of sweeping changes in the organization of the American military system, went unpublished at his death by suicide in 1881. The book was finally published in 1904 at the urging of Elihu Root, Theodore Roosevelt s secretary of war. First published in 1964, Ambrose s thorough and well-researched study of Emory Upton s career has proven to be an important addition to American military history as well as to the history of the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=613DaOFZaNwC&dq=Upton+and+the+Army&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Evaluate Business Opportunities","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"21st Century Complete Medical Guide to Thyroid Cancer - Authoritative Government Documents and Clinical References for Patients and Physicians with ... on Diagnosis and Treatment Options","description":"Getting the right diagnosis is a key aspect of health care - it provides an explanation of a patient's health problem and informs subsequent health care decisions. The diagnostic process is a complex, collaborative activity that involves clinical reasoning and information gathering to determine a patient's health problem. According to Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, diagnostic errors-inaccurate or delayed diagnoses-persist throughout all settings of care and continue to harm an unacceptable number of patients. It is likely that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences. Diagnostic errors may cause harm to patients by preventing or delaying appropriate treatment, providing unnecessary or harmful treatment, or resulting in psychological or financial repercussions. The committee concluded that improving the diagnostic process is not only possible, but also represents a moral, professional, and public health imperative. Improving Diagnosis in Health Care a continuation of the landmark Institute of Medicine reports To Err Is Human (2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm (2001) finds that diagnosis-and, in particular, the occurrence of diagnostic errorsa\\"has been largely unappreciated in efforts to improve the quality and safety of health care. Without a dedicated focus on improving diagnosis, diagnostic errors will likely worsen as the delivery of health care and the diagnostic process continue to increase in complexity. Just as the diagnostic process is a collaborative activity, improving diagnosis will require collaboration and a widespread commitment to change among health care professionals, health care organizations, patients and their families, researchers, and policy makers. The recommendations of Improving Diagnosis in Health Care contribute to the growing momentum for change in this crucial area of health care quality and safety.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-fphCwAAQBAJ&dq=21st+Century+Complete+Medical+Guide+to+Thyroid+Cancer+-+Authoritative+Government+Documents+and+Clinical+References+for+Patients+and+Physicians+with+...+on+Diagnosis+and+Treatment+Options&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladies whose bright eyes: A romance","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Along the Inca Road : A Woman's Journey into an Ancient Empire","description":"A woman's journey and her experiences down the Inca Road from Ecuador to Chile provides insight into the sights, sounds, people, and customs of South America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i0h7AAAAMAAJ&dq=Along+the+Inca+Road+:+A+Woman%27s+Journey+into+an+Ancient+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tropical Spa","description":"A catalog of Asia's most luxurious spas and spa treatments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A197SwYvPzYC&dq=The+Tropical+Spa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn","description":"An illustrated edition of the Newberry Medalwinning Caddie Woodlawn, which has been captivating young readers since 1935.

Donaldson shows that the Southern Agrarians might have ultimately failed in their efforts to revive the South they saw as traditional, stable, and unified, but they nonetheless sparked debates and quarrels about history, literature, race, gender, and regional identity that are still being waged today over Confederate flags, monuments, slavery, and public memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HLxN4lXpgEUC&dq=I%27ll+Take+My+Stand:+The+South+and+the+Agrarian+Tradition+(Library+of+Southern+Civilization)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reaching the Top : Secrets of Closing the Sale, Top Performance : Using the Art of Persuasion to Develop Excellence in Yourself and Others","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lucifer's Flood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ciao!

We think of these events as disasters, but for Earth they are merely business as usual. This dramatically illustrated book describes some of the more than 3,000 active volcanoes scattered around the planet, and chronicles many of history's most devastating volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tidal waves. The author explains that volcanoes and earthquakes both result from movement of the Earth's vast tectonic plates, and are most likely to occur at or near places where two or more plates come together. Such movement has been going on since the Earth's origins, creating mountain ranges and dividing the landmass into separate continents. Described in these pages are volcanic blasts from the past: Vesuvius, Italy in 79 A.D. ... Laki, Iceland in 1783 ... Tambora, Indonesia in 1815 ... Krakatoa, Indonesia in 1883 ... Mount St. Helens, Washington State in 1980 ... Pinatubo, the Philippines in 1991, and others. Also chronicled are earthquakes that have struck large population centers, producing disasters in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1755, San Francisco in 1906, Tokyo-Yokohama, Japan, in 1923, and Kobe, Japan, in 1995. The Earth's major trouble spots and likely targets for future earthquakes are described. Urban areas in greatest danger continue to be those along the Pacific Rim, which encompasses North America's West Coast and most of Japan's cities. Here is an intensely readable summary of natural disasters that have struck the earth, along with informed speculation on how and when similar events will recur in the future. More than 200 color illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=opANetC51r4C&dq=Raging+Planet:+Earthquakes,+Volcanoes,+and+the+Tectonic+Threat+to+Life+on+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quack Board Book","description":"Follows five little ducklings as they flip their wings, wobble their tails, follow their mother in a dash, find a puddle, and splash!

Sandy Haney would say yes for several reasons. Sand crabs spend much of their time near the shore, where the crashing waves are relentless. While sand crabs only move backward, they keep looking forward. And finally, sand crabs burrow into the sand to prevent being washed away by powerful waves but hold on to the shore until the end. Sandy Haney's Sand Crab Sentiments is a collection of inspirational poetry that will encourage even the weariest Christian to keep looking forward and endure to the end. Sandy's passion for the Lord and his Word is evident in her poems about life, death, love, happiness, and everything in between. She has been used as God's pen to bring hope to the hopeless and strength to the weak. Sand Crab Sentiments includes uplifting poems for any situation you may find yourself in, whether delightful or dismal, droll or deep. Immerse yourself in these Sand Crab Sentiments, and you'll soon realize that this crustacean's perspective is one to emulate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zOJcjJp9e0C&dq=The+Sand+Crabs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewel - 0304","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The informer (Superior reprint)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sea Fury, Firefly & Sea Venom (Australian airpower collection series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-IdNAgAAQBAJ&dq=Sea+Fury,+Firefly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The faith and practice of the Quakers, (The faiths: varieties of Christian expression)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Okinawan Karate: Teachers, Styles and Secret Techniques (Martial Arts)","description":"Progression is a positive trait, as long as one keeps in touch with the past and has a staple backdrop to focus or fall back on.

In the vast, almost empty battlefield of the Pacific the US Navy and Marine Corps were obliged to develop every aspect of the amphibious assault landing in painstaking detail, from the design of many new types of vessel, down to the tactics of the rifle platoon hitting the beach, and the logistic system without which they could not have fought their way inland.

Why do so many information systems projects collapse? How can we do better? There are many technical, social, economic and other aspects to consider. How do we ensure we take all these into account as we research ITC or employ them? ICT affects our lives and world more profoundly than ever before. How may we understand it? This book employs philosophy to lay foundations for understanding the complexity of ICT, in five areas: The nature of information and computers, and artificial intelligence; The use of ICT at work and home, for serious and less-serious use; The ICT features that annoy or delight us; Societal issues, such as surveillance, e-government, ICT in developing countries, climate change, what technological progress is and what is the role of ICT as a whole and of the information systems field; ICT development - including computer programming, knowledge engineering and project management. The ideas in this book emerge from five decades of experience of the author with ICT, across industry, the professions and academic life. Information systems researchers will enjoy this book because it offers them new ideas and fresh perspectives. On the 500th anniversary of the European Reformation, this book introduces and applies the Reformational Philosophy of mid-20th-century Dutch thinker, Herman Dooyeweerd, to contemporary challenges of the 21st century. Excitingly, this accessible philosophy is grounded in everyday experience and yields a rich seedbed of ideas, which researchers and practitioners can develop to their advantage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tS1FzAEACAAJ&dq=Foundations+of+Information+Systems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mickey Mouse and goofy the big bear scare","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ji71ygAACAAJ&dq=Mickey+Mouse+and+goofy+the+big+bear+scare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watch Your Language; A Lively, Informal Guide to Better Writing, Emanating from the News Room of the New York Times","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An American rhetoric","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIDBQgAACAAJ&dq=An+American+rhetoric&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Eye","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910-1917","description":"This book represents an attempt to comprehend and recreate the political and diplomatic history of the United States from the beginning of the disruption of the Republican party in 1910 to the entrance of the United States into the First World War in 1917.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dyl3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Woodrow+Wilson+and+the+Progressive+Era,+1910-1917&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rostnikov's Vacation (An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Novel)","description":"When Soviet authorities force Inspector Rostnikov to take a vacation in Yalta so that they can plan his demotion, Rostnikov and his two associates, Karpo and Tkach, save his job, in addition to solving a robbery, a kidnapping, and a murder","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z6UiEBiMlPsC&dq=Rostnikov%27s+Vacation+(An+Inspector+Porfiry+Rostnikov+Novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FIRM LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fighting force 64: Prima's official strategy guide","description":"Complete move lists for each hero Step-by-step walkthroughs Blow-by-blow strategies for defeating your enemies Cheat codes and exit locations revealed!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3e3ROwAACAAJ&dq=Fighting+force+64:+Prima%27s+official+strategy+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructive Combinatorics (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sewn Mini Travelers, Faux Old Leather, Embossed, Mini, Lined","description":"176 lined pages. 5\\" wide x 7\\" high (12.7 cm wide x 17.8 cm high).

Elaborating on  A Call for Vatican III  from his New York Timesbestseller Constantine s Sword: The Church and the Jews, James Carroll proposes a clear agenda for reform, to help committed but concerned Catholics understand the most essential issues facing their Church. He moves beyond current events to suggest new ways for Catholics to approach Scripture, Jesus, and power, and he looks at the daunting challenges facing the Church in a world of diverse beliefs and contentious religious fervor. His thought-provoking case for democracy within the Church illustrates why lay people have already initiated change. Carroll shows that all Catholics parishioners, priests, bishops, men and women have an equal stake in ensuring the Church s future.  The boisterous collapse of trust in the Catholic hierarchy during the pedophile scandals makes it not only important but imperative to heed this eloquent call for a new Ecumenical (this time truly ecumenical) Council.

This literary memoir takes readers from her childhood in India where depression is thought to be a curse to life in America where she eventually finds the light within by drawing on both her rich Hindu heritage and Western medicine to spare. As a young girl in Bangalore, Gayathri was surrounded by the fragrance of jasmine and flickering oil lamps, her family protected by Hindu gods and goddesses. But as she grew older, demons came forth from the dark corners of her idyllic kingdom--with the scariest creatures lurking within her.The daughter of a respected Brahmin family, Gayathri began to feel different. \\"I can hardly eat, sleep, or think straight. The only thing I can do is cry unending tears.\\" Her parents insisted it was all in her head. Because traditional Indian culture had no concept of depression as an illness, no doctor could diagnose and no medicine could heal her mysterious malady.This memoir traces Gayathri's courageous battle with the depression that consumed her from adolescence through marriage and a move to the United States. It was only after the birth of her first child, when her husband discovered her in the backyard \\"clawing the earth furiously with my bare hands, intent on digging a grave so that I could bury myself alive,\\" that she finally found help. After a stay in a psych ward she eventually found \\"the light within,\\" an emotional and spiritual awakening from the darkness of her tortured mind.Gayathri's inspiring story provides a first-of-its-kind cross-cultural view of mental illness--how it is regarded in India and in America, and how she drew on both her rich Hindu heritage and Western medicine to find healing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qlvXDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Young Sherlock Holmes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Magnesium Solution for Migraine Headaches","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sillwee Wobbert: Diabetes and Jose at School and Play","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Modern Spectrum Analysis of Time Series: Fast Algorithms and Error Control Techniques","description":"Spectrum analysis can be considered as a topic in statistics as well as a topic in digital signal processing (DSP). This book takes a middle course by emphasizing the time series models and their impact on spectrum analysis. The text begins with elements of probability theory and goes on to introduce the theory of stationary stochastic processes. The depth of coverage is extensive. Many topics of concern to spectral characterization of Gaussian and non-Gaussian time series, scalar and vector time series are covered. A section is devoted to the emerging areas of non-stationary and cyclostationary time series. The book is organized more as a textbook than a reference book. Each chapter includes many examples to illustrate the concepts described. Several exercises are included at the end of each chapter.

During the 1980s, religious traditions around the world, from Islamic fundamentalism to Catholic liberation theology, began making their way, often forcefully, out of the private sphere and into public life, causing the \\"deprivatization\\" of religion in contemporary life. No longer content merely to administer pastoral care to individual souls, religious institutions are challenging dominant political and social forces, raising questions about the claims of entities such as nations and markets to be \\"value neutral\\", and straining the traditional connections of private and public morality. Casanova looks at five cases from two religious traditions (Catholicism and Protestantism) in four countries (Spain, Poland, Brazil, and the United States). These cases challenge postwar and indeed post-Enlightenment assumptions about the role of modernity and secularization in religious movements throughout the world. This book expands our understanding of the increasingly significant role religion plays in the ongoing construction of the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VXfRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fashion Doll Knitting Graphs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Voyages to the moon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NCNbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Voyages+to+the+moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"99% OF THE TIME","description":"This is the story of a group of misfits who become a self proclaimed 'family of choice'.

There are just a few problems: he s in prison, and she doesn t know what he did to end up there.

Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her father s incarceration . . . and Ashley s entire world is turned upside down.

The Soul of a Woman is Isabel Allende s most liberating book yet.  Elle  When I say that I was a feminist in kindergarten, I am not exaggerating,  begins Isabel Allende. As a child, she watched her mother, abandoned by her husband, provide for her three small children without  resources or voice.  Isabel became a fierce and defiant little girl, determined to fight for the life her mother couldn t have. As a young woman coming of age in the late 1960s, she rode the second wave of feminism. Among a tribe of like-minded female journalists, Allende for the first time felt comfortable in her own skin, as they wrote  with a knife between our teeth  about women s issues. She has seen what the movement has accomplished in the course of her lifetime. And over the course of three passionate marriages, she has learned how to grow as a woman while having a partner, when to step away, and the rewards of embracing one s sexuality. So what feeds the soul of feminists and all women today? To be safe, to be valued, to live in peace, to have their own resources, to be connected, to have control over our bodies and lives, and above all, to be loved. On all these fronts, there is much work yet to be done, and this book, Allende hopes, will  light the torches of our daughters and granddaughters with mine. They will have to live for us, as we lived for our mothers, and carry on with the work still left to be finished.

In his early years, Nearing made his name as a formidable opponent of child labor and military imperialism. Having been fired from university jobs for his independence of mind, Nearing became a freelance lecturer and writer, traveling widely through Depression-era and post-war America to speak with eager audiences. Five-time Socialist candidate for president Eugene V. Debs said, \\"Scott Nearing! He is the greatest teacher in the United States.\\" Concluding that it would be better to be poor in the country than in New York City, Scott and Helen Nearing moved north to Vermont in 1932 and commenced the experiment in self-reliant living that would extend their fame far and wide. They began to grow most of their own food, and devised their famous scheme for allocating the day's hours: one third for \\"bread work\\" (livelihood), one third for \\"head work\\" (intellectual endeavors), and one third for \\"service to the world community.\\" Scott (who'd grown up partly on his grandfather's Pennsylvania farm) taught Helen (who was raised in suburbia, groomed for a career as a classical violinist) the practical skills they would need: working with tools, cultivating a garden and managing a woodlot, and building stone and masonry walls. For the rest of their lives, the Nearings chronicled in detail their \\"good life,\\" first in Vermont and ultimately on the coast of Maine, in a group of wonderful books--many of which are now being returned to print by Chelsea Green in cooperation with the Good Life Center, an educational trust established at the Nearings' Forest Farm in Harborside, Maine, to promote their ongoing legacy. With a new foreword by activist historian Staughton Lynd, The Making of a Radical is freshly republished-Scott Nearing's own story, told as only he could tell it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PqGAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Making+of+a+Radical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breadfruit bread and papaya pie: Recipes of Micronesia and the outer Pacific","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2rhQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Breadfruit+bread+and+papaya+pie:+Recipes+of+Micronesia+and+the+outer+Pacific&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Moon (Poldark, 5)","description":"The stunning fifth novel in Winston Graham's classic Poldark saga, the major TV series from Masterpiece on PBS.

Before the Archbishop s blood dried on the Cathedral floor, the miracles began. The number of pilgrims visiting his shrine in the Middle Ages was so massive that the stone floor wore thin where they knelt to pray. They came seeking healing, penance, or a sign from God. Chaucer s The Canterbury Tales, one of the greatest, most enduring works of English literature, is a bigger-than-life drama based on the experience of the medieval pilgrim. Power, politics, friendship, betrayal, martyrdom, miracles, and stories all had a place on the sixty mile path from London to Canterbury, known as the Pilgrim s Way. Walking to Canterbury is Jerry Ellis s moving and fascinating account of his own modern pilgrimage along that famous path. Filled with incredible details about medieval life, Ellis s tale strikingly juxtaposes the contemporary world he passes through on his long hike with the history that peeks out from behind an ancient stone wall or a church. Carrying everything he needs on his back, Ellis stops at pubs and taverns for food and shelter and trades tales with the truly captivating people he meets along the way, just as the pilgrims from the twelfth century would have done. Embarking on a journey that is spiritual and historical, Ellis reveals the wonders of an ancient trek through modern England toward the ultimate goal: enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z8WoYdlSEfcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immunocytochemistry and In Situ Hybridization in the Biomedical Sciences","description":"Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization are widely used biomedical sciences.

It plays upon powerful emotions -- envy, fear, lust and ambition. But the industry itself is far more subtle and complex than many people might assume. Through an innovative mix of business strategy and cultural theory, this pioneering book provides a behind-the-scenes analysis of the link between advertising and larger cultural forces, as well as a rare look into the workings of agencies themselves. How do advertisements endeavour to capture real life? How do advertising agencies think of their audience: the consumer and their corporate client? What issues do agencies have to consider when using an advertisement in a range of different countries? What specific methods are used to persuade us not only to buy but to remain loyal to a product? How do advertisers fan consumer desire? An incisive understanding of human behaviour is at the core of all these questions and is what unites advertisers and anthropologists in their work. While this link may come as a surprise to those who consider the former to be firmly rooted in commerce and the latter in culture, this book clearly shows that these two fields share a remarkable number of convergences. From constructing a Japaneseness that appeals to two very different Western audiences, to tracking advertising changes in the post World War II period, to considering how people can be influenced by language and symbols, Advertising Cultures is an indispensable guide to the production of images and to consumer behaviour for practitioners and students alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_TLpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Service Level Management","description":"Discusses the theories and realities of service level management, covering service level agreements, products, monitoring tools, reports, implementation, and potential architectures and technologies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-TdPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Foundations+of+Service+Level+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National airspace system: Maintenance and support operational concept, NAS-SR-137","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xdvZzgEACAAJ&dq=National+airspace+system:+Maintenance+and+support+operational+concept,+NAS-SR-137&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living With Schizophrenia (Psychological Disorders Series, Bk 2)","description":"This volume traces the modern critical and performance history of this play, one of Shakespeare's most-loved and most-performed comedies.

Countless previous studies have focused on their pain and powerlessness, but that has done little more than sustain our preconceptions of marginalized groups. Most accounts of marginalization approach the subject from a distance and tend to overemphasize the victimization of outsiders. Taking a more intimate approach, this book reveals the personal, moral, and social implications of marginalization by drawing upon the actual experiences of such individuals. Multidisciplinary and multicultural, Identity on the Margin addresses marginalization at a variety of social levels and within many different social phenomena, going beyond familiar cases dealing with race, ethnicity, and gender to examine such outsiders as renegade children, conservative Christians, and the physically and mentally disabled. And because women are especially subject to the effects of marginalization, feminist concerns and the marginalization of sexual practices provide a common denominator for many of the essays. From problems posed by \\"complimentary racism\\" to the status of gays in Tony Blair's England, from the struggle of Native Americans to preserve their identities to the singular problems of single mothers, Identity on the Margin takes in a broad spectrum of cases to provide theoretical analysis and ethical criticism of the mechanisms of identity formation at the edges of society. In all of the cases, the authors demonstrate the need for theory that initiates social change by considering the ethical implications of marginalization and criticizing its harmful effects. Bringing together accounts of marginalization from many different disciplines and perspectives, this collection addresses a broad audience in the humanities and social sciences. It offers a basis for enhancing our understanding of this process and for working toward meaningful social change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cj27AAAAIAAJ&dq=Marginal+Groups+and+Mainstream+American+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii Restaurant Guide 2005","description":"A comprehensive guidebook to the special restaurants and dining spots in the Hawaiian Islands covering all culinary tastes and styles with priced menu samples included for budgeting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=almD3woDSqgC&dq=Hawaii+Restaurant+Guide+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mindlings: Encounters Within Inner Space","description":"\\"When Professor John Robis becomes a subject in a secretive sensory-input experiment, he crosses a chasm between matter and spirit, discovering a world inhabited by mindlings, beings much like ourselves who live within him.

Dunn investigates the factors that led to the initiation and persistence of institutionalized cabinets in the governments of T.C. Douglas in Saskatchewan, Duff Roblin and Walter Weir in Manitoba, and W.R. Bennett in British Columbia. He describes the transition from unaided central executive structures to those that are more structured, collegial, and prone to emphasize planning and coordination. He also examines how the premier's role has expanded from simply choosing cabinets to reorganizing their structure and decision-making processes. The institutionalization of provincial cabinets has had major effects on both political actors and functions in the three provinces studied. Dunn shows that cabinet structure has changed, and been changed by, power relations within the cabinet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8DTEcJR0GQwC&dq=Institutionalized&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Quilts and Coverlets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8lhQAAAAMAAJ&dq=America%27s+Quilts+and+Coverlets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Online Dating: The Early Years","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tomorrow About This Time","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"McKay Recycled: A Collection of Minor Observations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Resumes from Hell: How (Not) to Write a Resume and Succeed in Your Job Search by Learning from Career-Killing Blunders","description":"In this illustrated \\"how-not-to,\\" former recruiters Reed and Meyers open up their own joke files, and share highlights from the worst--and funniest--resumes they ever received.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=29GN-dth_cMC&dq=Resumes+from+Hell:+How+(Not)+to+Write+a+Resume+and+Succeed+in+Your+Job+Search+by+Learning+from+Career-Killing+Blunders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What You Must Know about Statin Drugs & Their Natural Alternatives: A Consumer's Guide to Safely Using Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Crestor, Mevacor, or","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Moses: God's Man for Challenging Times","description":"From Moses' life we can learn what it means to walk closely with God day by day; we can learn what it means to find our all-sufficiency in the God of the Bible as we live through sometimes dreary and troublesome times.

In this pioneering study, Paul Blumberg examines a wide variety of evidence, including over 600 accounts written by workers who disclose in elaborate detail the deceptions their employers practiced on the public. Employed in a wide variety of business enterprises--supermarkets, restaurants, fish markets, department stores, gas stations, drug stores, pet stores, and many more--these workers pull back the curtain and reveal the hidden recesses of the American marketplace. Blumberg documents these deceptions in numerous vivid stories, providing readers with a trenchant handbook on survival in America. He tells of stores that routinely mark prices up before a sale; gas stations that sell regular gas as high test; auto mechanics who spray-paint customers' old car parts and then charge them for new parts (in one gas stations, the workers claimed that the mechanic's best tool was his paint can); and pharmacists who sell generic drugs and charge name-brand prices. But equally important, he provides an insightful analysis of why deception pervades the American marketplace. Though at times amusing, The Predatory Society is also frequently disturbing for what it says about private capitalism: how dishonesty is all but built into the American marketplace, and how this dishonesty has potentially disastrous effects on trust and community in our society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GivRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in Orange County","description":"Orange County, California, is a dazzling seaside treasure chest overflowing with sparkling beaches, exciting outdoor activities, vibrant cities, a thriving art scene, world-class shopping and dining, and seemingly endless sunshine.

Given the dominance today of Harley Davidson, few realize that in the early years of this century Indian was the pre-eminent American motorcycle manufacturer, while Harley was struggling to make inroads into the market. Indians had always had an aura and visual style of their own, but by the 50s the company had gone out of business, leaving the field to Harley. The new Millennium, however, sees the successful re-birth of the marque, after several false starts. A new Indian Chief (the 2000) is being built (the machine is based on a Harley), and a new Scout is under development. This superb book is the definitive colour chronicle of the legend that is Indian. First published in 1998, it is now fully updated to include details and unique photography of both the new Chief and the Scout. With superb studio photography of all the significant models from 1901 to the new 2000 Chief and Scout, this is the only fully comprehensive, totally up-to-date hardware history of the company available.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KqtAPQAACAAJ&dq=Indian:+The+History+Of+A+Classic+American+Motorcycle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sea Is All Around","description":"Mab Kendall has been living with her aunt in Iowa, but is sent to spend a year with her other aunt on an island off the coast of Massachusetts.

We have been fighting without being clear for what. We have been waging war without using the full resources we need to win. With the publication of \\"War Footing\\", Frank Gaffney and his colleagues make it clear not only whom the enemy is and how high the stakes are, but also how we can prevail. Their book explains that we are engaged in nothing less than a War for the Free World - a fight to the death with Islamofascists who adhere to a political ideology bent on our destruction. It then offers ten specific steps that Americans, as individuals and as communities, can take to ensure our way of life and the safety and well-being of our children. These steps include specific recommendations about how to know the enemy, support our troops, provide for our energy security, stop investing in terror, equip the country for war at home, counter an EMP attack, secure our borders and interior against illegal immigration, wage political warfare, launch regional initiatives, and wield effective diplomacy. This definitive, highly readable \\"owner's manual\\" for the War for the Free World has been written by one of the most prominent national security experts of our time, Frank J.

The target was a  50 million opium storage plant, which doubled as an Al Qaeda local command centre, in Helmand province. The mission had three objectives: to kill as many terrorists as possible; to collect enemy intelligence; and to destroy the opium, the main source of income for the Taliban regime. Ultimate Risk is a story of extraordinary courage. The mission involved a perilous advance to contact across open ground and yet there had been no time for CTRs (Close Target Reccies) and there were no maps.

While advances in perinatal and neonatal care have improved survival for preterm infants, those infants who do survive have a greater risk than infants born at term for developmental disabilities, health problems, and poor growth. The birth of a preterm infant can also bring considerable emotional and economic costs to families and have implications for public-sector services, such as health insurance, educational, and other social support systems. Preterm Birth assesses the problem with respect to both its causes and outcomes. This book addresses the need for research involving clinical, basic, behavioral, and social science disciplines. By defining and addressing the health and economic consequences of premature birth, this book will be of particular interest to health care professionals, public health officials, policy makers, professional associations and clinical, basic, behavioral, and social science researchers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9c_7kxBsKzIC&dq=The+good+news+-+bad+news+about+premature+birth.(efforts+at+reducing+severe+health+problems+of+premature+babies):+An+article+from:+Medical+Update&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Estate Planning Guide","description":"Offers advice on estate-planning, identifies key documents, and explains the technical jargon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BVbH-7fvdmIC&dq=Complete+Estate+Planning+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocks & Minerals (Reader's Digest Pathfinders)","description":"A stunning visual reference book for little geologists who love to find fascinating rocks all around them.

I realize now what I have never admitted before. I behaved badly. That may strike you as obvious, but it's taken me a long time to admit this, even to myself. I was attacked so often, and so viciously, that I felt that I was the victim. I felt hurt, and betrayed, and somehow that justified my actions. But of course all of the attacks and all of the betrayal were beside the point. The point is   I behaved badly. And the release of What Really Happened didn't help. When I look back at this book that I wrote, I want to throw it out and start again. But instead of attempting to erase my mistakes, I am now owning them. I've annotated the original book. Typos have been corrected but not a word has been changed, not even words that cause me to cringe when I reread them.

For the first century and a half of America's existence, it was invincible as it achieved unprecedented heights of power, wealth, and greatness. And it did all of this in the face of daunting, hopeless and impossible obstacles arrayed against it. These volumes show exactly how and why this was accomplished.

Centuries ago, all of this was foretold in the most intricate, precise, and accurate detail in the pages of the ancient prophets of the Bible. What great purpose awaits America?

In The Little Book of Big Change, psychologist Amy Johnson shows you how to rewire your brain and overcome your bad habits once and for all. No matter what your bad habit is, you have the power to change it. Drawing on a powerful combination of neuroscience and spirituality, this book will show you that you are not your habits. Rather, your habits and addictions are the result of simple brain wiring that is easily reversed. By learning to stop bad habits at the source, you will take charge of your habits and addictions for good. Anything done repeatedly has the potential to form neural circuitry in the brain. In this light, habits and addictions are impersonal brain wiring problems that result from taking your habitual thinking as truth, and acting on that thinking in the form of doing your habit over and over. This book offers a number of small changes you can make in your everyday life that will help you stop your bad habit in its tracks. If you want to understand the science behind your habit, make the decision to end it, and commit to real, lasting change, this book will help you to finally take charge of your life once and for all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KWFBCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At Freedom's Table: More Than 200 Years of Recipes and Remembrance from Military Wives","description":"Women and men are socialized to accept and perform certain gendered roles generally man as warrior/protector and woman as caretaker/protected. The United States Military depends on the wives of servicemen to embrace these gendered roles in order to carry out military operations such as Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF.) The conservative nature of the military, its demand for obedience and loyalty, the dependency of military wives on the military community for financial and social support to cope with the hardships of military life contribute to the reluctance of those opposed to OIF to publicly express this opposition and/or contribute to their negative perceptions of the antiwar movement. Although large-scale opposition to OIF among military wives is unlikely, to avoid further alienating military wives and potential allies, members of the anti-war movement should consider the impact that specific methods of protest have on military families and engage in anti-war activities accordingly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yf5N9FL_KMAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Distributive justice: The right and wrong of our present distribution of wealth","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Thane centers her novel around four major characters: the aristrocratic St. John Sprague, who becomes George Washington's aide; Regina Greensleeves, a Virginia beauty spoilt by a season in London; Julian Day, a young schoolmaster who arrives from England on the eve of the war and thought of himself as a Tory; and Tibby Mawes, one of his less fortunate pupils, saddled with an alcoholic father and an indigent mother. But we also see Washington, Jefferson, Lafayette, Greene, Patrick Henry, Francis Marion, and the rest of that brilliant galaxy not as historical figures but as men and women. We see de Kalb's gallant death under a cavalry charge at Camden. We penetrate Marion's swamp-encircled stronghold on the Peedee. We watch the cat-and-mouse game between Cornwallis and Lafayette.

He appeared before her in her father's house, filthy from the desert, tired and thirsty. But as the dirt of travel was washed from his body, the sight of him filled her heart. And when Abram promises Sarai to return in ten years to take her for his wife, her fate was sealed. Abram kept his promise, and Sarai kept hers. They were wed, and so joined the royal house of Ur with the high priesthood of the Hebrews. So began a lifetime of great joy together, and greater peril: and with the blessing of their God, a great nation would be built around the core of their love.

Forster's life are as engaging as those of his earlier years. Imbued with the same wit, warmth, and vitality, they reveal the breadth of his interests and the great range and enduring quality of his friendships. After a second trip to India in 1921, Forster finally finished the Indian novel he had begun years before. A Passage to India (1924) capped his career as a novelist; he then turned his energies to essays and other nonfictional prose. In the 1930s he emerged as an active journalist, writing and broadcasting on social and political issues. He fought for civil liberties and led a successful campaign against the BBC's political blacklisting of performers. His correspondents during these years included T. S. Eliot, Siegfried Sassoon, Lennard and Virginia Woolf, Christopher Isherwood, and Stephen Spender. At seventy Forster began along, happy, and productive new period in his life with his work on the libretto for Benjamin Britten's opera Billy Budd. In 1960 he was a leading defense witness in the Lady Chatterley trial. By then he was a revered figure among literati and enjoyed advising younger writers. In these last decades he divided his time between his rooms at King's College, Cambridge, and the home of his friends the Buckinghams in Coventry, where he died at age ninety-one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pKtaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Selected+Letters+of+E.+M.+Forster,+Volume+Two+1921-1970+(Volume+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legs Benedict:: A Bed-And-breakfast Mystery (Bed-And-Breakfast Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Focus on the Language Classroom: An Introduction to Classroom Research for Language Teachers (Cambridge Language Teaching Library)","description":"The authors set out to define the aims, principles and objectives of recent research into what exactly happens in the language classroom, to describe the findings of this work, and to relate these to teaching practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2oDhkXnHApQC&dq=Focus+on+the+Language+Classroom:+An+Introduction+to+Classroom+Research+for+Language+Teachers+(Cambridge+Language+Teaching+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical FPGA Programming in C","description":"FPGA brings high performance applications to market quickly  this book covers the many emerging platforms in a proven, effective manner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tJVTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Practical+FPGA+Programming+in+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Thing About a Puppy (Giggle Club)","description":"A young boy describes all the things he likes and does not like about his feisty new puppy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WFPYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Best+Thing+About+a+Puppy+(Giggle+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God and the Constitution: Christianity and American Politics","description":"Is there room for religion in politics?

Comic strip characters - Mutt and Jeff, Barny Google, Little Orphan Annie, Popeye, Blondie, Dick Tracy, Flash Gordon, Li'l Abner - were everywhere. They starred in live-action and animated films, stage plays, and radio programs, and they helped market a wide range of products. Their phrases enriched the language; their adventures, which reflected societal changes, were retold in books and inspired hit songs. Cartoonist and historian Brian Walker's comprehensive survey - illustrated with rare original art - is the most authoritative history of American newspaper comics currently in print. It documents the fascinating origins of the comics and, decade by decade, the major trends in the funnies business. In-depth biographies of twenty-one of the most important creators of the era are featured, as well as samples of many other artists' work. The Comics Before 1945 joins the author's The Comics Since 1945 to form a classic survey of American popular culture by one of the greatest authorities in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZSHuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Comics:+Before+1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Looking Back: Travels of My Soul","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A king in khaki","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"God's Love Story: The Rosary as Protection","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christopher Robin Gives Pooh a Party","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The secret invaders,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Drums","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hebrews (NIV Application Commentary)","description":"George H.

Dermody. Instead of a uniform, Fatty is clothed in a soiled bed sheet. From that moment, life changes for the men aboard the Dermody, especially Larsen, a young sailor fresh from electronics school. The year is 1973, the dog days of the Vietnam War, and the Dermody is beginning her WESTPAC cruise. With no enemy to fight, the ship ?s crew turns on itself in fits of racial tension, drug use and insubordination. Enforcing his will with his massive belly, Fatty Fitzgerald brings his spit and polish \\"rules\\" to the ship, intent on instilling the discipline of the \\"old navy\\" upon his electronics division. Larsen must decide whether to bend to Fatty ?s indomitable will, or experience the revolution with Goat, a fellow technician and self-proclaimed hippie. Other influences are Sonny, the emotional leader of the ship ?s blacks, and Nettles, the bible-thumping corpsman who attempts to save Larsen ?s soul, but loses his own. To complicate things, Larsen falls for Juliet, the Chinese bargirl who steals his heart-for a price. This 157,000-word novel takes place at sea and in the exotic ports of the Orient. Larsen loses his money on the muddy streets of Olongapo, is chased back to his ship by a typhoon in Hong Kong, and endures the Shellback initiation at the equator. By the time the Dermody arrives in Singapore, Larsen has made a decision that will change his life forever. \\"Steve McQueen Would be Proud\\" is a coming-of-age story that explores a world that no longer exists, except in the memories of thousands of sailors who served in the Western Pacific during the Vietnam War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ekaO_ororD0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Kiss","description":"Anna is less than thrilled to be shipped off to boarding school in Paris, leaving a fledgling romance behind  until she meets  tienne St. Clair.

In 1961, just as NASA launched its first man into space, a group of women underwent secret testing in the hopes of becoming America s first female astronauts. They passed the same battery of tests at the legendary Lovelace Foundation as did the Mercury 7 astronauts, but they were summarily dismissed by the boys  club at NASA and on Capitol Hill. The USSR sent its first woman into space in 1963; the United States did not follow suit for another twenty years. For the first time, Martha Ackmann tells the story of the dramatic events surrounding these thirteen remarkable women, all crackerjack pilots and patriots who sometimes sacrificed jobs and marriages for a chance to participate in America s space race against the Soviet Union. In addition to talking extensively to these women, Ackmann interviewed Chuck Yeager, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, and others at NASA and in the White House with firsthand knowledge of the program, and includes here never-before-seen photographs of the Mercury 13 passing their Lovelace tests. Despite the crushing disappointment of watching their dreams being derailed, the Mercury 13 went on to extraordinary achievement in their lives: Jerrie Cobb, who began flying when she was so small she had to sit on pillows to see out of the cockpit, dedicated her life to flying solo missions to the Amazon rain forest; Wally Funk, who talked her way into the Lovelace trials, went on to become one of the first female FAA investigators; Janey Hart, mother of eight and, at age forty, the oldest astronaut candidate, had the political savvy to steer the women through congressional hearings and later helped found the National Organization for Women. A provocative tribute to these extraordinary women, The Mercury 13 is an unforgettable story of determination, resilience, and inextinguishable hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xekqfR0z9PcC&dq=The+Mercury+13:+The+Untold+Story+of+Thirteen+American+Women+and+the+Dream+of+Space+Flight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silent Sin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Using the Runes","description":"This guidebook will help you discover the oracular nature of the runes and how to use them as a magickal tool for insight, protection, and luck.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TdYa__wxEF0C&dq=Using+the+Runes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Lanes","description":"Jayne Anne Phillips has always been a master of portraiture, both in her widely acclaimed novels and in her short fiction.

Along with the original seven stories from Fast Lanes--each told in extraordinary first person narratives that have been hailed by critics as virtuoso performances--these incandescent portraits offer windows into the lives of an entire generation of Americans, demonstrating again and again why Jayne Anne Phillips remains one of our most powerful writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R6LLZYmn3-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And Those Who Trespass Against Us","description":"Author Bio: Gretchen Cook-Anderson is a public affairs professional and former Capitol Hill lobbyist who lives in the Washington, DC area with her husband. This is her first novel. A young newlywed was killed in a suburban San Francisco bank hold-up 25 years ago. Her murderers were never found. Twenty-something and savvy, Congressional aid Rachel Mooreshelton's life begins to violently twist and turn following the untimely murder of her office colleague, Persy Pritchard. Life in prominent Congressman Jackson's office will never again be the same. Rookie DC police detective Mike James, pulled in to investigate the Capitol Hill murder of Congressman Jackson's chief of staff, becomes embroiled in a complicated, politically volatile case, that stands to not only blow the lid off of the decades-old bank murder, and topple the old-guard leadership in the Congress, but may also reveal an uneasy truth about one of the nation's most celebrated lawmakers. Those Who Trespass Against Us reminds us that those in whom we place our trust and our nation's welfare are sometimes those who betray our unblinding faith again and again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HidS9UmRLHUC&dq=And+Those+Who+Trespass+Against+Us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mile in Her Boots: Women Who Work in the Wild","description":"\\"A collection of true stories by women who do a variety of outdoor jobs, from smoke jumping to biology, river running to professional falconry, horse packing to atmospheric science, and more\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1wiRJj-jqPkC&dq=A+Mile+in+Her+Boots:+Women+Who+Work+in+the+Wild&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra: a book for all and none","description":"Friedrich Nietzsche's most accessible and influential philosophical work, misquoted, misrepresented, brilliantly original and enormously influential, Thus Spoke Zarathustra is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable. If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, also available in Penguin Classics. 'Enigmatic, vatic, emphatic, passionate, often breathtakingly insightful, his works together make a unique statement in the literature of European ideas' A. C.

A young settler reprimanded him for stepping out of the way of an African family on a narrow bush path:  Walk straight on. They must know who is the master in the land.  Fraenkel found himself whistling the Nazis  anthem  Clear the streets for the brown battalions. The storm troopers are marching.  He was coming to learn the importance of not conforming.  A vivid account of a childhood in a middleclass, non-observant Jewish family in Nazi Germany, forced to emigrate to Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) in 1939.    Trevor Gundry, Jewish Chronicle  Peter Fraenkel... and his family emigrated in 1939 from Breslau to Northern Rhodesia, where he forged a successful career... in the Central African Broadcasting Service. Fraenkel was thus given the opportunity of using his undoubted skills as a broadcaster to help in the education of black people, using new methods of mass education... his sojourn in Northern Rhodesia came to an end in 1957, a few years after the country was refashioned by the British government as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland   a big mistake, Fraenkel thinks, and one that wasn t undone until much later when the independent state of Zambia was created. His love affair with Africa came to an end, and he felt impelled to leave, because of his  dislike of racist politics in this bastion of white privilege ... Peter Fraenkel s account of the 20 years in Northern Rhodesia is absorbing... there are riveting chapters on his activities as a somewhat subversive broadcaster, working together with like-minded whites and Blacks... The book is written in a very lively manner and there are countless anecdotes, many of them in direct speech... I recommend it strongly.    Leslie Baruch Brent, Association of Jewish Refugees  The book bursts with life. Countries like these Central African territories are... far more exciting than countries with a settled structure. Here a new society is emerging. This excitement is lost in official reports and academic studies and one of Fraenkel s achievements is that he conveys it in full measure. I know of no book which more vividly describes the variety and throb of a modern African township.

In late April 1902, Mount Pel e, a volcano on the Caribbean island Martinique, began to wake up. It emitted clouds of ash and smoke for two weeks until violently erupting on May 8. Over 30,000 residents of St. Pierre were killed; they burned to death under rivers of hot lava and suffocated under pounds of hot ash. Only three people managed to survive: a prisoner trapped in a dungeon-like jail cell, a man on the outskirts of town, and a young girl found floating unconscious in a boat days later. So how did a town of thousands not heed the warnings of nature and local scientists, instead staying behind to perish in the onslaught of volcanic ash? Why did the newspapers publish articles assuring readers that the volcano was harmless? And why did the authorities refuse to allow the American Consul to contact Washington about the conditions? The answer lies in politics: With an election on the horizon, the political leaders of Martinique ignored the welfare of their people in order to consolidate the votes they needed to win. A gripping and informative book on the disastrous effects of a natural disaster coupled with corruption, The Day the World Ended reveals the story of a city engulfed in flames and the political leaders that chose to kill their people rather than give up their political power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5O4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Snake Pits To Cash Cows: Politics And Public Institutions In New York","description":"Explains why public institutions for people with developmental disabilities have persevered despite plans to eliminate them. Public institutions for people with developmental disabilities continue to operate within New York State, although their very existence has been condemned, and public policies directed their complete closure by the year 2000. From Snake Pits to Cash Cows investigates why these institutions persevere despite virtually universal predictions of their demise. Paul J. Castellani s provocative account spans the years 1935 to 2000, describing decades of conflict and confusion about the role of public institutions. This book demonstrates how and why a convergence of operational, fiscal, and political crises in the mid-1970s resulted in a series of agreements among adversaries that radically changed the political landscape, and reversed the plan to close all public institutions. He also shows why New York s experience has implications and lessons for the study of public policy in the area of developmental disabilities services and for understanding Medicaid policymaking, intergovernmental finance, and human services administration. Paul J. Castellani is Public Service Professor at the Nelson A. Rockefeller College, University at Albany, State University of New York.

In short, a work of art.    Harper Lee Hailed by the Washington Post Book World as  a sort of Catcher in the Rye out West,  Richard Bradford s Red Sky at Morning is the classic coming-of-age story set during World War II about the enduring spirit of youth and the values in life that count. In the summer of 1944, Frank Arnold, a wealthy shipbuilder in Mobile, Alabama, receives his volunteer commission in the U.S. Navy and moves his wife, Ann, and seventeen-year-old son, Josh, to the family s summer home in the village of Corazon Sagrado, high in the New Mexico mountains. A true daughter of the Confederacy, Ann finds it impossible to cope with the quality of life in the largely Hispanic village and, in the company of Jimbob Buel an insufferable, South-proud, professional houseguest takes to bridge and sherry. Josh, on the other hand, becomes an integral member of the Sagrado community, forging friendships with his new classmates, with the town s disreputable resident artist, and with Amadeo and Excilda Montoya, the couple hired by his father to care for their house. Josh narrates the story of his fateful year in Sagrado and, with irresistibly deadpan, irreverent humor, describes the events and people who influence his progress to maturity. Unhindered by his mother's disdain for these \\"tacky, dusty little Westerners,\\" Josh comes into his own and into a young man's finely formed understanding of duty, responsibility, and love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2mu2AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BEACH ROAD","description":"Dark mysteries come to East Hampton while a struggling lawyer fights to save his friend from being framed for a triple murder. Montauk lawyer Tom Dunleavy's client list is woefully small-occasional real estate closings barely keep him in paper clips. So when he is hired to defend a local man accused in a triple murder in East Hampton, he knows that he has found the case of his lifetime. The crime turns the glittering playground for the super-rich into a blazing inferno. Dunleavy's client is a local hero, but he knows the case rests on money, deception, and forbidden desires. His client will be framed-unless he can find the key to the case. When Dunleavy is joined by his former flame, the savvy and well-connected attorney, Kate Costello, he believes he has a chance. But payback is a bitch, especially from the rich. The violent retaliations of billionaires threatened by his investigation exceed anything Dunleavy has ever seen. With the entire nation's eyes on him in a new Trial of the Century, Dunleavy orchestrates a series of revelations that lead to a stunning outcome-and the truth is wilder than anything he ever imagined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CPG6o9eyMMEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Clash of Ideologies","description":"How do ideologies shape international relations in general and Middle Eastern countries' relations with the United States in particular? The Clash of Ideologies by Mark L. Haas explores this critical question. Haas argues that leaders' ideological beliefs are likely to have profound effects on these individuals' perceptions of international threats. These threat perceptions, in turn, shape leaders' core security policies, including choices of allies and enemies and efforts to spread their ideological principles abroad as a key means of advancing their interests. Two variables are particularly important in this process: the degree of ideological differences dividing different groups of decision makers (\\"ideological distance\\"), and the number of prominent ideologies that are present in a particular system (\\"ideological polarity\\"). The argument is tested in four case studies of states' foreign policies, primarily since the end of the Cold War: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey. As the argument predicts, ideological differences in these cases were a key cause of international conflict and ideological similarities a source of cooperation. Moreover, different ideological groups in the same country at the same time often possessed very different understandings of their threat environments, and thus very different foreign policy preferences. These are findings that other prominent international relations theories, particularly realism, cannot explain. Clash of Ideologies goes beyond advancing theoretical debates in the international relations literature. It also aims to provide policy guidance on key international security issues. These prescriptions are designed to advance America's interests in the Middle East in particular, namely how U.S. leaders should best respond to the ideological dynamics that exist in the region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfxQEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Clash+of+Ideologies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlikely Teachers: Finding the Hidden Gifts in Daily Conflict","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conservative Management of Sports Injuries","description":"This text embraces the philosophy of 'active' conservative care and a multidisciplinary team approach to treatment.

The organization of the future must be not only nimble and flexible but also self-governing and values-driven. But what will this future organization look like? And how will it be led? In this thoughtful book, organizational expert Brook Manville and Princeton classics professor Josiah Ober suggest that the model for building the future organization may lie deep in the past. The authors argue that ancient Athenian democracy was an ingenious solution to organizing human capital through the practice of citizenship. That ancient solution holds profound lessons for today's forward-thinking managers: They must reconceive today's \\"employees\\" as \\"citizens.\\" Through this provocative case study of innovation and excellence lasting two hundred years, Manville and Ober describe a surprising democratic organization that empowered tens of thousands of individuals to work together for both noble purpose and hard-edged performance. Their book offers timeless guiding principles for organizing and leading a self-governing enterprise. A unique and compelling think piece, A Company of Citizens will change the way managers envision the leadership, values, and structure of tomorrow's people-centered organizations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9uN0wgEACAAJ&dq=A+Company+of+Citizens:+What+the+World%27s+First+Democracy+Teaches+Leaders+About+Creating+Great+Organizations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FIREARMS.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bugsters","description":"The insect friends of Mudville are featured in two stories that deal with cooperation, prejudice, and fear of the unknown.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HisdGQAACAAJ&dq=Bugsters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Lance Goines Posters","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"La venganza de don Mendo / Don Mendo's Revenge (Letras Hispanicas) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Momo's kitten","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The O'Dooles of Reseda: A Year in the Life of America's Most Dysfunctional Family","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"One on One with Jack Welch","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All's Fair in Love and War","description":"When your chance for getting into college and your date for the prom are all on the line...

But when she tanks the SATs, her automatic assumptions about going to college don't appear to be so automatic anymore. She determines that her only hope for college admission is to win the election for student body president. Unfortunately, with her razor wit and acid tongue, she's better suited to dishing out insults than winning votes. When she brashly bets her classmate Logan that she can go two weeks without uttering a single insult, Samantha immediately realizes that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. And when her current boyfriend dumps her, less than three weeks before the prom, it couldn't be a worse time to be forced to keep her opinions to herself. Finding a new boyfriend will be a challenge now that Logan shadows her every move, hoping to catch her slipping back into her old ways. Samantha is determined to win the election and find a dream date for the prom, no matter what it takes.

The man who W.H. Auden once called perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived has inspired both greater adulation and greater loathing than any other composer. Bryan Magee presents a penetrating analysis of Wagner's work, concentrating on how his sensational and deeply erotic music uniquely expresses the repressed and highly charged contents of the psyche. He examines not only Wagner's music and detailed stage directions but also the prose works in which he formulated his ideas, as well as shedding new light on his anti-semitism and the way in which the Nazis twisted his theories to suit their own purposes. Outlining the astonishing range and depth of Wagner's influence on our culture, Magee reveals how profoundly he continues to shock and inspire musicians, poets, novelists, painters, philosophers, and politicians today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZI2gbZ5BVMC&dq=Aspects+of+Wagner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Cookbooks (Self-Counsel Writing)","description":"-- By the author of five cookbooks-- Collecting recipes that sell-- The spiritual connection between people and food-- Getting published","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2FRKoIdkOmcC&dq=Writing+Cookbooks+(Self-Counsel+Writing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crusades;: Translated from the French by Anne Carter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OH7kAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Crusades%3B:+Translated+from+the+French+by+Anne+Carter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kingfisher Illustrated Pocket Dictionary","description":"A dictionary for ages nine to thirteen, with entries identifying part of speech and definition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lxvdAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Kingfisher+Illustrated+Pocket+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Installing Debian GNU/Linux (Other Sams)","description":"Down covers topics such as hardware requirements, troubleshooting, selecting packages, setting up a GUI, networking, partitioning, and more.

While an impressive body of professional literature attests to the central role of mutual aid in social work practice with groups, what has been lacking is a single source that links the description of mutual aid (what it is, exactly) with practice prescriptions (how to help it come about and flourish in various settings). This book does just that. This updated edition of the pathbreaking original contains four entirely new chapters that address: single-session groups short-term groups open-ended groups very large groups In addition, this book will help you to better understand and make use of mutual-aid perspectives on: pre-group planning early group goals and norms the significance of time and place, and the role of the group worker individual problem-solving authority, conflict, and evaluation Each chapter of The Mutual-Aid Approach to Working with Groups: Helping People Help One Another, Second Edition describes and discusses how to catalyze mutual aid in different settings and systems including generic and specific obstacles to overcome; offers implications for practice and identifies group-specific skills for reaching each system's full mutual-aid potential. This new edition of The Mutual-Aid Approach to Working with Groups provides a foundation for practice, examining theories, concepts, and practice principles specific to mutual aid.

Hosokawa recounts the ordeals faced by the immigrant generation and their American-born offspring, the Nisei; the ill-advised government decisions that led to their uprooting during World War II; how they withstood harsh camp life; and their courageous efforts to prove their loyalty to the United States. As Hosokawa additionally demonstrates, since World War II, Japanese Americans have achieved exceptional social, economic, and political progress. Their efforts led to apologies by four U.S. presidents for wartime injustices and redress through the landmark Civil Liberties Act of 1988.

Hall's celebrated 20th century tome, where readers delight in discussions about ancient symbolism, rituals, and mythology. Manly P. Hall was a Canadian Author of over 150 published works, the best known of which are Initiates of the Flame, The Story of Healing, The Divine Art, Aliens Magic and Sorcery The Secret Teachings of All Ages, and An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy. Symbolism is the language of the Mysteries; in fact it is the language not only of mysticism and philosophy but of all Nature, for every law and power active in universal procedure is manifested to the limited sense perceptions of man through the medium of symbol. Every form existing in the diversified sphere of being is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language. This book is often hailed as an encyclopedia for all things hidden, ancient, and arcane, and it explores a vast array of topics, from secret societies and the Zodiac to Mystic Christianity and William Shakespeare's identity. Despite some of the outdated and controversial ideas it poses now in the 21st century, it continues to fascinate students of the cryptic and mysterious.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sPBNEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Challenge of the American Revolution","description":"This volume presents an eminent historian's progress over thirty years in trying to understand the American Revolution. Here is the historian at his best beginning with the assumption that things are not always as they appear to be, delighting in the discovery of the previously unknown, and offering new interpretations with style, wit, and the good sense to know that there are always more questions to be answered. The Revolution is fertile ground for the historian's craft, as these essays attest. Edmund S. Morgan discovers in American protests against British taxation an affirmation of rights that the colonists adhered to with surprising consistency, and that guided them ultimately to independence. Then, after a general reassessment of the importance of the Revolution, he moves to a study of it as an intellectual movement, which challenged the best minds of the period to transform their political world. Next, in studying the ethical basis of the Revolution, Morgan traces the shaping of national consciousness by puritanical attitudes toward work and leisure. This leads him to an exploration of the paradoxical relationship between slavery and freedom, and the role their relationship played in the Revolution. Finally, thinking about the Revolution on its anniversary, Morgan looks once again at the Founding Fathers and the innovative daring, admiring most their ability to reject what had hitherto been taken for granted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-WgXAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chain of Destiny","description":"He was the last man  Suzannah Lightfoot was alone in the world, without a job or the means to support herself.

Thus, companies who own 1TB of data today will own 32TB in five years. Storage networks help to tame such data quantities and to manage this data growth efficiently. Since stored data and information are the biggest asset of any company, anyone who is involved in the planning or the operation of IT systems requires a basic knowledge of the principle and the use of storage networks. Storage Networks Explained covers the fundaments, techniques and functions of storage networks such as disk subsystems, Fibre Channel SAN, Internet SCSI (iSCSI), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Network Attached Storage (NAS), file systems, and storage virtualization. Furthermore the authors describe the use of these techniques and how they are designed to achieve high-availability, flexibility, and scalability of data and applications. Additional attention is given to network backup and the management of storage networks. Written by leading experts in the field, this book on storage area networks is updated and fully revised. Key features: Presents the basic concepts of storage networks, such as I/O techniques, disk subsystems, virtualization, NAS and SAN file systems Covers the design of storage networks which provide flexible, highly-available, and scaleable IT systems Explains the use of storage networks for data sharing, data protection, and digital archiving Discusses management of storage networks using SNMP, SMI-S, and IEEE 1244 This book provides system administrators and system architects, as well as students and decision makers, with the tools needed for optimal selection and cost-effective use of storage networks.

Was everything about to fall apart just when heaven had seemed within reach?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rEsnnCet__kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Short Stories 1997","description":"The best-selling story anthology includes both old and new talent, including Tobias Wolff, Donald Hall, Robert Stone, Cynthia Ozick, and Junot Diaz, and features works divided into such categories as \\"Perceived Social Values.\\" Simultaneous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5Nha56pNTUwC&dq=The+Best+American+Short+Stories+1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected stories of Katherine Mansfield","description":"Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp Murry was a prominent modernist writer of short fiction who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield.

Acclaimed as one of the best historical novels ever written, this engaging saga of Viking adventure in 10th century northern Europe has a very appealing young hero, Orm Tostesson, whose story we follow from inexperienced youth to adventurous old age, through slavery and adventure to a royal marriage and the search for great treasure. Viking expeditions take him to lands as far apart as England, Moorish Spain, Gaardarike (the country that was to become Russia), and the long road to Miklagard. The salt-sea spray, the swaying deck awash in slippery blood are the backdrop to fascinating stories of King Harald Blue Tooth, the Jomsvikings, attempts to convert the Northmen to Christianity, and much else. Like H. Rider Haggard, Bengtsson is a master of the epic form.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BnJJAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Long+Ships:+A+Saga+of+the+Viking+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divided Arsenal: Race and the American State During World War II","description":"A comparison of the causes and effects of federal race policy during World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wn3nphroZ3YC&dq=Divided+Arsenal:+Race+and+the+American+State+During+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic of Rapport","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flickering Shadows","description":"Political corruption, lust, and betrayal poison a Caribbean island paradise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1eCGPwAACAAJ&dq=Flickering+Shadows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Invisible Minority: Brazilians in New York City","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SpAMAAAAYAAJ&dq=An+Invisible+Minority:+Brazilians+in+New+York+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rainwater Catchment Systems for Domestic Supply: Design, Construction and Implementation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The naturalist in La Plata","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H9wSAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crimes of the Heart","description":"THE STORY: The scene is Hazlehurst, Mississippi, where the three Magrath sisters have gathered to await news of the family patriarch, their grandfather, who is living out his last hours in the local hospital.
