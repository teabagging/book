It is unfortunate, therefore, that Father Julian, the well-loved curate of the Pimlico church, should have been killed in a burglary gone wrong. And doubly unfortunate that the Vicar, upwardly-aspiring William Keble Smythe, should choose to appoint a woman to replace him. From the moment that Rachel Nightingale enters the serene Anglo-Catholic world of St Margaret s, tempers and emotions run high; Christian charity is not much in evidence, even among those who espouse it loudly. Then another  accidental  death unites the parishioners in new heights of hypocrisy, and leaves some crying  murder . But David Middleton-Brown is sceptical  until he learns about Father Julian s death. With the encouragement of the Archdeacon, David and Lucy Kingsley embark on a search for the truth about the  dead man out of mind , and discover more than they ever wanted to know about greed, hypocrisy, ambition  and the cost of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=omofCgAAQBAJ&dq=A+Dead+Man+Out+of+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If the Gods Are Good: The Epic Sacrifice of HMS Jervis Bay","description":"\\"To give readers a full appreciation of the significance of what took place, the authors put the battle in the context of contemporary naval and political events and describe the battle action aboard several ships, including the Admiral Scheer.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PvFmAAAAMAAJ&dq=If+the+Gods+Are+Good:+The+Epic+Sacrifice+of+HMS+Jervis+Bay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zambelli: The First Family of Fireworks: A Story of Global Success","description":"\\"The story of the Zambelli family, the world's largest manufacturer and exhibitor of fireworks, unfolds in this biography about an Italian family that came to America in search of a better life and, through hard work and determination, achieved extraordinary success in the pyrotechnic industry.

As night fell, army snipers took up position; military officers surveilled the scene from a nearby roof; and their accomplice, restaurant-owner Loyd Jowers, was ready to remove the murder weapon. When the dust had settled, King had been shot and a cleanup operation was in motion James Earl Ray was framed, the crime scene was destroyed, and witnesses were killed. It would take William F. Pepper, attorney and friend of King, thirty years to get to the bottom of a conspiracy that changed the course of American history. In 1999, the King family, represented by the author, brought a civil action lawsuit against Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators. Seventy witnesses set out the details of a plot that involved J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, Richard Helms and the CIA, the US military, the Memphis police, and organized crime. The jury took an hour to find for the King family. Now fifty years after MLK s execution, An Act of State demonstrates the bloody depths to which the US government will descend to repress a movement for change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wedqDwAAQBAJ&dq=An+Act+of+State:+The+Execution+of+Martin+Luther+King&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lent Book Two: A Lent Sourcebook: The Forty Days: Book 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Autobiography of a Flea (Scarlet Library)","description":"An electrifying story of the sensational murder trial that divided a city and ignited the civil rights struggle In 1925, Detroit was a smoky swirl of jazz and speakeasies, assembly lines and fistfights. The advent of automobiles had brought workers from around the globe to compete for manufacturing jobs, and tensions often flared with the KKK in ascendance and violence rising. Ossian Sweet, a proud Negro doctor-grandson of a slave-had made the long climb from the ghetto to a home of his own in a previously all-white neighborhood. Yet just after his arrival, a mob gathered outside his house; suddenly, shots rang out: Sweet, or one of his defenders, had accidentally killed one of the whites threatening their lives and homes. And so it began-a chain of events that brought America's greatest attorney, Clarence Darrow, into the fray and transformed Sweet into a controversial symbol of equality. Historian Kevin Boyle weaves the police investigation and courtroom drama of Sweet's murder trial into an unforgettable tapestry of narrative history that documents the volatile America of the 1920s and movingly re-creates the Sweet family's journey from slavery through the Great Migration to the middle class. Ossian Sweet's story, so richly and poignantly captured here, is an epic tale of one man trapped by the battles of his era's changing times.

This noble individual was not conscious of the fact that at that very moment the divine within him and the divine of the universe were most intimately united. So, for Goethe, the resonance with a natural rationality seems part of the genius of modern science. Einstein's 'cosmic religion', which reflects Spinoza, also echoes Goethe's remark (Ibid. , Item 575 from 1829): Man must cling to the belief that the incomprehensible is comprehensible. Else he would give up investigating. But how far will Goethe share the devotion of these cosmic rationalists to the beautiful harmonies of mathematics, so distant from any pure and 'direct observation'? Kepler, Spinoza, Einstein need not, and would not, rest with discovery of a pattern within, behind, as a source of, the phenomenal world, and they would not let even the most profound of descriptive generalities satisfy scientific curiosity. For his part, Goethe sought fundamental archetypes, as in his intuition of a Urpjlanze, basic to all plants, infinitely plastic. When such would be found, Goethe would be content, for (as he said to Eckermann, Feb. 18, 1829): . . . to seek something behind (the Urphaenomenon) is futile. Here is the limit. But as a rule men are not satisfied to behold an Urphaenomenon. They think there must be something beyond.

Through an examination of the score utilizing a variety of sopranino saxophone-centric contemporary resources alongside an interview with Czernowin herself, this dissertation provides the first extant performance guide to the sopranino saxophone edition of The Last Leaf, with the purpose of providing any saxophonists wishing to attempt this work with the information of Czernowin's intention for the piece and how to implement the techniques necessary for a performance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=57yqzgEACAAJ&dq=Sopranino,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fairy Tales By the Brothers Grimm","description":"\\"When Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published their 'Children's and Household Tales' in 1812, followed by a second volume in 1815, they had no idea that such stories as 'Rapunzel, ' 'Hansel and Gretel, ' and 'Cinderella' would become the most celebrated in the world. Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, 'The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm' makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezs?. From 'The Frog King' to 'The Golden Key, ' wondrous worlds unfold--heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique--they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms' later, more embellished collections of tales. Zipes's introduction gives important historical context, and the book includes the Grimms' prefaces and notes. A delight to read, 'The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm' presents these peerless stories to a whole new generation of readers\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JumgzgEACAAJ&dq=Fairy+Tales+By+the+Brothers+Grimm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greater Purpose","description":"Walter Bradley made a deal with God: he would unashamedly share his faith with students and faculty, and he would not let academic ambition prevent him from giving his faith and family the time they deserve. The day he could no longer keep that deal, he would leave the academy. He never had to. From his days as a determined graduate assistant sharing his love for Jesus with his first class, to becoming one of the most respected engineering professors in academia, Walter Bradley remained a man of integrity, dedicated to truth and love. He s made a difference in myriad ways from leading a small Bible study for students in his home to defending intelligent design before large crowds of his academic peers. He s equally comfortable performing ground-breaking research for NASA, serving as an expert witness in the courtroom, or empowering people in Africa with appropriate technologies. Through it all, one thing has remained true: Walter Bradley made a crucial difference for good in countless lives. In For a Greater Purpose: The Life and Legacy of Walter Bradley, authors Robert Marks and William Dembski detail the story of this remarkable man whose passion for God, science, higher education, and human empowerment provides an excellent model of someone who integrates faith and learning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXD6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson, the apostle of Americanism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death of White Sociology","description":"Brings together essays on the dynamics, dimensions, and problems of black sociology","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OlZEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Death+of+White+Sociology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Finland","description":"Lonely Planet Finland is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

The authors begin by showing that computer science is the study of algorithms, which is the central theme of the book, then move up the next five levels of the hierarchy: hardware, virtual machine, software, applications, and ethics. Each layer in the hierarchy builds upon the ideas and concepts presented in earlier chapters. In addition to some motivational applications such as Web page design and interactive graphics, the book covers the fundamental issues of algorithms, hardware design, computer organization, system software, language models, theory of computation, and social and ethical issues of computing. Exposure to these deeper and more complex core ideas introduces students to the richness and beauty of the field and helps them appreciate the principles behind their creation and implementation. While feeling the excitement of computer science, students receive a solid grounding in the central concepts as well as in important uses of computing and information technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9PKqQgAACAAJ&dq=An+Invitation+to+Computer+Science:+Java+Version,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hunt for Red October","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights: Ali Baba and the Forth Thieves and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jv8xNgAACAAJ&dq=Tales+from+the+Arabian+Nights:+Ali+Baba+and+the+Forth+Thieves+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Handbook for Building Healthy Self-Esteem in Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heathen Girls","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ayurveda Secrets of Healing","description":"Ayurveda, Secrets of healing is a seminal work, the basis of which is deeply rooted in the scriptural knowledge behind Ayurveda.

There is something new to be chronicled every day,  writes C. S. Lewis in A Grief Observed. When Carl Klaus's wife of thirty-five years died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage, right before Thanksgiving in 2002, he took the only road toward recovery that made sense to him: he started writing letters to her, producing a unique history of grief, solace, and love. His vivid and thoughtful letters will resonate with everyone whose loss confronts them with emotional, psychological, and philosophical questions for which there are no easy answers. During his first year without Kate, Carl writes himself into the life that comes after the life he loved. From days of grief in the darkness of a midwestern winter, to springtime, with a return to life in the garden and a memorial service for Kate on a sunny afternoon, to fall, with a pilgrimage to their favorite vacation spot in Hawaii, Carl documents his year-long experience of remembering, meditating, and evolving a new life. Individually his letters provide the insights of a master diarist; collectively, they have the arc of a master essayist. Recording the full range of mourning from intense shock to moments of exceptional affirmation, Klaus's stories and reflections on loss bear witness to universal truths about the first and most significant year of mourning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cJS2RBoT2acC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters: On Family and Fatherhood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lockheed P-38 Lightning","description":"The definitive story of the World War II fighter which the Germans dubbed \\"the fork-tailed devil\\" includes line drawings, photos of prototypes and coverage of Lockheed proposals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NWx2PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Lockheed+P-38+Lightning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Mexique Bay","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"everything on this page is for Treasure Island","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads them to a pirate's fortune.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPAYAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yemenite girl: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Perfect Choice: The Ultimate Party and Wedding Location Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHxR4_DLeIcC&dq=The+Perfect+Choice:+The+Ultimate+Party+and+Wedding+Location+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe Leather-bound Journal with Lined Pages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Goodnight Train","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Impending Hour","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VGgctAEACAAJ&dq=The+Impending+Hour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baryshnikov","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Emily Eyefinger","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Body from Ipanema","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Helen Keller and the Big Storm","description":"A true incident in the life of young Helen Keller in which she gets stuck in a storm and her teacher, Annie Sullivan, rescues her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WUY3n4UuZUoC&dq=Helen+Keller+and+the+Big+Storm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anatole and the poodle","description":"Anatole the mouse comes to the aid of Juliette, the French poodle, who needs his help.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zh05swEACAAJ&dq=Anatole+and+the+poodle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Body Parts","description":"The bestselling author delves into the twisted crimes of Wayne Adam Ford. This kind of frightening and fascinating glimpse into a killer s mind is rare.   Ron Franscell, New York Timesbestselling author On a chilly November afternoon in 1998, a tearful 36-year-old man walked into the Humboldt County Sheriff s Department in Eureka, California, and confessed to something horrible.  I hurt some people,  he said. Inside his pocket was the ghastly proof of his statement. But there was more to Wayne Adam Ford than the trail of mangled victims he left behind. More, even, than the twisted predator inside, which drove him to increasingly perverse sexual appetites. Pulitzer Prizenominated author Caitlin Rother draws on previously sealed testimony, interviews with the key players in the case, and the killer s shocking confession to explore the demons that drove a damaged man to his unspeakable crimes. Her book is a harrowing psychological portrait and a haunting, unforgettable true-life thriller. Includes dramatic photos  Page-turning excitement and blood-curdling terror . . .

From such great radio works as \\"War of the Worlds\\" to his cinematic masterpieces Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Othello, Macbeth, Touch of Evil, and Chimes at Midnight, Welles was a master storyteller, as expansive as he was enigmatic. This Is Orson Welles, a collection of penetrating and witty conversations between Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, includes insights into Welles's radio, theater, film, and television work; Hollywood producers, directors, and stars; and almost everything else, from acting to magic, literature to comic strips, bullfighters to gangsters. Now including Welles's revealing memo to Universal about his artistic intentions for Touch of Evil, (of which the \\"director's edition\\" was released in Fall 1998) this book, which Welles ultimately considered his autobiography, is a masterpiece as unique and engaging as the best of his works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBQ6wf2ffnYC&dq=This+Is+Orson+Welles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the cannon's mouth;: The Civil War letters of General Alpheus S.

Very well, here s an ultimatum: manage your finance better and avoid the biggest common money mistakes that are burning a hole in your pocket. Frankly, it s not your fault.

This is especially so for the millennial generation and after, who don t have the same spending and saving money habits of the boomer generation and before. Our fast-paced consumerist culture has also blown up out of proportion with all the latest new shiny objects to buy, must-try experience to spend on, and money-wasting services to subscribe to that are popping up more and more, guaranteeing to lead you to instant financial ruin (if you re not already there yet).

This pathbreaking synthesis reveals a striking continuity in negative stereotypes of Jews, contempt for Judaism, and negation of Jewish national self-determination from the days of Karl Marx to the current left-wing intellectual assault on Israel. World-renowned expert on the history of antisemitism Robert S. Wistrich provides not only a powerful analysis of how and why the Left emerged as a spearhead of anti-Israel sentiment but also new insights into the wider involvement of Jews in radical movements. There are fascinating portraits of Marx, Moses Hess, Bernard Lazare, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Trotsky, and other Jewish intellectuals, alongside analyses of the darker face of socialist and Communist antisemitism.

Ancheta demonstrates how United States civil rights laws have been framed by a black-white model of race that typically ignores the experiences of other groups, including Asian Americans. When racial discourse is limited to antagonisms between black and white, Asian Americans often find themselves in a racial limbo, marginalized or unrecognized as full participants. Ancheta examines legal and social theories of racial discrimination, ethnic differences in the Asian American population, nativism, citizenship, language, school desegregation, and affirmative action. In the second edition of this influential book, Ancheta also covers post-9/11 anti-Asian sentiment and racial profiling. He analyzes recent legal cases involving political empowerment, language rights, human trafficking, immigrant rights, and affirmative action in higher education--many of which move the country farther away from the ideals of racial justice. On a more positive note, he reports on the progress Asian Americans have made in the corporate sector, politics, the military, entertainment, and academia. A skillful mixture of legal theories, court cases, historical events, and personal insights, this second edition brings fresh insights to U.S. civil rights from an Asian American perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uc_q6upNmugC&dq=Race,+Rights,+and+the+Asian+American+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mycenae, rich in gold","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RUirAAAACAAJ&dq=Mycenae,+rich+in+gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Titan: A Life of Theodore Dreiser","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hometown Advantage : How to Defend Your Main Street Against Chain Stores and Why it Matters","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Electromagnetic Waves in Chiral and Bi-Isotropic Media (Artech House Antenna Library)","description":"Learn how chiral and BI media affect electromagnetic fields and wave propagation, and how to apply the theory to basic problems in waveguide, antenna, and scattering analysis with this book.

Having recently lost her husband of fifty years, Packer also speaks with candor and tenderness about the convulsions of a grieving heart and the peace that undivided awareness can bring. Toni Packer began studying Zen in 1967 with Roshi Philip Kapleau (author of The Three Pillars of Zen ) at the Rochester Zen Center and was eventually named his successor. Seeing the potentially destructive effects of relying too much on tradition, however, she did not accept the position. Packer is strongly influenced by the teachings of Krishnamurti and has turned away from the traditional forms and hierarchies that are prevalent in many Buddhist schools. Her approach is appealing to many Westerners who find institutionalized practices such as chanting, bowing, and burning incense to be alien and unnecessary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7_miErEsR9wC&dq=The+Wonder+of+Presence:+And+the+Way+of+Meditative+Inquiry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner","description":"Selling more than 200,000 copies, Living Wicca has helped countless solitary practitioners blaze their own spiritual paths.

Not everyone tells jokes. Not everyone gets a joke, even a good one. But, Gini argues, joke-telling can act as both a sword and a shield to defend us from reality.

Through the lives of its generals and governors, this book explores the narrative of Britannia as an integral and often troublesome part of Rome s empire, a hard-won province whose mineral wealth and agricultural prosperity made it crucial to the stability of the West. But Britannia did not exist in a vacuum, and the authors set it in an international context to give a vivid account of the pressures and events that had a profound impact on its people and its history. The authors discuss the lives and actions of the Roman occupiers against the backdrop of an evolving landscape, where Iron Age shrines were replaced by marble temples and industrial-scale factories and granaries sprang up across the countryside.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nJC6DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wayward Winds (Secrets of Heathersleigh Hall #2)","description":"On the brink of the Great War, all of Europe is caught up in a rising current of tension and political upheaval.

This book is destined to accompany many students making their way into a classical area of mathematics which represents the most fruitful example to date of the intimate connection between algebra and analysis. For exam preparation it offers quick access to the essential results and an abundance of interesting inducements. Teachers and interested mathematicians in finance, industry and science will also find reading it profitable, again and again referring to it with pleasure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uP8SF4jf7GEC&dq=Theory+of+Complex+Functions+(Graduate+Texts+in+Mathematics+/+Readings+in+Mathematics)+(v.+122)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese Communication, Culture, Context: Volume 1 (Japanese Edition)","description":"NAKAMA 1 is a complete, flexible introductory program designed to present the fundamentals of the Japanese language to users.

Suddenly and unexpectedly a family, Herbie, Noon, and their two girls draw closer until an outside threat reawakens a fire in Noon, causing her to rise up and fight to hold her family and her community together.

Expanded and updated with a new epilogue, Blais  book tells the story of a season in the life of the Amherst Lady Hurricanes a girls  high school basketball team from the Western Massachusetts college town. The Hurricanes were a talented team with a near-perfect record, but for five straight years, when it came to the crunch of the playoffs, they somehow lacked the desire to go all the way. Now, led by senior guards Jen Pariseau, a three-point specialist, and Jamila Wideman, an All-American phenom, this was the year to prove themselves. It was a season to test their passion for the sport and their loyalty to each other, and a chance to discover who they really were.

He warned the Attorney General that the \\"mixture of armed groups and those who hate is a recipe for disaster.\\" This was six months before the Oklahoma City bombing. In Gathering Storm, he tells for the first time why he decided to alert the Attorney General and why the danger of serious domestic terrorism still exists. The militia movement we saw so much about immediately after the Oklahoma City bombing was not a spontaneous grassroots uprising of men angry at big government but, as Dees shows, a well-organized effort by some of America's most dangerous far-right extremists. Its goal is to destabilize our democracy through domestic terrorism. Few are more qualified to expose the militia network and its close cousin, the Christian patriots, than Dees. Dees points out that the Oklahoma City tragedy was not an isolated event. He connects together a series of violent acts and plans promoted by militia groups and small secret \\"patriot\\" cells since the early 1980s. Many, he says, have ties to sources of political power in state houses and in Washington.

Did the \\"hymietown\\" comment by Jesse Jackson and the Crown Heights riot signal a resurgence of antisemitism among blacks? The surprising answer to both questions, according to Leonard Dinnerstein, is no--Jews have never been more at home in America. But what we are seeing today, he writes, are the well-publicized results of a long tradition of prejudice, suspicion, and hatred against Jews--the direct product of the Christian teachings underlying so much of America's national heritage. In Antisemitism in America, Leonard Dinnerstein provides a landmark work--the first comprehensive history of prejudice against Jews in the United States, from colonial times to the present. His richly documented book traces American antisemitism from its roots in the dawn of the Christian era and arrival of the first European settlers, to its peak during World War II and its present day permutations--with separate chapters on antisemititsm in the South and among African-Americans, showing that prejudice among both whites and blacks flowed from the same stream of Southern evangelical Christianity. He shows, for example, that non-Christians were excluded from voting (in Rhode Island until 1842, North Carolina until 1868, and in New Hampshire until 1877), and demonstrates how the Civil War brought a new wave of antisemitism as both sides assumed that Jews supported with the enemy. We see how the decades that followed marked the emergence of a full-fledged antisemitic society, as Christian Americans excluded Jews from their social circles, and how antisemetic fervor climbed higher after the turn of the century, accelerated by eugenicists, fear of Bolshevism, the publications of Henry Ford, and the Depression. Dinnerstein goes on to explain that just before our entry into World War II, antisemitism reached a climax, as Father Coughlin attacked Jews over the airwaves (with the support of much of the Catholic clergy) and Charles Lindbergh delivered an openly antisemitic speech to an isolationist meeting. After the war, Dinnerstein tells us, with fresh economic opportunities and increased activities by civil rights advocates, antisemititsm went into sharp decline--though it frequently appeared in shockingly high places, including statements by Nixon and his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \\"It must also be emphasized,\\" Dinnerstein writes, \\"that in no Christian country has antisemitism been weaker than it has been in the United States,\\" with its traditions of tolerance, diversity, and a secular national government. This book, however, reveals in disturbing detail the resilience, and vehemence, of this ugly prejudice. Penetrating, authoritative, and frequently alarming, this is the definitive account of a plague that refuses to go away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJLHrb-o5E0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diversity and Evolution of Plants","description":"This exciting new textbook examines the concepts of evolution as the underlying cause of the rich diversity of life on earth-and our danger of losing that rich diversity. Written as a college textbook, The Diversity and Evolution of Plants introduces the great variety of life during past ages, manifested by the fossil record, using a new natural classification system. It begins in the Proterozoic Era, when bacteria and bluegreen algae first appeared, and continues through the explosions of new marine forms in the Helikian and Hadrynian Periods, land plants in the Devonian, and flowering plants in the Cretaceous. Following an introduction, the three subkingdoms of plants are discussed. Each chapter covers one of the eleven divisions of plants and begins with an interesting vignette of a plant typical of that division. A section on each of the classes within the division follows. Each section describes where the groups of plants are found and their distinguishing features. Discussions in each section include phylogeny and classification, general morphology, and physiology, ecological significance, economic uses, and potential for research. Suggested readings and student exercises are found at the end of each chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l9W1rNL3O7QC&dq=The+Diversity+and+Evolution+of+Plants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The town that died","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Langue Et Langage/Le Francais Par Le Francais","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-lD_wAEACAAJ&dq=Langue+Et+Langage/Le+Francais+Par+Le+Francais&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The crisis of the Negro intellectual","description":"Published in 1967, as the early triumphs of the Civil Rights movement yielded to increasing frustration and violence, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual electrified a generation of activists and intellectuals. The product of a lifetime of struggle and reflection, Cruse's book is a singular amalgam of cultural history, passionate disputation, and deeply considered analysis of the relationship between American blacks and American society. Reviewing black intellectual life from the Harlem Renaissance through the 1960s, Cruse discusses the legacy (and offers memorably acid-edged portraits) of figures such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, arguing that their work was marked by a failure to understand the specifically American character of racism in the United States. This supplies the background to Cruse's controversial critique of both integrationism and black nationalism and to his claim that black Americans will only assume a just place within American life when they develop their own distinctive centers of cultural and economic influence. For Cruse's most important accomplishment may well be his rejection of the clich s of the melting pot in favor of a vision of Americanness as an arena of necessary and vital contention, an open and ongoing struggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9FNdJ8wlss8C&dq=The+crisis+of+the+Negro+intellectual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forgotten Husband (Where The Heart Is) (Silhouette Romance, No 1019)","description":"The Forgotten Husband by Elizabeth August released on May 25, 1994 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4619CirRLnUC&dq=Forgotten+Husband+(Where+The+Heart+Is)+(Silhouette+Romance,+No+1019)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ame a Jacob/Jacob Have I Loved","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Multicultural Math Classroom: Bringing in the World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fugitive","description":"After spotting fugitive Pete Duffy on the Metro in Washington D.C. and playing a role in his capture, Theodore Boone must face a greater danger than ever before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DR5hDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Fugitive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algonquian Spirit: Contemporary Translations of the Algonquian Literatures of North America (Native Literatures of the Americas)","description":"When Europeans first arrived on this continent, Algonquian languages were spoken from the northeastern seaboard through the Great Lakes region, across much of Canada, and even in scattered communities of the American West. The rich and varied oral tradition of this Native language family, one of the farthest-flung in North America, comes brilliantly to life in this remarkably broad sampling of Algonquian songs and stories from across the centuries. Ranging from the speech of an early unknown Algonquian to the famous Walam Olum hoax, from retranslations of ?classic? stories to texts appearing here for the first time, these are tales written or told by Native storytellers, today as in the past, as well as oratory, oral history, and songs sung to this day. ? An essential introduction and captivating guide to Native literary traditions still thriving in many parts of North America, Algonquian Spirit contains vital background information and new translations of songs and stories reaching back to the seventeenth century. Drawing from Arapaho, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Cree, Delaware, Maliseet, Menominee, Meskwaki, Miami-Illinois, Mi'kmaq, Naskapi, Ojibwe, Passamaquoddy, Potawatomi, and Shawnee, the collection gathers a host of respected and talented singers, storytellers, historians, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal educators, both Native and non-Native, from the United States and Canada?all working together to orchestrate a single, complex performance of the Algonquian languages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i9mB2uvVreMC&dq=Algonquian+Spirit:+Contemporary+Translations+of+the+Algonquian+Literatures+of+North+America+(Native+Literatures+of+the+Americas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Wayne's the Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Amelia rules!: In with the out crowd","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Unger's Bible Dictionary","description":"eBook now easier to navigate than ever Unger s Bible Dictionary has been one of the best-selling Bible dictionaries on the market since its introduction in 1957.

Anderson provides a fresh interpretation of Sino-American relations in the nineteenth century. The book focuses on the eight Americans who occupied the chief U.S. diplomatic post in China from 1861 to 1898 and personally shaped American policy toward China in the forty years before Secretary of State John Hay's Open Door Notes. Their policies, as Anderson explains, were as varied as the eight individuals, and yet at the same time were characteristically American--expressing both idealistic altruism and imperialistic self-interest. Ultimately, John Hay merged the altruism and the self-interest in the Open Door Notes of 1899 and 1900, which influenced much of America's twentieth-century conduct in Asia. Anderson reemphasizes Hay's role in bridging the differences that have plagued U.S. policy in China.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y2NrAQVuNxwC&dq=Imperialism+and+Idealism:+American+Diplomats+in+China,+1861-1898&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fusion of the Five Elements: Basic and Advanced Meditations for Transforming Megative Emotions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Tilsit Inheritance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jOFxtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Tilsit+Inheritance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audrey Hepburn: A Secret Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fmUNAAAACAAJ&dq=Audrey+Hepburn:+A+Secret+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gatherings In Diaspora: Religious Communities and the New Immigration","description":"The new religious communities of the United States in their churches, mosques, temples, home meetings, and festivals, being built by immigrants.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DhARf4jGcXYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Work of Redemption","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=it0OAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to build a flying saucer: And other proposals in speculative engineerings","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Leave a Message for Willie","description":"Amid the shifting world of San Francisco flea markets, shady vendors sell junk, precious antiques, and stolen goods side by side.

Yet the richly diverse building traditions of Native Americans encompass much more, including specific structures for sleeping, working, worshipping, meditating, playing, dancing, lounging, giving birth, decision-making, cleansing, storing and preparing food, caring for animals, and honoring the dead. In effect, the architecture covers all facets of Indian life. The collaboration between an architect and an anthropologist, Native American Architecture presents the first book-length, fully illustrated exploration of North American Indian architecture to appear in over a century. Peter Nabokov and Robert Easton together examine the building traditions of the major tribes in nine regional areas of the continent from the huge plank-house villages of the Northwest Coast to the moundbuilder towns and temples of the Southeast, to the Navajo hogans and adobe pueblos of the Southwest. Going beyond a traditional survey of buildings, the book offers a broad, clear view into the Native American world, revealing a new perspective on the interaction between their buildings and culture. Looking at Native American architecture as more than buildings, villages, and camps, Nabokov and Easton also focus on their use of space, their environment, their social mores, and their religious beliefs. Each chapter concludes with an account of traditional Indian building practices undergoing a revival or in danger today. The volume also includes a wealth of historical photographs and drawings (including sixteen pages of color illustrations), architectural renderings, and specially prepared interpretive diagrams which decode the sacred cosmology of the principal house types.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wcF9dBCui9sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corruption and Reform: Lessons from America's Economic History (National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Report)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rome and Vatican (Practical Artistic Guide Book Including Large Map)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Governance and Politics of China (Comparative Government and Politics)","description":"Now available in a substantially revised 3rd edition covering the changes of the Seventeenth Party Congress and Eleventh National People's Congress and other recent developments, this major text by a leading academic authority provides a thorough introduction to all aspects of politics and governance in post-Mao China","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=acW5mgEACAAJ&dq=Governance+and+Politics+of+China+(Comparative+Government+and+Politics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth Blackwell: First Woman Doctor of Modern Times","description":"Describes the personal life and achievements of the woman credited with being the first woman physician in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AFHek-YaEMsC&dq=Elizabeth+Blackwell:+First+Woman+Doctor+of+Modern+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Damron Amsterdam- P","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On SF","description":"Praise for Thomas Disch: \\"One of the most remarkably talented writers around.\\" ---Washington Post Book World \\"[Disch] is without doubt one of the really bright lights on the American SF scene.\\" ---Fantasy and Science Fiction This collection by the much-loved and lauded science-fiction writer Thomas Disch spans twenty-five years of his career, during which he has supplemented his creative output with reviews and critical essays in publications as diverse as the Nation, the New York Times Book Review, the Atlantic Monthly, and Twilight Zone. Disch's perspectives on his genre are skeptical, novel, and often incendiary. The volume's opening essay, for example, characterizes writers of science fiction as \\"the provincials of literature.\\" Other essays explore science fiction's roots-Poe, Bradbury, Clarke, Asimov, Vonnegut-as well as modern practitioners such as Stephen King, Philip Dick, Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and William Gibson. Disch entertains and provokes with essays on UFOs, Science Fiction as a Church, and Newt Gingrich's Futurist Brain Trust. Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Madame Blavatsky also get the Disch treatment. Throughout, the writing is lively, agile, and irreverent, exhibiting an incisive honesty that is undiluted by Disch's own attachments as a sci-fi practitioner.

When their wealthy father suddenly dies, the two gently reared New England heiresses are sent to live with their aunt on a sprawling Texas ranch. There the twins meet Chad Kinkaid, the cowboy son of a neighboring rancher. Marian is fascinated by Chad's rugged good looks and his sheer masculinity, but she knows that like every other man she and her twin have met, he will pursue Amanda, not her.

Reinforced by the constitutional separation between church and state, policymakers have shied away from this potentially volatile and divisive issue. In this timely precient book, one of the most renowned figures in American politic argues that in today s climate, a secular approach is no longer sufficient. The 21st century seems to be devolving into a period of religious war, and in an era of confrontation between international terrorism and the West, our political leaders can no longer avoid dealing directly and explicitly with religious issues. In The Mighty and the Almighty, Madeleine Albright examines religion and foreign affairs through the lens of U.S. history as well as her own experience in public office. She offers a sharp critique of U.S. policy, condemnation for those who exploit religious fervor for violent ends, and praise for political, cultural, and spiritual leaders who seek to harness the values of faith to unite us in these confusing and dangerous times. Illuminating and engrossing, this is a provocative work calling for leadership that is bold enough to rein in divisive religious rivalries and lay the groundwork for a new moral consensus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KRM9Hme0kf4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modular Approach to Md-DOS 6.2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fox Valley Murders","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xd-SzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Fox+Valley+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grand Scribe's Records, Vol. 7: The Memoirs of Pre-Han China","description":"This volume is part of the first complete translation (in nine volumes) of the Shih chi (The Grand Scribe's Records), one of the most important narratives in traditional China.

Such prophetic language often differs from other parts of Scripture, employing highly figurative details. God in His wisdom has imparted these clued to various prophets spanning centuries of time, civilizations and social levels, thus providing the modern-day reader a highly complex, yet complete prophetic puzzle pointing us forward to final days in earth's history. Therefore, a complete study is necessary to understanding Bible prophecy as the act of overlooking one prophet or vision will render an incomplete understanding. William miller was a simple New York farmer when God called him to become one of the cornerstones of the great revival movement that eventually formed the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist church. A self-proclaimed agnostic, Miller had little to do with God or the bible for much of his adult life. However, as the Holy Spirit worked on his heart, Miller began an extensive study of the Scriptures where he found Christ as his personal friend and Saviour. Evidence From Scripture and History explores into the heart of many Bible prophecies both known and ambiguous. Backing up all claims wich Scripture and references, Miller takes the reader on an exhaustive study of Bible prophecy in this modern-day repring of an early advent study. - INTRODUCTION. LECTURE I.

Every statistician working in any area of applied science should buy it and experience the excitement of these new approaches to familiar activities.\\"  Technometrics Generalized Linear Models: With Applications in Engineering and the Sciences, Second Edition continues to provide a clear introduction to the theoretical foundations and key applications of generalized linear models (GLMs). Maintaining the same nontechnical approach as its predecessor, this update has been thoroughly extended to include the latest developments, relevant computational approaches, and modern examples from the fields of engineering and physical sciences. This new edition maintains its accessible approach to the topic by reviewing the various types of problems that support the use of GLMs and providing an overview of the basic, related concepts such as multiple linear regression, nonlinear regression, least squares, and the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Incorporating the latest developments, new features of this Second Edition include: A new chapter on random effects and designs for GLMs A thoroughly revised chapter on logistic and Poisson regression, now with additional results on goodness of fit testing, nominal and ordinal responses, and overdispersion A new emphasis on GLM design, with added sections on designs for regression models and optimal designs for nonlinear regression models Expanded discussion of weighted least squares, including examples that illustrate how to estimate the weights Illustrations of R code to perform GLM analysis The authors demonstrate the diverse applications of GLMs through numerous examples, from classical applications in the fields of biology and biopharmaceuticals to more modern examples related to engineering and quality assurance. The Second Edition has been designed to demonstrate the growing computational nature of GLMs, as SAS?, Minitab?, JMP?, and R software packages are used throughout the book to demonstrate fitting and analysis of generalized linear models, perform inference, and conduct diagnostic checking. Numerous figures and screen shots illustrating computer output are provided, and a related FTP site houses supplementary material, including computer commands and additional data sets. Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition is an excellent book for courses on regression analysis and regression modeling at the upper-undergraduate and graduate level. It also serves as a valuable reference for engineers, scientists, and statisticians who must understand and apply GLMs in their work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LBiT207QLZgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bantam chickens","description":"Bantam Chickens are the most popular variety among current chicken owners.

By 1938, two-thirds of rural dwellings had been connected to a centrally generated supply, but the majority of farms in Britain were not linked to the mains until sometime between 1950 and 1970. Given the significance of electricity for modern life, the difficulties of supplying it to isolated communities, and the parallels with current discussions over the provision of high-speed broadband connections, it is surprising that until now there has been little academic discussion of this vast and protracted undertaking. This book fills that gap. It is divided into three parts. The first, on the progress of electrification, explores the timing and extent of electrification in rural England, Wales and Scotland; the second examines the effects of electrification on rural life and the rural landscape; and the third makes comparisons over space and time, looking at electrification in Canada and Sweden and comparing electrification with the current problems of rural broadband.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rs2VDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Teens While They're Still in Preschool","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"You Never Asked Me to Read: Useful Assessment of Reading and Writing Problems","description":"Presents eight case studies of children who have had difficulty reading, the reader follows as the children are tested and assessed.

Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VUVMAQAAQBAJ&dq=To+Have&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pornography's Victims","description":"Gathers excerpts from the Attorney Gerneral's Commission on Pornography, shares the stories of individuals whose lives have been affected by pornography, and suggests actions to take against pornography","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6rjoQEACAAJ&dq=Pornography%27s+Victims&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The truth reflex: A scientific method to access intuitive intelligence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Down to Earth Sociology: Introductory Readings, 12th Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Restraint","description":"The United States, Barry R. Posen argues in Restraint, has grown incapable of moderating its ambitions in international politics. Since the collapse of Soviet power, it has pursued a grand strategy that he calls \\"liberal hegemony,\\" one that Posen sees as unnecessary, counterproductive, costly, and wasteful. Written for policymakers and observers alike, Restraint explains precisely why this grand strategy works poorly and then provides a carefully designed alternative grand strategy and an associated military strategy and force structure. In contrast to the failures and unexpected problems that have stemmed from America s consistent overreaching, Posen makes an urgent argument for restraint in the future use of U.S. military strength. After setting out the political implications of restraint as a guiding principle, Posen sketches the appropriate military forces and posture that would support such a strategy. He works with a deliberately constrained notion of grand strategy and, even more important, of national security (which he defines as including sovereignty, territorial integrity, power position, and safety). His alternative for military strategy, which Posen calls \\"command of the commons,\\" focuses on protecting U.S. global access through naval, air, and space power, while freeing the United States from most of the relationships that require the permanent stationing of U.S. forces overseas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rnmuAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Second Chance!

A cordon of blueclad troopers formed around a train of open wagons loaded with Indian families. As a military band drawn up at the base of the flagstaff played \\"Auld Lang Syne,\\" the procession moved out of the fort and headed north. The post was Fort Bowie, Arizona, for a quarter of a century a lonely bastion in Apache Pass, the heart of Apacheria. The Indians were Geronimo and his band of Chiricahua Apaches, for more than a decade scourges of the southwestern frontier. Now the warfare had ended, and with a touch of musical irony the victors bade farewell as the vanquished were escorted to the railroad cars that would bear them eastward to an uncertain future. Today the gaunt ruins of Fort Bowie, set in an environment otherwise uncluttered by man's works, recall a dramatic and significant phase of the American past\\"Ythe struggle of a dynamic and aggressive people to conquer the wilderness, and the struggle of a proud and independent people to retain the wilderness and the way of life they had known.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OlqiOwAACAAJ&dq=A+clash+of+cultures:+Fort+Bowie+and+the+Chiricahua+Apaches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girls from Planet 5 (Vintage Ballantine, 117)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ernestine & Amanda","description":"Ernestine is in over her head.

Sparkling white beaches by day, scintillating nightclubs after dark. This sophisticated, international capital was the crown jewel of an island paradise--until the idealism that fed the Cuban Revolution yielded a nightmare of soul-crushing dictatorship.ADIOS HAVANA is a true account of romance and peril, adventure and patriotism. Fueled by love--love of family, of country, and of each other--a young couple must face the most wrenching of choices: remain in the country they cherish, lose the wealth and position their families strove for generations to attain, and watch their children grow up impoverished under a terrifying regime; or risk escaping with no money or possessions and leave behind everything they have ever known to begin a new life in a strange land.Andrew Rodriguez's memoir paints his struggle, along with his young bride, to escape the communist betrayal at any cost. \\"Adios Havana\\" is a stirring energetic portrait of 1950s Cuba--its joys, its wonders, and its griefs--through the eyes of two teenagers who lived it. His story of the tragedy that is Cuba is both informed and enriched by his present perspective as a prosperous, self-made businessman and grandfather, grateful for the opportunities extended to him when he arrived virtually destitute on American soil.A legacy to future generations, this memoir is intended to remind readers of the fragility of freedom...to describe the disintegration of a prosperous civilized society and offer counsel on how to prevent a similar catastrophe from happening in America...and to show how and why penniless refugees flourish in the land of the free--why anyone who resists oppression would be driven to tell his beloved homeland, Adios!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pa6yt4rSxzYC&dq=Adios,+Havana:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WITCHERY HILL","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Police Intelligence Reports","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=95DdAAAACAAJ&dq=Police+Intelligence+Reports&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Friedrich II, of Prussia: Called Frederick the Great (The works of Thomas Carlyle)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"25th Edition Grading Guides 1977 Standard catalogue of Canadian Coins Tokens and Paper Money Fully Illustrated 1670 to Date","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Speaker's Lifetime Library","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mTXntwEACAAJ&dq=Speaker%27s+Lifetime+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The right way to do wrong;: An expose of successful criminals,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j5_XHZImTqcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men Out of Asia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ID6xAAAAIAAJ&dq=Men+Out+of+Asia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bowl Food: Comfort Food for People on the Move (Laurel Glen Little Food Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A River Never Sleeps","description":"Few books have captured the haunting world of music and rivers and of the sport they provide as well as A River Never Sleeps. Roderick L. Haig-Brown writes of fishing not just as a sport, but also as an art. He knows moving water and the life within it its subtlest mysteries and perpetual delights. He is a man who knows fish lore as few people ever will, and the legends and history of a great sport. Month by month, he takes you from river to river, down at last to the saltwater and the sea: in January, searching for the steelhead in the dark, cold water; in May, fishing for bright, sea-run cutthroats; and on to the chilly days of October and the majestic run of spawning salmon. All the great joy of angling is here: the thrill of fishing during a thunderstorm, the sight of a river in freshet or a river calm and hushed, the suspense of a skillful campaign to capture some half-glimpsed trout or salmon of extraordinary size, and the excitement of playing and landing a momentous fish. A River Never Sleeps is one of the enduring classics of angling. It will provide a rich reading experience for all who love fishing or rivers. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for fishermen. Our books for anglers include titles that focus on fly fishing, bait fishing, fly-casting, spin casting, deep sea fishing, and surf fishing. Our books offer both practical advice on tackle, techniques, knots, and more, as well as lyrical prose on fishing for bass, trout, salmon, crappie, baitfish, catfish, and more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to publishing books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked by other publishers and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UvbpBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enchanting Evil","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Holy Bible: PTL Parallel Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YAvozgEACAAJ&dq=Holy+Bible:+PTL+Parallel+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy: A True Story of Discovery, Acting, Health, Illness, Recovery, and Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Prairie Birds: Fragile Splendor in the Great Plains","description":"One of the nation's premier ornithologists documents the great diversity of prairie birds in drawings and photographs that capture their habits, habitats, migratory patterns, breeding practices, and beauty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_MXwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Prairie+Birds:+Fragile+Splendor+in+the+Great+Plains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Men Who Shaped World History","description":"Presents a brief biographical profile and portrait of mostly American and European men known for their contributions in such areas as politics, religion, the arts, and science","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r-MGAAAACAAJ&dq=100+Men+Who+Shaped+World+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Mother's Body Book","description":"Billy Beede, the teenage daughter of the fast-running, no-account, and six-years-dead Willa Mae, comes home one day to find a fateful letter waiting for her: Willa Mae s burial spot in LaJunta, Arizona, is about to be plowed up to make way for a supermarket. As Willa Mae s only daughter, Billy is heiress to her mother s substantial but unconfirmed fortune a cache of jewels that Willa Mae s lover, Dill Smiles, is said to have buried with her. Dirt poor, living in a trailer with her Aunt June and Uncle Roosevelt behind a gas station in a tumbleweedy Texas town, and pregnant with an illegitimate child, Billy knows that treasure could mean salvation. So she steals Dill s pickup truck and, with her aunt and uncle in tow, heads for Arizona with Dill in hot pursuit. While everyone agrees it s only polite to speak of getting mother s body and moving her to a proper resting place, it s well understood that digging up Willa Mae s diamonds and pearls will make the whole trip a lot more worthwhile. The enormously accomplished fiction debut from Suzan-Lori Parks, the 2002 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Getting Mother s Body takes its place in the company of the classic works of Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker.

While the book will have immediate appeal for students of writing, it will also be of interest to general readers for its in-depth reading of contemporary fiction and for its take on important issues of the day: Should writers try to be more uplifting? How is emotion best conveyed in fiction? Why are serious writers in North America wedded to the realist tradition?

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. American writer Faber Birren devoted his life to color and it's effects on human life. After writing around 25 texts on the topic, it would be safe to say his work is considered highly among color experts and psychologists around the world. Birren's work has a strong focus on linking how humans perceive colors to how it makes them react. He writes, \\"Good smelling colors are pink, lilac, orchid, cool green, aqua blue.\\" Birren explores the work of several physicians, scientists and doctors, mainly the German psychoanalyst and physician Felix Deutsch, whose findings throw important light not only on medical practice with references to color but on the whole psychology of color. Birren states that if a person prefers warmer colors such as hues of red and oranges, they are likely to me more aware of their social environment. He labels these as \\"warm color dominant subjects.\\" On the other hand, those preferring cooler colous such as blues and greens, are categorized generally as \\"cold color dominant subjects\\" and are recognized as finding it challenging to adapt themselves to new environments and situations.\\" By splitting people into separate categories, based on their color preferences, Birren finds himself able to establish a greater understanding of their personalities and characteristics. One experiment Birren explores in his text, courtesy of Kurt Goldstein, involves a subject standing before a black wall with his eyes shut and arms outstretched to touch the wall in front. When the subject is influenced by a warm color such as the color red, his arms deviate away from each other, whereas when under the influence of a cooler colour such as green or blue, even though the reaction is a subtle one, the subject will move his arms closer together. I find this experiment, simple as it is, to be fascinating in highlighting the strong effects colors have on our minds and bodies. As well as distinguishing the differences in peoples' character through his use of color psychology, Birren also touches on the effects colors can have on the mentally ill. This section was the most interesting and involved a series of complex experiments such as discovering which neurological disorders were linked to which colors. Courtesy of the work by Hans Huber, it was proven that patients suffering manic tendencies preferred the color red, a symbol of blood and anger. Hysterical patients were more sensitive to green, \\"perhaps as an escape,\\" the color linked to paranoid subjects was found to be brown and schizophrenics are sensitive to yellow. Birren states that persons troubled with \\"nervous (neurotic) and mental (psychotic) disturbances are greatly affected by color and are responsive to it.\\" Therefore color becomes much more significant to them, and affects them in a completely different way than those without such neurological disturbances. Chapter 12 \\"Neurotics and Psychotics\\" is the most compelling in the text as it relates to my dissertation topic. After struggling to find texts specific to my research subject, this text and its contents came as a welcomed discovery and I will be referring to Birren's work throughout my further research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zIOengEACAAJ&dq=Color+Psychology+and+Color+Therapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Close Encounters: Communicating in Relationships","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Future power: A science fiction anthology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Washington, D.

As the expedition s geologist and naturalist, Darwin collected evidence from the Galapagos Islands and other locations which prompted him to speculate that species evolve over generations through a process of natural selection. In 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. His revolutionary work presented evidence from the Beagle expedition as well as from years of subsequent research and experimentation. Written for non-specialists, Darwin s book gained widespread interest from the scientific community, religious leaders, politicians and the general public. The theory Darwin presented in his book quickly became the subject of heated debate and discussion. Now accepted by the scientific community, Darwin s concepts of evolutionary adaptation via natural selection are central to modern evolutionary theory and form the foundation of modern life sciences. Perhaps the most transformative scientific volume ever published, this volume of the first edition of On the Origin of Species: Outlines Darwin s ideas, scientific influences and the core of his theory Details natural selection and address possible objections to the theory Examines the fossil record and biogeography to support evolutionary adaptation Features a \\"Recapitulation and Conclusion\\" which reviews key concepts and considers the future relevance of Darwin s theory On the Origin of Species: The Science Classic is an important addition to the bestselling Capstone Classics series edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon.

In it, Levinas not only affirms the necessity of an escape from being, but also gives a meaning and a direction to it. Beginning with an analysis of need not as lack or some external limit to a self-sufficient being, but as a positive relation to our being, Levinas moves through a series of brilliant phenomenological analyses of such phenomena as pleasure, shame, and nausea in order to show a fundamental insufficiency in the human condition. In his critical introduction and annotation, Jacques Rolland places On Escape in its historical and intellectual context, and also within the context of Levinas's entire oeuvre, explaining Levinas's complicated relation to Heidegger, and underscoring the way Levinas's analysis of \\"being riveted,\\" of the need for escape, is a meditation on the body.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pbN_2_P1cmgC&dq=Ethique+Et+Infini+(Ldp+Bib.Essais)+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asymmetric Conflicts : War Initiation by Weaker Powers (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","description":"The key argument of deterrence theory is that the military superiority of a relatively strong power, coupled with a credible retaliatory threat, will prevent attack.

In the \\"line-shape theory\\" sections, we are especially pleased to include an IBM-compatible diskette supplied by David Schneider and Jack Freed which contains fast, accurate, ready-to-use software for slow-motion simulations. Barney Bales discusses inhomogeneous broadening phenomena in detail. Several developments in techniques and interpretation in saturation transfer spectroscopy have appeared since the publica tion of Spin Labeling II: Theory and Applications (L. J. Berliner, ed., Academic Press, 1979). We have included an up-to-date chapter on spin-label applications by M. A. Hemminga and P. A. de Jager. By incorporating 15N and deuterium into nitroxide spin labels, several unique advantages are derived in line-shape analysis. Albert Beth and Bruce Robinson have contributed a detailed chapter on the analysis of these labels in the slow-motion regime while Jane Park and Wolfgang Trommer present the advantages for specific biochemical examples in our \\"applications\\" section. Derek Marsh's contri bution on spin-label spectral analysis may be regarded as a summary chapter which touches on several of the detailed spectral analysis methods described in the earlier chapters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pFiSngEACAAJ&dq=LABELING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing Natural Foods by Looking Through History: Traditional Diets from around the World that have Maintained Health, Weight Loss, and Nutrition.....for Centuries!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Passion: Photography from the Movie \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"","description":"Presents still photographs taken during the filming of Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" accompanied by passages from the gospels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=noCGAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Passion:+Photography+from+the+Movie+%22The+Passion+of+the+Christ%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curl Up And Die (Worldwide Library Mystery)","description":"When renowned hairstylist DeAngelo is murdered while taking an electric foot bath, Stella's friend Meredith is accused, and Stella must clear Meredith's name while struggling in her tentative romance with Jason.

It is titled after a pair of lions which killed his workers, and which he eventually killed. Following the death of the lions, the book tells of the bridge's completion in spite of additional challenges (such as a fierce flood) as well as many stories concerning local wildlife (including other lions), local tribes, the discovery of the maneaters' cave, and various hunting expeditions. An appendix contains advice to sportsmen visiting British East Africa.

The volume follows both chronological and thematic paths, offering a panoramic and multilayered analysis of the various strategies in which modern Hebrew writers, from the turn of the nineteenth century through the twenty-first century pursued in their attempt to represent the divine in the face of metaphysical, theological, and representational challenges. Modern Hebrew literature emerged during the nineteenth century as part of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) movement, which attempted to break from the traditional modes of Jewish intellectual and social life. The Hebrew literature that arose in this period embraced the rebellious nature of the Haskalah and is commonly characterized as secular in nature, defying Orthodoxy and rejecting God. Nevertheless, this volume shows that modern Hebrew literature relied on traditional narratological and poetic norms in its attempt to represent God. Despite its self-declared secularity, it engaged deeply with traditional problems such as the nature of God, divine presence, and theodicy. Examining these radical changes, this volume is a key text for scholars and students of modern Hebrew literature, Jewish studies and the intersection of religion and literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p6PSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible as Literature: An Introduction","description":"This comprehensive and systematic text approaches the Bible from a literary/historical perspective and studies it as a body of writing produced by real people who intended to convey messages to real audiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MNkYAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Bible+as+Literature:+An+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii under the rising sun: Japan's plans for conquest after Pearl Harbor","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"At the Stroke of Madness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Into the Light, My Dream of Heaven","description":"At a time before popular discussion of and research into near death and after life experiences was in the popular consciousness, Rebecca Springer courageously and faithfully penned this account of her own passing \\"into the light","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CTQuAAAACAAJ&dq=Into+the+Light,+My+Dream+of+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eat Well, Stay Well With Parkinson's disease","description":"Designed for people with Parkinson's, carers and health professionals.

However, Nelson s apprehensions over French ambitions in the East are more than justified. Edouard Santhonax, Drinkwater s old enemy, is already preparing for a French descent on India. The hunt for this elusive Frenchman and his frigate is combined with British naval operations on the flank of Napoleon s Egyptian campaign. It is during the attack on Kosseir that Drinkwater is left for dead. His escape and the subsequent desperate attack on Santhonax leads to a still more dangerous situation under Augustus Morris, former tyrant of the midshipmen s berth on HMS Cyclops. Drinkwater s fight to bring a half-armed ship safely to the cape of Good Hope is beset with personal enmity, the activity of the French and the violence of the sea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mHuBDQAAQBAJ&dq=A+Brig+of+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speed-Walk And Other Stories (Pitt Drue Heinz Lit Prize)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reform","description":"For Massimo Faggioli, the debate about the meaning of Vatican II too often misses the profound significance of that council's first and perhaps most consequential document, Sacrosanctum Concilium.

Artie is handsome, athletic, and popular, but he possesses a hidden, powerful sadistic streak and a desire to dominate. Judd is a weedy introvert, a genius who longs for a companion whom he can idolize and worship. Obsessed with Nietzsche s idea of the superhuman, both boys decide to prove that they are above the laws of man by arbitrarily picking and murdering a Jewish boy in their neighborhood.

Together, his Paris Diary, first published in 1966, and The New York Diary,which followed a year later, paint a colorful landscape of Rorem s world and its famous inhabitants, as well as a fascinating self-portrait of a footloose young artist unabashedly drinking deeply of life. In this amalgam of forthright personal reflections and cogent social commentary, unprecedented for its time, Rorem s anecdotal recollections of the decade from 1951 to 1961 represent Gay Liberation in its infancy as the author freely expresses his open sexuality not as a revelation but as a simple fact of life. At once blisteringly honest and exquisitely entertaining, Rorem s diaries expound brilliantly on the creative process, following their peripatetic author from Paris to Morocco to Italy and back home to America as he crosses paths with Picasso, Cocteau, Gide, Boulez, and other luminaries of the era. With consummate skill and unexpurgated insight, a younger, wilder Rorem reflects on a bygone time and culture and, in doing so, holds a revealing mirror to himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JfZsotZGARQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild at Heart","description":"John Eldredge revises and updates his best-selling, renowned Christian classic.

An extraordinary parable of the corruption of the flesh and spirit, The Good Doctor has inspired enthusiastic interest around the world and has assured Damon Galgut s place as a major international talent. When Laurence Waters arrives at his new post at a deserted rural hospital, staff physician Frank Eloff is instantly suspicious. Laurence is everything Frank is not young, optimistic and full of big ideas. The whole town is beset with new arrivals and the return of old faces. Frank reestablishes a liaison with a woman, one that will have unexpected consequences. A self-made dictator from apartheid days is rumored to be active in cross-border smuggling, and a group of soldiers has moved in to track him, led by a man from Frank s own dark past. Laurence sees only possibilities but in a world where the past is demanding restitution from the present, his ill-starred idealism cannot last.

Police literature and statistics concerning the deaths of police officers on patrol are reviewed, and possible reasons for the increasing number of assaults on police are explored. Eleven safety rules for police working on mobile assignments cover such areas as approach, stopping known wanted criminals, pursuit, communication, and use of weapons. The bulk of the text is devoted to nine separate incidents in which patrol officers were killed. Each history presents a description of the situation surrounding the crime scene and the officer's death, elaborates and charts the time framework, includes illustrations of the crime scene, and provides questionnaires and work assignments to provoke student discussion on the conduct of the officers involved and on possible alternative conduct which could have prevented their deaths. Finally, brief scenarios of actual events that resulted in the death of law enforcement personnel are included. Each scenario is accompanied by questions designed to stimulate thinking on alternative preventive actions. Sample general orders offering guidelines on pursuit policies and management and on arrests and transportation of arrestees are appended. Eight footnotes accompany the introductory chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EMfyAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Deadly+Routine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Lighten The Heavy Load of Fibromyalgia","description":"Life details and outline of FIBROGA program.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lJO_AAAACAAJ&dq=How+To+Lighten+The+Heavy+Load+of+Fibromyalgia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Short Stories of W.

This volume is the first significant look at the organizations that emerged in the late 1960s to promote Puerto Rican independence and the radical transformation of U.S. society. The Puerto Rican movement was a response to U.S. colonialism on the island and to the poverty and discrimination faced by most Puerto Ricans on the mainland. This anthology looks at the organizations that emerged to combat these two problems in such places as Boston, Chicago, Hartford, New York, and Philadelphia. Almost all the contributors worked with the organizations they describe. Interviews with such key figures as Elizam Escobar, Piri Thomas, and Luis Fuentes, as well as accounts by people active in the gay/lesbian, African American, and white Left movements, create a vivid picture of why and how people became radicalized and how their ideals intersected with their group's own dynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XKJtYNvKKrgC&dq=The+Puerto+Rican+Movement:+Voices+from+the+Diaspora+(Puerto+Rican+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through Russia on a mustang","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chance;: A tale in two parts (His Complete works)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kuiBzgEACAAJ&dq=Chance%3B:+A+tale+in+two+parts+(His+Complete+works)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nine Months & Counting: Bible Promises/Bright Ideas f/Pregnancy and After","description":"Join a family of three who spend nine whole months waiting, from a frosty winter through a sun-dappled summer, until finally . . . a baby is here.

In this book, Jocelyne Cesari investigates the relationship between modernization, politics, and Islam in Muslim-majority countries such as Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey - countries that were founded by secular rulers and have since undergone secularized politics. Cesari argues that nation-building processes in these states have not created liberal democracies in the Western mold, but have instead spurred the politicization of Islam by turning it into a modern national ideology. Looking closely at examples of Islamic dominance in political modernization, this study provides a unique overview of the historical and political developments from the end of World War II to the Arab Spring that have made Islam the dominant force in the construction of the modern states, and discusses Islam's impact on emerging democracies in the contemporary Middle East.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WgFeAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Do Everything with JavaScript","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"George Washington,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Building the Talent Edge: A Manager's Guide to Recruiting the Best","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Construction of Communalism in Colonial North India","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aditi and the one-eyed monkey","description":"Accompanied by an elephant, an ant, and a one-eyed monkey, Princess Aditi goes on a magical journey in search of a wayward dragon who holds the key to her future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xe_WUB9Wv8AC&dq=Aditi+and+the+one-eyed+monkey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Discover Your Purpose in 10 Days 10-CDs, Plus 2-Bonus CD System","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sPRUAAAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Discover+Your+Purpose+in+10+Days+10-CDs,+Plus+2-Bonus+CD+System&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smythe Sewn Fantastic Felines Santa Fe Felines Lined (Smythe Sewn Laurel Burch)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eod-wgEACAAJ&dq=Smythe+Sewn+Fantastic+Felines+Santa+Fe+Felines+Lined+(Smythe+Sewn+Laurel+Burch)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse heaven hill (Great Western Edition [58])","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Powhatan's World and Colonial Virginia: A Conflict of Cultures (Studies in the Anthropology of North Ame)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Professional Machine Quilting: The Complete Guide to Running a Successful Quilting Business","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Last Patrician: Bobby Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Neurological Anatomy: in relation to clinical medicine","description":"\\"The definitive treatise in neuroanatomy\\"* \\"Indispensable to ... everyone entrusted with teaching anatomy, physiology, pathology, or diseases of the nervous system.\\"--*Annals of Neurology \\"Deserves to be on the bookshelf of every scientist and clinician who deals with the structure of thenervous system.\\"--Journal of Neurosurgery","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wa1qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Neurological+Anatomy:+in+relation+to+clinical+medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fourteen Bears in Summer and Winter (Deluxe Golden Book)","description":"A bear family amuses itself with summer and winter activities such as walking, swimming, making snowmen, and decorating trees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=baHbGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Fourteen+Bears+in+Summer+and+Winter+(Deluxe+Golden+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great Constitution: A book for young Americans","description":"This book gives all the color and the truth and the nobility of the Constitutional Convention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbVXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+great+Constitution:+A+book+for+young+Americans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rosicrucians,: Their rites and mysteries","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Five on a Secret Trail (Galaxy Children's Large Print)","description":"Four friends and an injured dog witness some strange occurences while camping on a desolate common near an abandoned house.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7FICAAAACAAJ&dq=Five+on+a+Secret+Trail+(Galaxy+Children%27s+Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Computing in the Twentieth Century","description":"History of Computing in the Twentieth Century","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AsvSBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"hottest blood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Corel Photo-Pain 8 for Power Macintosh, The Official Guide","description":"Corel PHOTO-PAINT 8 for Power Macintosh.

Do narratives such as the Eden story explain that dissymmetry or contribute to it? This book suggests that the Hebrew Bible began and has sustained a rich conversation about sex and gender throughout its life. A literary study of the Garden of Eden story reveals a focus on the human partnership as integral to the divine creation project. Texts from other Hebrew Bible genres build a picture of robust and flexible partnerships within a patriarchal framework. In popular culture, Eve still carries the stench of guilt while Adam, seemingly unscathed by Eden events, remains a positive symbol of manhood. This book helps explain why they have had such different histories. The book also charts the subversive alternate streams of interpretation of women's writings and rabbinic texts. The story of Adam and Eve demonstrates how conceptions of gender in both ancient and modern worlds reflect larger philosophical schemes. Far from existing as timeless verities, female and male relations are constructed according to cultural imperatives of the day. Understanding the different ways that Adam and Eve have been conceived gives us perspective on our own twenty-first century gender architecture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A5RZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethics for Professionals in a Multicultural World","description":"Written in an easily accessible, non-threatening presentation, Ethics for the Multicultural World offers clear explanation of how philosophical ethics has historically evolved as a response to muddle and banal moral decisions based on confusion caused by the plurality of ethical and moral beliefs.

While Kliuchevsky is critical of Catherine, he draws upon her memoirs and other writings and the accounts of her contemporaries to achieve a well-rounded and deeply human analysis of her character and personality. It is an extraordinary act of historical re-creation of the sort that brought Kliuchevsky such renown in his own time, and it remains so lifelike that it fairly leaps off the page. Kliuchevsky's examination of Western influence in Catherine's reign leads him to questions that were of urgent significance for Russia's development in his own day, and have remained so ever since: how to use Western ideas and practices to improve and enrich Russian life, without turning them into idle fashions or political bludgeons, and where to find the social leadership capable of performing such a delicate task.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o6pzCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Iceland Country Map (Rough Guide City Maps)","description":"The Rough Guide to Iceland is the ultimate guidebook to one of Europe's most exciting destinations.

The most malignant of these has been the unprecedented rise, since 1987, in crimes of violence against the person, especially among juveniles. Using their own official statistics, author Oliver James demonstrates that Home Office claims that violence has not been growing are false. Public debates about violence tend to centre on single-cause explanations, such as moral fecklessness, single parenting, depictions of violence in films and videos, and even genetics. If their is a single-cause, argues author Oliver James, it is to be found in the far more complex issue of inequality. Since the 1980s, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. There is less welfare and worse welfare for the disadvantaged. Furthermore, a winner-loser culture has emerged, with the disadvantaged deemed the 'losers'. James proposes a 'lagged' theory of violence causation. He demonstrates that the rise in numbers of low income families in the early 1980s caused another rise from the late 1980s onwards: violence against the person. Separating the evidence concerning the causes of violence from that concerned with criminality in general, James links trends in social, familial and economic deprivation to show how inequality provides a breeding ground for violence, historically and cross-nationally.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ijRHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Juvenile+Violence+in+A+Winner-Loser+Culture:+Socio-Economic+and+Familial+Origins+of+the+Rise+of+Violence+Against+the+Person&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mannerheim, Marshal of Finland (Nordic Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2rZKG6OTC0QC&dq=Mannerheim,+Marshal+of+Finland+(Nordic+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economics as an Art of Thought: Essays in Memory of G.L.S.

Reconsidering the genesis, inception and reception of these crucial chapters of Decline and Fall, Pocock explores the response of Gibbon's critics, affirming that his reputation as an unbeliever was established before his history of the Church had been written. The magnitude of Barbarism and Religion is already apparent.

Bohannon argues here that cities and natural environments, however, are both connected and continually affected by one another. He shows how such connections become overt during natural disasters, which disrupt the narratives people use to make sense of the world,including especially religious narratives, and make them more visible. This book offers both a theoretical exploration of the intersection of the city, nature, and religion, as well as a sociological analysis of the 1997 flood in Grand Forks, ND, USA. This case study shows how religious factors have influenced how the relationship between nature and the city is perceived, and in particular have helped to justify the urban control of nature. The narratives found in Grand Forks also reveal a broader understanding of the nature of Western cities, highlighting the potent and ethically-rich intersections between religion, cities and nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1uquLKD-PJoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living With Grief: After Sudden Loss Suicide, Homicide, Accident, Heart Attack, Stroke","description":"First published in 1996.

John Sheriff analyzes the treatment of determinate meaning and contends that as long as we cling to a notion of language that begins with Saussure's dyadic definition of signs, meaning cannot be treated as such any more than can essence or presence. Asserting that Peirce's less familiar position offers a way out of this difficulty, Sheriff first discusses the Saussurean-based theory of meaning and then argues for the advantages of the radically different triadic theory developed by Peirce. Part One of the work reviews and critiques the treatment of meaning in works by Jonathan Culler, Tzvetan Todorov, Stanley Fish, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Derrida, among others. The focus of this section is on the treatment of meaning in structural and post-structural theories and their common basis in Saussurean linguistics. Part Two provides a readable introduction to Peirce's general theory of signs and develops comprehensively the implications of his semiotic. The substitution of his theory for Saussure's opens our eyes to new and cogent answers to many questions relevant to the meaning of texts. Originally published in 1989.

In 1930s Brooklyn, there lived a breed of men who now exist only in legend and in the memories of a few old-timers: Jewish gangsters, fearless thugs with nicknames like Kid Twist Reles and Pittsburgh Phil Strauss. Growing up in Brownsville, they made their way from street fights to underworld power, becoming the execution squad for a national crime syndicate. Murder Inc. did for organized crime what Henry Ford did for the automobile, and Tough Jews is the first in-depth portrait of these men, a thrilling glimpse at the muscle that made possible the success of gangster statesmen such as Bugsy Siegel, Meyer Lansky, and Lucky Luciano. For Rich Cohen, who grew up in suburban Illinois in the 1980s taunted by the stereotype of Jews as book-reading rule followers, the very idea of the Jewish gangster was a relief; for once, a Jew in jail did not have to be a white collar criminal. With a clear eye and a comic sensibility, Cohen looks beyond the blood and ultimately encounters each of these ruthless killers  matzo-ball heart. Tough Jews shows what can happen when a member of the tribe combines brains, heart, and a dangerous determination never to back down.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MwgscCNtqHYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Building Construction: Materials and Methods","description":"An introduction to the art of building, it has been revised and updated to reflect changes in the industry.

But after repeatedly allowing Japan - our closest ally in Asia - to mislead us intellectually and psychologically, how well are we prepared to deal with less friendly emerging powers like China and India? Based on three decades of on-the-spot observation and participation in Japan, Ivan Hall's provocative work draws the reader into a world of intellectual manipulation and gullibility, false images, emotional blackmail, financial beguilement, and fatuous expectations. It illuminates the many ways that American ideological hubris and Japanese pleading for special treatment combine to deprive our trans-Pacific dialogue of the honesty, openness, and plain common sense of our trans-Atlantic intellectual ties with Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RJYYDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyewitness Travel Guide to Delhi, Agra and Jaipur","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Womanspirit Rising: Feminist Reader in Religion (Harper forum books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My First Prayers All Things Wise Board","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Echoes in the Air: A Chronicle of Aeronautical Ghost Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conversations with Capote","description":"Extraordinary conversations with the writer and celebrity who elevated talk to art and gossip to literature","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nQ1O4q9elfAC&dq=Conversations+with+Capote&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crooked House (King's Daggers)","description":"Sir Stalwart and Emerald set off for an ancient lord's house known as Smealey Hall, where they believe the source of evil--in the form of murder--lies, and along the way they are joined by Badger, a Blade-in-training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XYwOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Crooked+House+(King%27s+Daggers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters of the South Wind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Luke's Thrilling Gospel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hot Fudge Hero","description":"In each of three episodes which involve either an unfriendly neighbor, his sister, or his mom, Bertie succeeds in being rewarded with his favorite, a hot fudge sundae.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjL_YpVGoucC&dq=Hot+Fudge+Hero&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rebirth of History: Eastern Europe in the Age of Democracy; 2nd Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gangsta Rap (Teen's Top 10 (Awards))","description":"When teenage Ray and his two friends, Prem and Tyronne, form a successful rap band in the London's East End where they live, they soon find themselves embroiled in increasingly violent gang warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y430VUBxjIoC&dq=Gangsta+Rap+(Teen%27s+Top+10+(Awards))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People Could Fly-Pkg","description":"In this retelling of a folktale, a group of slaves, unable to bear their sadness and starvation any longer, calls upon the African magic that allows them to fly away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RdMmEAAAQBAJ&dq=People+Could+Fly-Pkg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Vocabulary (Barron's Pocket Guides)","description":"This fast-reference word finder and vocabulary guide alphabetically lists more than 3,000 words with definitions and sample sentences.

The story unfolds on a classic Krantz background, a magic carpet of gorgeous entertainment and sumptuous events. Yet, at its core, The Jewels of Tessa Kent is an engrossing, deeply moving, and ultimately inspiring tale of two women bound by blood yet torn apart by their deepest emotions. Tessa Kent, an exquisite and precocious fourteen, gives birth to an illegitimate daughter. Her parents, devout Catholics, raise the infant, Maggie, as their own child. At sixteen Tessa is discovered by Hollywood; by nineteen she's an international movie star. Maggie lives for her glorious \\"sister's\\" infrequent whirlwind visits. Maggie is a captivating, independent eighteen when she accidentally learns the truth. Mortally wounded, she breaks all ties with Tessa and starts to work at the famed Manhattan auction house of Scott & Scott. Five years later, a life-altering crisis makes Tessa passionately determined to end this estrangement. An auction is the only way she can find to reach her daughter, an auction of the immensely valuable collection of famed jewels that represent all the love lavished on her by her late husband. Tessa promises Scott & Scott the auction on the condition that Maggie and she work closely together on the sale. For Tessa, her entire future now hangs on the hope of an almost impossible reconciliation. The Jewels of Tessa Kent deals with the fascinating workings of an auction house; it's a revealing look at the inside of Hollywood stardom; but more than anything else, it's a story of feelings and family, of loss, mistakes, joy and redemption.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dcQ3QqE7RnUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The young colonists;: A story of the Zulu and Boer Wars","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uqS3DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listening with the third ear;: The inner experience of a psychoanalyst","description":"Case histories are used to show that a psychoanalyst's ability to understand and relate to his patients reflects his skills of self-observation and self-analysis","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=huDPm9jilOsC&dq=Listening+with+the+third+ear%3B:+The+inner+experience+of+a+psychoanalyst&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A thousand clowns ; Thieves ; The goodbye people","description":"A THOUSAND CLOWNS: Murray Burns (formerly of the Chuckles the Chipmunk show) and his precocious nephew Nick, have a far from humdrum life together- until two social workers come to investigate.

Novel high-performance marine vehicles, such as the air cushion vehicle (ACV), surface effect ship (SES), high-speed monohull craft (MHC), catamaran (CAT), hydrofoil craft (HYC), wave-piercing craft (WPC) and small water area twin hull craft (SWATH) have all developed as concepts, achieving varying degrees of commercial and military success. Prototype ACV and SES have achieved speeds of 100 knots in at calm con- tions; however, the normal cruising speed for commercial operations has remained around 3550 knots. This is partly due to increased drag in an average coastal s- way where such craft operate services and partly due to limitations of the propulsion systems for such craft. Water jets and water propellers face limitations due to c- itation at high speed, for example. SWATH are designed for reduced motions in a seaway, but the hull form is not a low drag form suitable for high-speed operation. So that seems to lead to a problem  maintain water contact and either water propulsion systems run out of power or craft motions and speed loss are a problem in higher seastates. The only way to higher speed would appear to be to disconnect completely from the water surface. You, the reader, might respond with a question about racing hydroplanes, which manage speeds of above 200 kph. Yes, true, but the power-to-weight ratio is extremely high on such racing machines and not economic if translated into a useful commercial vessel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oAXEphDmmEMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiny Alice","description":"THE STORY: TINY ALICE begins with a venomous exchange between a lawyer and a cardinal whose contempt for each other careens back to their school days.

It is a book about authority: about how Christian truth is validated, and the means by which the institutional Church can resist the intrusion of error into its understanding of faith. What Anglicanism notably lacks, he believes, is a coherent basis of authority, a doctrine of the Church itself. It has, in consequence - and despite its seeming traditionalism - more of the qualities of a religious society than of a Church, and this is due to imperfectly addressing fundamental questions about its source of authority at the time of the Reformation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8vewAEACAAJ&dq=Anglican+Difficulties:+A+New+Syllabus+of+Errors+(Contemporary+Church+Issues)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swahili (Teach Yourself)","description":"Are you looking for a complete course in Swahili which takes you effortlessly from beginner to confident speaker?

In the summer of 1965, Harvey, a lifelong resident of Long Beach, New York, met two people who would make a profound impact on his life: Ellen Laufer and her seven-year-old son, Ricky, who had been born with cerebral palsy and was severely disabled. That day at the Coral Reef Beach Club in Lido Beach, where Harvey worked as a lifeguard, was the beginning of a love story that continues to this day. Not only did Harvey fall in love with Ellen, he also fell in love with Ricky, who introduced him to the challenges of both children with special needs and their families. Through this relationship, Harvey found his life s mission. For the Love of a Child tells the story of the people who inspired Harvey early on, as well as the City of Long Beach, which greatly influenced his life in public service. He held office for thirty-eight years, thirteen as a council member in Long Beach and twenty-five in Albany as a state assemblyman. During this time, he worked with and in some cases, bumped heads with five New York governors. As a legislator, Harvey s priorities were always for the people, not political agendas, as his story shows. Harvey knows first hand that children with special needs are filled with unconditional love. God gave him an angel in Ricky, a saint in Ellen, and, thanks to both, a mission that allowed him to spend his life making sure that children like Ricky and their families are given the best quality of life. Through his story, Harvey shares the important work he did, the challenges he met, and the life-changing experiences he has had along the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ISisDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"21st Century Complete Guide to the Gulf War, Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, from the Invasion by Iraq and Saddam Hussein to the Liberation ... with Declassified Military and CIA Files","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Rose City and Other Stories","description":"Written with understanding and familiarity, these seven stories present characters who are coming into their own as they discover and rediscover themselves.

Unfortunately, as anyone who deals with psychological reports knows, this is almost never the case. Extensive research has shown that with most psychologist's reports, there is a dangerously wide gap between author intent and reader interpretation. Since the quality of clinical reports can have a direct bearing on the quality of care a client receives  especially in an age of managed care  it is essential that psychologists arm themselves with a systematic approach to creating reports that in structure, content, and style have the utmost clarity, thoroughness, and utility. Psychological Reports, Third Edition, provides them with such an approach. The book begins with a theory-based analysis of report-writing problems, which is then used to construct a framework for identifying and correcting them. A valuable working resource for practicing psychologists and psychotherapists, Psychological Reports, Third Edition, is also must reading for students and psychologists-in-training.

Robert M. Geraci argues that virtual worlds and video games have become a locus for the satisfaction of religious needs, providing many users with devoted communities, opportunities for ethical reflection, a meaningful experience of history and human activity, and a sense of transcendence. Using interviews, surveys, and his own first-hand experience within the virtual worlds, Geraci shows how World of Warcraft and Second Life provide participants with the opportunity to rethink what it means to be religious in the contemporary world. Not all participants use virtual worlds for religious purposes, but many online residents use them to rearrange or replace religious practice as designers and users collaborate in the production of a new spiritual marketplace. Using World of Warcraft and Second Life as case studies, this book shows that many residents now use virtual worlds to re-imagine their traditions and work to restore them to \\"authentic\\" sanctity, or else replace religious institutions with virtual communities that provide meaning and purpose to human life. For some online residents, virtual worlds are even keys to a post-human future where technology can help us transcend mortal life. Geraci argues that World of Warcraft and Second Life are \\"virtually sacred\\" because they do religious work. They often do such work without regard for-and frequently in conflict with-traditional religious institutions and practices; ultimately they participate in our sacred landscape as outsiders, competitors, and collaborators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XBWeAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Special Little Girl: Incest in a Christian Home","description":"\\"Is it possible to describe the confusion and shame I felt every time daddy came to my bedroom and used me to fulfill his sexual perversion?

The Black Death was a human tragedy that abruptly halved entire populations and caused untold suffering, but it also brought about a cultural and economic renewal on a scale never before witnessed. The World the Plague Made is a panoramic history of how the bubonic plague revolutionized labour, trade, and technology and set the stage for Europe s global expansion. James Belich takes readers across centuries and continents to shed new light on one of history s greatest paradoxes. Why did Europe s dramatic rise begin in the wake of the Black Death? Belich shows how plague doubled the per capita endowment of everything even as it decimated the population. Many more people had disposable incomes. Demand grew for silks, sugar, spices, furs, gold, and slaves. Europe expanded to satisfy that demand and plague provided the means. Labour scarcity drove more use of waterpower, wind power, and gunpowder. Technologies like water-powered blast furnaces, heavily gunned galleons, and musketry were fast-tracked by plague. A new  crew culture  of  disposable males  emerged to man the guns and galleons. Setting the rise of Western Europe in global context, Belich demonstrates how the mighty empires of the Middle East and Russia also flourished after the plague, and how European expansion was deeply entangled with the Chinese and other peoples throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FStaEAAAQBAJ&dq=THE+BLACK+DEATH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design and Analysis of Clinical Experiments (Wiley Classics Library)","description":"First published in 1986, this unique reference to clinical experimentation remains just as relevant today.

It retells, in language accessible to children, the stories of twenty of Shakespeare's plays. Tales from Shakespeare is an English children's book written by Charles Lamb and his sister Mary Lamb in 1807. The book is designed to make the stories of Shakespeare's plays familiar to the young. However, as noted in the authors' Preface, \\"[Shakespeare's] words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided.\\" Mary Lamb was responsible for the comedies, while Charles wrote the tragedies; they wrote the preface between them.... Charles Lamb (10 February 1775 - 27 December 1834) was an English essayist, poet, and antiquarian, best known for his Essays of Elia and for the children's book Tales from Shakespeare, co-authored with his sister, Mary Lamb (1764-1847). Friends with such literary luminaries as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and William Hazlitt, Lamb was at the center of a major literary circle in England. He has been referred to by E. V. Lucas, his principal biographer, as \\"the most lovable figure in English literature.\\" Lamb was born in London, the son of Elizabeth Field and John Lamb. Lamb was the youngest child, with a sister 11 years older named Mary and an even older brother named John; there were four others who did not survive infancy. His father John Lamb was a lawyer's clerk and spent most of his professional life as the assistant to a barrister named Samuel Salt, who lived in the Inner Temple in the legal district of London. It was there in Crown Office Row that Charles Lamb was born and spent his youth. Lamb created a portrait of his father in his \\"Elia on the Old Benchers\\" under the name Lovel. Lamb's older brother was too much his senior to be a youthful companion to the boy but his sister Mary, being born eleven years before him, was probably his closest playmate. Lamb was also cared for by his paternal aunt Hetty, who seems to have had a particular fondness for him. A number of writings by both Charles and Mary suggest that the conflict between Aunt Hetty and her sister-in-law created a certain degree of tension in the Lamb household. However, Charles speaks fondly of her and her presence in the house seems to have brought a great deal of comfort to him..... Mary Ann Lamb (3 December 1764 - 20 May 1847), was an English writer. She is best known for the collaboration with her brother Charles on the collection Tales from Shakespeare. Lamb suffered from mental illness, and in 1796 she stabbed her mother to death during a mental breakdown. She was confined to mental facilities off and on for most of her life. She and Charles presided over a literary circle in London that included the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, among others....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a8u9swEACAAJ&dq=Shakespeare%27s+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy Does It For Spring (Art To Heart #520B)","description":"This delightful book offers a wide and enticing range of gorgeous designs and scenes for you to color in and make your own.

One of the first military engagements in World War II, the battle for this tiny, strategically located atoll in the Pacific began on December 8, 1941, just five hours after Japan s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. It ended on December 23, when the marines despite diminished forces, incapacitated fighter planes, and no communications strove to stem an overwhelming Japanese invasion until their commanding officers ordered them to surrender. No sooner had the surviving marines the author s eighteen-year-old brother among them laid down their arms than they were stripped and bound. For two days they sat naked in the hot sun; at night they shivered in the cold. For the next three weeks they slogged in the ruins of their bombed-out camp. They were then jammed into the hold of the ship that would take them to prison camps in China and Japan, where they would endure the cruelest indignities and grimmest tortures until their liberation in August 1945. Hell Wouldn t Stop tells their often horrific, frequently heroic, and unforgettable if long-forgotten World War II story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=acrkGwAACAAJ&dq=Hell+Wouldn%27t+Stop:+An+Oral+History+of+the+Battle+of+Wake+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milo's Trip to the Museum With Grandpa","description":"When the exhibits come to life an afternoon visit to the museum becomes the adventure of a lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z_NQAAAACAAJ&dq=Milo%27s+Trip+to+the+Museum+With+Grandpa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Rising","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Matthew, a Commentary: The Churchbook, Matthew 13-28","description":"Drawing on great church teachers through the centuries and on the classical Christian creeds and confessions, this book asks both what Matthew's Gospel said to its first hearers and what it says to readers today.

He was also prone to vanity and self-pity, and sensitive to what he perceived as slights, or attacks on his reputation or character. He also had a lust for fame, as did many involved in the founding of this nation. But if fame was the spur, it was also the driving force be-hind Adams  enormous energy, energy guided by a strong sense of honor and duty that was built into his character and stayed with him his whole life. Adams was a realist, with a profound sense of what people en masse are all about. He seems to have drawn that knowledge from his understanding of himself. He knew that each of us has the capacity for good or evil, and the gov-ernment of checks and balances he envisioned for the new nation they were building took this into account. Victory in the long struggle for freedom was certainly not assured. Many were Tories who wished to continue as British subjects. Many cared, but not enough to fight for the cause. We can be thankful for those who did, who initiated and carried on the War for In-dependence. Among them were the best and brightest the colonies had to offer. These were the people who tendered their lives, property, and sacred honor as collateral in the struggle for freedom.

The Berlin blockade (24 June 1948;12 May 1949) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War. During the multinational occupation of postWorld War II Germany, the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies  railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under allied control. The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutschmark from West Berlin. In response, the Western Allies organised the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin. Aircrews from the United States Air Force, the British Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year, providing up to 8,893 tons of necessities daily, such as fuel and food, to the Berliners. Neither side wanted a war; the Soviets did not disrupt the airlift. By the spring of 1949 the airlift was clearly succeeding, and by April it was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail. On 11 May 1949, the USSR lifted the blockade of West Berlin. The Berlin Crisis of 19481949 served to highlight competing ideological and economic visions for post-war Europe, particularly Germany. The clash ultimately led to the division of that country into East and West and to the division of Berlin itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uLhvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geography Club","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lorna Doone","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mystery of Runes","description":"From an acclaimed new master of fantasy fiction comes Book Four in the continuing saga of magic, adventure, courage, and fate on parallel worldsmystical Eldh and modern Earth.

This classic book, first published in 1991, was one of the first to propose the  embodied cognition  approach in cognitive science. It pioneered the connections between phenomenology and science and between Buddhist practices and science claims that have since become highly influential. Through this cross-fertilization of disparate fields of study, The Embodied Mind introduced a new form of cognitive science called  enaction,  in which both the environment and first person experience are aspects of embodiment. However, enactive embodiment is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a brain, a mind, or a self; rather it is the bringing forth of an interdependent world in and through embodied action. Although enacted cognition lacks an absolute foundation, the book shows how that does not lead to either experiential or philosophical nihilism. Above all, the book's arguments were powered by the conviction that the sciences of mind must encompass lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience. This revised edition includes substantive introductions by Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch that clarify central arguments of the work and discuss and evaluate subsequent research that has expanded on the themes of the book, including the renewed theoretical and practical interest in Buddhism and mindfulness. A preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the originator of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, contextualizes the book and describes its influence on his life and work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gzLaDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Embodied+Mind:+Cognitive+Science+and+Human+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens More from Your Wok","description":"Recipes for easy-to-prepare main dishes, accompaniments, and desserts accompany tips on meal planning and and nutrition and data on stocking the kitchen","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IV8PDMJ1pOoC&dq=Better+Homes+and+Gardens+More+from+Your+Wok&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start and Run a Profitable Secondhand Store (Self-Counsel Business Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Personally yours, needlepoint","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q41swSIEDL4C&dq=Personally+yours,+needlepoint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Borderless Borders: U.S. Latinos, Latin Americans, and the Paradox of Interdependence","description":"This book brings together some of the most prominent scholars working across the spectrum of Latin American and Latino studies to explore their changing intellectual undertaking in relation to global processes of change.

The prototype flew in 1977, but it was not until the mid-1980s that production began in Khar'kov. The baseline military airlifter soon spawned a wide selection of derivatives. First was the An-74; originally conceived as a specialized version for Arctic and Antarctic support, it entered production as an ordinary civil transport. Concerted efforts by the Antonov OKB to enhance the capabilities of the An-72/An-74 family led to the development of the An-72P armed border patrol version, the convertible cargo/passenger An-747T and An-74TK, the An-74S flying hospital and the radically redesigned An-74TK-300 with engines on underwing pylons - an arrangement which improved the all-important economic efficiency. The most intriguing An-72 derivative was the unorthodox An-71 AEW aircraft; originally meant for shipboard operations, it was prevented from entering production by the political and economic situation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_tsJAQAAMAAJ&dq=Sukhoi+Interceptors+-+Red+Star+Vol.+16&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Wonders: Encounters With the Astonishing World Around Us","description":"In 30 essays--filled with anecdotes and illustrations--Evans takes such commonplace concepts as gravity, water, and breath and turns them into delightfully documented adventures.

A Swedish proverb speaks of placing the church in the middle of the village, and that is precisely what Nilsson has here done. Homer and Hesiod formed the basis of the traditional education of the Greeks in general, and the great gods and goddesses as they appear in art show at all times the formative influence of the epic tradition. Nevertheless, the hard core of Greek religion is to be found in its observances: these took their shape among men whose focus was first the hearth and then the city-state, men moreover whose life and livelihood were tied to crops and herds and the annual cycle of nature.\\" Arthur Darby Nock, from the Foreword Martin Nilsson writes about the popular religious observances of the Greeks, as practiced both earlier in the twentieth century and in classical times, the agricultural festivals and customs, the rituals of family and society. The folk religions of Greece that underlay and continually erupted into the more \\"elevated\\" Olympian mythology of Homer and Hesiod are explained in detail by a scholar with unparalleled understanding of the rites and customs of rural life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UwnGYe8WiCUC&dq=Greek+folk+religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Cross and Resurrection: A Theology of Holy Saturday","description":"For much of Christian history the church has given no place to Holy Saturday in its liturgy or worship. Yet the space dividing Calvary and the Garden may be the best place from which to reflect on the meaning of Christ's death and resurrection. This superb work by the late Alan Lewis develops on a grand scale and in great detail a theology of Holy Saturday.The first comprehensive theology of Holy Saturday ever written, Between Cross and Resurrectionshows that at the center of the biblical story and the church's creed lies a three-day narrative. Lewis explores the meaning of Holy Saturday -- the restless day of burial and waiting -- from the perspectives of narrative (hearing the story), doctrine (thinking the story), and ethics (living the story). Along the way he visits as many spiritual themes as possible in order to demonstrate the range of topics that take on fresh meaning when viewed from the vantage point of Holy Saturday.Between Cross and Resurrection is not only incisive and elegantly written, but it is also a uniquely moving work deeply rooted in Christian experience. While writing this book Lewis experienced his own Holy Saturday in suffering from and finally succumbing to cancer. He considered Between Cross and Resurrection to be the culmination of his life's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TilcK5t72s0C&dq=Between+Cross+and+Resurrection:+A+Theology+of+Holy+Saturday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"N By E","description":"When artist, illustrator, writer, and adventurer Rockwell Kent first published N by E in a limited edition in 1930, his account of a voyage on a 33-foot cutter from New York Harbor to the rugged shores of Greenland quickly became a collectors' item. Little wonder, for readers are immediately drawn to Kent's vivid descriptions of the experience; we share \\"the feeling of wind and wet and cold, of lifting seas and steep descents, of rolling over as the wind gusts hit,\\" and the sound \\"of wind in the shrouds, of hard spray flung on a drum-tight canvas, of rushing water at the scuppers, of the gale shearing a tormented sea.\\" When the ship sinks in a storm-swept fjord within 50 miles of its destination, the story turns to the stranding and subsequent rescue of the three-man crew, salvage of the vessel, and life among native Greenlanders. Magnificently illustrated by Kent's wood-block prints and narrated in his poetic and highly entertaining style, this tale of the perils of killer nor'easters, treacherous icebergs, and impenetrable fog -- and the joys of sperm whales breaching or dawn unmasking a longed-for landfall -- is a rare treat for old salts and landlubbers alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lB1XE29hSgoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation & Theme Parks","description":"Offers a chronologically arranged look at the thirty animated Disney films, as well as the development and growth of the Disney industry and theme parks","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s7Wc6CVOxgkC&dq=Mouse+Under+Glass:+Secrets+of+Disney+Animation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Cousins or The Aunt-Hill","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Building a Lemonade Stand is Not Just For Kids Anymore: Entrepreneurial traits and resources for developing a business","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Signing Naturally: Teacher's Curriculum Guide - Level One (Vista Curriculum Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qoU4mQEACAAJ&dq=Signing+Naturally:+Teacher%27s+Curriculum+Guide+-+Level+One+(Vista+Curriculum+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Stress: Theoretical and Clinical Aspects.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QARAQAAIAAJ&dq=Handbook+of+Stress:+Theoretical+and+Clinical+Aspects.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Pacific Northwest: Including Oregon, Washington, Vancouver, Victoria, and Coastal British Columbia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Decay of the Angel","description":"The dramatic climax of the SEA OF FERTILITY, bringing together the dominant themes of the three previous novels; the decay of Japan's courtly tradition and samurai ideal, and the essence and value of Buddhist philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sAEQAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Decay+of+the+Angel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SOMETHING WARM FROM OVEN","description":"A trove of classic recipes from the New York Times bestselling novelist Eileen Goudge One of six children, Eileen Goudge learned to bake at an early age, inspired by her mother, who made everything from scratch and baked all her own bread.

Those who would fight freedom's enemies, from political correctness to corporate intimidation to outright censorship, face powerful adversaries. But they also have a potent weapon at their disposal: good, old-fashioned talk--tough talk. And as one of America's leading First Amendment attorneys, Martin Garbus is one of the toughest talkers there is. Starting with his work on the tam that defended the legendary satirist Lenny Bruce against obscenity charges, Garbus has been a fearless advocate for some of the most important voices of our time, among them union organizer Cesar Chavez, actor Robert Redford, director Spike Lee, writer Samuel Beckett, Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, and Czech playwright Vaclav Havel, who, as president of his country's revolutionary government, invited Garbus to help write the nation's constitution. But Garbus is not an ivory-tower theoretician. He is a highly effective defense lawyer who takes on cases with the full intent of winning. In Tough Talk, Garbus goes behind the scenes to show us how our system really works and what he does to make it work for his clients. How does an attorney get controversial cases? What does he do to gain control of a hostile courtroom? How does he work with a defendant whose beliefs are the opposite of his own? Tough Talk is both the story of one man's battle for freedom and a clear-eyed account of every major First Amendment issue this nation has faced in the last three decades, for the battles Garbus has fought have become the touchstones of America's debate about the limits of freedom. In showing us how he has harnessed his personal idealism to the gritty reality of the courtroom, Garbus gives brilliant testimony to the power of tough talk.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=amDWq87Zv6IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Houdini, Tarzan, and the Perfect Man: The White Male Body and the Challenge of Modernity in America","description":"A remarkable new work from one of our premier historians In his exciting new book, John F. Kasson examines the signs of crisis in American life a century ago, signs that new forces of modernity were affecting men's sense of who and what they really were. When the Prussian-born Eugene Sandow, an international vaudeville star and bodybuilder, toured the United States in the 1890s, Florenz Ziegfeld cannily presented him as the \\"Perfect Man,\\" representing both an ancient ideal of manhood and a modern commodity extolling self-development and self-fulfillment. Then, when Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan swung down a vine into the public eye in 1912, the fantasy of a perfect white Anglo-Saxon male was taken further, escaping the confines of civilization but reasserting its values, beating his chest and bellowing his triumph to the world. With Harry Houdini, the dream of escape was literally embodied in spectacular performances in which he triumphed over every kind of threat to masculine integrity -- bondage, imprisonment, insanity, and death. Kasson's liberally illustrated and persuasively argued study analyzes the themes linking these figures and places them in their rich historical and cultural context. Concern with the white male body -- with exhibiting it and with the perils to it --reached a climax in World War I, he suggests, and continues with us today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3r7-Ju4Cy30C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Life: Reconstructing an American Myth","description":"First published in 1975 and now in paperback, Cowboy Life continues to be a landmark study on the historical and legendary dimensions of the cowboy. The central figure in American mythology, the cowboy can be seen everywhere: in films, novels, advertisements, TV, sports, and music. Though his image holds little resemblance to the historical cowboy, it is important because it represents many qualities with which Americans identify, including bravery, honor, chivalry, and individualism. Accounts by Joseph G. McCoy, Richard Irving Dodge, Charles A. Siringo, and many others detail the daily trials and tribulations of cowboy life on the southern Great Plains-particularly Texas, Indian Territory, and Kansas-from the 1860s to around 1900. And in a new Afterword, editor William W. Savage, Jr. discusses the directions the cowboy myth has taken in the past two decades, as well as the impact the \\"new Western history\\" and films such as Lonesome Dove have had on popular culture.

Yet the practice of the twentieth-century church has been to concentrate on one part of the Gospel--repentance and justification--as if it were the whole, and to proclaim that part uniformly, often without meaningful context that would demonstrate the relevance of Christ to the hearer. The Gospel and Its Meaning breaks fresh ground for evangelism. It equips the students of evangelism with theological foundations for reaching diverse groups, from Hindi pantheists to radical environmentalists, without compromising the Gospel's integrity. The Gospel and Its Meaning - Identifies the basic elements of the Gospel - Shows the relationship of these elements to specific doctrines of theology - Identifies theologians and systems that have focused on particular doctrines - Shows which elements of the Gospel deal most clearly with various issues of evangelism - Suggests avenues of ministry that can address each evangelistic issue. By showing how different parts of the Gospel address the concerns of people within and without the Judeo-Christian worldview, The Gospel and Its Meaning helps those in any kind of evangelistic ministry to develop a means for connecting the Gospel directly to the world of the hearer while distinguishing it clearly from philosophies of relativism and pluralism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S0_Qsh7MkMIC&dq=The+gospel+and+its+ministry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meeting God in Quiet Places","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Smart Games: Wizard Workout Word Games: Superchallenging Wordplay, Strategy, and Perception Puzzles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Listening to Your Hormones: From PMS to Menopause, Every Woman's Complete Guide","description":"A guide to women's health examines hormonal links to health, well-being, and such diseases as depression, PMS, cancer, and chronic fatique syndrome","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ngGZknhfR0wC&dq=Listening+to+Your+Hormones:+From+PMS+to+Menopause,+Every+Woman%27s+Complete+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Independence, democracy, prosperity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pdwsAQAAIAAJ&dq=Independence,+democracy,+prosperity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enlightenment: An Interpretation","description":"The second volume of Peter Gay's in-depth study of the dawn of the modern world the Age of Reason.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gQPna6P69i0C&dq=The+Enlightenment:+An+Interpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girl in Melanie Klein","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mfdWAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Girl+in+Melanie+Klein&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do I Dust or Vacuum First?","description":"An entertaining, but practical, guide to housecleaning explains how to keep a house immaculate with a minimum amount of time, energy, and money","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VdiopTVpqdgC&dq=Do+I+Dust+or+Vacuum+First%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Glastonbury romance","description":"First published in 1932, this is an epic novel of terrific force and lyrical intensity interweaving the ancient with the modern as it probes the mystical and spiritual ethos of Glastonbury and its association with the legend of the Grail. ... the only novel produced by an English writer that can fairly be compared with the fiction of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky...with an immensity to which only Blake could provide any parallel.

Adopted nationwide, this anthology brings together representative writings, many of which had been unavailable for years or had never been reprinted. Drawn from mainstream sources, little-known sixties periodicals, pamphlets, public speeches, and personal voices, the selections range from the Port Huron Statement and the NOW Bill of Rights to speeches by Malcolm X, Richard Nixon, Robert Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan, to private letters from civil rights workers and Vietnam soldiers. Introductions and headnotes by the editors highlight the importance of particular documents, relating them to each other and placing them within the broader context of the decade. The book focuses on civil rights, Black Power, the counterculture, the women's movement, anti-war activity, gay and lesbian struggles, and the conservative current that ran counter to more typical sixties movements. These include both topics that fell outside the daily attention of the media and those that made front-page news. Covering an extremely popular period of history, \\"Takin' it to the streets\\" remains the most accessible and authoritative reader of an extraordinary decade, one unlike any America had seen before or has experienced since.

In the case of England's best-known and best-loved modern satirist, that event has been long overdue. Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent Discworld novels satirize and celebrate every aspect of life, modern and ancient, sacred and profane. Consistent number-one bestsellers in England, they have garnered him a secure position in the pantheon of humor along with Mark Twain, Douglas Adams, Matt Groening, and Jonathan Swift. Even so distinguished an author as A. S. Byatt has sung his praises, calling Pratchett's intricate and delightful fictional Discworld \\"more complicated and satisfying than Oz.\\" His latest satiric triumph, Carpe Jugulum, involves an exclusive royal snafu that leads to comic mayhem. In a fit of enlightenment democracy and ebullient goodwill, King Verence invites Uberwald's undead, the Magpyrs, into Lancre to celebrate the birth of his daughter. But once ensconced within the castle, these wine-drinking, garlic-eating, sun-loving modern vampires have no intention of leaving. Ever. Only an uneasy alliance between a nervous young priest and the argumentative local witches can save the country from being taken over by people with a cultivated bloodlust and bad taste in silk waistcoats. For them, there's only one way to fight.

Built in the glory days of Asbury Park by a reclusive millionaire, the magnificent structure which foreshadowed the beauties of art-deco architecture is now boarded up and marked for demolition. The five people are \\"creepers,\\" the slang term for urban explorers: city archeologists with a passion for investigating abandoned buildings and their dying secrets. On this evening, they are joined by a reporter who wants to profile them anonymously, as this is a highly illegal activity for a New York Times article.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Telempath","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i2Nd-nrTz2AC&dq=Telempath&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Getting of Wisdom (The Academy Editions of Australian Literature)","description":"The subject of this book is a young woman- an awkward, insecure, restless and 'knowing' child who learns that self-realisation depends on rebellion and escape, but that the latter will first demand at least the semblance of conformity.

This book gathers the central papers in this continuing debate, brings the issues into clear focus, points out practical problems and philosophical pitfalls involved in using the tests, and provides a benchmark from which further analysis can proceed.The papers deal with some of the basic philosophy of science, mathematical and statistical assumptions connected with significance tests and the problems of the interpretation of test results, but the work is essentially non-technical in its emphasis. The collection succeeds in raising a variety of questions about the value of the tests; taken together, the questions present a strong case for vital reform in test use, if not for their total abandonment in research.The book is designed for practicing researchers-those not extensively trained in mathematics and statistics that must nevertheless regularly decide if and how tests of significance are to be used-and for those training for research. While controversy has been centered in sociology and psychology, and the book will be especially useful to researchers and students in those fields, its importance is great across the spectrum of the scientific disciplines in which statistical procedures are essential-notably political science, economics, and the other social sciences, education, and many biological fields as well.Denton E.

Margo Anderson argues that the census has always been an influential policymaking tool, used not only to determine the number of representatives apportioned to each state but also to allocate tax dollars to states, and, in the past, to define groups-such as slaves and immigrants-who were to be excluded from the American polity. \\"As a history of the census, this study is a delight. It is thoroughly researched and richly detailed. Anderson is to be commended for covering such an expansive chronology with such skill. . . . Anderson has woven together not only social history but also intellectual, institutional, political, and military history into a thoroughly readable book that examines not only changes in the census but also the remarkable changes that have taken place in the US.\\"-Choice \\"This book is valuable, clearly written and contains many interesting facts. It should be read not only by national policymakers and the statistical community, but by all who are interested in American society.\\"-Bryant Robey, Population Today \\"A solid and readable piece of social, political, and institutional history.

This knowledge becomes an indicator for the military as to what areas and types of training soldiers will need in preparation for future battles. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has seen the need to train in actual urban environments in cities across the United States. The USMC conducted one such exercise, Urban Warrior, on March 13, 1999. The city chosen for the exercise was Monterey, California. During this realistic training, the Marines discovered real impediments when organizing the exercise. The problems encountered during this exercise are examples of the impediments that can arise when coordinating with civilian agencies. To overcome potential impediments the Marines found that better coordination could minimize the time and effort required for enhancing civil-military relations. This thesis argues that with better civil-military relations, training exercises, as well as real exercises, which the National Guard will take part, these impediments can be erased or diminished. This thesis concludes that most or all impediments that occurred are preventable by an early, aggressive, and adequately staffed public relations campaign. It concludes further that public relations campaigns should be planned and organized prior to events. This planning and organizing should be conducted on a full-time coordinating and educating basis between military personnel and civilian agencies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KbXMAAAACAAJ&dq=Urban+Warrior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RANCHING FOR SYLVIA","description":"\\"Ranching for Sylvia\\" by Harold Bindloss.

It moves through changing moods from which wit and grace and good humour are never long absent when the mind is, as in these poems, at play and in command.

Yeats and the rise of Seamus Heaney, tells the triumphant story of his journey from homespun balladry through early journal and poetry publications to his eventual coronation as one of the most influential figures in Irish poetry. Kavanagh (19041967) was born in County Monaghan, the son of a cobbler-cum-small farmer. He left school at thirteen to work the land but continued to educate himself, reading and writing poetry in his spare time. In 1929 he began contributing verses to the Irish Statesman and was soon publishing in Irish and English journals. His first collection, Ploughman and Other Poems, appeared in 1936 and was followed by an autobiography, The Green Fool, in 1938. In 1939 he moved to Dublin where he spent the rest of his life as a freelance writer and as part of the social and literary scene, keeping company with a gifted generation of writers, among them Flann O Brien and Brendan Behan. He gained recognition as an important literary voice with his long poem  The Great Hunger  in 1942. Further collections and the novel Tarry Flynn appeared in the following decades to growing critical acclaim. Published to widespread praise, Patrick Kavanagh, A Biography traces Kavanagh's publishing history as well as revealing what he was writing in the long interval between his books. This engaging, well-researched account of his daily professional life as a writer, his revisions and redraftings, his negotiations with publishers and editors, dispels the view that he was an untutored, gormless genius visited by an occasional flash of inspiration. Patrick Kavanagh, A Biography is the definitive account of Patrick Kavanagh s life and work and should be the standard for years to come.

The bald eagle is regal but fearless, a bird you re not inclined to argue with. For centuries, Americans have celebrated it as  majestic  and  noble,  yet savaged the living bird behind their national symbol as a malicious predator of livestock and, falsely, a snatcher of babies. Taking us from before the nation s founding through inconceivable resurgences of this enduring all-American species, Jack E. Davis contrasts the age when native peoples lived beside it peacefully with that when others, whether through hunting bounties or DDT pesticides, twice pushed Haliaeetus leucocephalus to the brink of extinction. Filled with spectacular stories of Founding Fathers, rapacious hunters, heroic bird rescuers, and the lives of bald eagles themselves monogamous creatures, considered among the animal world s finest parents The Bald Eagle is a much-awaited cultural and natural history that demonstrates how this bird s wondrous journey may provide inspiration today, as we grapple with environmental peril on a larger scale.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5EM3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Images that Injure: Pictorial Stereotypes in the Media Second Edition","description":"Offers a critical view of media stereotypes of diverse cultural groups, including ethnic, racial, and gender-related imagery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x4yjcIocJAkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Swedish fairy book","description":"\\"The Swedish Fairy Book\\" by Various (translated by Frederick Herman Martens).

The students are called Nisei (pronounced \\"nee-say\\") which means second-generation children of Japanese immigrants. In the 1930s Paul T. Hirohata first published the valedictorians' speeches in a book called Orations and Essays. Seventy years later, Hirohata's granddaughter, Joyce Hirohata, has updated and expanded her grandfather's work. In this new edition, she documents the valedictorians' lives and adds a collection of poignant photographs to the original 1930s material. The fifty manuscripts of the valedictorians' orations give a rare glimpse into the words and thoughts of Japanese Americans in the period between World Wars. Over 160 images bring to life the history of the Nisei students and their generation. Through interviews with the valedictorians, as well as their families and friends, Nisei Voices creates a collage of the students' lives, forged in hope but tested by the adversity of incarceration during World War II. An epic story of triumph, Nisei Voices lends a powerful, personal perspective of Japanese Americans before, during and after World War II, and the decades that followed.

Moreover, teaching the several categories of the tenor voice presents teachers of singing with a series of problems not encountered with any other voice type. The tenor voice remains, in short, a mystery to most audiences and teachers alike. Training Tenor Voices presents a unique combination of historical and pedagogical information on how tenors sing. Designed as a practical program for singers, teachers, and voice professionals, the book places emphasis on the special nature of the tenor voice and the proper physiological functioning that leads to the establishment of vocal proficiency. It supplies practical information on instruction for each category of the tenor voice; recommends the kinds of literature to sing and to avoid; and provides an effective system for voice building, including registration factors, techniques for breath coordination, vowel modification (\\"covering\\"), resonance balancing, range extension, the development of vocal agility, and maintaining the high tessitura and sostenuto. The book also includes dozens of technical exercises; numerous anatomical illustrations; musical examples; the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols; unique spectrographic analyses of such famous tenors as Jussi Bjoerling, Franco Corelli, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti; a glossary of terms; and a bibliography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eiYrAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tenor+Voice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Astonished Hours (Carnegie Mellon Poetry Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sensuous Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"DOING DEVELOPMENT IN ARKANSAS: USING CREDIT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY","description":"This is the story of the Southern Development Bancorporation, an organization established in 1988 with headquarters in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, for the purpose of stimulating economic and community development in South Arkansas. Richard P. Taub chronicles this experiment in development banking, established by Bill Clinton when he was governor. Based somewhat on the model of Shorebank Corporation, a Chicago bank-holding corporation that had achieved national recognition through its development efforts in the South Shore community, Southern was established with the assistance of the state's leading foundation as a holding company with a set of subsidiaries designed to provide crucial credit opportunities and technical assistance missing from southern Arkansas. Doing Development in Arkansas is a history of that program as its creators tried to find their footing in new terrain, establish trust, work with borrowers despite legal pitfalls in doing so, and attempted to create new loan and technical assistance products. It is the story of the towns themselves in which Southern tried to have a substantial impact, including Arkadelphia, Hope, Malvern, Hot Springs, and Pine Bluff. Southern was an experiment and many of its achievements were the results in some cases of trying new ideas and in others of transporting programs successful in one setting to new locations. The most dramatic example of such a move is the development of the Good Faith Fund in Pine Bluff, based on a model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. This book has been supported by the Winthrop Rockefeller and Ford Foundations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ymAGFV-KRU0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martial Arts in the Modern World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nature myths and stories for little children;","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQECAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phonics from A to Z (Grades K-3)","description":"Provides an explanation of phonics, a method of reading instruction that focuses on the relationship between sounds and their spellings, and features over one hundred activities for the classroom, as well as sample lessons, word lists, and teaching strategies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RVNCyoeIRPIC&dq=Phonics+from+A+to+Z+(Grades+K-3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tape reading and market tactics;: The three steps to successful stock trading","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Russian wonder tales","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WTokMQAACAAJ&dq=Russian+wonder+tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Odyssey (Cyber Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Under The Gun","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cahokia: City of the Sun : Prehistoric Urban Center in the American Bottom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NnXPPQAACAAJ&dq=Cahokia:+City+of+the+Sun+:+Prehistoric+Urban+Center+in+the+American+Bottom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Dance Iguana (Alex Rutledge Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Women, Science, and Technology: A Reader in Feminist Science Studies","description":"This reader provides an introduction to the gendering of science and the impact women are making in laboratories around the world.

Its silvery light washes over and illuminates all in the homestead. In the centre of the homestead is a small bonfire. Some women are roasting corn and pears. Not far from the bonfire, sat a group of children and adults. The attention of the group is focused on the old man with a cow tail flung casually over his left shoulder. The group is expectant. Their concentration is total. The night has gone suddenly very quiet. The old one clears his throat noisily. &quote;Chapkrii&quote; he bellows with a gesticulation of his left hand.&quote;Waaaaarrri&quote;, the listeners reply in chorus.&quote;Once upon a time&quote;, he begins, drawing out the words slowly.&quote;And time came upon time,&quote; the group replies. &quote;The tortoise and the he-goat used to be best friends,&quote; began the old man, a dry smile of superior wisdom on his lower lip. The above is one of the many traditional African storytelling scenes, which Wooden Gongs and Drumbeats seeks to recapture. Funny, witty, light-hearted and highly amusing, Dahi also brings together some of the idioms and proverbs commonly used in Africa. These are, as they say, the salt with which prudent speakers spice words and statements. Their measured and apt usages are also widely regarded as the hallmarks of sober oratory.

The four years he spent there, startlingly re-created in The House of the Dead, were the most agonizing of his life. In this fictionalized account he recounts his soul-destroying incarceration through the cool, detached tones of his narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov: the daily battle for survival, the wooden plank beds, the cabbage soup swimming with cockroaches, his strange  family  of boastful, ugly, cruel convicts. Yet The House of the Dead is far more than a work of documentary realism: it is also a powerful novel of redemption, describing one man s spiritual and moral death and the miracle of his gradual reawakening.

A disused bank vault holding eight dismembered bodies immersed in barrels of acid. Two bodies buried in a suburban backyard. A further two found in the bush. Such was the findings of one of South Australia's most horrific murder trials. Informed by material never seen before - an interview with Bunting's last lover Elizabeth Harvey, and with the Crown's key eye-witness James Vlassakis and with details of the torture and crimes not previously released - this is a tensely woven and microscopic examination of tawdry lives and tragic deaths. Four men who tortured and killed for fun, for power. Four men who kept each other's dark secrets for years. By the time the police investigation concluded, the story had invited comparison with the nightmare of Rosemary and Fred West, the British House of Horrors. Details of what the killers did to their victims before and after their deaths were deemed so depraved that suppression orders were in place throughout the trial. But the killers were not insane. They made deliberate choices to kill and lived in a culture of complete anarchy, sadistic violence, deviance and chaos. Journalist and author Debi Marshall explores the killers' psychopathic makeup in minute and harrowing detail. She charts the victims' exposure to generational paedophilia, incest, unemployment and hopelessness. Marshall covers the exhaustive trials and interviews the lawyers who ran them. Through interviews, she captures the voices of the victim's families and examines the police and forensic investigation and then wades into the social structure that spawned the people in this story. This book was used as a primary source for the acclaimed Australian feature film, Snowtown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PNSTq1UV3EsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailing to the Far Horizon: The Restless Journey and Tragic Sinking of a Tall Ship","description":"The tall ship Sofia sank off New Zealand s North Island in February 1982, stranding its crew on disabled life rafts for five days.

In this third volume of the series, he focuses on what seems to be a very simple idea: the fine art of truly paying attention. He writes, \\"Air is what connects our hearts and our minds to the world around us. Astrologically - but also in plain speech - it is the linking element, telegraphing an endless stream of information to us - and letting us send a few telegrams in return. Air makes a mockery of the delusion that we are separate from each other - or, for that matter, from anything else. Air connects. It is what allows us to pay attention, and perhaps to create some good reasons for other people to pay attention to us.\\" In these pages, Forrest offers a detailed exploration of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius, along with their planetary rulers and their associated astrological houses: the third, the seventh, and the eleventh. Together, these powerful words in astrology's magical vocabulary are the key to nothing less than aligning your mind with reality as it actually is.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gk1rzQEACAAJ&dq=Air+to+Air&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Play: Dictionary of Idioms","description":"Presents more than 1200 of the most frequently used idioms and slang expressions in the English language.

In wartime, however, enemy codemakers make that task much more difficult. If you cannot break their codes and read their messages, you may discover too late the enemy's intentions. That's why codebreakers were considered such a crucial weapon during World War II. In Secret Messages, David Alvarez provides the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of decoded radio messages (signals intelligence) upon American foreign policy and strategy from 1930 to 1945. He presents the most complete account to date of the U.S. Army's top-secret Signal Intelligence Service (SIS): its creation, its struggles, its rapid wartime growth, and its contributions to the war effort. Alvarez reveals the inner workings of the SIS (precursor of today's NSA) and the codebreaking process and explains how SIS intercepted, deciphered, and analyzed encoded messages. From its headquarters at Arlington Hall outside Washington, D.C., SIS grew from a staff of four novice codebreakers to more than 10,000 people stationed around the globe, secretly monitoring the communications of not only the Axis powers but dozens of other governments as well and producing a flood of intelligence. Some of the SIS programs were so clandestine that even the White House unaware of the agency's existence until 1937 was kept uninformed of them, such as the 1943 creation of a super-secret program to break Soviet codes and ciphers. In addition, Alvarez brings to light such previously classified operations as the interception of Vatican communications and a comprehensive program to decrypt the communications of our wartime allies. He also dispels many of the myths about the SIS's influence on American foreign policy, showing that the impact of special intelligence in the diplomatic sphere was limited by the indifference of the White House, constraints within the program itself, and rivalries with other agencies (like the FBI). Drawing upon military and intelligence archives, interviews with retired and active cryptanalysts, and over a million pages of cryptologic documents declassified in 1996, Alvarez illuminates this dark corner of intelligence history and expands our understanding of its role in and contributions to the American effort in World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wgVnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Secret+Messages:+Codebreaking+and+American+Diplomacy,+1930-1945+(Modern+War+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House At Rest","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMnkGAAACAAJ&dq=The+House+At+Rest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Administrative Medical Assisting","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Acrimony","description":"\\"Very entertaining.

In order to better explain how pyramids enhance evolution, the author also examines the purpose of humanitys evolution. Why we exist, why existence is such as it is, and the nature of this and other dimensions are also dealt with in an easily comprehensible manner. The purpose of evolution, for which physical evolution is but the initial stage, is the souls evolutionary return to its homethe sentient, infinite, and eternal energy field otherwise called God.

A cannon. A strap. A piece. A biscuit. A burner. A heater. A chopper. A gat. A hammer A tool for RULE Or, you can call it a gun. That s what fifteen-year-old Will has shoved in the back waistband of his jeans. See, his brother Shawn was just murdered. And Will knows the rules. No crying. No snitching. Revenge.

Press draws on his insights as a long-time journalist based in Africa, but goes beyond what his media colleagues do by integrating into his analysis of trends and events references to the relevant scholarly literature on Africa. The result is a very thoughtful--and hopeful--book.\\"--Goran Hyden, University of Florida; former president of the African Studies Association \\"Post-cold war conflicts in Africa have received scant coverage and were often presented as current incomprehensible manifestations of traditional tribal hatreds. Not in this study by journalist and Africa scholar Robert Press, which admirably blends the author's personal insights as a reporter, an acute sense of history, and a pioneering human rights approach. Mr. Press sees the hope beyond the wreckage of such devastating conflicts as the ones that almost tore Somalia and Rwanda apart in the early nineties: it lies, he tells us, in the collective struggle of ordinary Africans for human rights and dignity. This book will carry a valuable message to the world: about the importance of human rights in Africa and for Africa's future.\\"--Suliman Baldo, Human Rights Watch /Africa \\"It is a now a truism that the distinguishing characteristic of good photojournalism is that the photographer must truly care about her subjects, not as subjects but as people. Betty Press's love and respect for Africans and their astonishing diversity animate her photography, bringing the struggle, achievements and sorrows of individuals and nations home to the rest of us who did not accompany her.\\"--Ellen Tolmie, UNICEF Photography Editor, New York In The New Africa, former Christian Science Monitor correspondent Robert Press tells his first-hand story of triumph and tragedy in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa. Featuring 90 photographs by Betty Press, whose work has appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, New York Times, Time, and Newsweek, the book offers a compelling account of the continent's emerging movements toward democracy. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, Press also explores the causes of the extraordinary human tragedies of civil war in Somalia and genocide in Rwanda and offers explanations for the West's failure to curb them. While providing broad, in-depth coverage of sweeping social and cultural upheaval, The New Africa also introduces readers to some of the many individual Africans struggling for greater personal freedom. We meet the \\"Mercedes Benz\\" women of West Africa who made small fortunes in the wholesale cloth business; Peter, once a homeless Kenyan, who took up tailoring lessons until he was stricken with the AIDS virus; and Nike Davis, a Nigerian artist who escaped a polygamous marriage and abuse to establish a tuition-free art school. Both general readers and students of African politics will finish The New Africa better informed about the intricate diplomatic and political problems surrounding the struggle for human rights in Africa today, while bearing witness to vivid and moving portraits of individual Africans who, often in the face of danger, stand for greater freedom. After serving as foreign correspondent in Africa for the Christian Science Monitor from 1987 to 1995, Robert M. Press has been a visiting scholar and adjunct professor of journalism at Stetson University, DeLand, Florida, and a visiting professor at Principia College, Elsah, Illinois.
