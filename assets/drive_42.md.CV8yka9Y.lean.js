Lean Enterprise is the process that companies are now adopting to provide superior customer service and improve bottom line performance. Are you contemplating Lean Enterprise for your manufacturing or office facility? Are you already implementing Lean, but dissatisfied with the speed of change? Do your employees think that Lean is just the new flavor of the month? Are you being forced to go Lean by your customers, or your competitors? Are you anticipating going offshore to cut costs? Irrespective of your situation, this book is for you. The Elusive Lean Enterprise is designed to help guide you through the Lean transformation and avoid the pitfalls. Find out why many companies are failing to live up to the promise of Lean, and why there are alternatives to outsourcing or going offshore. In The Elusive Lean Enterprise, lean experts Keith Gilpatrick and Brian Furlong show you what to do, what you must not do, and how to make Lean the way business is done in the 21st century. Learn from the mistakes of others and avoid the trial and error implementation process that often kills the initiative.

For companies that invest the time and have an effective strategy, Lean Enterprise can produce outstanding results.

Jacob Finch Bonner was once a promising young novelist with a respectably published first book. Today, he s teaching in a third-rate MFA program and struggling to maintain what s left of his self-respect; he hasn t written let alone published anything decent in years. When Evan Parker, his most arrogant student, announces he doesn t need Jake s help because the plot of his book in progress is a sure thing, Jake is prepared to dismiss the boast as typical amateur narcissism. But then . . . he hears the plot. Jake returns to the downward trajectory of his own career and braces himself for the supernova publication of Evan Parker s first novel: but it never comes. When he discovers that his former student has died, presumably without ever completing his book, Jake does what any self-respecting writer would do with a story like that a story that absolutely needs to be told. In a few short years, all of Evan Parker s predictions have come true, but Jake is the author enjoying the wave. He is wealthy, famous, praised and read all over the world. But at the height of his glorious new life, an e-mail arrives, the first salvo in a terrifying, anonymous campaign: You are a thief, it says. As Jake struggles to understand his antagonist and hide the truth from his readers and his publishers, he begins to learn more about his late student, and what he discovers both amazes and terrifies him. Who was Evan Parker, and how did he get the idea for his  sure thing  of a novel?

Dillinger's daring escapes-single-handed at Crown Point jail or through the withering machine gun fire of FBI agents at Little Bohemia Lodge-and his countless bank robberies excited the imagination of a despondent country.

The author conducted hundreds of interviews; his research took him through thirty-four states, into the cells where Dillinger was confined, and into every bank he robbed.

Representation as currently understood derives its legitimacy from a politics of ideas, which considers accountability in relation to declared policies and programmes, and makes it a matter of relative indifference who articulates political preferences or beliefs. But what happens to the meaning of representation and accountability when we make the gender or ethnic composition of elected assemblies an additional area of concern? In this innovative contribution to the theory of representation - which draws on debates about gender quotas in Europe, minority voting rights in the USA, and the multi-layered politics of inclusion in Canada - Anne Phillips argues that the politics of ideas is an inadequate vehicle for dealing with political exclusion. But rejecting any essentialist grounding to group identity or group interest, she also argues against any either/or choice between ideas and political presence. The politics of presence then combines with contemporary explorations of deliberative democracy to establish a different balance between accountability and autonomy.

Focusing on Seville, the commercial capital of Habsburg Spain, Perry uses rich archival sources to document the economic and spiritual activity of women, and efforts made by civil and church authorities to control this activity, during a period of local economic change and religious turmoil. In analyzing such sources as art and literature from the period, women's writings, Inquisition records, and laws and regulations, Perry finds that social definitions of what it meant to be a woman or a man persisted due to their sanctification by religious ideas and their adaptation into political order. She describes the tension between gender ideals and actual conditions in women's lives, and shows how some women subverted the gender order by using a surprisingly wide variety of intellectual and physical strategies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qej5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King James Version Reference Bible, Compact","description":"Study on the go with this easy-to-read and easy-to-carry reference edition of the time-tested King James Version Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIYxDwAAQBAJ&dq=King+James+Version+Reference+Bible,+Compact&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Failure to Appear","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6_3rpL4VYi4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swimming Pool & Spa Owners' Manual (Clear Answers Clear Solutions, Volume 4)","description":"It's summer, and for teachers Ed and Natalie Steele this means six weeks off work with their young daughter Molly.

But today, Las Vegas has transformed itself into a family vacation spot second only to Disneyworld on America's leisure-time itinerary. What and who is responsible for this multibillion-dollar transformation? With High Stakes, Gary Provost takes the reader on a wide-ranging tour of Nevada's newly revitalized 21st-century vacation world. This inside look at both the gaming business and its new total entertainment centers, which now host twenty million visitors a year, reveals how Las Vegas became a clean, attractive, family-oriented resort. Today, casino gambling is just one attraction of many, most of them new: amazing theme parks, spectacular virtual-reality rides, futuristic glass domes, the world's tallest tower, a sky laser that can be seen all the way to Los Angeles. Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. is used as a model of excellence to show how the Las Vegas gaming industry develops, markets, and delivers its entertainment \\"product\\" at a lower price, and with greater profits, than any of its competitors. Highlighted by a preview of Circus Circus' astonishing pyramid Luxor the new centerpiece of the greatest gaming empire in history, High Stakes includes extensive interviews with Luxor's legendary creator, William G. Bennett, the man who taught the entire gaming industry how to attract the vast market of family-oriented vacationers. Also covered are all the games of chance that a casino like Circus Circus offers and the odds each gives; everything the casino hands out for free and why; the different ways in which high rollers and ordinary folk are treated; how legendary casinos of the past have crashed to oblivion and the hot newcomers that have taken their place; and the increasing competition from Atlantic City and the growing list of other venues of legal gambling in the United States. Timely, wide-ranging, and well informed, this eye-opening book traces the evolution of Las Vegas from \\"Sin City\\" to the \\"Orlando of the West.\\" Whether you are interested in gambling, business, or the changing face of America, High Stakes is fascinating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xts4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Past Mortem","description":"'A writer who provokes, almost as much as he entertains' Daily Mail 'Engaging and smartly plotted' Observer ___ With old friends like these, who needs enemies?

In provocative new readings of Shakespeare, Herbert, and Milton, Flesch illuminates the personal authority that is bound inextricably with acts of generosity. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Mauss, Blanchot, Bourdieu, Wittgenstein, Bloom, Cavell, and Greenblatt, Flesch maintains that the literary power of Shakespeare, Herbert, and Milton is at its most intense when they are exploring the limits of generosity. He considers how in Herbert's Temple divine assurance of the possibility of redemption is put into question and how the poet approaches such a gift with the ambivalence of a beneficiary. In his readings of Shakespeare's Richard II, Henry IV, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and the sonnets, Flesch examines the perspective of the benefactor including Shakespeare himself who confronts the decline of his capacity to give. Turning to Milton's Paradise Lost, Flesch identifies two opposing ways of understanding generosity Satan's, on the one hand, and Adam and Eve's, on the other - and elaborates the different conceptions of poetry to which these understandings give rise. Scholars of Shakespeare and of Renaissance culture, Miltonists, literary theorists, and others interested in the relationship between philosophy and literature will want to read this insightful and challenging book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ByZzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Generosity+and+the+Limits+of+Authority:+Shakespeare,+Herbert,+Milton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Mago De Oz / The Wizard of Oz (Spanish Edition)","description":"After a cyclone transports her to the land of Oz, Dorothy must seek out the great wizard in order to return home to Kansas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vWuWIAZvaCgC&dq=El+Mago+De+Oz+/+The+Wizard+of+Oz+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Health Recipes From The Saturday Evening Post Family Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=831dKhgWIQMC&dq=Selected+Health+Recipes+From+The+Saturday+Evening+Post+Family+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"123 Sesame Street (Elmo's neighborhood)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jIUltQEACAAJ&dq=123+Sesame+Street+(Elmo%27s+neighborhood)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wife in name only","description":"\\"Wife in Name Only\\" by Charlotte M.

Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write.

Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Written more than a century and a half ago by a Black man who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age. It is a record of savagery and inhumanity that goes far to explain why America still suffers from the great injustices of the past.

Beginning as a movement based on the recovery, interpretation and imitation of ancient Greek and Roman texts and the archaeological study of the physical remains of antiquity, humanism turned into a dynamic cultural programme, influencing almost every facet of Renaissance intellectual life. The fourteen essays in this 1996 volume deal with all aspects of the movement, from language learning to the development of science, from the effect of humanism on biblical study to its influence on art, from its Italian origins to its manifestations in the literature of More, Sidney and Shakespeare.

Using a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, the book s award-winning author examines how the British imposed their rule, dominated by the clashing dualities of their Mandate obligations towards the Arabs and the Jews, and their own interests. The rulers  Empire-wide conceptions of the  White man s burden  and preconceptions of the Holy Land were potent forces of change, influencing their policies. Lucidly written, Mandated Landscape is also a rich source of information supported by numerous maps, tables and illustrations, and has 66 appendices, a considerable bibliography and extensive index. With a theoretical and historical backdrop, the ramifications of British rule are highlighted in their impact on town planning, agriculture, forestry, land, the partition plans and a case study, presenting discussions on such issues as development, ecological shock, law and the controversial division of village lands, as the British operated in a politically turbulent climate, often within their own administration. This book is a major contribution to research on British Palestine and will interest those in Middle East, history, geography, development and colonial/postcolonial studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpSRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Japanese: Being descriptions of many of the customs, manners, ceremonies, festivals, arts and crafts of the Japanese besides numerous other subjects","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=giYaAAAAMAAJ&dq=We+Japanese:+Being+descriptions+of+many+of+the+customs,+manners,+ceremonies,+festivals,+arts+and+crafts+of+the+Japanese+besides+numerous+other+subjects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncommon Women and Others.","description":"THE STORY: Comprised of a collage of interrelated scenes, the action begins with a reunion, six years after graduation, of five close friends and classmates at Mount Holyoke College.

Identifying the major trends and telling moments within major denominations and also in less formal religious movements, he asks how these religious groups have shaped, and been shaped by, some of the most important and divisive issues and events of the last half century: the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, feminism and the sexual revolution, abortion rights, the antinuclear and environmentalist movements, and many others. Allitt argues that the boundaries between religious and political discourse have become increasingly blurred in the last fifty years. Having been divided along denominational lines in the early postwar period, religious Americans had come by the 1980s to be divided along political lines instead, as they grappled with the challenges of modernity and secularism. Partly because of this politicization, and partly because of the growing influence of Asian, Latino, and other ethnic groups, the United States is anomalous among the Western industrialized nations, as church membership and religious affiliation generally increased during this period. Religion in America Since 1945 is a masterful analysis of this dynamism and diversity and an ideal starting point for any exploration of the contemporary religious scene.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mvGEAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assisted Living: Needs, Practices, and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Distributed Com Application Development Using Visual C++ 6.0 with CDROM (Prentice Hall Series on Microsoft Technologies)","description":"The complete guide to designing, developing, and deploying multi-tier applications with Visual C++ 6.0, this book gives intermediate-to-advanced Visual C++ and MFC programmers all the in-depth knowledge and skills they need to build and deploy state-of-the-art multi-tiered applications.

Although Schaecher's friends and family have worried about his obsession with bathroom drawings, it is clear that with the publication of this tome, his seat in the annals of architectural history will never be put down.Here are reproductions of stylish (dare we say perfectionist?) renderings of Thronehenge, Wright's Flushing Water, the Odor Dame Cathedral, the Taj Ma-stall, Jefferson's Johnicello, Sullivan's Merchants First National Outhouse, Le Corbusier's Bidet Savoye, Fuller's Geodesic Throne, the Hancock's John Building, the Centre Pompidoodoo-the unmistakable outhouse for that weird-looking French museum-and many others. Each is accompanied by insightful historical and analytical text, depending on your definitions of insightful and analytical. The preface, by architectural critic I.P. Daley, will leave you in no doubt of the importance of this completely nonsensical book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-SMcHF5KKgC&dq=Outhouses+by+Famous+Architects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Castle of Eyes: A Novel of Dark Fantasy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SsxlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Castle+of+Eyes:+A+Novel+of+Dark+Fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prepare for the Great Tribulation Volume 9","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SWWbZsSn4IUC&dq=Prepare+for+the+Great+Tribulation+Volume+9&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cities and years;: A novel, (A Laurel edition)","description":"Scarlett would never kill her best friend, perhaps a Citizen if the situation called for it, but never Rhys.

Although the dozen biographies devoted to Rimbaud s life depend on one main source for information his own correspondence a complete edition of these remarkable letters has never been published in English. Until now. A moving document of decline, Rimbaud s letters begin with the enthusiastic artistic pronouncements of a fifteen-year-old genius, and end with the bitter what-ifs of a man whose life has slipped disastrously away. But whether soapboxing on the essence of art, or struggling under the yoke of self-imposed exile in the desert of his later years, Rimbaud was incapable of writing an uninteresting sentence. As translator and editor Wyatt Mason makes clear in his engaging Introduction, the letters reveal a Rimbaud very different from our expectations. Rimbaud presented by many biographers as a bohemian wild man is unveiled as  diligent in his pursuit of his goals . . . wildly, soberly ambitious, in poetry, in everything.  I Promise to Be Good: The Letters of Arthur Rimbaud is the second and final volume in Mason s authoritative presentation of Rimbaud s writings. Called by Edward Hirsch  the definitive translation for our time,  Mason s first volume, Rimbaud Complete (Modern Library, 2002), brought Rimbaud s poetry and prose into vivid focus. In I Promise to Be Good, Mason adds the missing epistolary pieces to our picture of Rimbaud.  These letters,  he writes,  are proofs in all their variety of impudence and precocity, of tenderness and rage for the existence of Arthur Rimbaud.  I Promise to Be Good allows English-language readers to see with new eyes one of the most extraordinary poets in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-c6qA8yyguIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Archery","description":"Author Brian J.

About a month earlier, in the lead up to his election, Jagmeet held community meet-and-greets across Canada. At one such event, a disruptive heckler in the crowd hurled accusations at him. Jagmeet responded by calmly calling for all Canadians to act with  love and courage  in the face of hate.

With a revolt breaking out across North Africa, the world seems to be racing Raf straight to hell. The last thing he needs is a father he s never known. But when the old Emir s security chief requests that Raf come out of retirement to investigate an assassination attempt on His Excellency, that s exactly what Raf gets.

As suggested by Christopher R. Gabel, the maneuvers had an incalculable influence on the development of the American force structure in World War II, giving Army formations experience in teamwork and combined arms. Viewed by Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall as the \\"combat college for troop leading\\" for the rising crop of field-grade officers, they also served to test emerging assumptions about doctrine, organization, and equipment. Gabel's work assumes its rightful place as an important and useful addition to the body of historical literature on military training. The evolution of training in the U.S. Army, particularly the linkage between maneuvers and changes in doctrine and organization, is worthy of reflection by military students and those with an interest in maneuvers as field laboratories for simulating large-scale engagements.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-q9QQVHJi5QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Mr. Verdant Green,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fire in the Wind : The Life of Dickey Chapelle","description":"The biography of the first female combat photographer discusses her years at MIT, her marriage, her introduction to photography, and her work photographing the battle of Iwo Jima, the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the rise of Castro, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5l8nAQAAIAAJ&dq=Fire+in+the+Wind+:+The+Life+of+Dickey+Chapelle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","description":"A profile of Albert Speer is based on letters, interviews, and personal writings, and details his unhappy childhood, friendship with Hitler, and remorse over his crimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uqk_DwAAQBAJ&dq=Albert+Speer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outline of Buddhism","description":"Excerpt from The Outline of Buddhism It is but just, however, that I should own here, being far from an original, the bulk of the present volume is largely taken from the several works of older scholars of great fame on this subject, and the reader will, no doubt, also find many similar state ments through the writings of some Western scholars.

How can professors meet the challenge of teaching introductory-level philosophy so that their students, regardless of initial incentive or skill, come to understand and even enjoy the subject? For nearly a decade, renowned philosopher and teacher Steven M. Cahn offered doctoral students a fourteen-week, credit-bearing course to prepare them to teach undergraduates. At schools where these instructors were appointed, department chairs reported a dramatic increase in student interest. In this book, Cahn captures the essence of that course. Yet many of the topics he discusses concern all faculty, regardless of subject: a teacher s responsibilities, the keys to effective instruction, the proper approach to term papers, examinations, and grades; and suggestions for how administrators should demonstrate that they take teaching seriously. Such matters are covered in the first seven chapters and in the final, fourteenth chapter. The intermediate six chapters focus on teaching introductory philosophy and, in particular, on critical thinking, free will, philosophy of religion, ethics, and political philosophy. Cahn s writing is lucid and lively, using vivid examples and avoiding educational jargon. In sum, this book is not only a guide on how to inspire students but also an inspiration for teachers themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkZbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RELIGION FROM TOLSTOY TO CAMUS","description":"First published in 1961, this volume brings together basic writings and religious truths and morals from a wide range of sources. Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Plus II, Leo XIII, Nietzsche, James, Royce, Wilde, Freud, Niem?ller, Barth, Maritain, Tillich, Schweitzer, Buber, Camus, and others, all have sought the religious truth about man, and have in the last three quarters of our century made great contributions to religious thought, critical often of the accepted and fashionable religion of their day, but greatly concerned to purify religion as they understood it. Dr. Waller Kaufman, of Princeton University, who has already written extensively on philosophy and religion, supplies an editorial and critical note for each of his subject, thus providing valuable continuity and evaluation. Such a book as this deserves a place in all libraries, public and private, so that it will be possible to quote these men from knowledge, rather than hearsay many times removed from the original.  The point is not to win friends for religion, or enemies, but to provoke greater thoughtfulness. Here are texts that deserve to be pondered and discussed. Some of them I have criticized in other volumes; in such cases, the references are given. But in the present book nothing is included merely to be disparaged, nor is anything offered only to be praised. The hope is that those who read this book will gain a deeper understanding of religion.

Unaccountably, the details of that shocking crime have been largely ignored by Wright s legion of biographers a historical and cultural gap that is finally addressed in William Drennan s exhaustively researched Death in a Prairie House: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Murders. In response to the scandal generated by his open affair with the proto-feminist and free love advocate Mamah Borthwick Cheney, Wright had begun to build Taliesin as a refuge and \\"love cottage\\" for himself and his mistress (both married at the time to others). Conceived as the apotheosis of Wright s prairie house style, the original Taliesin would stand in all its isolated glory for only a few months before the bloody slayings that rocked the nation and reduced the structure itself to a smoking hull. Supplying both a gripping mystery story and an authoritative portrait of the artist as a young man, Drennan wades through the myths surrounding Wright and the massacre, casting fresh light on the formulation of Wright s architectural ideology and the cataclysmic effects that the Taliesin murders exerted on the fabled architect and on his subsequent designs.

Women are thought to have a special aptitude for making and keeping friends. But notions of friendship are not constant-and neither are women's experiences of this fundamental form of connection. In Another Self, Linda W. Rosenzweig sheds light on the changing nature of white middle-class American women's relationships during the coming of age of modern America. As the middle-class domesticity of the nineteenth century waned, a new emotional culture arose in the twentieth century and the intensely affectionate bonds between women of earlier decades were supplanted by new priorities: autonomy, careers, participation in an expanding consumer culture, and the expectation of fulfillment and companionship in marriage. An increased emphasis on heterosexual interactions and a growing stigmatization of close same-sex relationships fostered new friendship styles and patterns. Drawing on a wide range of primary sources including diaries, journals, correspondence, and popular periodicals, Rosenzweig uncovers the complex and intricate links between social and cultural developments and women's personal experiences of friendship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WoPsjMVBleoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","description":"Available for the first time in trade paperback, the second of five volumes collecting the complete fiction of William Hope Hodgson, an influential early twentieth-century author of science fiction, horror, and the fantastic. William Hope Hodgson was, like his contemporaries Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen, one of the most important, prolific, and influential fantasists of the early twentieth century. His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown. While his adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the latter half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find. Night Shade Books s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The second of the five-volume set, The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places, collects Hodgson s mystery and suspense fiction, including those starring the occult detective Thomas Carnacki, and the titular novel The House on the Borderland, a seminal and influential work of early weird fiction. The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes: The Boats of the  Glen Carrig  and Other Nautical Adventures The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea The Night Land and Other Romances The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GKRBMQAACAAJ&dq=The+House+on+the+Borderland+and+Other+Mysterious+Places+(The+Collected+Fiction+of+William+Hope+Hodgson,+Vol.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iWI-AQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","description":"In the fall of 1930, David Packard left his hometown of Pueblo, Colorado, to enroll at Stanford University, where he befriended another freshman, Bill Hewlett. After graduation, Hewlett and Packard decided to throw their lots in together. They tossed a coin to decide whose name should go first on the notice of incorporation, then cast about in search of products to sell. Today, the one-car garage in Palo Alto that housed their first workshop is a California historic landmark: the birthplace of Silicon Valley. And Hewlett-Packard has produced thousands of innovative products for millions of customers throughout the world. Their little company employs 98,400 people and boasts constantly increasing sales that reached $25 billion in 1994. While there are many successful companies, there is only one Hewlett-Packard, because from the very beginning, Hewlett and Packard had a way of doing things that was contrary to the prevailing management strategies. In defining the objectives for their company, Packard and Hewlett wanted more than profits, revenue growth and a constant stream of new, happy customers. Hewlett-Packard's success owes a great deal to many factors, including openness to change, an unrelenting will to win, the virtue of sustained hard work and a company-wide commitment to community involvement. As a result, HP now is universally acclaimed as the world's most admired technology company; its wildly successful approach to business has been immortalized as The HP Way. In this book, David Packard tells the simple yet extraordinary story of his life's work and of the truly exceptional company that he and Bill Hewlett started in a garage 55 years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AUyzAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gum on the Drum (Start to Read!

Sometimes the damage suffered by the litigant is irreversible. In England and many other common law countries the injured person will normally have no redress because of the privilege of immunity from suit enjoyed by judges. This result also normally follows when the complaint is against the actions of someone acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. The situation then raises a number of questions, including questions about civil rights, the redress of wrongs, and the whole foundation of judicial independence. As more people resort to the courts and other judicial tribunals for the resolution of their disputes the question of the proper approach to injurious judicial errors becomes more important, especially since every participant in judicial proceedings is a potential victim. This book presents an in-depth study of the substantive, procedural and theoretical issues that arise when a judge is to be sued. The material is drawn mainly from English and American Federal case law. The study however also incorporates some Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand case law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IvXvwAEACAAJ&dq=Suing+Judges:+A+Study+of+Judicial+Immunity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission to Metlakatla","description":"In 1857, British William Duncan, age 25, became a British Lay-Missionary to civilize the savage Tsimshian Indian tribe near Fort Simpson, northernmost trading post in coastal British Columbia.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style thorough, yet riveting famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H2t_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing into the Blue","description":"Colorful photographs of the world of nature are accompanied by poetic meditations on God and spiritual growth","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ooQwCmyNmjYC&dq=Growing+into+the+Blue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pissing in the Gene Pool","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","description":"LISP was developed in the late 1950s as a language for manipulating symbols.

But when, on a retreat, Fee discovers how the director treats the boys he makes section leader, he is so ashamed, he says nothing of the abuse, not even when Peter, Fee s best friend, is in line to be next. The director is eventually arrested, and Fee tries to forgive himself for his silence. But when Peter takes his own life, Fee blames only himself. Years later, after he has carefully pieced a new life together, Fee takes a job at a private school near his hometown.

Griffith's eagerly anticipated retrospective \\"Dark Odyssey\\" traces his forty-year journey through this chaotic world, from the wide horizon of his native Wales to the ravaged villages of war-torn Vietnam, in more than one hundred astounding black-and-white photographs. In each of his pictures, Griffiths creates a complex diagram of meaning and emotion. The collision of culture and ideology is often the basis of the work--sometimes in a simple pairing of figures, sometimes in a dizzying throng of life: the arresting, straightforward gazes of a Vietnamese child and her war-disfigured mother; the dazed face of a woman lost among the multitude of graves at a cemetery in Hiroshima; the wicked glee of a boy about to hurl a boulder into a grand piano, outside under an ominously dark sky. Griffiths's photogarphs tackle love, death, frivolity, politics, violence . . . they comment--ironically and profoundly--on virtually every aspect of human life, offering a gripping and unforgettable view of both the devastations and the beauties of our era. With an in-depth critical profile by renowned \\"New Yorker\\" writer Murry Sayle--who has known Griffiths for more than thirty years--\\"Dark Odyssey\\" also includes poignant narrative notes by the photographer himself. \\"I have traveled to over one hundred and forty countries trying to makesense of it all,\\" Griffiths writes. \\"I have discovered that almost every belief we hold collapses under scrutiny--the 'truth' is often simply a tool that serves someone else's purpose.\\" This skepticism and this sense of awe are palpable in every one of Griffiths's masterful photographs. Born in Rhuddlan, Wales, in 1936, Philip Jones Griffiths began his career as a pharmacist, but turned to photography in the early 1960s. As a free-lance photojournalist, he covered the wars in Algeria and Vietnam (his book \\"Vietnam Inc.\\" was published in 1971), and in the 1970s worked in Cambodia and Thailand. Griffiths moved to New York City in 1980 to assume the post of president at the Magnum Photo agency--a position he held for a record five years. His photographs have appeared in every major magazine in the world, including \\"Life,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Newsweek,\\" and \\"Geo.\\" Griffiths has also made several documentary films, on subjects ranging from the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the descendants of the HMS Bounty living on Pitcairn Island. \\"A Welsh Eye,\\" a film about the photographer, was shown in Britain in 1991. Murray Sayle has written for \\"Encounter,\\" \\"Harper's,\\" \\"Life,\\" \\"The New Republic,\\" \\"The New Statesman,\\" \\"The Spectator,\\" \\"The New Yorker,\\" \\"The New York Times Review of Books,\\" \\"The New York Review of Books,\\" and many other publications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ld9TAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dark+Odyssey+(Aperture+Magazine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hearing","description":"A writer-musician examines how the switch from analog to digital audio is changing our perceptions of time, space, love, money, and power. Our voices carry farther than ever before, thanks to digital media. But how are they being heard? In this book, Damon Krukowski examines how the switch from analog to digital audio is changing our perceptions of time, space, love, money, and power. In Ways of Hearing modeled on Ways of Seeing, John Berger's influential 1972 book on visual culture Krukowski offers readers a set of tools for critical listening in the digital age. Just as Ways of Seeing began as a BBC television series, Ways of Hearing is based on a six-part podcast produced for the groundbreaking public radio podcast network Radiotopia. Inventive uses of text and design help bring the message beyond the range of earbuds. Each chapter of Ways of Hearing explores a different aspect of listening in the digital age: time, space, love, money, and power. Digital time, for example, is designed for machines. When we trade broadcast for podcast, or analog for digital in the recording studio, we give up the opportunity to perceive time together through our media. On the street, we experience public space privately, as our headphones allow us to avoid  ear contact  with the city. Heard on a cell phone, our loved ones' voices are compressed, stripped of context by digital technology. Music has been dematerialized, no longer an object to be bought and sold. With recommendation algorithms and playlists, digital corporations have created a media universe that adapts to us, eliminating the pleasures of brick-and-mortar browsing. Krukowski lays out a choice: do we want a world enriched by the messiness of noise, or one that strives toward the purity of signal only?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4o2NDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Hearing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","description":"This critically acclaimed sonnet sequence is the passionately intense story of a love affair between two women, from the electricity of their first acquaintance to the experience of their parting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-VZTBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible And Contemporary Theology: The Quest for Truth And Relevance","description":"An honest appraisal of much biblical material must admit that in terms of its perspectives of nature and the universe, cultural mores, moral sensitivity, and understanding of God, there are factual errors and considerable irrelevance for the contemporary world.

Whatever criticisms may be made in relation to Robison s methodology, Proofs . . . remains valuable today for several reasons: firstly, it provides a snapshot of Continental-style Freemasonry and secret societies in the 18th century; secondly, it is the earliest attempt, along with Barruel s, to examine the r?le of conspiracies in a revolution; thirdly, it supplies insights into what we may call the  lowlands  of the  Enlightenment  not its eminent thinkers, but the odd and peculiar characters that were also active in this movement; and, finally, it presents a systematic critique of the ideals that in France led eventually to the Terror, thereby serving as a primary source for understanding opposition to the French Revolution and its core ideal of equality as a moral absolute. The Counter-Enlightenment arguments of authors like Robison are today more relevant than ever, since the politics of the West remain a legacy of his era, to the extent that even conservatives ultimately derive their political philosophy from Locke and rely on terminology based on the seating arrangements of the French National Assembly. Though it was soon forgotten, Proofs . . . has had a lasting impact; indeed, we live in times awash with conspiracy theories. Be it about the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the New World Order, 9/11, or master conspiracies involving all of the above, could the growth of conspiratology tell us something about democratic societies in liberal modernity?

This fruitful approach helps illuminate the impact of the gospel on its original readers and, in turn, shows how potent a force it can be for the church and society today. The book begins with an in-depth study of the Thessalonians themselves -- their history, land, socioeconomic conditions, and religious environment. This fascinating discussion gives the necessary context for fully appreciating the circumstances surrounding the founding of the city's first church and the subsequent struggles of the Thessalonian believers to live out their Christian faith. The main body of the book provides informed verse-by-verse commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians that extracts the fullest possible meaning from these important New Testament texts. As Green's exposition shows, the Thessalonian scriptures are especially valuable as letters of friendship and for showing Paul's pastoral concern for the many areas in which the Thessalonians needed guidance. Some of Paul's purposes are to thank the new believers for their steadfastness amid suffering, to encourage them in their trials, to urge them not to neglect their daily work, and, no less important, to teach them about the future of believers who die before Christ returns. Indeed, the matter of the last things and the second coming of Christ so permeates these texts that they are often called Paul's eschatological letters. Filled with new information about ancient society, this commentary will fast become a standard reference work for Bible study. By carefully bridging the biblical and modern worlds, Green shows with clarity and warmth the continuing relevance of 1 & 2 Thessalonians for contemporary readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0GfnDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Letters+to+the+Thessalonians+(Pillar+New+Testament+Commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Season of Hope: Season of Hope/Sleigh Bells/Candy Cane Calaboose/For a Father's Love (Heaven Sent)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_bBEAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Weight Is Over","description":"Syleena Johnson s highly anticipated self-help book, The Weight is Over, shares her compelling and painful journey toward self-love and discovery, while chronicling her battles with body image birthed in adolescence and carried throughout her music career.

In New York, Washington, D.C., and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, four planes piloted by members of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization left death, shattered innocence, and incomprehensible destruction in their wake. While the attacks united all Americans in their shared horror and grief, the actual witnesses to these events often bear the heaviest weight of these painful memories. Never Forget is a collection of unbelievably moving stories of loss, heartache, and survival, as told in the words of those closest to the unfolding tragedy. In stark, haunting detail, these vivid personal accounts bring to life the events as they happened: from the harrowing moments after the planes hit the twin Towers of the World Trade Center to the overwhelming cloud of debris that enveloped lower Manhattan when the towers fell, the devastating conversations with loved ones on the hijacked flights, the terrifying hours spent trapped in the fallen buildings, and the painstaking recovery efforts at each site. Moses Lipson, an eighty-nine-year-old construction inspector, walks down from the eighty-eighth floor of Tower 1. Steven Bienkowski, a police officer in the New York Harbor Unit Scuba Team, watches helplessly from a helicopter as people trapped in the upper floors of Tower 1 reach from the windows to beg for a miracle rescue. Tim McGinn, a now-retired NYPD lieutenant, shoots out a window and saves at least thirty people from suffocation. Young Lyzbeth Glick's heart drops when she realizes that her husband, Jeremy, who changed his travel plans at the last moment, is now on the hijacked flight from Newark. As the Pentagon blazes, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Anderson plunges back inside to rescue civilians trapped by fallen debris. Weeks later, the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero continue. Construction worker Joseph Bradley looks on as a firefighter gently closes the eyes and straightens the suit of a woman whose body is found in the rubble. Benjamin Garelick, seven years old, raises seven hundred dollars with a lemonade stand to \\"help the firemen buy a new truck.\\" As these unforgettable stories reveal, many Americans transcended their own confusion and despair to help one another escape, to offer one another kindness, and to affirm life in the face of catastrophe. This concert of voices shows, as never before, the heartbreaking grief and slow but uplifting healing process that the people of this nation have experienced individually and as one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tPGKQgAACAAJ&dq=Never+Forget&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","description":"Like many Jewish Americans, Elizabeth Ehrlich was ambivalent about her background. She identified with Jewish cultural attitudes, but not with the institutions; she had fond memories of her Jewish grandmothers, but she found their religious practices irrelevant to her life. It wasn't until she entered the kitchen--and world--of her mother-in-law, Miriam, a Holocaust survivor, that Ehrlich began to understand the importance of preserving the traditions of the past. As Ehrlich looks on, Miriam methodically and lovingly prepares countless kosher meals while relating the often painful stories of her life in Poland and her immigration to America. These stories trigger a kind of religious awakening in Ehrlich, who--as she moves tentatively toward reclaiming the heritage she rejected as a young woman--gains a new appreciation of life's possibilities, choices, and limitations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YnSr7EwBoQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salt boy","description":"When danger to the sheep leaves no alternative, a young Navajo boy breaks his promise to his father and is rewarded for his courage and good judgment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dHMkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Salt+boy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Westerns","description":"First Published in 2002.

In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife. A Land Remembered was winner of the Florida Historical Society's Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel. Now in its 14th hardcover printing, it has been in print since 1984 and is also available in trade paperback.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xpdxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Appalachian Trail","description":"The Appalachian Trail is America's most beloved trek, with millions of hikers setting foot on it every year.

From Grandma Gatewood--a mother of eleven who thru-hiked in canvas sneakers and a drawstring duffle--to Bill Bryson, author of the best-selling A Walk in the Woods, the AT has seized the American imagination like no other hiking path. The 2,000-mile-long hike from Georgia to Maine is not just a trail through the woods, but a set of ideas about nature etched in the forest floor. This character-driven biography of the trail is a must-read not just for ambitious hikers, but for anyone who wonders about our relationship with the great outdoors and dreams of getting away from urban life for a pilgrimage in the wild.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fCTrDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Appalachian+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to modern epidemiology","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-kAQAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World in dust: A personal record","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fo4IAQAAIAAJ&dq=World+in+dust:+A+personal+record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milet Picture Dictionary: English-Farsi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Net Of Jewels","description":"Hua-yen is regarded as the highest form of Buddhism by most modern Japanese and Chinese scholars. This book is a description and analysis of the Chinese form of Buddhism called Hua-yen (or Hwa-yea), Flower Ornament, based largely on one of the more systematic treatises of its third patriarch. Hua-yen Buddhism strongly resembles Whitehead's process philosophy, and has strong implications for modern philosophy and religion. Hua-yen Buddhism explores the philosophical system of Hua-yen in greater detail than does Garma C.C. Chang's The Buddhist Teaching of Totality (Penn State, 1971). An additional value is the development of the questions of ethics and history. Thus, Professor Cook presents a valuable sequel to Professor Chang's pioneering work. The Flower Ornament School was developed in China in the late 7th and early 8th centuries as an innovative interpretation of Indian Buddhist doctrines in the light of indigenous Chinese presuppositions, chiefly Taoist. Hua-yen is a cosmic ecology, which views all existence as an organic unity, so it has an obvious appeal to the modern individual, both students and layman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MibyUr_a29sC&dq=Net+Of+Jewels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn the Internet in a Weekend (In a Weekend (Premier Press))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE BACHELOR CHRONICLES","description":"Alexander Denford, Baron Sedgwick, is a gentleman to be envied.

I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. . . . This is the testament of Paul B?umer, who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty, culture, and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive.  The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.

Confronted with these warnings of impending doom, our best defense is to understand how valid--or invalid--these predictions of calamity are. By perceiving these threats in a wise and sagacious way, we can best meet future challenges by not earmarking precious resources for wrong or misleading reasons. Walter Karplus, a professor of computer sciences at UCLA, in his 35 years of experience has made predictions for all kinds of phenomena by generating models and computer simulations. His decades of experience have taught him what we can and cannot predict with any accuracy. Dr. Karplus surveys the most hotly debated catastrophes that many scientists have predicted will imminently endanger the lives of countless people all over the globe. These catastrophes include the depletion of the ozone layer, the Greenhouse Effect, nuclear radiation, acid rain, the AIDS epidemic, the population explosion, another Great Depression, and earthquakes. Drawing on his superb background, he assesses the strengths and weaknesses of arguments propounding the seriousness of these calamities. All the while, he never allows us to lose sight of the profound shortcomings of scientific prediction. In his singularly engaging manner, Dr. Karplus traces the fascinating art of prediction from our earliest ancestors to today. He pronounces at what point prediction, even within science, becomes a black art. He elucidates the problems that computer simulations have in predicting events and goes on to pinpoint when and where these models lapse into the area of pure conjecture. Through reason and wit, Walter Karplus teaches us how to bring a trained eye to the predictions of disaster that unceasingly assault us. The Heavens Are Falling is an illuminating and entertaining work that bestows on us the wisdom to make informed judgments before taking arms against a sea of troubles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ABj3BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rescue Manual for Parents: How to Successfully Survive the Teenagers Years","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Winning Market Leadership : Strategic Market Planning for Technology-Driven Businesses","description":"Strategic market planning in technology-intensive businesses is more complex and is less manageable than in most other organizations.

Thaddeus Stevens was among the first to see the Civil War as an opportunity for a second American revolution a chance to remake the country as a genuine multiracial democracy. As one of the foremost abolitionists in Congress in the years leading up to the war, he was a leader of the young Republican Party s radical wing, fighting for anti-slavery and anti-racist policies long before party colleagues like Abraham Lincoln endorsed them. These policies including welcoming black men into the Union s armies would prove crucial to the Union war effort. During the Reconstruction era that followed, Stevens demanded equal civil and political rights for Black Americans rights eventually embodied in the 14th and 15th amendments. But while Stevens in many ways pushed his party and America towards equality, he also championed ideas too radical for his fellow Congressmen ever to support, such as confiscating large slaveholders  estates and dividing the land among those who had been enslaved. In Thaddeus Stevens, acclaimed historian Bruce Levine has written a  vital  (The Guardian),  compelling  (James McPherson) biography of one of the most visionary statesmen of the 19th century and a forgotten champion for racial justice in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5zJcEAAAQBAJ&dq=Thaddeus+Stevens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harold, the last of the Saxon kings (Standard literature series [no. 12])","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ENGLISH ROMANTIC POETS; MODERN ESSAYS IN CRITICISM","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U9sJmZIGmM0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","description":"They may be known as man's best friend, but as the writers in this poignant, funny, and dramatic collection know, there's no gender divide when it comes to canines.

Very flexible, allowing teachers to select materials to highlight and stress, each text can be implemented on various grade levels for a quarter, a semester, or a full year depending on the length and frequency of class meetings. Intended to function as the primary textbook for a semester or year-long course in a Catholic high school at the eleventh and twelfth grade levels the goal of the course is to help students understand the interrelationship of the components of the Catholic Church. This course emphasizes the living Church and what it is in the present moment and is constructed around themes such as the Church as the People of God, the Church as servant, and the Church as sacrament. Each theme traces major periods of Church history and provides insights as to how the Church has come to its contemporary expression. Recognizing that to truly understand what it means to be Catholic, one must look not only at current theology, worship, and belief, but how those things were developed and accepted through history, The Church: Our Story combines a discussion of ecclesiology -- literally the \\"study of the nature of the Church\\" -- with a discussion of Church history. The purpose of the historical sections are not to recount all of the significant events over the past two thousand years, but rather to give insight into the beliefs, practices, and tensionsin Catholicism today that resulted from their historical roots.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6vMlv_mCUkC&dq=The+Church:+Our+Story:+Catholic+Tradtion,+Mission,+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Farce","description":"Inspired by Madison s observation, Mark Lloyd has crafted a complex and powerful assessment of the relationship between communications and democracy in the United States.

Drawing on a wealth of historical sources, Lloyd demonstrates that despite the persistent hope that a new technology (from the telegraph to the Internet) will rise to serve the needs of the republic, none have solved the fundamental problems created by corporate domination. After examining failed alternatives to the strong publicly-owned communications model, such as anti-trust regulation, the public trustee rules of the Federal Communications Commission, and the under-funded public broadcasting service, Lloyd argues that we must recreate a modern version of the Founder s communications environment, and offers concrete strategies aimed at empowering citizens.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SbmxyHXadQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siegfried Odermatt & Rosmarie Tissi: Graphic design (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9s60PAAACAAJ&dq=Siegfried+Odermatt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Friends For Francis","description":"Frances doesn't think her little sister, Gloria, can be her friend.

William Hope Hodgson was, like his contemporaries Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen, one of the most important, prolific, and influential fantasists of the early twentieth century. His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience (a professional merchant mariner for much of his life, many of Hodgson s tales are set at sea), and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown. While his nautical adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the latter half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find. Night Shade Books s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The third book of the five-volume set, The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea, collects more of Hodgson s nautical fiction, including his 1909 novel The Ghost Pirates. The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes: The Boats of the  Glen Carrig  and Other Nautical Adventures The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea The Night Land and Other Romances The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WoOOtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Ghost+Pirates+and+Other+Revenants+of+the+Sea:+The+Collected+Fiction+of+William+Hope+Hodgson,+Volume+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unearned Pleasures and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Essential Poems (To Fall in Love With)","description":"Forget chocolate, exotic lingerie, or marriage counselors -- the only props you'll ever need, whether you are in love or out of it, are the poems in this book.

In captivity, octopuses have been known to identify individual human keepers, raid neighboring tanks for food, turn off lightbulbs by spouting jets of water, plug drains, and make daring escapes. How is it that a creature with such gifts evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own? What does it mean that evolution built minds not once but at least twice? The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. What can we learn from the encounter? In Other Minds, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how subjective experience crept into being how nature became aware of itself. As Godfrey-Smith stresses, it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared. Tracking the mind s fitful development, Godfrey-Smith shows how unruly clumps of seaborne cells began living together and became capable of sensing, acting, and signaling. As these primitive organisms became more entangled with others, they grew more complicated. The first nervous systems evolved, probably in ancient relatives of jellyfish; later on, the cephalopods, which began as inconspicuous mollusks, abandoned their shells and rose above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so. Taking an independent route, mammals and birds later began their own evolutionary journeys. But what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? Drawing on the latest scientific research and his own scuba-diving adventures, Godfrey-Smith probes the many mysteries that surround the lineage. How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually  think for themselves ? What happens when some octopuses abandon their hermit-like ways and congregate, as they do in a unique location off the coast of Australia? By tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith casts crucial new light on the octopus mind and on our own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRNmDQAAQBAJ&dq=Other+minds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boomerang","description":"Right now, Europe is in serious financial chaos.

War was a distant rumor, life a routine of easy shifts and dinners under the stars. On December 8 all that changed, as Japanese bombs began raining down on American bases in Luzon, and this paradise became a fiery hell. Caught in the raging battle, the nurses set up field hospitals in the jungles of Bataan and the tunnels of Corregidor, where they tended to the most devastating injuries of war, and suffered the terrors of shells and shrapnel. But the worst was yet to come. After Bataan and Corregidor fell, the nurses were herded into internment camps where they would endure three years of fear, brutality, and starvation. Once liberated, they returned to an America that at first celebrated them, but later refused to honor their leaders with the medals they clearly deserved. Here, in letters, diaries, and riveting firsthand accounts, is the story of what really happened during those dark days, woven together in a deeply affecting saga of women in war.

For this project, Richter photographed 216 details of his abstract painting \\"No. 648-2\\" (1987), and, working on a long table over a period of several weeks, combined these 4 x 6-inch details with 165 texts on the Iraq war, published in the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungnewspaper on the dates of the war's outbreak (March 20 and 21, 2003). \\"My method was to attach a number of texts to a number of images without having to think about whether something would be better positioned to the left or the right, above or below,\\" Richter told an interviewer, for a New York Timesfeature on the publication. \\"I placed these images so that a connection develops in terms of colors, structures and other characteristics. . . . Some images match the cruelty and the madness described in the texts shockingly well. And others can even serve as illustrations when the texts speak of deserts and other landscapes.\\" Originally published only in German in 2004, this long-awaited English version of this important artist's book presents Richter's powerful attempt to accommodate the extremity of war.

Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington Baseball Fan's Little Book of Wisdom (Little Book of Wisdom (Taylor))","description":"Baseball is returning to our nation's capital, and in due fashion, the team has recently announced its name--the Washington D.C.

The report assesses tests of visual function, including visual acuity and visual fields whether visual impairments could be measured directly through visual task performance or other means of assessing disability.

One asserts that homosexual acts are legitimate, the other that they are not. Concentration on the legitimacy of sexual expression rather than on underlying needs has made the debate about homosexuality incapable of resolution. Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic presents a psychoanalytic interpretation that has shifted the focus of the debate from symptoms to root causes. The crux of Elizabeth Moberly's argument is that 'the homosexual condition involves legitimate developmental needs, the fulfilment of which has been blocked by an underlying ambivalence to members of the same sex'. But, while the argument is certainly controversial, it involves a much-needed restatement of the traditional Christian distinction between the homosexual condition and its expression in homosexual activity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BO5kv0vdzoUC&dq=Homosexuality:+A+New+Christian+Ethic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sophisticated Cat: A Gathering of Stories, Poems, and Miscellaneous Writings About Cats","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mathematical Theory of Communication","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Finding Space: Winnicott, God and Psychic Reality","description":"In Finding Space, Ann Belford Ulanov argues that depth psychology in general and the work of D. W. Winnicott in particular offer vital new ways in which to apprehend religious life, especially Christian religious life. Her inspiration is rooted in Winnicott's influence on her work as an analyst and how his ideas have enriched her own Christian faith and religious understanding. In addition, Ulanov feels Winnicott's focus on the intensity of aliveness is an antidote to the plight of contemporary religion - that it can be passionless or rote, and thereby irrelevant to so many people. She expands Winnicott's concept of transitional space between self and other to apply to the space between the human and divine. She explores the importance of the \\"illusionist element\\" of God images in creative approaches to the divine. Other topics include the paradox transitional reality holds with subjective and objective notions Christians have of God; the inclusion of the body - specifically sexuality and aggression and the struggle for integration within the self - in the search for relationship with God; and the importance of the feminine. In an especially helpful appendix, Ulanov includes Winnicott's thoughts on matters pertinent to religious life and thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=roFyOqDTtYUC&dq=Finding+Space:+Winnicott,+God+and+Psychic+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overheard in a Garden","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Combining a bibliographic study with an inquiry into method, it opens with a survey of the principal reference tools available to historians of Islam and a systematic review of the sources they will confront. Problems of method are then examined in a series of chapters, each exploring a broad topic in the social and political history of the Middle East and North Africa between A.D. 600 and 1500. The topics selected represent a cross-section of Islamic historical studies, and range from the struggles for power within the early Islamic community to the life of the peasantry. Each chapter pursues four questions. What concrete research problems are likely to be most challenging and productive? What resources do we possess for dealing with these problems? What strategies can we devise to exploit our resources most effectively? What is the current state of the scholarly literature for the topic under study?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hm7dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead End Bluff","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y3eSAQAACAAJ&dq=Dead+End+Bluff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Door In The Tree","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Mistake","description":"An exultant novel of New York City at the turn of the twentieth century, about one man's rise to fame and fortune, and his mysterious murder--\\"engrossing\\" (Wall Street Journal), \\"immersive\\" (The New Yorker), and \\"seriously entertaining\\" (The Sunday Times, London). Andrew Haswell Green is dead, shot at the venerable age of eighty-three, when he thought life could hold no more surprises.

These battleships were the stars of the 190709 Great White Fleet circumnavigation, in which the emerging power and reach of the US Navy was displayed around the world. They also took part in the bombardment and landings at Veracruz, some served as convoy escorts in World War I, and the last two were transferred to the Hellenic Navy and were sunk during World War II. This book examines the design, history, and technical qualities of the final six classes of US predreadnought battleships, all of which were involved in the circumnavigation of the Great White Fleet. These classes progressively closed the quality gap with European navies  the Connecticuts were the finest predreadnought battleships ever built  and this book also compares and contrasts US predreadnought battleships to their foreign contemporaries. Packed with illustrations and specially commissioned artwork, this is an essential guide to the development of US Navy Battleships at the turn of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RdzLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlocking Your Genetic History: A Step-by-Step Guide to Discovering Your Family's Medical and Genetic Heritage (National Genealogical Society Guides)","description":"This book shows how to discover genetic predispositions to specific diseases, confirm ancestral connections through genetic testing, and understand DNA breakthroughs reported in today's headlines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvUIAAAACAAJ&dq=Unlocking+Your+Genetic+History:+A+Step-by-Step+Guide+to+Discovering+Your+Family%27s+Medical+and+Genetic+Heritage+(National+Genealogical+Society+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Santayana (Hispanics of achievement)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Satan, satanism, and witchcraft, (Zondervan books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zoWcJAZO-PQC&dq=Satan,+satanism,+and+witchcraft,+(Zondervan+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars Dark Apprentice Volume Jedi","description":"Luke Skywalker finds his academy threatened by untold dangers when his most talented and rebellious student, Kyp Durron, delves dangerously into the Dark Side of the Force, aided by an evil and deadly enemy.

His sanctity took 120 years to become officially recognized, but between his death in 1889 and his canonization in 2009--amid creeping secularization and suspicion of the missionary spirit he so much embodied--Fr. Damien De Veuster never faded from the world's memory. What kept him there? What keeps him there now? To find an answer, Belgian historian and journalist Jan De Volder sifted through Father Damien's personal correspondence as well as the Vatican archives. With careful and even-handed expertise, De Volder follows Father Damien's transformation from the stout, somewhat haughty missionary of his youth, bounding from Europe to Hawaii and straight into seemingly tireless priestly work, to the humble and loving shepherd of souls who eventually succumbed to the same disease that ravaged his flock. De Volder finds that--as spiritual father, caretaker, teacher, and advocate--Father Damien accomplished many heroic feats for these poor outcasts. Yet the greatest gift he gave them was their transformation from a disordered, lawless throng exiled in desperate anarchy into a living community built on Jesus Christ, a community in which they learned to care for one another. Every generation seems to have its own image of this world-famous priest. Already during his life on Molokai and at his death in 1889, many considered him a holy man. Even today, in the highly secularized Western world, he is widely admired. In 2005 his native Belgium honored him with the title \\"the greatest Belgian\\" in polling conducted by their public broadcasting service. Statues honor his memory in the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and at the entrance to the Hawaiian State Capitol in Honolulu. In 1995, in the presence of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Pope John Paul II beatified him in Brussels, Belgium; and in 2009 Pope Benedict XVI canonized him in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Today Father Damien is the unofficial patron of outcasts and those afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Illustrated with many photos. De Volder contends that the common thread running through the saint's life, the spirit of Father Damien that so speaks to the world, is at once uniquely Christian, fully human, and as important today as ever before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1YxHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xk_uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ethics:+Inventing+Right+and+Wrong+(Pelican)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Performance Consulting","description":"NEW EDITION, REVISED AND UPDATED In America, organizations spend $175 billion in training initiatives and more than $500 billion in human resource solutions every year yet often have little to show for it.

A Manual of Scientific Enquiry, Third Edition, 1859 Scott Huler was working as a copy editor for a small publisher when he stumbled across the Beaufort Wind Scale in his Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary. It was one of those moments of discovery that writers live for. Written centuries ago, its 110 words launched Huler on a remarkable journey over land and sea into a fascinating world of explorers, mariners, scientists, and writers. After falling in love with what he decided was  the best, clearest, and most vigorous piece of descriptive writing I had ever seen,  Huler went in search of Admiral Francis Beaufort himself: hydrographer to the British Admiralty, man of science, and author Huler assumed of the Beaufort Wind Scale. But what Huler discovered is that the scale that carries Beaufort s name has a long and complex evolution, and to properly understand it he had to keep reaching farther back in history, into the lives and works of figures from Daniel Defoe and Charles Darwin to Captains Bligh, of the Bounty, and Cook, of the Endeavor. As hydrographer to the British Admiralty it was Beaufort s job to track the information that ships relied on: where to lay anchor, descriptions of ports, information about fortification, religion, and trade. But what came to fascinate Huler most about Beaufort was his obsession for observing things and communicating to others what the world looked like. Huler s research landed him in one of the most fascinating and rich periods of history, because all around the world in the mid-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in a grand, expansive period, modern science was being invented every day. These scientific advancements encompassed not only vast leaps in understanding but also how scientific innovation was expressed and even organized, including such enduring developments as the scale Anders Celsius created to simplify how Gabriel Fahrenheit measured temperature; the French-designed metric system; and the Gregorian calendar adopted by France and Great Britain. To Huler, Beaufort came to embody that passion for scientific observation and categorization; indeed Beaufort became the great scientific networker of his time. It was he, for example, who was tapped to lead the search for a naturalist in the 1830s to accompany the crew of the Beagle; he recommended a young naturalist named Charles Darwin. Defining the Wind is a wonderfully readable, often humorous, and always rich story that is ultimately about how we observe the forces of nature and the world around us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oqGUXPWbieMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy And Myth In Karl Marx","description":"In Karl Marx's early writing (first made available many years after his death) his economic interpretation of history and his concept of communism were set in a comprehensive philosophical framework. Marx's main preoccupation at this time was with man estranged from himself in an alienated world: a subjective, almost religious theme. Taking full account of these earlier writings, Robert Tucker critiques and reinterprets Marx's thought. He shows how its origins can be located in earlier German philosophers, in particular Kant, Hegel, and Feuerbach. Reconstructing the genesis of Marxism in its founder's own mind, he clarifies Marx's mystifying contention that Marxism represented Hegelianism turned 'on its head'. He then presents a new interpretation, based on close textual analysis, of the relation between Marx's early philosophical system and the subsequent materialist conception of history as expounded in the later and best known writings of Marx and Engels. Against this background, Tucker presents Das Kapital as a work belonging to the post-Hegelian mythical development of Germany philosophy. Considering in turn the genesis of Marxism and the underlying continuity of his thought from the early writings to Das Kapital, Tucker shows the theme of alienation is central throughout. In the years since the book was first written, comments and criticism have encouraged Tucker to change his position somewhat. This is explained in a new introduction that goes beyond the interpretative enterprise of the rest of the book to assess Marx in relation to contemporary concerns: first it presents a critique of Marx's treatment of alienation and then it comments on the moot problem of the continuing relevance of his social and economic thought. On the latter point his views have matured and altered during the intervening years and he now finds the economic and social aspects of Marx's thought considerably more relevant than he did before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UUCJswEACAAJ&dq=Philosophy+And+Myth+In+Karl+Marx&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Theory of Art","description":"What, if anything, has art to do with the rest of our lives and in particular with those ethical and political issues that matter to us most?

Flying in broad daylight over enemy-held territory, their green-nosed Thunderbolts and Mustangs not only protected the bombers but often embraced an even more dangerous tactical role engaging targets on the ground. In the deadly dance that ensued many a brave young pilot lost his life in the skies over western Europe, but our bombers got through and the GIs landed at Normandy. Relying not on recollections rendered imprecise by the passage of time, or secondhand reports which inevitably lose context, A Manifest Spirit instead presents observations from the group historian, base chaplain, and the fighter pilots themselves, recorded as they occurred during the conflict. The complex operation of a wartime fighter base, the deep satisfaction of a successful mission, and the heartbreak of waiting for pilots that never returned, are presented with the clarity that can only come from contemporaneous reports. A Manifest Spirit is a tribute to the officers that gave the 359th Fighter Group its organization and direction, the enlisted men who made it work, and above all the pilots, 121 of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nk95tAEACAAJ&dq=Mustangs+and+Unicorns:+History+of+the+359th+FG&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Say It with Presentations: How to Design and Deliver Successful Business Presentations, Revised & Expanded Edition","description":"Organize a powerful, effective business presentation and deliver it with style!

Twenty-four years after his own final road trip as a minor leaguer, Gmelch went back on the road with ballplayers, this time with a pen and pad to record the details of life around the diamond. Drawing on more than one hundred interviews with Major and Minor League players, coaches, and managers, Gmelch explores players' experiences throughout their careers: being scouted, becoming a rookie, moving through or staying in the Minors, preparing mentally and physically to play day after day, coping with slumps and successes, and facing retirement. He examines the ballplayers' routines and rituals, describes their joys and frustrations, and investigates the roles of wives, fans, and groupies in their lives. Based on his own experience as a player in the 1960s, Gmelch charts the life cycle of the modern professional ballplayer and makes perceptive comparisons to a previous generation of players.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgmv3BqDEi8C&dq=INSIDE+PITCH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to get rich in TV without really trying","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uFsxAQAAIAAJ&dq=How+to+get+rich+in+TV+without+really+trying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wind of a Thousand Tales: A Play (A \\"Stage magic\\" play)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4egzQwRU61oC&dq=Wind+of+a+Thousand+Tales:+A+Play+(A+%22Stage+magic%22+play)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of a Great American (Basic Selections From Emerson Essays, Poems, & Apothegms)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Improve Your Eyesight : Vision Therapy Eye Exercises--Updates Bates Method (1 Hour & 30 Minute Video and Eye Chart Included)","description":"Better Eyesight Without Glasses is not only the definitive source for the classic Bates Method, it is in itself a remarkable phenomenon.

If you think that your eyesight could be made better by natural methods, you are right. After years of experimentation, Dr. Bates came to the conclusion that many people who wore glasses did not need them. He gradually and carefully developed a simple group of exercises for improving the ability of the eyes themselves to see, eliminating the tension caused by poor visual habits that are the major cause of bad eyesight.

Everyone must struggle to adjust himself to this, to face the situation for 'now is the judgment of the world.' In a way, each one judges himself merely by what he does. Does, not says. Yet let us not completely dismiss words. They do have meaning. They are related to action. They spring from action and they prepare for it, they clarify it, they direct it.\\" --Thomas Merton, August 16, 1961 The fourth volume of Thomas Merton's complete journals, one of his final literary legacies, springs from three hundred handwritten pages that capture - in candid, lively, deeply revealing passages - the growing unrest of the 1960s, which Merton witnessed within himself as plainly as in the changing culture around him. In these decisive years, 1960-1963, Merton, now in his late forties and frequently working in a new hermitage at the Abbey of Gethsemani, finds himself struggling between his longing for a private, spiritual life and the irresistible pull of social concerns. Precisely when he longs for more solitude, and convinces himself he could not cut back on his writing, Merton begins asking complex questions about the contemporary culture (\\"the 'world' with its funny pants, of which I do not know the name, its sandals and sunglasses\\"), war, and the churches role in society. Thus despite his resistance, he is drawn into the world where his celebrity and growing concerns for social issues fuel his writings on civil rights, nonviolence, and pacifism and lead him into conflict with those who urge him to leave the moral issues to bishops and theologians. This pivotal volume in the Merton journals reveals a man at the height of a brilliant writing career, marking the fourteenth anniversary of his priesthood but yearning still for the key to true happiness and grace. Here, in his most private diaries, Merton is as intellectually curious, critical, and insightful as in his best-known public writings while he documents his movement from the cloister toward the world, from Novice Master to hermit, from ironic critic to joyous witness to the mystery of God's plan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gc0XBTn_KYUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polaris Writings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dNHWPQAACAAJ&dq=Polaris+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Los mares de la luna / The Seas of the Moon (Narrativa) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Boundary Waters: The Grace of the Wild (The World As Home)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Becoming a Counselor: The Light, the Bright, and the Serious","description":"Through the use of autobiographical vignettes, Dr. Gladding shares his experiences as one of the field's leaders.

How can the latest breakthroughs in the neuroscience of emotional learning transform the classroom? How can teachers use the principles and practices of positive psychology to ensure optimal 21st-century learning experiences for all children? Patty O Grady answers those questions. Positive Psychology in the Elementary School Classroom presents the basics of positive psychology to educators and provides interactive resources to enrich teachers  proficiency when using positive psychology in the classroom. O Grady underlines the importance of teaching the whole child: encouraging social awareness and positive relationships, fostering self-motivation, and emphasizing social and emotional learning. Through the use of positive psychology in the classroom, children can learn to be more emotionally aware of their own and others  feelings, use their strengths to engage academically and socially, pursue meaningful lives, and accomplish their personal goals. The book begins with Martin Seligman s positive psychology principles, and continues into an overview of affective learning, including its philosophical and psychological roots, from finding the  golden mean  of emotional regulation to finding a child s potencies and  golden self.  O Grady connects the core concepts of educational neuroscience to the principles of positive psychology, explaining how feelings permeate the brain, affecting children s thoughts and actions; how insular neurons make us feel empathy and help us learn by observation; and how the frontal cortex is the hall monitor of the brain. The book is full of practical examples and interactive resources that invite every educator to create a positive psychology classroom, where children can flourish and reach their full potential.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sYSsm2D36OsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Pressure Process Technology: fundamentals and applications, Volume 9 (Industrial Chemistry Library)","description":"Clear evidence of increasing demands in the processing industry prompted the editors and authors to publish a new book about High Pressure Process Technology: Fundamentals and Applications.

Some characters adapt readily to this treacherous, shifting environment -- blaming the weak and overpowering the helpless. Others perish in horror, praying for death. Read this book and live! Written for all ages, the story can be understood by even the youngest reader: The \\"maze\\"is a metaphor for life, and the \\"cheese\\" is a metaphor for whatever you desire in life -- be it worldly goods, spiritual well-being, or unspeakable sexual encounters too deviant even for the Internet. The more advanced reader will also understand the secondary message of the book: \\"Resistance is futile.\\" As soon as change happens, we must accept it immediately or suffer the consequences. This heavy-handed lesson is designed to engender unquestioning obedience to authority, and makes the book an ideal gift for subordinates. Large companies would be well advised to give this book to each and every one of their employees, especially if they are considering a restructuring to bolster shareholder value.

How, in fact, did Country and Hearth negotiate this industrial makeover? Home Fires, the inaugural publication in the new series How Things Worked, lets students see how. Though seemingly simple, the question of home heating prods students to think about natural resources (first wood, then, coal, then oil), logistics, and evolving business practices. Adams depicts the problem of dwindling supplies of firewood and the search for alternatives; the hazards of cutting, digging, and drilling in the name of home heating; the trouble and expense of moving materials from place to place; changing technological means, chiefly the rise of steam power; the rise of an industrial economy; and economic questions, both household and macro.

Its very name recalls scenes of horror during the French Revolution, as nobles lost their heads while gangs of people cheered and Madame Defarge knitted. Some of history's most famous people lost their heads at the guillotine, including Marie Antoinette, King Louis XVI of France, and Robespierre, and the apparatus is immediately recognizable across the world, not just for its appearance but for all the stories it featured prominently in. However, the truth behind this device is much more complicated than its short-lived use during France's Reign of Terror. For one thing, societies have been executing people since ancient times and have used various devices, the guillotine being just one. Even as early as the 13th century, there were moves among some to make the arduous task of state-sanctioned executions quicker and easier, and in time, the evolution of various devices helped bring about the invention of the guillotine. Though many their names have now faded into history, both the instruments of the past and the people who used them were the parents of this monstrous device. But a funny thing happened along the way as people became less and less enamored of killing each other, even for those who had themselves committed murder. As the Age of Enlightenment spread in the mid-1700s, so did a sense that government should not take lives at all, or if they did, that they should do so as quickly and painlessly as possible. Thus it was that the guillotine was created, not to hurt others so much as to dispatch those condemned as painlessly as possible. It is but a sad coincidence that its design was perfected on the eve of one of the bloodiest eras in French history; had it been developed at another point in time, it might very-well have been hailed as a merciful way to mete out justice. Like all important devices, the guillotine did not remain unchanged during its centuries of use. Its design was periodically tweaked for decades until the latter half of the 19th century, when it was completely redesigned, likely in light of a growing hostility toward capital punishment in general and beheadings in particular. By this time, such notable Frenchmen as Victor Hugo had spoken out against the right of the state to take a human life. Even the Sanson family, who had served as France's executioners for more nearly 200 years, had given up their work, and it fell to others to master the new apparatus. These men would be increasingly maligned for their work as a more civilized world insisted that it was not for the state to conduct executions. That said, it often surprises people to learn that the guillotine remained in use through the middle part of the 20th century, outliving other barbaric practices like slavery by nearly 100 years. Though the government outlawed public executions in the mid-1930s, men and women continued to be beheaded in the name of justice long after the end of World War II. But ultimately, the times were changing, and Nazi and Japanese atrocities had opened the eyes of many to man's ability to hurt fellow man. Killing was even less attractive to those who had already killed in the name of patriotism, and their voices raised, higher and higher, until ultimately the device that had dispatched royalty and paupers alike was finally used for the last time.

One of these entirely new processes is that of the digital intermediate. The DI has tremendous advantages, ranging from improved quality (first \\"print\\" is as good as the last) to cost savings (no re-mastering) to digital distribution (bits and bytes: no film in canisters). The DI influences everything from on set production to the delivery of content to consumers and everything in between. Digital Intermediates for Film and Video teaches the fundamental concepts and workflow of the digital intermediate process. Covers basics of film first, and then introduces the digital world--including a tutorial on digital images, asset management, online editing, color correction, restoration, film and video output, mastering and quality control.

A twenty-year-old telegraphic engineer at the time, he was a member of the Russian-American Telegraph Expedition, a now virtually unknown but nevertheless remarkable nineteenth-century adventure story. That bold undertaking would have established telegraph service between the United States and Russia by submarine cable across the Bering Strait, an event unfortunately upstaged by the successful laying of the Atlantic Cable. Its directors subsequently abandoned the project. But for Kennan the impact of the endeavor proved both formative and lasting; his work in northeastern Siberia as a member of the expedition had so piqued his interest in Russia that over half a century later it still was not slaked. By the time of his death in 1924, his various investigations of Russian subjects had resulted in numerous publications and lectures that had established his reputation as the leading American expert on Russia of his era. The major concern of Frederick F. Travis's book is the role of George Kennan in shaping American-Russian relations in the important half century before the Russian Revolution and its immediate aftermath. This study first establishes that Kennan began his career as an ardent Russophile, then carefully traces his shift to hostility following his investigation of the Siberian exile system in 1885-86, and explains in some detail his subsequent influence on public opinion. Kennan's later work revealed a Russia of almost unrelieved political and economic distress in the tsarist empire, and of a noble, almost hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned opposition, contributing significantly to the unpreparedness with which America faced the Revolution of 1917. Kennan's analysis of the October Revolution and its immediate aftermath served only to harden American attitudes toward the presumed evils of Bolshevism.

Cheap Amusements is a fascinating discussion of young working women whose meager wages often fell short of bare subsistence and rarely allowed for entertainment expenses. Kathy Peiss follows working women into saloons, dance halls, Coney Island amusement parks, social clubs, and nickelodeons to explore the culture of these young women between 1880 and 1920 as expressed in leisure activities. By examining the rituals and styles they adopted and placing that culture in the larger context of urban working-class life, she offers us a complex picture of the dynamics shaping a working woman's experience and consciousness at the turn-of-the-century. Not only does her analysis lead us to new insights into working-class culture, changing social relations between single men and women, and urban courtship, but it also gives us a fuller understanding of the cultural transformations that gave rise to the commercialization of leisure. The early twentieth century witnessed the emergence of \\"heterosocial companionship\\" as a dominant ideology of gender, affirming mixed-sex patterns of social interaction, in contrast to the nineteenth century's segregated spheres. Cheap Amusements argues that a crucial part of the \\"reorientation of American culture\\" originated from below, specifically in the subculture of working women to be found in urban dance halls and amusement resorts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UlBzEAAAQBAJ&dq=Cheap+Amusements:+Working+Women+and+Leisure+in+Turn-of-the-Century+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Japan: A Budget Travel Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why the Chicken Crossed the Road: & Other Hidden Enlightenment Teachings from the Buddha to Bebop to Mother Goose","description":"A rollicking investigation of cause and effect by the Caldecott medalist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ElCPGrS2oeMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Church: Our Story: Catholic Tradition, Mission, and Practice with Disk","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6q4PAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Church:+Our+Story:+Catholic+Tradition,+Mission,+and+Practice+with+Disk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melville Goodwin USA","description":"Finalist for the National Book Award: This sweeping novel set in the aftermath of World War II reveals the story behind the creation of an American icon Major General Melville A. Goodwin, the son of a druggist, served in two world wars, rising through the ranks to take command of an armored division. He was a hero long before he braved a hail of bullets to save a fellow American in postwar Berlin, but until that mad act of courage, no one outside of the military had ever heard of him. That is all about to change: A weekly news magazine has convinced the major general to sit down for an extended interview at the home of Sid Skelton, a popular radio commentator and former army buddy of Goodwin s. Over the course of many hours, Goodwin tells the story of his life from his small-town childhood to his years at West Point, his battlefield traumas, his marriage to an ambitious woman who helped shape his military career, and his impressions of the world as seen through the barbed wire of far-flung army posts. Of primary interest to Skelton, however, is Dottie Peale, the vivacious journalist Goodwin romanced in war-torn France. Skelton is a little bit in love with her himself, and now that the major general is in the news, Dottie plans to make a dramatic return to his life. At the moment of his greatest triumph, Goodwin will discover that his marriage and career are under threat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You Ticklish?

Would our view of nature \`red in tooth in claw' be different if women had played a larger role in the creation of evolutionary theory and through education in its transmission to younger generations? Is there any such thing as a feminist science or feminist methodology? For feminists, does any kind of biological determinism undermine their contention that gender roles purely constructed, not inherent in the human species? Does the study of animals have anything to say to those preoccupied with the evolution and behavior of humans? All these questions and many more are addressed by this book, whose contributing authors include leading scholars in both feminism and evolutionary biology.

The text is fully annotated and illuminated by 200 genuine pharmaco-shamanic images from the ancient world. Since it is popularly written, and very heavily illustrated with the remarkable, overtly pharmaco-shamanic art of the ancient world, it reads like a movie. But a movie with profound psychological and political relevance for the contemporary world, since it uses the words and pictures of our ancestors to address contemporary issues. In this sense, it compares to \\"The Chalice and the Blade\\" and \\"Food of the Gods,\\" two recent bestsellers of similar intent. As such, the book is a unique tool for exciting undergraduates about the contemporary relevance of ancient history and the Greek classics. This was the intent of Jane Ellen Harrison in her \\"Prolegomena\\" and \\"Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religion.\\" Harrison was the most influential classicist of the twentieth century, and, not coincidentally, the most influential feminist historian of the century as well. A major feature of \\"Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda,\\" in 4 of its 17 chapters, is its summary of Harrison's seminal thesis, in her own words. Harrison was concerned with the historical and psychological transition from the originary matriarchal conscious of tribal culture to the warrior-oriented patriarchal consciousness of industrial culture. She understood this transition to be central to the process of industrial enslavement. That enslavement necessarily demonized the power-rites, the rites de passage, as she called them, of tribal cultures. That is, Harrison pointed to the tribal, the matriarchal pre-industrial roots of Classical, patriarchal-industrial, Greek culture. She was, therefore, concerned with originary, tribal, Greek sacramentalism. Herbal magic, real pharmaco-shamanism, is at the core of all matriarchal cultures. The Goddess does not separate from her herbal magic, from her invention of medicine. The central sacrament of all Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures known is an inebriative herb, a plant totem, which became metaphoric of the communal epiphany. These herbs, herbal concoctions and herbal metaphors are at the heart of all mythologies. They include such familiar images as the Burning Bush, the Tree of Life, the Cross, the Golden Bough, the Forbidden Fruit, the Blood of Christ, the Blood of Dionysos, the Holy Grail (or rather its contents), the Chalice (Kalyx: 'flower cup'), the Golden Flower (Chrysanthemon), Ambrosia (Ambrotos: 'immortal'), Nectar (Nektar: 'overcomes death'), the Sacred Lotus, the Golden Apples, the Mystic Mandrake, the Mystic Rose, the Divine Mushroom (teonanacatl), the Divine Water Lily, Soma, Ayahuasca ('Vine of the Soul'), Kava, Iboga, Mama Coca and Peyote Woman. They are the archetypal - the emotionally, the instantaneously understood - symbols at the center of the drug propaganda. A sexually attractive man or woman is an archetypal image, the basis of most advertising. A loaf of bread is an archetypal image. The emotional impact of the sacramental herbal images, or, rather, the historical confusion of their natural function, is central to the successful manipulation of mass emotion and individual self-image. That is, contemporary politics has an unconscious, an evolutionary element, that involves the industrial manipulation of instinct. That manipulation can only be understood by contemplating what elements of our evolutionary inheritance contemporary inquisitors want forgotten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfkQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Shamanism+and+the+Drug+Propaganda:+The+Birth+of+Patriarchy+and+the+Drug+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witchcraft and Sorcery of the American Native Peoples","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Prophet Reads Scripture: Allusion in Isaiah 40-66 (Contraversions: Jews and Other Differenc)","description":"By examining literary allusion in Isaiah 40-66, the author illuminates the changes that led to the demise of biblical prophecy and the rise of hermeneutically based religions in the post-biblical era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--Uh4h8d6IgC&dq=A+Prophet+Reads+Scripture:+Allusion+in+Isaiah+40-66+(Contraversions:+Jews+and+Other+Differenc)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not of Her Race (Russian Edition)","description":"Russia, one of the most ethno-culturally diverse countries in the world, provides a rich case study on how globalisation and associated international trends are disrupting, and causing the radical rethinking of approaches to, inter-ethnic cohesion. The book highlights the importance of television broadcasting in shaping national discourse and the place of ethno-cultural diversity within it. It argues that television s role here has been reinforced, rather than diminished, by the rise of new media technologies. Through an analysis of a wide range of news and other television programmes, the book shows how the covert meanings of discourse on a particular issue can diverge from the overt significance attributed to it, just as the impact of that discourse may not conform with the original aims of the broadcasters. The book discusses the tension between the imperative to maintain security through centralised government and overall national cohesion that Russia shares with other European states, and the need to remain sensitive to, and to accommodate, the needs and perspectives of ethnic minorities and labour migrants. It compares the increasingly isolationist popular ethnonationalism in Russia, which harks back to \\"old-fashioned\\" values, with the similar rise of the Tea Party in the United States and the UK Independence Party in Britain. Throughout, this extremely rich, well-argued book complicates and challenges received wisdom on Russia s recent descent into authoritarianism. It points to a regime struggling to negotiate the dilemmas it faces, given its Soviet legacy of ethnic particularism, weak civil society, large native Muslim population and overbearing, yet far from entirely effective, state control of the media.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAnwBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The approach to philosophy,","description":"This monograph describes different approaches to philosophy, their situational and conceptual fields, their inter-relations and limitations.

Rubio shatters the boundaries of reality with this fiercely imaginative debut.  The first witch of the waters was born in Destruction. The moon named her Maria.  Set against the tropics and megacities of the Americas, Maria, Maria takes inspiration from wild creatures, tarot, and the porous borders between life and death. Motivated by love and its inverse, grief, the characters who inhabit these stories negotiate boldly with nature to cast their desired ends. As the enigmatic community college professor in  Brujer a for Beginners  reminds us:  There s always a price for conjuring in darkness. You won t always know what it is until payment is due.  This commitment drives the disturbingly faithful widow in  Tijuca,  who promises to bury her husband s head in the rich dirt of the jungle, and the sisters in  Moksha,  who are tempted by a sleek obsidian dagger once held by a vampiric idol. But magic isn t limited to the women who wield it. As Rubio so brilliantly elucidates, animals are powerful magicians too. Subversive pigeons and hungry jaguars are called upon in  Tunnels,  and a lonely little girl runs free with a resurrected saber-toothed tiger in  Burial.  A colorful catalog of gallery exhibits from animals in therapy is featured in  Art Show,  including the Almost Philandering Fox, who longs after the red pelt of another, and the recently rehabilitated Paranoid Peacocks. Brimming with sharp wit and ferocious female intuition, these stories bubble over into the titular novella,  Maria, Maria  a tropigoth family drama set in a reimagined California rainforest that explores the legacies of three Marias, and possibly all Marias. Writing in prose so lush it threatens to creep off the page, Rubio emerges as an ineffable new voice in contemporary short fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ibs2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thought power, its control and culture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHwlqAAACAAJ&dq=Thought+power,+its+control+and+culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewelry: Ancient To Modern","description":"\\"Written by a team of the Gallery's own curators and visiting experts, Jewelry -- Ancient to Modern describes more than 700 pieces in special sections devoted to the Ancient near East, Egypt, Etruria, Greece, South Russia (Olbia), the Roman Empire, the nomadic tribes of the Migration Period, the Byzantine Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries.\\"--Page 2 of cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MD09AQAAIAAJ&dq=Jewelry:+Ancient+To+Modern&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

The preface to the collection contends that any gain in territory for individual states through a disregard of treaty agreements will mar the honor of the United States. A message from John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, presented to the National Council and Committee of that nation in July of 1830, discusses the impact of Georgia extending its oppressive laws over the Cherokee territory and President Jackson's refusal to interfere. He suggests that the nation organize for further legal effort in the hope that the U.S. will eventually honor its agreements. Also included is an address by the Council and Committee of the Cherokee Nation to the people of the United States, a final plea for aid against forcible removal. The Cherokees elaborate on the legal efforts of the nation to avoid removal, such as encouraging Jackson and Congress to uphold treaties and laws that would protect the Cherokees from the encroachment of Georgia. The address examines the political relationship between whites and Cherokees from first contact to the present in order to show the legitimacy of the Cherokees' case. They also emphasize that the majority of their people do not want to emigrate and that this has been publicly misrepresented to further political aims. The address is followed by an article from the Massachusetts Journal concerning Andrew Jackson and the Indians which criticizes the President for not doing his duty in upholding U.S. laws and shows the hypocrisy of Georgia for desiring to recognize the fraudulent Treaty of Indian Springs (U.S. and Creeks, 1825) but refusing to abide by official compacts with the Cherokees. Lastly, the opinion of William Wirt, former U.S. Attorney General, dated June 20, 1830, is presented. Wirt argues that the Cherokee Nation is a sovereign nation, that it is not within the jurisdiction of Georgia, that Georgia has no right to extend its laws over the Cherokees and that the laws of Georgia are unconstitutional and void.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SabyjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Removal+of+the+Cherokee+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","description":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit is one of the most powerful books you could ever read.

Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering and the indomitable will of the human spirit. For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone. For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received. But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin barely of age herself finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours. Praise for Doomsday Book  A stunning novel that encompasses both suffering and hope. . . . The best work yet from one of science fiction s best writers.  The Denver Post  Splendid work brutal, gripping and genuinely harrowing, the product of diligent research, fine writing and well-honed instincts, that should appeal far beyond the normal science-fiction constituency.  Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  The world of 1348 burns in the mind s eye, and every character alive that year is a fully recognized being. . . . It becomes possible to feel . . . that Connie Willis did, in fact, over the five years Doomsday Book took her to write, open a window to another world, and that she saw something there.

While practical in orientation, the book is based solidly on empirical evidence.Building on the success of the previous edition this handbook has been extensively revised in a number of ways. Throughout the book, the text, references, and website addresses and have been updated to reflect important developments since the publication the first edition. Recent research findings on the epidemiology, aetiology, course, outcome, assessment and treatment of all psychological problems considered in this volume have been incorporated into the text.

Each of the chapters on clinical problems explains how to assess and treat the condition in an evidence-based way with reference to case material. Interventions from cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic, interpersonal/systemic and biomedical approaches are described, where there is evidence that they are effective for the problem in question. Skill building exercises and further reading for psychologists and patients are included at the end of each chapter. This book is one of a set of three volumes which cover the lion's share of the curriculum for clinical psychologists in training in the UK and Ireland.

But from his first visit to Paris, Craig knew he had found the city of his dreams, although one thing was still missing-the good ol' American breakfast he loved so much. Pancakes in Paris is the story of Craig tackling the impossible-from raising the money to fund his dream to tracking down international suppliers for \\"exotic\\" American ingredients... and even finding love along the way.

By 1945, it was a drab and exhausted city, beginning the long haul back to recovery. The defiant capital of England had always been Hitler's prime target. The last months of the Second World War saw the final phase of the battle of London as the enemy unleashed its new vengeance weapons, the flying bombs and rockets. They were terrifying and brought destruction on a vast scale, but fortunately came too late to dent morale seriously. The people of London were showing the spirit, courage, and resilience that had earned them the admiration of the world during a long siege. In the harshest winter of fifty years, they were living in primitive conditions. Thousands were homeless, living in the Underground and deep shelters. Women lined up for horse meat and were lucky to obtain one egg a month. They besieged emergency coal dumps. Everyone longed for peace. The bright new world seemed elusive. As the victory celebrations passed into memory, there were severe hardships and all the problems of post-war adjustment. Women lost the independence the war had lent them, husbands and wives had to learn to live together again, and children had a lot of catching up to do. Yet London's loss has often been its opportunity. Its people had eagerly embraced plans for a modern metropolis and an end to poverty. They voted overwhelmingly for a Labour government and the new, fairer social order that was their reward for all they had endured. The year of victory, 1945, represents an important chapter in London's---and Britain's---long history. Acclaimed historian Maureen Waller draws on a rich array of primary sources, letting the people tell their own story, to re-create that moment, bringing to it the social insight at which she excels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CeEKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Troubleshooting and Repairing Major Appliances","description":"Diagnose and repair home appliances and air conditioners using the latest techniques \\"The book has it all...written by a pro with 40 years of hands-on repair and teaching experience...this book is like brain candy\\"--GeekDad (Wired.com) Fully updated for current technologies and packed with hundreds of photos and diagrams, this do-it-yourself guide shows you how to safely install, operate, maintain, and fix gas and electric appliances of all types.

In this book Sergius Bulgakov refutes the Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception and discusses the Orthodox veneration of the Mother of God. The Burning Bush is a consideration of the personal sinlessness of Mary, the truth of which Bulgakov fi nds grounded in both Gospel witness and the liturgical tradition of the church. Though his most controversial legacy to the theological community, Bulgakov s Sophiology nevertheless is critical to understanding his Mariology. This volume is more than mere sophiological speculation, however, as anthropology, eschatology, original sin, human sanctity, and sexuality all fi nd their way into Bulgakov s exploration of the mystery of the woman chosen by God to give birth freely to the Christ. / In this book, unique in the Russian Orthodox literature, the great theologian Sergius Bulgakov illuminates various aspects of the Church s veneration of the Mother of God. Like all of Bulgakov s devotional books, this is not a work of abstract theologizing, but a work of prayer, opening up a vision of the mystical reality that forms the foundation of our relations to the Ever-Virgin and her relation to us. Thomas Allan Smith s translation is superb, and in his first-rate introduction he does an excellent job of elucidating Bulgakov s sophiological approach. Boris Jakim / Thomas Allan Smith and Eerdmans deserve an immense debt of gratitude for providing a long-awaited English translation of this pivotal work of the leading Russian Orthodox theologian of the twentieth century. Even more, Smith s translation is careful, nuanced, and yet preeminently readable. . . . Western Christians and non-Christians alike often see Orthodoxy as a fascinating, exotic, and mysterious form of Christianity. The Burning Bush, in Smith s translation, helps the reader recognize both Orthodoxy s inner coherence and rationality and its rootedness in a profoundly sublime appreciation of creation s beauty and magnificence. . . . Smith s list of Bulgakov s sources is a simple yet indispensable tool for the scholarly reader. This translation will serve us all well for decades to come.

From the moment the myth-infused character El Pachuco burst onto the stage, cutting his way through the drop curtain with a switchblade, Luis Valdez spurred a revolution in Chicano theater. Focusing on the events surrounding the Sleepy Lagoon Murder Trial of 1942 and the ensuing Zoot Suit Riots that turned Los Angeles into a bloody war zone, this is a gritty and vivid depiction of the horrifying violence and racism suffered by young Mexican Americans on the home front during World War II. Valdez?s cadre of young urban characters struggle with the stereotypes and generalizations of America?s dominant culture, the questions of assimilation and patriotism, and a desire to rebel against the mainstream pressures that threaten to wipe them out. Experimenting with brash forms of narration, pop culture of the war era, and complex characterizations, this quintessential exploration of the Mexican-American experience in the United States during the 1940?s was the first, and only, Chicano play to open on Broadway. This collection contains three of playwright and screenwriter Luis Valdez?s most important and recognized plays: Zoot Suit, Bandido! and I Don?t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges. The anthology also includes an introduction by noted theater critic Dr. Jorge Huerta of the University of California-San Diego. Luis Valdez, the most recognized and celebrated Hispanic playwright of our times, is the director of the famous farm-worker theater, El Teatro Campesino.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_jpytdTx0TIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","description":"The general topic of this volume is education on its intellectual side.

P. Putnams Sons New York London The Knickerbocker Press 1927 WILLIAM TIIK SK ON1 To His Subjects PREFACE THIS book is a portrait of William the Second no more it presents neither his epoch, nor the whole story of his life. That it is too soon for such a delineation can scarcely be maintained in the seven years since his abdication the pace of events, the overthrow of accepted forms of govern ment, have brought to light a greater quantity of relevant documents than seven decades would hitherto have afforded us. In these years, some twenty volumes of German memoirs, together with the remarkable series of German Foreign Office Papers, have laid bare the greater part of what had been kept secret until now. To the illumination thus obtained, even the solitary missing link a volume from Prince Billows pen could add but little. Of William the Second, then, we know in these days not too little, but too much. His chronicler must forget the full extent of his own knowledge the details seen and heard by him, as a contemporary he must sacrifice a hundred anecdotes of which historians in the future will assuredly make use. For fairness sake, at any rate, we here design to let no adversary of the Emperor bear witness, but to construct our portrait wholly from his own deeds and words, together with the reports of those who stood in close relation to him, and who give strikingly similar answers to the psychical questions involved. In the following pages neither Socialist nor alien voices will be heard only tlie voices of the Emperor, his relatives and friends, his Chan cellors, Ministers, and Generals, his courtiers and officials. All these documents and reports are to be found in well-known works. As sources, they have sometimes been quoted more fully than was desirable for the flow of the narrative in such special instances the present chronicler has often felt obliged to repress his more summary judg ment in favour of the individual opinions of eye-witnesses, thus guarding himself against the reproach of a one-sided interpretation. The one liberty occasionally taken by the author has been the modulation of indirectly reported conversations into dialogue form. There is but a limited appeal to the oral testimony of participators in the events. The War-years, to which the youngest reader can bear witness, receive the least extended treatment for they were merely the logical epilogue to the psychological prologue. In short, this is an attempt to trace from the idiosyn crasies of a monarch the direct evolution of international political events from his essential nature, the course of his countrys destiny. Hence there is a twofold purpose in this presentation of the story of one human beings life The realization of what may befall a mentally gifted, physically disabled young man, inspired by the best in tentions, when after an adolescence fruitful in stern ex periences he suddenly attains to power, and finds no one who will speak the truth to him. It is so that the Law of Succession may too early lead a youth, untaught, untrained, to that exalted station where, surrounded by Court-flat terers, he all too easily becomes an overweening autocrat.

It is not preachy or new-agey nor affiliated with any religious or specific spiritual point of view. It is straight-forward and written for the mass market. The intention of this book is to teach, in a straightforward and clear way how and why to meditate. With no background or training, the reader can, after completing the book in one or two sessions, begin meditating. This book emphasizes brevity and practicality.The central point of this book is that meditation is about the practice of focusing on process and not results -- that meditation is not about achieving or performing. Many people, even regular meditators, are under the mistaken impression that to meditate correctly means to keep the mind focused on something (an anchor) or to clear the mind. In fact, the benefits of meditation come from the mindset that it is not important how long you stay focused on an anchor in between wanderings of the mind and overall during the course of a meditation. This book explains this point of view and makes very clear the relationship between how to meditate, including this mindset, and the benefits that come from meditating. The reader will learn that meditation is about practicing the focus on process without worrying about the results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i80FAAAACAAJ&dq=Feel+Better+Now:+Meditation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up With Jessica","description":"Inspiring true story.

The world has changed since then. Today it is clear that \\"good old-fashioned AI,\\" based on the idea of using symbolic representations to produce general intelligence, is in decline (although several believers still pursue its pot of gold), and the focus of the Al community has shifted to more complex models of the mind. It has also become more common for AI researchers to seek out and study philosophy. For this edition of his now classic book, Dreyfus has added a lengthy new introduction outlining these changes and assessing the paradigms of connectionism and neural networks that have transformed the field. At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly studied. Dreyfus's arguments are still provocative and focus our attention once again on what it is that makes human beings unique.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7vS2y-mQmpAC&dq=What+Computers+Still+Can%27t+Do:+A+Critique+of+Artificial+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Canon and Its Critics","description":"Traces the history of canonical criticism and assesses current trends in biblical analysis, and explores the relationship between contemporary interpretations of holy texts and their ancient meanings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoZKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People of the talisman (Ace double)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tiZoGQAACAAJ&dq=People+of+the+talisman+(Ace+double)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antique firearms: Their care, repair, and restoration","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9qTLPwAACAAJ&dq=Antique+firearms:+Their+care,+repair,+and+restoration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Francais Courant I","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=38J1swEACAAJ&dq=Le+Francais+Courant+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Athanasius on the Incarnation: The Treatise De Incarnatione Verbi Dei","description":"\\"New edition, revised, with a letter of St. Athanasius on the interpretation of the Psalms added as an appendix.\\" Includes bibliographical references.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sbynjQaK-04C&dq=St.+Athanasius+on+the+Incarnation:+The+Treatise+De+Incarnatione+Verbi+Dei&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Mary Tyler Moore","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jzkmAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Real+Mary+Tyler+Moore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tools of Navigation: A Kid's Guide to the History & Science of Finding Your Way (Tools of Discovery series)","description":"Discusses the history of navigation, how past and current navigational equipment works, and how to practice navigation from home using different pieces of equipment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H8kGywAACAAJ&dq=Tools+of+Navigation:+A+Kid%27s+Guide+to+the+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Collector's World of Inkwells","description":"Featuring over 1,000 photographs of inkwells and inkstands from circa 1750 to 1920 by makers in the United States, Europe, and Asia, including Tiffany, Wedgwood, Quimper, Staffordshire, Sandwich and Vaseline glass, majolica, art pottery, faience, milk glass, and Delft.

Hers is a story little discussed in Native American history books. Instead, much of what is known of her has been passed down through generations via stories and legends. For example, it is said that she was embued with supernatural powers, given to her by the gods. She would lift her arms to the sky and place her palms against the wind, and through the heat she felt in her open hands, she could detect the direction and distance of her enemies. Whether true or not, she did ride into battle alongside Geronimo in the Apache wars, and fought bitterly and savagely until she was captured along with her people, packed into railroad cars, and sent to imprisonment in the east, where she spent her last days. Peter Aleshire uses historical facts and oral histories to recreate her life. With immaculate detail he tells the story of her childhood, surrounded by the vastness of nature and the Chiricahua legends and religions that shaped her thoughts. He describes her coming-of-age ceremonies, and induction into her tribe as a spiritual leader. As the white men slowly took over the land of her people and forced them from one reservation to another, her role slowly evolved to match that of the staunchest warrior -- an almost unheard-of occurence among the Native Americans of the 19th century, where a woman's place was with the children in the villages. This is not only the story of Lozen, but the story of her people, from the events leading up to the Apache Wars until their inevitable and unfortunate conclusion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BadvCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bushwhackers 01","description":"After their parents are murdered by a band of marauding Yankees, Win and Joe Coulter join William Quantrill and his gang of bloodthirsty raiders to seek revenge on the attackers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3w4QDSl-FykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chaotic Elections! A Mathematician Looks at Voting","description":"What does the 2000 U.S. presidential election have in common with selecting a textbook for a calculus course in your department? Was Ralph Nader's influence on the election of George W. Bush greater than the now-famous chads? In Chaotic Elections!, Don Saari analyzes these questions, placing them in the larger context of voting systems in general. His analysis shows that the fundamental problems with the 2000 presidential election are not with the courts, recounts, or defective ballots, but are caused by the very way Americans vote for president. This expository book shows how mathematics can help to identify and characterize a disturbingly large number of paradoxical situations that result from the choice of a voting procedure. Moreover, rather than being able to dismiss them as anomalies, the likelihood of a dubious election result is surprisingly large. These consequences indicate that election outcomes--whether for president, the site of the next Olympics, the chair of a university department, or a prize winner--can differ from what the voters really wanted. They show that by using an inadequate voting procedure, we can, inadvertently, choose badly. To add to the difficulties, it turns out that the mathematical structures of voting admit several strategic opportunities, which are described. Finally, mathematics also helps identify positive results: By using mathematical symmetries, we can identify what the phrase \`\`what the voters really want'' might mean and obtain a unique voting method that satisfies these conditions. Saari's book should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand not only what happened in the presidential election of 2000, but also how we can avoid similar problems from appearing anytime any group is making a choice using a voting procedure. Reading this book requires little more than high school mathematics and an interest in how the apparently simple situation of voting can lead to surprising paradoxes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MqWPngEACAAJ&dq=Chaotic+Elections!+A+Mathematician+Looks+at+Voting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An invitation to arithmetic geometry (Graduate studies in mathematics)","description":"Extremely carefully written, masterfully thought out, and skillfully arranged introduction   to the arithmetic of algebraic curves, on the one hand, and to the algebro-geometric aspects of number theory, on the other hand.   an excellent guide for beginners in arithmetic geometry, just as an interesting reference and methodical inspiration for teachers of the subject   a highly welcome addition to the existing literature.

Through this new friendship, he is introduced to the drawing-rooms of high society and finds love in an unexpected quarter. Then, suddenly, he vanishes without a trace. Alarmed, his sister, Charlotte, sets out from their crumbling country estate determined to find him. In the sinister, labyrinthine London that greets her, she uncovers a hidden, supernatural city populated by unforgettable characters: a female rope walker turned vigilante, a street urchin with a deadly secret, and the chilling  Doctor Knife.

This gives the subject an interest that stretches far beyond the shores of America itself. For over fifty years knowledge of these ships has relied heavily on the works of Howard Chapelle, a practical naval architect with a fine understanding of design, but an amateur historian who was less than professional in his use of sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_BJUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sailing+Warships+of+the+Us+Navy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3e Bccp, Indochine, 1948-1950: 3e Bataillon Colonial de Commandos Parachutistes (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No turning back","description":" Rania Abouzeid has produced a work of stunning reportage from the very heart of the conflict, daring to go to the most dangerous places in order to get the story.   Dexter Filkins, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Forever War Award-winning journalist Rania Abouzeid dissects the tangle of ideologies and allegiances that make up the Syrian conflict through the dramatic stories of four young people seeking safety and freedom in a shattered country.

Sinclair wrote the novel to portray the lives of immigrants in the United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities. Many readers were most concerned with his exposure of health violations and unsanitary practices in the American meatpacking industry during the early 20th century, based on an investigation he did for a socialist newspaper. The book depicts working class poverty, the lack of social supports, harsh and unpleasant living and working conditions, and a hopelessness among many workers. These elements are contrasted with the deeply rooted corruption of people in power. A review by the writer Jack London called it, \\"the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery.\\" Sinclair was considered a muckraker, or journalist who exposed corruption in government and business. He first published the novel in serial form in 1905 in the Socialist newspaper, Appeal to Reason, between February 25, 1905, and November 4, 1905. In 1904, Sinclair had spent seven weeks gathering information while working incognito in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper. It was published as a book on February 26, 1906 by Doubleday and in a subscribers' edition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NdQoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","description":"Angry Warrior, Modern Man...

But the sky is marred by two conspicuous columns of smoke, replacing pleasurable anticipation with alarm and suspicion. One smoke column is the result of an overnight fire that has damaged the master's outbuildings. The second column rises from the wooded edge of the village, sent up by newcomers to announce their presence. In the minds of the wary villagers a mere coincidence of events appears to be unlikely, with violent confrontation looming as the unavoidable outcome. Meanwhile, another newcomer has recently been spotted taking careful notes and making drawings of the land. It is his presence more than any other that will threaten the village's entire way of life.

Released in 1946, Howard Hawks' adaptation of Raymond Chandler reunited Bogart and Bacall and gave them two of their most famous roles. The mercurial but ever-manipulative Hawks dredged humour and happiness out of film noir. 'Give him a story about more murders than anyone can keep up with, or explain,' David Thomson writes in his compelling study of the film, 'and somehow he made a paradise.' When it was first shown to a military audience The Big Sleep was coldly received. So, as Thomson reveals, Hawks shot extra scenes, 'fun' scenes, to replace one in which the film's murders had been explained, and in so doing left the plot unresolved. Thomson argues that, if this was accidental, it also signalled a change in the nature of Hollywood cinema: 'The Big Sleep inaugurates a post-modern, camp, satirical view of movies being about other movies that extends to the New Wave and Pulp Fiction.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pu7_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Big+Sleep+(BFI+Film+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Computer Networking","description":"Schaum's Outline of Computer Networking introduces the underlying concepts, principles, and terminology of computer networks.

He had been an accomplished photographer and internationally known, yet at age seventy, he finds he has outlived his celebrity, his friends and worst of all his investments. For him, suicide is a reasonable solution. A young medical student inadvertently intervenes, robbing the old man of his graceful escape, and, as an act of contrition, decides to employ the legendary 13 GHOST POINTS of the ancient art of acupuncture to try and revive him. As each of the thirteen needles penetrates the old man's flesh, a memory held in that region of the body springs in vivid detail into Randolph's unconscious mind, allowing him to once again experience the passions in his past. GHOST POINTS is an end of life crisis, a story of how one man is allowed to retrieve the moments of his life that have been obscured by the passage of time and buried under the weight of disappointment, to understand, to know and to finally believe that he had not failed, but rather had the experience of a truly remarkable life. The ancient Chinese believed that the demons of memory are held in the body and can be retrieved by means of acupuncture.

Arun, a young man of privileged background, leaves his home in the prosperous north of his Southeast Asian island nation to teach in the devastated south, where a civil war between the military and rebel insurgents profoundly affects daily life. Idealistic and driven by a need to give meaning to his life, Arun relinquishes the trappings of wealth to dedicate himself to improving the lot of the \\"2 percenters,\\" as the country's southern population is called. Over the course of several months he befriends some of the local people-Jaisaram, the local butcher, and his daughter Anjani, who reads to her father from romance novels; Kumarsingh, a \\"go-getting\\" entrepreneur; Seth, an American-trained army captain stationed at the local base; and various pupils. In Omeara, however, nothing is as it seems; everyone has secrets and truth is elusive. At the village school, attendance is meager and irregular. The only students who attend are those who, damaged by the conflict, are incapable of working in the fields. Surrounded by poverty and the constant threat of violence, Arun's optimism is eventually depleted and frustration with educating the village's schoolchildren overwhelms him. When violence finally touches him personally, he is forced to confront basic truths about his friends, his family, his country and, most wrenchingly, himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5LanqJOS_PkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY","description":"Place- and community-based education  an approach to teaching and learning that starts with the local  addresses two critical gaps in the experience of many children now growing up in the United States: contact with the natural world and contact with community.

Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, was induced to the task by the first President s nephew, Bushrod Washington. Marshall s own principal biographer, Albert J. Beveridge, has described The Life of George Washington as  to this day the fullest and most trustworthy treatment of that period from the conservative point of view.  In fact, so significant is the biography that Marshall later executed a one-volume abridgment, first published in 1838 and used widely for generations in American schools and colleges. The twentieth and final version of the abridgement, published in 1849, is the text reproduced in the new Liberty Fund edition of what Charles A. Beard has praised as a  great  and  masterly  biography. The editors  foreword and notes, together with maps of major battle campaigns not included in the original edition, make this edition especially attractive for classroom use. The Appendices include Washington s Speech to the Officers of the Army (15 March 1783), Address to Congress on Resigning Commission (23 December 1783), Letter to Congress Transmitting Proposed Constitution (17 September 1787), First Inaugural Address (30 April 1789), and Farewell Address (19 September 1796).

Yet not everyone is accepting the status quo. In Bridge Builders: Bringing People Together in a Polarized Age, journalist Nathan Bomey paints a forensic portrait of Americans who are spanning gaping divides between people of difference. From clergy fighting racism in Charlottesville to a former Republican congressman engaging conservatives on climate change and Appalachian journalists restoring social trust with the public, these countercultural leaders all believe in the power of forging lasting connections to bring about profound change. Though the blueprints for political, social, and cultural bridges vary widely, bridge builders have much in common and we have much to learn from them. In this book, Bomey dissects the transformational ways in which bridge builders are combatting polarization by pursuing reconciliation, rejecting misinformation, and rethinking the principle of compromise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TGUuEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses","description":"The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses contains one of the most comprehensive listings and descriptions of Egyptian deities.

He then discusses the impact of this cultural revolution on the creativity of major Romantic writers, focusing especially on William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Coleridge, Clare, Keats, Hazlitt and Hunt. In readings which engage current debates around literature and travel, landscape aesthetics, ecocriticism, the poetics of gender, and the materiality of Romantic discourse, Jarvis demonstrates how walking became not only a powerful means of self-enfranchisement but also the focus of restless textual energies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nEGHDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Web Cam Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"La Verdadera Historia de los Tres Cerditos!

Although several major battles were fought in the state between Confederate and Union forces, much of the fighting in Missouri was an ugly form of terrorism carried out by loose bands of Missouri guerrillas, by Kansas \\"Jayhawkers,\\" or by marauding patrols of Union soldiers. This irregular warfare provided a training ground for people like Jesse and Frank James who, after the war, used their newly learned skills to form an outlaw band that ultimately became known all over the world. Jesse James and the Civil War in Missouri discusses the underlying causes of the Civil War as they relate to Missouri and reveals how the war helped create both the legend and the reality of Jesse James and his gang.

Since the 1950s, these flashy restyled automobiles have occupied a unique place in American popular mythology. Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture checks out this particularly male subculture with an up-close look at customized car art and the artists who create it. Through amazing technical mastery, coupled with a uniquely American imagination, these motorheads transform mass-produced products of industry into unique hand-crafted pieces of art called \\"rods\\" and \\"customs.\\" This first full-length study to focus on the practice of hot rodding and car customizing argues not only that this \\"kustom kulture\\" deserves consideration as a source of legitimate art forms but also that the rise of American car customizing reflects the attitudes and ideas of the teen culture that emerged in the 1950s. While tracing the evolution of styles, this book examines specific cars and the progression of car culture through the 1990s. Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture argues moreover that in this car art the theories of modernism meld with popular culture. In their beauty, in the sophistication of their designs, and in their formal play, these transformed, re-imagined cars parallel the ideas, techniques, and achievement of high-art modernists. And as high art progresses into postmodernism, so too does customized car culture. Despite the longevity and the magnitude of Kustom Kulture, this far-reaching contribution to American art has largely been ignored by mainstream critics. While postulating the cause of this anomaly, this book questions what is meant by art and how preconceived notions of gender, race, and class often prevent the recognition of creativity in places where imagination is not anticipated. John F. DeWitt, an associate professor of English and the acting director of the liberal arts program at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, is the author of several books of poetry.

Following Je Tsongkhapa's (1357-1419 C.E.) text Having the Three Convictions, Lama Yeshe introduces the renowned Six Yogas of Naropa, focusing mainly on the first of these six, the practice of inner fire (tummo). Mastery of inner fire quickly brings the mind to its most refined and penetrating state--the experience of clear light, an extra-ordinarily powerful state of mind that is unequaled in its ability to directly realize ultimate reality. Lama Yeshe felt that twentieth-century Westerners could easily grasp the often misunderstood ideas of this esoteric tradition: \\"We really need tantra these days because there is a tremendous explosion of delusion and distraction.and we need the atomic energy of inner fire to blast us out of our delusion.\\" Lama Yeshe's aim was for his students to actually taste the experience of inner fire rather than merely gain an intellectual understanding. Lama's own realization of the transformative power of these practices comes through, inspiring his students to discover for themselves their own capacity for inexhaustible bliss.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IhPtIBEhGtYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grip Book, Third Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Guide to Grand Canyon National Park and Vicinity (Grand Canyon Association)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wisconsin Lore","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tLhPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Wisconsin+Lore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Janes's Fighting Ships 1969-1970","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q-TcswEACAAJ&dq=Janes%27s+Fighting+Ships+1969-1970&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2004 New Car Price Guide (Consumer Guide New Car Price Guide)","description":"A comprehensive guide to new car prices features the manufacturer's suggested retail price, a dealer invoice price, a recommended low price, standard equipment and options, and EPA fuel economy estimates for more than 130 new passenger cars, minivans, and sport utility vehicles.

His nutrient-rich eating plan can have a significant impact on your child's resistance to dangerous infections, and a dramatic effect on reducing the occurrence of illnesses like asthma, ear infections, and allergies. Dr. Fuhrman explains how you can make sure your children are eating right to maintain a healthy mind and body, and how eating certain foods and avoiding others can positively impact your child's IQ and success in school.

They vividly demonstrate that, contrary to current macroeconomic preoccupations, continued growth on a planet of finite resources cannot be physically or economically sustained and is morally undesirable. Among the issues addressed are population growth, resource use, pollution, theology (east and west), energy, and economic growth. Their common theme is the notion, popular with classical economists from Malthus to Mill, that an economic stationary state is more healthful to life on earth than unlimited growth.

But for Jehovah s Witnesses Lawrence and Brad, it s a time for them to try to explain  the truth  about this holiday season to the people of the community. Their earnest efforts may earn them ridicule, disagreement, or a door slammed rudely in their faces, but they persist and are sometimes able to find a mind and heart receptive to their urgent message about Jehovah s coming Kingdom. Whereas for Elders Skousen and Marshall two Latter-day Saint (Mormon) missionaries the season is another opportunity to share their Church s distinctive interpretation of the Christian gospel; but their efforts are often rebuffed, as well. In the course of their work, these two pairs of men engage in dialogue with traditional Christians, as well as members of the Church of Christ; the Community of Christ (RLDS); Seventh-day Adventists; and  Oneness  Pentecostals not to mention skeptics, atheists, and the increasing numbers of people who lack any particular religious beliefs. But when a local church brings in a researcher to give a series of lectures on  Cults  and specifically targeting the Jehovah s Witnesses and Mormons a confrontation is ensured, where theological and biblical concepts collide in a public forum. Who, if anyone, really has  the Truth ? Can one still discover the  true meaning of Christmas  in the midst of passionate disagreements over the validity of the holiday season? Are objections raised about the secularization and rampant commercialism of the modern celebration valid? Spend a holiday season (or any other season) with some interesting and intellectually-stimulating characters, as they explore these and other challenging questions. (Readers of the author s earlier novel, A Multicultural Christmas, will be pleased to see a brief reappearance of two characters from that book.)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l43TNUB6gbAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ru0YtAEACAAJ&dq=A+short+history+of+the+world+(The+thinker%27s+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art afterpieces","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=etkgNQAACAAJ&dq=Art+afterpieces&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suck: Worst-Case Scenarios in Media, Culture, Advertising, and the Internet (Hardwired)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mahatma Gandhi in a Cadillac","description":"The adventures of a young couple in the 1960s.

In all of her remarkable books, she delves with tireless enthusiasm into her research and writing, ensuring each recipe's authenticity and accessibility. In The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean, she brings readers and cooks into the kitchens that produce the healthy home cooking that is the trademark of such lands as Macedonian, Turkey, Syria, and the countries on the Black Sea. Wolfert's food dazzles the palate. Her book begins with recipes for sauces and dips, including two walnut and pomegranate sauces; soups include Anatolian Sour Soup and Macedonian \\"Green Cream.\\" Meat, poultry, and fish dishes include eleven varities of kibbeh, Duck with Quinces, and Skewered Swordfish. Her sumptuous recipes for vegetables and grains--stuffed eggplants, pilafs, and pomegranate-flavored vegetables, to name a few--reflect the bounty and healthful eating patterns of the Eastern Mediterranean. Wolfert's Middle Eastern grain salads are healthy and rich with flavor. Paula travels into the kitchens of native cooks to ensure that her recipes are as genuine as they are delicious. She takes us into the home of a friend in the Republic of Georgia, whose mother teaches Wolfert how to prepare Chicken Tabaka; to a mountain village in northern Greece where, with a sister food writer, she searches for fine cheese to complete a savory pie; and to a farm in Turkey, where the country's best bread baker tells her secrets of baking unleavened flat griddle bread. These delicious, authentic recipes focus on the healthy eating patterns for which the Eastern Mediterranean is increasingly being recognized.

He was growing older, and fears about death and infirmity were haunting him. So he decided to embark on mission to get to the bottom of his fears. Through a series of events that included a vision quest in a secluded cabin and studying with Sufi masters, Buddhist teachers and Native-American shamans, Reb Zalman found a way to turn aging into the most meangful and joyous time in his life. In this inspiring and informative guide, Reb Zalman shares his wisdom and experience with readers. He shows readers how to create an aging process for themselves that is full of adventure, passion, mystery, and fulfillment, rather than anxiety. Using scientific research--both neurological and psychological-- Reb Zalman offers techniques that will expand horizons beyond the narrow view of \\"the present\\" into a grand and enduring eternity. By harnessing the power of the spirit, as well as explaining exactly how to become a sage in their own community, he gives readers a helpful and moving way to use their own experiences to nurture, heal, and perhaps even save a younger generation from the prison of how we typically regard aging. In this updated version of his popular book, Reb Zalman has added a brand new introductory chapter that provides insight into the shifts that have taken place in our culture since the first edition of this book came out in the 1990s. Reb Zalman speaks candidly about the role the 78 million (now aging) Baby Boomers are currently playing in how we think about aging. He provides new inspiring ideas about the importance of an elder's role in shaping society, and explains how elders can embrace the power they have to provide value and wisdom to those around them. Additionally he has added a concluding chapter in which he shares his own experience with aging and the time he calls \\"The December Years.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I9hrngEACAAJ&dq=From+Age-ing+to+Sage-ing:+A+Profound+New+Vision+of+Growing+Older&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7 Application Development","description":"With a slew of advanced new features, ColdFusion MX 7 represents both an opportunity and a challenge for those developing Web apps with it.

To successfully manage this complicated and decentralised business, the Manhattan Company s directors had to be particularly sensitive the social and political environments.

Secured to the decks of these vessels were secret weapons to be deployed for the first time in modern warfare: two-man midget submarines, intended to enter Pearl Harbor without being detected and torpedo the US Navy battleships lying at anchor there. None of them would return from their mission.  One of the last remaining and persistent mysteries of the Pearl Harbor attack is that of the Japanese Midget Submarines. It is a fascinating story of innovation, courage, secrets, and failed expectations. And it is not only a story of the morning hours of December 7, but of the years before to develop these weapons and the years after, where they were deployed in the great Pacific War and how they fared as weapons of war.  These words by Daniel J. Basta, from the foreword of this work, capture both the essence and the impact of The Lost Submarines of Pearl Harbor. James P. Delgado and his coauthors have worked on the story of these incredible craft for decades. They combed the records of the US Navy and the recollections of its veterans as well as Japanese, Australian, and British archives in order to uncover the truth. They have logged hours of direct observation and research on the midget subs in their final resting places, in some cases more than 1,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific. And in the end, they have woven a tapestry of scholarship, historical sleuthing, scientific insight, and good storytelling that will enthrall specialists and history enthusiasts alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1YyEDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life in the pit;: The Deacon Jones story","description":"This biography of \\"Deacon\\" Jones, the Los Angeles Rams' defensive lineman, tells about his rise from the obscurity of a small Southern ghetto to become one of pro football's superstars.

These radical associations - sometimes dangerous, sometimes merely quirky - illuminate a dark part of the American psyche. In this encyclopedic work, John George and Laird Wilcox present a thorough and fair assessment of extremist groups on the periphery of the American political system. The authors begin by surveying the history of the extremist trend in America prior to 1960. They then delineate the general characteristics of extremism on both ends of the political spectrum, relate extremism to constitutional principles, and analyze the factors that motivate fringe-group members. The bulk of the book is devoted to an in-depth discussion of more than forty separate groups from the extreme right and left. The authors examine each group's history, beliefs, and current activities. The book concludes with a fascinating appendix on the use of fake quotes and fabricated documents, a common ploy of many extremist organizations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2vS3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Nazis,+Communists,+Klansmen,+and+Others+on+the+Fringe:+Political+Extremism+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One step, two","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"College-Level Examination Program Subject Test in Introductory Marketing: Test Preparation Study Guide (Rudman's Questions and Answers on the CLEP)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YN-1YgEACAAJ&dq=College-Level+Examination+Program+Subject+Test+in+Introductory+Marketing:+Test+Preparation+Study+Guide+(Rudman%27s+Questions+and+Answers+on+the+CLEP)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dominoes: Basic Rules & Variations","description":"\\"Beginners through experienced players receive tips to numerous games; from very simple games for kids to adult-oriented and advanced domino strategies.

After analyzing Job and his wife within medieval Christian theology of Eden, the author identifies ways in which Job's wife visually aligns with medieval images of Satan. The volume explores portrayals of Job and his wife in publications on marriage and gender roles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, moving onto an investigation of William Blake's sharp artistic divergence from the common tradition in his representation of Job's wife as a shrew. In the exploration of societal portrayals of Job and his Wife throughout history, this book discovers how arguments about marriage intertwine with not only gender roles, but also, with political, social, and historical movements.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xXZvAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirits Rebellious","description":"A clarion call for freedom from one of the twentieth century's most important philosophers and writers, Kahlil Gibran A book so powerful it was burned in the marketplace of Beirut at the time of its publication, Kahlil Gibran's 'Spirits Rebellious' is a clarion call for freedom in his homeland of Lebanon-for individuals and society.

To the Communist Party, which mounted the defense, the Scottsboro case was an ideal opportunity to unite issues of race and class. To jury after jury, the idea that nine black men had raped two white women on a train traveling through northern Alabama in 1931 was so self-evident that they found the Scottsboro boys guilty even after the U.S. Supreme Court had twice struck down the verdict and one of the \\"victims\\" had recanted. This innovative and grippingly narrated work of history tells the story of a case that marked a watershed in American racial justice. Or, rather, it tells several stories.

Perceptive, clever, and graphic --- Wright's instincts brand him as America's personal trainer at love. Wright's hand size (a full 11 1/4 inches spread) afforded him the ability to earn Sports Illustrated notoriety as a slam-dunk king. In two erotically raw volumes he gives tips that will have women in the palm of your hand (regardless of how many inches you're wielding). Wright's coaching a new team of men --- and, frankly fellows, she won't be trading you to another team after you read Wright's Straight Talk. Letter to Gerry Wright: Dear Mr. Wright, I went to a little book store called \\"Consider The Alternatives\\" on Thursday, April 19, looking for a book about relationships. I told Judy, the owner, that I have read many books to try to understand my man. And I couldn't seem to find one about women for men to read that wasn't just about sex. She called me at my home the very next day and left me a message that two books came in about the subject we were discussing and would I mind coming and taking them to read and review. I went to the store the very next day and read the cover letter, then the contents of the books. I immediately took them home to read. I am 2/3 through Volume 1 and I can't put it down. You must promote this book every where. Your book is heroic to all of us who have been criticized for saying the things you had the balls to say and say it straight. These two books must be marketed ASAP. Get the word out! Thank-you so much for your gift to men and women. Your reward is very great.

NPR From the woman who gave the landmark testimony against Clarence Thomas as a sexual menace, a new manifesto about the origins and course of gender violence in our society; a combination of memoir, personal accounts, law, and social analysis, and a powerful call to arms from one of our most prominent and poised survivors. In 1991, Anita Hill began something that's still unfinished work. The issues of gender violence, touching on sex, race, age, and power, are as urgent today as they were when she first testified. Believing is a story of America's three decades long reckoning with gender violence, one that offers insights into its roots, and paths to creating dialogue and substantive change. It is a call to action that offers guidance based on what this brave, committed fighter has learned from a lifetime of advocacy and her search for solutions to a problem that is still tearing America apart. We once thought gender-based violence--from casual harassment to rape and murder--was an individual problem that affected a few; we now know it's cultural and endemic, and happens to our acquaintances, colleagues, friends and family members, and it can be physical, emotional and verbal. Women of color experience sexual harassment at higher rates than White women. Street harassment is ubiquitous and can escalate to violence. Transgender and nonbinary people are particularly vulnerable. Anita Hill draws on her years as a teacher, legal scholar, and advocate, and on the experiences of the thousands of individuals who have told her their stories, to trace the pipeline of behavior that follows individuals from place to place: from home to school to work and back home. In measured, clear, blunt terms, she demonstrates the impact it has on every aspect of our lives, including our physical and mental wellbeing, housing stability, political participation, economy and community safety, and how our descriptive language undermines progress toward solutions. And she is uncompromising in her demands that our laws and our leaders must address the issue concretely and immediately.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hlhFEAAAQBAJ&dq=Believing+It+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The food of France","description":"The Food of France gives you a real taste of a country that has one of the world's great cuisines.

Neither mediation nor alternative dispute resolution, it has been called a  horizontal system of justice  because all participants are treated as equals with the purpose of preserving ongoing relationships and restoring harmony among involved parties. In peacemaking there is no coercion, and there are no  sides.  No one is labeled the offender or the victim, the plaintiff or the defendant. This is a book about peacemaking as it exists in the Navajo Nation today, describing its origins, history, context, and contributions with an eye toward sharing knowledge between Navajo and European-based criminal justice systems. It provides practitioners with information about important aspects of peacemaking such as structure, procedures, and outcomes that will be useful for them as they work with the Navajo courts and the peacemakers. It also offers outsiders the first one-volume overview of this traditional form of justice. The collection comprises insights of individuals who have served within the Navajo Judicial Branch, voices that authoritatively reflect peacemaking from an insider s point of view. It also features an article by Justice Sandra Day O Connor and includes contributions from other scholars who, with the cooperation of the Navajo Nation, have worked to bring a comparative perspective to peacemaking research. In addition, some chapters describe the personal journey through which peacemaking takes the parties in a dispute, demonstrating that its purpose is not to fulfill some abstract notion of Justice but to restore harmony so that the participants are returned to good relations. Navajo Nation Peacemaking seeks to promote both peacemaking and Navajo common law development. By establishing the foundations of the Navajo way of natural justice and offering a vision for its future, it shows that there are many lessons offered by Navajo peacemaking for those who want to approach old problems in sensible new ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GZMlEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bedford Introduction to Drama (Third Edition)","description":"Text & Presentation is an annual publication devoted to all aspects of theatre scholarship.

Architect Howard Roark is as unyielding as the granite he blasts to build with. Defying the conventions of the world around him, he embraces a battle over two decades against a double-dealing crew of rivals who will stop at nothing to bring him down. These include, perhaps most troublesome of all, the ambitious Dominique Francon, who may just prove to be Roarke's equal. This epic story of money, power and a man's struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity's creative potential. First published in 1943, The Fountainhead introduced millions to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: an uncompromising defence of self-interest as the engine of progress, and a jubilant celebration of man's creative potential. Ayn Rand (1905-1982), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual. If you enjoued The Fountainhead, you might like Rand's Atlas Shrugged, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

Originating in Franklin, Missouri, the Santa Fe Trail was the first and most exotic of America's great trans-Mississippi pathways to the west. Although the era of the trail ceased, its glory-days are still part of the collective imagination of America. Complete with directions, maps, anecdotes, and historical information, Following the Santa Fe Trail takes the traveler on an authentic historic journey. Modern paved highways now parallel much of the old wagon route and with this guide a modern adventurer can retrace large sections of the trail.

The easy kind, practiced by ants, shrimp, Welsh corgis -- and us -- is innate. What innate calculating skills do we humans have? Leaving aside built-in mathematics, such as the visual system, ordinary people do just fine when faced with mathematical tasks in the course of the day. Yet when they are confronted with the same tasks presented as \\"math,\\" their accuracy often drops. But if we have innate mathematical ability, why do we have to teach math and why do most of us find it so hard to learn? Are there tricks or strategies that the ordinary person can do to improve mathematical ability? Can we improve our math skills by learning from dogs, cats, and other creatures that \\"do math\\"? The answer to each of these questions is a qualified yes. All these examples of animal math suggest that if we want to do better in the formal kind of math, we should see how it arises from natural mathematics.

Betsy, on the other hand, is sweet and flirty--and seems to have attracted most of the bachelors in Lancaster County!

Thompson's Psychoanalysis: Evolution and Development, first published in 1950, remains an enormously fair-minded discussion of the history of psychoanalytic theory and therapy. Psychoanalysis has always been a theory of personality as well as a technique of therapy. Since Freud was born in 1856, and was an outstanding representative of the culture of old Vienna, Thompson thought there was plenty of room for revising classical analytic thinking in light of later developments. Such revisionism, she believed, need not lose the essential appreciation of the dynamic unconscious within classical analysis. However, Thompson felt Freud's biological outlook needed to be supplemented by a culturally more sophisticated orientation, and she was among those who tried to put Freud's concepts of libido into historical perspective. Instead of psychoanalysis having as its objective the release of tensions, Thompson proposed that the goal of analysis ought to be the growth of the total personality. Her revisionism also meant that the scope of psychoanalytic treatment could be broadened well beyond the neuroses Freud sought to explain. Thompson well understood the impact of the social environment on character formation. The psychology of women needed to be rethought; differences between men and women could be partly explained by the social expectations that traditional Western culture had imposed on them. Thompson believed the whole analyst-patient relationship needed to be rethought; the real personality of the therapist has to be acknowledged, and the full human interplay between patient and analyst required examination. In the current positivistic therapeutic climate based on technological advances in psychopharmacology, the ethical and humanistic dimension may be lost. Reflecting on the work of Clara Thompson and the neo-Freudian school can remind us of earlier efforts to challenge therapeutic authority and their distinct relevance to our problems today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3JtYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Convent Life: Roman Catholic Religious Orders for Women in North America (roman catholic religious orders for women of north america)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_1DZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Convent+Life:+Roman+Catholic+Religious+Orders+for+Women+in+North+America+(roman+catholic+religious+orders+for+women+of+north+america)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geography: Realms, Regions and Concepts, 10th Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The First Year of Marriage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oh, you Tex!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZAhmzgEACAAJ&dq=Oh,+you+Tex!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vietnam, Lotus in a Sea of Fire: A Buddhist Proposal for Peace.","description":"This stunning commentary on the cultural and political background to the war in Vietnam resonates deeply as the first work of Vietnamese writer, peace activist, and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh This rare book from 1967 is one of the very few written in English giving a Vietnamese perspective on the Indochina Wars. Many years ahead of its time, Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire will be welcomed by historians and readers of contemporary Vietnamese narratives. As war raged in Vietnam, the Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh became a leading figure in the Buddhist peace movement. With the help of friends like Catholic monk Thomas Merton, he published Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire in 1967 in the US (and underground in Vietnam as Hoa Sen Trong Bi?n L?a), his uncompromising and radical call for peace. It gave voice to the majority of Vietnamese people who did not take sides and who wanted the bombing to stop. Thomas Merton wrote the foreword, believing it had the power to show Americans that the more America continued to bomb Vietnam, the more communists it would create. This was Thich Nhat Hanh's first book in English and made waves in the growing anti-war movement in the United States at the time. Thich Nhat Hanh's portrayal of the plight of the Vietnamese people during the Indochina Wars is required reading now as the United States and Europe continue to grapple with their roles as global powers and the human effects of their military policies. Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire is of special interest for students of peace and conflict studies and Southeast Asian history. It also gives the reader insights into the thought of the young Thich Nhat Hanh, who would later go on to found--in exile--Plum Village in France, the largest Buddhist monastery outside Asia, and influence millions with his teachings on the path of peace and mindfulness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnwQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's New Explorer Spanish-English Dictionary (Spanish Edition)","description":"Contains over 180,000 definitions and translations of English and Spanish words, along with sections on Spanish grammar, abbreviations, numbers, and the metric system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xXFcYQBIM6AC&dq=Webster%27s+New+Explorer+Spanish-English+Dictionary+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J.

Sarah Katherine Lewis is a veteran of the sex industry who started small -- doing lingerie modeling and striptease shows -- but for reasons including the desire to earn more money and curiosity about other types of sex work, she moved into porn, and ultimately into illegal work. Lewis is smart, self-aware, and bitingly funny. Where other writers in this genre have generally shielded themselves from letting things get too bad or go too far, Lewis comes face-to-face with the unimaginable. Her experiences with customers, whose fetishes and behaviors range from obscene to bizarre to twisted, are often recounted with outrageous and caustic humor. Lewis is a brilliant observer of human nature and has a read on her employers and coworkers that lends unique insight into theseedy underground of the more hardcore sex industry. Lewis is a sex worker by choice. She neither condemns nor condones the work, though she depicts her experiences with a gallows humor that reveals the complexity of professional adult sex work.Indecent offers readers an insider's account of hard-earned lessons and acute insight gained from over a decade in the trenches of one of America's most insidious and lucrative industries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6TZUswEACAAJ&dq=Indecent:+How+I+Make+It+and+Fake+It+as+a+Girl+for+Hire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is It Bedtime Yet?

His father's boisterous views of women haunt him, as he is told that all women are evil-wanting only the material and causing all men \\"the worst of pains.\\" This has dire consequences for young Marlo as he matures and struggles with loving his mother and yet facing his father's twisted representation of a world full of vixen dominance. Marlo looks to his extraordinary artistic talent and two best friends for solace from everyday home life. But one of his friends (Danny) becomes romantically involved with a young girl who ends up crushing Danny's heart. This only reinforces what his father has long since warned. Confusion sets in further when Marlo meets Desiree Castillo, a girl unlike others. For she too sees the same magic in Marlo's \\"sandcastle dreams\\" and even tells a story of the first sandcastle which (legend has it) was built long ago, near the Yucatan Peninsula. Marlo struggles to keep his dream of art school alive while still trying to find the long-lost relationship that has evaded him and his mother. He too comes to terms with his deep attraction towards Desiree only to eventually meet her \\"twin\\" cousin, Divina.

The MNH Counselling Handbook is chiefly designed to be used by groups of SAs with the help of a facilitator. It can also be used by individual SAs who can get together with colleagues for discussions and activities where needed. It relies on a self-directed learning approach, allowing SAs to work at their own pace, drawing on their past counselling experience. The way it is used will be determined by each country s context, and the SAs preference. The MNH Counselling Handbook is divided into three main sections. Part 1 is an introduction which describes the aims and objectives and the general layout of the Handbook. Part 2 describes the counselling process and outlines the six key steps to effective counselling. It explores the counselling context and factors that influence this context including the socio-economic, gender, and cultural environment. A series of guiding principles is introduced and specific counselling skills are outlined. Part 3 focuses on different maternal and newborn health topics, including general care in the home during pregnancy; birth and emergency planning; danger signs in pregnancy; post-abortion care; support during labour; postnatal care of the mother and newborn; family planning counselling; breastfeeding; women with HIV/AIDS; death and bereavement; women and violence; linking with the community. Each Session contains specific aims and objectives, clearly outlining the skills that will be developed and corresponding learning outcomes. Practical activities have been designed to encourage reflection, provoke discussions, build skills and ensure the local relevance of information. There is a review at the end of each session to ensure the SAs have understood the key points before they progress to subsequent sessions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KSjcMlLQaOgC&dq=Woman+and+Labor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maintaining Body Balance, Flexibility & Stability: A Practical Guide to the Prevention & Treatment of Musculoskeletal Pain & Dysfunction, 1e","description":"A collection of tried and tested, effective and safe techniques and exercises for relaxing muscles in spasm and easing associated muscular pain, this is a handbook which the therapist can also safely recommend to his or her patients to buy and use themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sctnvgAACAAJ&dq=Maintaining+Body+Balance,+Flexibility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hymns of our faith;: A handbook for the Baptist hymnal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DddszgEACAAJ&dq=Hymns+of+our+faith%3B:+A+handbook+for+the+Baptist+hymnal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREY MAIDEN","description":"The complete story of Gray Maiden, the sword that changed history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E7q8oAEACAAJ&dq=GREY+MAIDEN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recognizing Health and Illness: Pathology for Massage Therapists and Bodyworkers","description":"Primarily for massage therapists and bodyworkers; Work holistically with individuals in health and illness; learn how to easily apply new knowledge to your practice when people are challenged by disease and injury; response more confidently to indications, precautions, and contraindications for over 300 health conditions; keep this valuable book for future reference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iDuqQwAACAAJ&dq=Recognizing+Health+and+Illness:+Pathology+for+Massage+Therapists+and+Bodyworkers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Qi: Quigong Meditations for Better Health and Spiritual Well-Being","description":"Ken Cohen, preeminent Qigong master, presents 100 days of traditional Chinese exercises to increase energy, physical health and spiritual well-being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vegXvgEACAAJ&dq=The+Power+of+Qi:+Quigong+Meditations+for+Better+Health+and+Spiritual+Well-Being&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Group Leadership as Spiritual Direction: Practical Ways to Blend an Ancient Art into Your Contemporary Community","description":"Don t just LEAD a small group, DIRECT it.

In the course of these writings, Sara journeys to Heaven and Hell and the vast Lands in between. She paints vivid pictures of her encounters in each of these realms. Through the teachings she brings ways to break the crystallized shell holding us back from ultimate self-love and forgiveness. Waving the smelling salts through the words, she discusses illness, karma, the dark side, the Lord of Death, Christ, the death minds, and how to awaken to Truth. There is an immense need for Death s truth to fully reveal itself. What this updated edition carries is a renewed and refreshed revelation death is a different death than was ever possible before.

As the primary component of the subject of \\"noncommutative topol ogy,\\" K -theory has opened vast new vistas within the structure theory of C* algebras, as well as leading to profound and unexpected applications of opera tor algebras to problems in geometry and topology. As a result, many topolo gists and operator algebraists have feverishly begun trying to learn each others' subjects, and it appears certain that these two branches of mathematics have become deeply and permanently intertwined. Despite the fact that the whole subject is only about a decade old, operator K -theory has now reached a state of relative stability. While there will undoubtedly be many more revolutionary developments and applications in the future, it appears the basic theory has more or less reached a \\"final form.\\" But because of the newness of the theory, there has so far been no comprehensive treatment of the subject. It is the ambitious goal of these notes to fill this gap. We will develop the K -theory of Banach algebras, the theory of extensions of C*-algebras, and the operator K -theory of Kasparov from scratch to its most advanced aspects. We will not treat applications in detail; however, we will outline the most striking of the applications to date in a section at the end, as well as mentioning others at suitable points in the text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5zwBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","description":"Here is a powerful new program that can clear away the unconscious agreements patterns that undermine even your best intentions.

Freedwomen fiercely asserted their own ideas of what freedom meant and insisted on important changes in the work they performed for white employers and in their own homes. They rejected the most unpleasant or demeaning tasks, guarded prerogatives gained under a slave economy, and defended their vision of freedom against unwanted intervention by Northern whites and the efforts of former owners to restore slavery's social and economic relations during Reconstruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FNchaICsLRsC&dq=A+Hard+Fight+for+We:+Women%27s+Transition+from+Slavery+to+Freedom+in+South+Carolina+(Women+in+American+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},I={key:1};function x(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-6342ef26"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/42.md","filePath":"drive/42.md"}'),q={name:"drive/42.md"},D=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(W)]))}});export{J as __pageData,D as default};
