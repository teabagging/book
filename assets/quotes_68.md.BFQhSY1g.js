This book is crazy. It's weird and funny, but not really. I guess it gives you perspective. You should read it just for that. It's just very, very odd."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, okay, so Salinger made a great depiction of a little loser, but is that enough to consider a book a classic? I can think of a few authors that have done more or less the same thing and have gone unnoticed. Yes, I found the writing to be quite brilliant, it does a great job introducing the reader into the world of Holden Caulfield, but no amount of brilliancy can make me feel even a bit simpathetic towards Holden, he's one of those people that I would instantly detest if I happened to meet him in the real world, he's so whiny and stupid, he can't stop complaining about everything that doesn't sit well with him, but instead of showing some backbone and trying either to do something to change at least a bit the stuff he doesn't like, or to adapt himself to the situation, he sulks and cusses, and dreams of running away and hiding in the wilderness, where he won't have to cope with the cold cruel world. I can appreciate his idealistic cynicism, but that's about the extent of my charity. I don't share other reviewer's feelings that the plot is uninteresting and/or inexistent; I'll admit is not a wild ride, but it is engaging, and it is quite interesting to witness Caulfield's teen angst (I hate that expression, I never was like that at that age or at any age, and I'm nineteen, so don't think I have forgotten). I'll concede that, all in all, J.D. Salinger managed to pull off a good story, and that is no small accomplishment in this case; I would give another of his books a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book; I couldn't put it down. I wasn't required to read it, but heard it was very good and I agree. Holden's writing is so realistic, even more than fifty years later."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I felt The Catcher in the Rye was written childishly and it didn't get to the point. Most books that teenagers are encouraged to read usually show a moral, lesson, or value in the text. No events occurred to make the plot interesting. I felt strongly that this book showed nothing else but simply a boy who needs help. Holden's outlook on life depressed me because he always looked for the bad in everything and everyone. I always try to relate with the main character of a book, and I was really hoping to get on the same page with Holden. Nothing good ever happened to him, but it's almost like he didn't want anything good to happen. He never got up the nerve to do anything he set up to do, such as calling Jane. Then he got with Sally. I really don't understand why. I think he wanted to drag her down in to his depressing world, poor girl. Also I don't understand why he thinks everyone's phony; he's the only phony one. I don't understand how so many opinions of this book could be high. I must be missing something. Maybe I am, but anyone who enjoyed this book must be able to relate to depressed people."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THis is definately one of the best books I have read in my life. I would like to congradulate sallinger on his astounding work of literature. He really knows how to portray greif and emotions.

Throughout the book, Holden, the main character, wanders purposelessly in thought and action, indifferent and cynical to the world around him -- the typical &quot;anti-hero.&quot; The reader is given a negative look at humanity, not for the purpose of correcting the worst in people, but for reveling in it.For an uplifting view of man, I suggest the masterpiece novel by Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged. Miss Rand presents man as a heroic being who is capable of dealing with reality. Although one may look at Atlas Shrugged and cringe (it is 1100 pages), one will be wishing for more by the end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book at fourteen and remember it vividly. That was thirty-two years ago. I think the principal appeal of this book among young readers is that it is profoundly comforting. To discover someone else sharing your own fears, anxieties, confusion and cynicism, comes as both a shock and a relief. I remember reading in amazement as Holden expressed thoughts I thought were mine alone. To realize that a &quot;grown up&quot; (someone of my father's generation, no less!) wrote the book and created Holden, gave me my first inkling that perhaps things weren't as bad as they seemed. For the first time, I actually began to believe my parents when they laughed off my &quot;problems,&quot; said they were just a part of growing up, and told me things would get better. I think this experience in reading the book is not atypical. Whether you like &quot;Catcher&quot; depends, I suppose, largely on your age and, perhaps, on which crowd you fit into in high school. The &quot;popular,&quot; &quot;cool,&quot; and &quot;in crowd&quot; types probably see only a whiny rich kid with nothing to complain of. To the rest of us, Holden was a kindred spirit and we re-read the book regularly. I last read &quot;Catcher&quot; about a dozen years ago. Holden and I no longer had much in common. I doubt I will read the book again. If you are young, confused, and wondering about your place in the world, read this book. (Just don't take it too seriously.) If you are older, (or, if young, have already achieved &quot;popular,&quot; &quot;winner&quot; or &quot;overachiever&quot; status) you probably don't need to and will wonder what all the fuss is about. No matter. For many, this is a book you will never forget."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story should be read at a certain age, which for me is 15, in order for the reader to respect the quality of this book. The main character, Holden Caufield, is caught between the carefree world of childhood and the responsibility he fears facing when he reaches his adult years. He can no longer stand his confusion about what lies ahead in his future. Salinger offers many hints and symbols about the boy's confusion, even in his choice of drink- whiskey, an older man's drink, with soda, for the child in him. The title is &quot;Cather in the Rye&quot; because of the unreal profession Holden wants to occupy when he is older. This imaginary job is preventing children from falling off a cliff. The symbolism in this is that Holden really wants to prevent younger children from falling into the phoniness of teenage society and its cliques, modern day examples being wiggas, skaters, athletes, losers, etc. He wants all the children to be protected from the problems he faces. This story helped me out much when I read it only a couple of months ago, and his hopes of protecting children from falling into the phoniness of teenageism are fulfilled whenever someone, who is at the right age, reads this teriffic novel. It has affected my feelings of the teenage idealism that I see daily. I was insulted when my 30 year old brother said he couldn't stand the book, which he didn't bother to start reading until he was 29. It is perfect for the ages of 15-18."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have not read all the reviews listed here, and so my comments may be redundant, but I feel that most of the customer reviewers have missed the mark. This book is a brilliant study (probably quasi-autobiographical from what I know of J.D. Salinger's life) of a teenage boy who suffers from severe depression, and barely hangs on through his odyssey from the time he leaves school until he is rescued by his younger sister. There are clear parallels between this book and The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, except that she found nothing to anchor her to life. As he travels along, Holden tempts fate on a number of occasions, any one of which could have resulted in his death or serious injury- a vulnerable teenage boy staying in a flophouse of a hotel, engaging a prostitute and taking on her pimp, walking through Central Park after dark, and generally roaming around a usually unforgiving city. His salvation is his sister, who is the only one who can cut through his cynicism, and self-destructiveness. She is truly the &quot;catcher in the rye,&quot; standing at the edge of the cliff, guardian and protector, keeping all the children from falling off the edge. In this case, she keeps her brother from the abyss, as he finally agrees to go home, and to not follow his fantasy to go out west, which I think is a metaphor for the great unknown, and probably his own ultimate destruction. Why he honors her so is not entirely clear, but it could be because she is truly pre-egoic; innocent, caring, displaying unconditional love and concern for Holden, and no facade that he can disparage with his cynicism and wit. The &quot;epilogue&quot; final chapter shows Holden acknowledging that he is in some institution, probably as a psychiatric inpatient, who is letting a psychotherapist into his world. He seems to have lost his severe cynical edge, and one gets the hint that he is going to make it, to recover from an illness which almost destroyed him. The novel leaves us on a hopeful note, although, interestingly enough, I dont get the impression that the author ever similarly extricated himself from the reclusive life which he has lived. All in all, I think that we bear witness to a brilliantly-crafted case study of adolescent depression, with all of the contrasting anguish and humorous cynicism expected in such a pathetic figure. The irony here, of course, is that the world and its inhabitants are indeed phony, and to cure Holden is to allow him to become everything he so incisively rails against. Do we do him- and any other beings who see the world for what it really is- a true service by trying to change them??"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Am I the only teenager in the world who found Holden Caulfield (as in Salinger's Catcher In the Rye) whiny, creepy, and not particularly someone to identify with? It's supposed to be like, the book in which all teenagers can see themselves or whatever, but I don't know who came up with that idea.He's a sixteen-year-old with the lifestyle of a twenty-six-year-old, thinking and behaving like an immature twelve-year-old. Yeah, he makes the occasional intelligent comment, but the book doesn't even have a plot, okay?After a while, I got tired of the repetitive slang; the way Holden implored the reader to have sympathy for him, but not too much, because he can't handle that; and of course, the episodes that pass for a plot: In Which Holden Blows Off a &quot;Friend&quot;, In Which Holden Has Issues With a Girl, In Which Holden Contemplates His Family Situation.What I see in it is a kid who has trouble relating to people and who avoids reality. He's obsessed with sex and drinking and various types of girls. He needs to find someone who he can, you know, talk to.Maybe it was rebellious and daring when it came out. Maybe it's the whole Salinger mystique. Maybe I just didn't get it. I read it because I was told repeatedly about its brilliance; I saw almost none of that. I won't deny that there were amusing moments, but as a whole I was far from impressed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I read this as a high school sophomore--on my own, no less, not assigned--I thought it was a pretty good tale of a young man like myself. Holden liked to hang with his buddies, smoke and drink, had a marvelous opinion of himself while being viciously disdainful of everyone else, and he was smart, too. He was just like me.Coming back to this American classic close to thirty years later, my perspective has changed quite a bit. I'm no longer a young man, and Holden is not the cool dude I once recognized. In fact, he's immature, judgmental, dishonest, wasteful, unappreciative and more than anything, pretentious. He's a directionless, self-pitying jerk, and what he needs is a swift kick in the rear from his wealthy, climbing, city-dwelling socialite parents, who are clearly too busy with their own lives to properly rear him or his siblings. He is everything wrong with material success, with its entitlement and the ennui which comes with never being challenged.More than anything, what hammered me in the forehead from the very first chapter was that Holden Caulfield IS America. In the 1940s, as America became the global giant, here is Holden Caulfield representing every aspect of it. He grows up too quickly and is immature, believing he is not. He is given much of what he has, really never having to work for any of it, and is ungrateful, not realizing what it took to get him where he is. His immaturity leads him to speak far too often when he would serve himself better to be quiet and just listen and learn. He cannot stay with a single task or a long-term project; he has to jump to another and another and another. He derives his self-worth from his shallow and meaningless relationships, which are self-serving, fleeting and often just plain false. He is smitten by Jane Gallagher, but never levels with her, never tells her the truth; he just avoids it. He is directionless, accepts no challenges, and feels no remorse for his mistakes. When he fails, he sees it coming and does nothing, then he rationalizes it away and flees, rather than taking responsibility and making things right. He denounces everyone and everything as pretentious and phony, when that is exactly what he is. He wants to be a grown-up, and play-acts at being one, never understanding what it takes to join that cohort.Interesting is that both of what today would be called mentors to Holden are people he essentially describes and we see as failures. His old teacher is superficially respected for his knowledge, but Holden sees him as grubby and poor, the unavoidable physical manifestation of his age compromising any real influence he could have on the young man. Mr. Antolini turns out to be a false mentor, a closeted homosexual driven to alcoholism, who attempts to molest the nave Holden (depending on your interpretation).Given the period in which it was written and restrictions on publishers, I can understand the book's lack of profanity, but its absence in a boy of 16-17 compromises his character. This was even more so with regard to the lack of sex. Holden was more interested in drinking and smoking than in sex, and I found that as a teenager reading it and again as a 40-something geezer that just doesn't ring true. He talks about it, and mentions it from time to time, but it is not in Holden the undeniable primitive driver that I know it to be.Fascinating in this book is the absence of World War II. There are a few mentions of men in uniform, but precious little else about the war. Even a teenager's self-absorbed detachment could not escape this oppressive fact from 1939 to 1945 and well after, especially a teenager who soon enough would be eligible for the draft. This can only be a deliberate omission from Salinger, and it is another aspect of the book which I feel compromises it. While any treatment of the war would take this story in many directions other than the main story arc, I believe it is something that has to be addressed here, especially given the book's physical setting in New York City and its conceptual and physical proximity to the European theater.Now, as for the end. Is Holden really ill, deathly sick with some unspoken malady, from which he emerges messianically at the end? I don't really think so. He fell ill because he wasn't eating, choosing to smoke and drink instead. He passed out and vomited because he hadn't slept in over a day, and was hung over and dehydrated. So what of the extended stay in the hospital? It sure looks to me like it was a forced institutionalization for mental health reasons, a good six months of intensive therapy to give this young man a bit of perspective on what it means to follow through, do what you're told, and exhibit some hardiness, if you're going to succeed.To wrap it all up, I think every American should read this book. It's easy, it flows effortlessly, and its writing is outstanding. It's a great portrait of upper class life in New York in the middle 1940s, a tale of a maturing teenager, and of the America he inhabits."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Of all the novels involving teenagers that were published in the twentieth century, the novel \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" stands among the most controversial publications. Over two hundred pages, the book covers the four days trip that the main character, Holden Caulfield, took after his private school expelled him for failing his classes except English, as he keeps reminding certain persons offended by his umpteenth expulsion. For years this book got the reputation of being an offensive novel with a lot of curse words, a rebellious teenager, and the unfortunate reputation of being, to Mark David Chapman's twisted mind, an inspiration in murdering the rock star John Lennon. Due to this reputation, readers' expectations have always been disproportionate to what \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is all about. To me, I think the book is not really a story, but in fact a rich and complex portrait of a teenager in crisis who narrates/describes his disgust toward phonies, his school, his New York trip but also his personal family life, in which a certain event, that happened a couple of years ago, gave birth to Holden's problems with his family.In its plot, the book's prose revolves constantly around Holden Caulfield and his voice stands out as an imposing one that doesn't leave the reader as he shuts the book. Very realistic and plausible, the novel shows very beautiful scenes that occur around Holden's trip, but also fascinating disgressions as he describes certain objects and friends that he got to interact with. As such, the novel is an excellent way to encourage other readers to dive into Salinger's other books, which have inspired incidents mentioned in this book and offer other experiences involving Holden Caulfield and his family. Though none of Salinger's other stories confirm what happened to Holden after the novel's ending, those stories offer various interpretations and discussions as to the main character's life.However I wish that Salinger had taken the time to develop other scenes that he briefly described, such as Holden's return to his house and to his parents. Not only that, though I didn't get myself caught up by all the hype and controversy surrounding the book, which people talk about as if it's Clockwork Orange, I can say that I liked the book, but didn't get obsessed by it as much as I thought it would be. Maybe because the novel constantly revolved around Holden's perspective, or maybe because the book rarely dove into scenes that could have given very powerful reactions between the characters and Holden, I don't know.I don't know if I will reread the novel one day. However, I am glad to have participated into that reading experience and will definitely read other novels that Salinger wrote, along with other books written in the fifties and revolving around teenagers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is as interesting to read now as it was many years ago. Holden Caulfield is an unforgettable character, richly consistent and well defined. It is said that this story was somewhat autobiographical for J.D. Salinger, which may explain why Holden seems like a real person whom the reader is getting to know. That, coupled with the first-person technique of storytelling, makes reading The Catcher In The Rye a very intimate experience. It is like being let inside a personal diary. This is a book that elicits a strong opinion from almost anyone, and in the era in which it was first published it was controversial and sometimes banned."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think I'm going to have to start publicly dissing good books.Think about it. Have you ever heard some friend gush about this amazing awesome movie, or whatever, and later seen it yourself with a distinct feeling of \\"meh\\"? After awhile, you get so super-saturated on hype that almost nothing could actually deliver on your expectations. It's a recipe for disappointment.Conversely, all I've heard about The Catcher in the Rye for the last ten years is how it's the most overrated high school book ever, and how Holden Caulfield is an insufferable prig, relentlessly whining about nothing. (Holden Seinfeld, maybe.)Well, having missed the book in high school myself, and only just picked it up now (in the very depths of senescence!), I have to say I kinda liked it. Yes, it's basically Ferris Bueller's Emo Day Out. Yes, Holden could probably benefit from a hard slap and an after-school job. But I was expecting him to be this completely self-centered angst-machine, and he just wasn't.I liked that he spent money and did favors for random strangers. I liked that he was respectful and considerate of other people's feelings, even when he was privately repulsed or bored stiff. I liked that he acknowledged most of his own faults, even if he didn't have much idea how to correct them. For all that he gets riled up about phony people and affectations, Holden Caulfield is himself a fair disciple of the \\"fake it 'til you make it\\" school of social graces. And although I can think of more fun or gripping or endearing characters to spend a couple hundred pages with, this one does a pretty good job of showing us around a world he's still figuring out how to live in. That's something I can empathize with, even from the old-folks' home."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the first books that I ever read. I really enjoyed this book. Good story and well written. I haven't read any other Salinger stuff but I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A terrific book but it can be depressing, not to mention controversial. The Catcher in the Rye is an American novel which you can usually find in your library and has garnered a lot of controversy due to its profanity, teenage attitudes, and views on society. It's about a teenage boy named Holden who has problems with society and people. He gets out early on the break when he got suspended and goes out on a trip to New York and kind of goes on a quest for himself and how he views the world and people. This book may be not be suitable for some as he can be unlikable, he talks about that you have to greet warmly to people so that you can be liked or else and seems to like to talk to girls than to go deal with boys. But Salinger's novel is interesting. It deals with teenage angst and apathy. It talks with the tone and view of a teenager. Holden is emotional, he has lost his brother Allie which we can relate to. Holden seems to bring up topics like attitudes on sex, education, social class, dealing with a lost one, friends, and society. Even though this book may not be well liked, this can be an intriguing for those who are or have been in rebellion or may not like school at one time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was hoping this was going to be the genre fitting my type: teenage rebellion and socialism, etc., but it didn't at all. Obviously, cynicist Holden Caufield complains about everything, but the book was completely boring and developed no plot, and I never got through it. I strongly suggest something more like &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,&quot; which is like &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; but is much more humorous and has a plot, even though their main focus is teenage rebellion and socialism, life, troubles, sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

This book elicited from me the same emotional response that I would also feel if attending a party of a friend of a friend of a friend; that is to say, slightly out of place but not in an unpleasant way but, not something to look forward to either. It was, the complete absence of feeling yet without being a sort of numbness. I felt neither highs nor lows. I realized upon completing this short tome of mediocrity that I realized I had not missed out on anything nor had I felt an intellectual or emotional loss. I will say that if anything, I perhaps felt pity...for myself and for Holden, but only slightly.This little literary jaunt firmly re-established in my mind a thorough understanding that the absence of pain is not pleasure and the absence of pleasure is certianly not pain either. As a former co-worker would answer to the &quot;How are ya&quot; question on Monday morning, this book is an emphatic &quot;medium.&quot; A thoroughly break-even book.I neither encourage nor discourage. There are certianly books which make you feel smarter (or at least accomplished) upon completion and there are other books which make you feel dumber when you close the back cover. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is neither.

Also, even though Holden has some serious \\"issues\\", I think most people can relate to his struggles on some level, particularly his dealings with \\"phonies\\".

But the first time was when I was just a kid and too dumb to actually get it and all. I just found it depressing, to tell the truth. But this time I enjoyed it. I'm not kidding. I found it funny, I really did. Especially the ironic parts when Holden says he hates to do something but he goes ahead and does it anyway. Those parts kill me. I have to admit, though, that sometimes the way he repeats certain phrases annoys the hell out me. It really does. And I don't like how he calls gays flits and all. Still, that was a long time ago, when people had different attitudes. And today people still read it and find symbolism and themes in it and all. They probably teach it at the same goddam prep school Holden Caulfield went to. They probably have a goddam wing in the school named after him. And all those phony teachers who didn't understand him now make their students write essays about Holden Caulfield.It's enough to make me vomit. It really is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"If a body meet a body coming thro' the rye...\\"Holden Caulfield. Yeah, I don't know what to make of him, really. I mean, I want to understand him and all, I really do, but I just don't feel like it. It makes me depressed. You know when you want to get into someone's head? And figure out what makes them tick? But then you think that's kinda next to impossible? Boy, it makes you depressed. Depressed as you-know-what.Yup. I have no problem making fun of this book. Did they really talk like that back in the 40s? Really? Because that by itself was enough to drive me crazy. By the end of the book, I didn't know whether I wanted to throttle that Caulfield kid, and throttle him good, or give him a hug because he's just so pathetic, but not like some kind of flit, if you know what I mean.And I know I've got some backlash coming my way from all you literary types. Maybe that's why this book is considered great: it gets the reader thinking. It gets the reader confused. It got this reader confused. What am I supposed to end up thinking about Holden? Is he this arrogant, anti-social, know-it-all who thinks nearly every human interaction is phony and that living in the woods would be a golldarn utopia? Or is he this searching, sentimental, awkward, scared kid who's looking for answers, but can't find them in the world he currently inhabits? I lean towards the latter. He's looking for authenticity, for realness in the world, but he's doubtful he's got enough patience to find it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are 2,000 reviews of this book here on amazon so I'm not sure how I can possibly add to that.All I know is that I first read this book fourteen years ago when I was a teenager and it's only gotten better with age. At first it was all about Holden; as a teenager it's hard not to relate to his disjointed journey through New York as he tries to find himself and some meaning in a world that seems all too happy to change without him.Over the years, though, Holden has come to mean less and less to me while Salinger the writer has come to mean more and more. The man is a master of prose, able to convey humor and meaning with ease. But most importantly, Salinger's imagery is perfect in every scene with all available choices used to augment Holden's unwillingness to let go of childhood, from the mummies at the museum forever trapped in time that Holden keeps returning to, to an oil puddle in the parking lot that Holden is afraid to look at twice because he knows it will change in that small span of time between glances.Holden's story might no longer ring perfectly true with me but Salinger's writing will always astound."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Note:The reviewer is an EFL learner.I've just finished reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye. I think it's both interesting and sad. I checked the book reviews for \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" on Amazon and was surprised to find that there were quite some people did not appreciate \\"Holden\\" at all and many of them asked him to \\"Grow up,\\" or \\"Get a life!\\"I like Holden, and I feel sympathy for him. I assume he had reasons to have become what he was like. Most of us had troubled mind with a lot of crazy notions going on when we were young. I mean, come on, when we were younger, hadn't we doubted all those \\"sit and listen\\" and wondered if it worth all the struggling being a decent adolescent? And I guess that is one thing \\"phony\\" of most adults. They think they know what is right for you. And they seem to accuse you of being immature or ungrateful when you do not follow their \\"guidance\\" or \\"assignmenth. Gratefulness and maturity and something like that are, in most cases, acquired and maybe learned. So I think it's just so true and real of Salingerfs portray of a sixteen Holden Caulfield, sad and angry.The adult world/ real world was too complicated for Holden. There were a lot in the real world he did not understand. ---Why did Allie have to die? Why should he care about life? Why did Mr. Antonlini do it? And that was probably why Holden wanted to be nothing but gthe catcher in the ryeh. He liked children, they are not complicated and malicious and all. Holden found it easy to get along with them and understand them.Why did Holden want so much to protect children? Why did he talk about sex yet dare not to try it? I have to say the revelation is in the book. Think about the immediate overreaction of Holden when he was woken up by Mr. Antonlinifs petting on his head. Salinger understated another chapter of Holdenfs life with \\"That kind of stufffs happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I canft stand it.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you're only going to read one classic American novel, this is the one. It is well written, lighthearted, even though the story does have its dismal moments; it is told in such a comical way it won't bring you down. I bought this book along with Grapes of Wrath, Mice and Men and Fahrenheit 451 when I was taking some time off from my English degree to have a baby and wanted to catch up with some readings of American Literature. I haven't been able to get through the other three yet, but this one I have already read twice.I pay special interest to the voice the author gives to the narrator of the story, and JD Salinger gets an A+ for this. When I read the book, I totally feel like the woman on the train listening to this young boy tell his story, I really do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the book that first made me realize I dislike reading almost any criticism about literature. I don't care what Harold Bloom thinks about the significance of Holden Caulfield's red hunting cap, I don't care what he thinks about Holden's obsession with where the ducks go in the winter; I don't care what he thinks about anything in this book. Part of me thinks that there's something dreadfully wrong with the image of any critic sitting down to put their scholarly paws on any page of this book. It makes me feel they missed the whole point of the book, and I don't want to listen to a critic who missed the whole point of the book. It's the phoniest thing in the world. The Catcher in the Rye is good because of its readers. They bring something to the book against which scholarly criticism pales.Every time I read The Catcher in the Rye I find something in it I never caught on any of my previous readings. This time I was struck by the architecture of novel. Salinger's structure. After reading the book I spent an hour noting the parallels among the scene with Mr. Spencer (a teacher of his from the school he is about to leave) that starts the novel, and the scene with Mr. Antolini (a former teacher of his from another school) near the end of the novel.I continue to adore Holden's memory of his brother, Allie, and his relationship with his little sister, Phoebe. And I continue to feel sorry for the grumpy grown ups who think The Catcher in the Rye is nothing more than a 200-page rant about teen angst. That's just gorgeous."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the most controversial books of all time, The Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger, was definitely worth the fight. Although banned from schools when it was first published because of the encouragement of profanity, prostitution, and premarital sex, it still became one of the most frequently taught novels in public high schools.The novel's narrator, Holden Caulfield, is an epitome of Salinger at the age of sixteen. Holden tells the story of his expulsion from his private school, Pencey prep, and his escape to New York City before his parents find out. While in the city, Holden discovers more about himself than he ever would have if he had merely stayed at Pencey for the last few days before vacation.While Holden is not a very focused character, he does eventually get his point across. He often goes off on a tangent while trying to clarify a simple point, instead of just stating a straightforward sentence. Nevertheless, Holden does make it back to his point, leaving the reader with a thorough understanding of his recent topic.Holden does not believe that being an adult is a good thing. He feels that, once one makes his or her way to adulthood, he/she becomes a phony. This is true with his friends, Stradlater, Ackley, and Sally. These three young adults over-exaggerate more than even Holden does (which is saying quite a bit), and they are \\"fake\\" in their responses, while Holden is true. Although Holden over-exaggerates, he says what he means. Stradlater, Ackley, and Sally, on the other hand, say what they believe will impress other people.The reason for the title of the book, The Catcher in the Rye, is revealed when Holden explains to Phoebe that he actually wants to be a \\"catcher in the rye.\\" \\"Comin' thro' the Rye\\" is an actual poem by Robert Burns, which is where Salinger gets the idea for the \\"catcher in the rye.\\" Holden says that he wishes there was an occupation where he could save a bunch of children who are playing in a field of rye from falling off of a cliff. His job would be to catch the children if they start to go off the cliff, and he explains that he would do this all day, and that he would be \\"the catcher in the rye and all.\\" This job symbolizes what Holden does for everyone in the world. He wants to protect people's innocence, even though he has lost his own.Although the novel has a controversial past, I do not believe that that should dissuade anyone from reading The Catcher in the Rye. This book is one of the greatest American classics, and is a witty and entertaining novel. An excellent read, I recommend The Catcher in the Rye to adolescents and adults alike who have a sense of humor and no sense of morals."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can see why people wouldn't like this book and all. Really. I can. But, me, on the other hand, liked this book and all. It was a riot. A real riot....People may not like this book because it obviously has very simple language at points and, as a reader, we are never given the point-of-view of other characters. However, I felt the simplicity of the novel gives it it's effect. Holden takes the world as being simple, yet there are many complex issues he must deal with.He is searching for his identity and the reason that most people are &quot;phonies&quot; is because he still hasn't completely figured out the world. Personally I felt as though the book couldn't have been written from any other point of view than 1st person and still achieved it's effect. I read the book rather quickly because it is as if someone is sitting there telling you their life story...well, in a way, Holden is. I recommend this book to anyone because it is original and definitely not boring. It is a book that many relate to, because it deals with the teenage world that we've all been a part of.I still don't think this book is anything better than 3 stars because it is rather simplistic in nature. However, I can understand why people consider it a classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has been condoned a classic book for many decades. My interpretation of this book was neither good or bad. To me this book, compared to others I have read, was rather mediocre, not that I have read an extremely large amount of books in my lifetime. For the most part it seemed that the world Holden describes is very similar to an actual teenagers world. Also the actions and events that Holden performs or encounters is closely related to ones that an actual teenager may face. These very accurate descriptions of Holden's world that he lives in and the troubleshooting that goes along with it, is what make this book a good read for not only young adults but for everyone.The first part of the book that caught my eye was how well the description of his school matched mine. It seemed that Holden was a rebel that disliked most \\"preps\\". No matter who you are there is always someone in this world that labels others. This example of one label disliking another is easily shown in every school, every day all across America. Even though Holden does not like \\"preps\\" he still seems to cater there needs. For example his roommate, Warn returns from the football game wanting to borrow Holden's jacket for his date that he is about to attend. Holden agreeably lends it to him then later finds out that Warn is dating a girl that his coat lending buddy may have feelings for. The funny part is, after Warn tells Holden who the girl is Holden still precedes to write a paper for his roommate. Not only does this action relate to me directly but I am sure it relates to others as well.The book describes very well the life of a teenager who is juggling and dealing with all the difficulties encountered as an adolescent. In some cases such as the hooker and her pimp seem to me to be a little farfetched. In this part of the story line Holden is staying in a New York hotel. On one of his trips to his room he has a pleasant conversation with the elevator attendant, Maurice, who doubles as a pimp. This conversation ends with an offer to have one of Maurice's girls to come up to Holden's room. They then briefly discuss the price and Holden agrees to Maurice's offer. Later a hooker named Sunny appears at Holden's door. These two do little more than talk because Holden is so upset with his situation. The end of the night comes abruptly and Sunny asks for ten dollars as her fee. Holden disagrees and only gives her five. Sunny leaves in a disgruntled manner but soon returns with Maurice to claim the rest of her money. Holden takes a pretty good beating but seems to brush it of as nothing had happened and goes on his way. This whole scenario to me seems to be extremely corny. This is the part of the story line that lowered my expectations for the book. This could happened to an adolescent but is highly unlikely.At the end of the book Holden seems to be more scared and confused than when the book began. It seemed to him that he either had to run away or die, like his brother Allie. His plan was to run away to the west. He decided that before he left he would have one more conversation with his beloved sister Phoebe. While talking to her, he takes a turn for the better and decides to stop running and stay home. This ending was wonderful. Again the book describes life as a teenager perfectly. Any teenager with a little common sense, a best friend, and something to live for will always make the right decisions. Holden has some common sense he was just thoroughly confused, his best friend was Phoebe, and all he wanted in life was to be unconfused and loved.In conclusion the details and realisticness of each scenario written about in this book was amazing although some seemed a little farfetched. The relationship that this book and real life was equally amazing. It also seemed that Holden in his journeys as an adolescent was more adult oriented than he knew. This book is a great read for all ages even the people that are only young at heart."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden was cynical.Holden was inarticulate.Holden was observant.Holden was intelligent.Holden was lost.Salinger, on the other hand, is articulate enough to let his readers to see the world through the eyes of his inarticulate main character. As the story unfolds, Holden grows. A once lost soul who has lost himself within the rye field we may call it life, by the end of the story, he has found the meaning of his life: to be the catcher in the rye.Is the world corny, foolish, meaningless, and perverted as Holden described to be? I'd say yes, but life is a game, a game one plays according to the rules. Should one despair over the facts of life?This book is very flexible for interpretaions. It is meant to be that way so people with different experience may relate to the story differently and find a guiding light within their confused souls.Life is like a rye field surrounded by cliff edges. Will you share your light to others and be a catcher in the rye?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I wish I could write a book like this. Many people may feel that a lack of plot makes this book weak. I, however, believe that this gives The Catcher in the Rye a quality not often found in books. While reading this book, I could not stop myself from feeling sorry for Holden, I could almost see myself in his position. I have never wanted to write a review before, but I had to after reading this book. Besides To Kill a Mockingbird, this is the only book I have not hated my English teacher for making me read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher and the RyeThe book The Catcher and the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a very interesting novel. In his unique writing style, Salinger jumps from subject to subject to subject before returning to the original topic at hand. This book basically portrays a chunk of a young man's life as he gets kicked out of a private high school called Pencey. He slowly leaves campus for home without trying to be too depressed. Holden Caulfield, as the character is named, is set in his way of thinking and its very abstract at that. The book takes you on these small adventures and you can tell that they are exaggerated. He thinks about things too much, and his mind is especially stuck on women. He doesn't like his parents much but has three siblings that he gets along with. He's always reminiscing things he's done or people he used to know, again particularly the females. He doesn't consider himself smart but he sure talks like he does. I know he's not preaching, he's just talking to people who care to listen. I liked the book to start, but it got old pretty fast."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"perhaps a novel which is too much viewed through rose coloured lenses. although well enough written i have always found the story to be somewhat absent. an uninteresting mildly nihilistic character, meanders through a brief and uninteresting plot. leaves me cold."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye in written by J.D Salinger. It is about Holden, an 16 years old boy, who talks in a very sarcastic way about his childhood, his growing up, his school life and his sexlife which doesen't exist. The book is written in talking speech, the narrator uses simple language, so it's easy to understand. The narrator exagerates often to make the \\"problems\\" of the adolescents understandable. First the story is very depressing, because you only see Holden's problems and there seems to be no way out of this darkness..but wait until the end..I like the book and I dislike it: I felt depressed when I started reading it and bored, but then I began to think about all these problems and so on. It had a positive effect towards my life, because I started thinking about my way to live and now I'm persuaded that you can do something good with your life, if you really want to..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as part as my work for school. You would think a teacher might have to tell her students to read the book, but our class read in the middle os a lesson and she would tell them to put it down. She couldn't believe what she was saying. My class took this book apart, we looked at symbolism and why Holden acted that way. We read this book because it went with are theme. Are born evil or we made evil? J.D. Salinger answered that question. Holden was a product of his enviroment. This was an excellent book. I would recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read. The Catcher in the Rye is beautiful. I could totally relate to Holden, he was such a complex character; he actually seemed like a real person, something so hard to find in a book.

I was so disappointed when it was over; I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can I say that has not already been said.

One of the few you can read over and over and get something new out of it as your life progresses and changes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Regardless of all the accolades and glowing reviews this book has gained over the years, I remain adamant that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is, in my opinion, awful as well as being boring to read. The only reason I ever even finished this book was because I had to do a report on it. Now many people are doubtless going to argue that this book &quot;defines a generation&quot; or maybe &quot;exemplifies the struggle for maturity in urban America&quot; or some other fancy phrase. That it may be, but for a book to win your approval, you actually have to like it. Now, some may be saying that I am a crusty old fart who hates everyone and everything and does not understand the struggle that Mr. Caulfield is going through. Not the case. I am currently 16 years of age and read this book when I was 15. This fellow embodies all of the qualities that I despise in people. Irresponsibility, arrogance, obnoxiousness, laziness - these are just a few of the things that I hate about Holden. A harsh review you say? Well that's just my opinon and I have a right to voice it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book made me want to murder John Lennon.

If you take out Holden Caulfield's complaining, you may have 5 good pages of material. As I started reading this book, after about 25 pages I thought it would get better once the story started, but lo and behold... there is no story.Ok, heres a summary, for all potential readers. A troubled teen fails out of school-complaining-, goes into New York city-complains. Thinks about calling a few people-complains. Gets a prostatute, talks to her for a couple of minutes-complains. She leaves-complains some more. Gets in a fight-complains a little. Goes to a bar-complains. Goes on a date with an old friend-complains. Goes to another bar-complains, and so on and so forth.This story is definately not worth reading, though I have several friends that liked it, I definately wouldn't recommend it to anyone that wants a good read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Here is a book I read about 10 years ago in high school because of a class. I enjoyed every book I got my hand on in school... except this one. Our teacher attempted to get us excited about reading this book by telling us &quot;they&quot; were trying to ban it. It was one of the hardest books to choke down! It felt like a sad attempt at being an annoying teenager.I tried to read this book again a couple of months ago. This critically acclaimed book could not be that bad. No, sorry still whiny and pointless. It's full of characters I don't care to know or even get to if I did. I understand if drivel was a reason to be banned then I could see why this would be a challenged book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'll admit, I enjoyed the style in which this story was written. He talks with slang, cuss words, uses street talk, and his prose is a good representation of the way people spoke in the late '40s and early '50s.However, what was the point to this book? Throughout the book, Caufield complains, whines, and tells the reader how much he hates life, the adult world, and everything else. He's very negative, very pessimistic, and is always cynical of society. He can't cope with his environment, can't adapt to the real world, and thus isolates himself and pretends he is above everybody else.The book has no conclusion either. .. No conclusion, little hope, and an abrupt end to a pointless book. If Holden Caufield hated life so much, why didn't he shoot himself and save my time, and the time of millions of other people?Kevin"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was not easy to read this book. Although the beginning was not bad at all because I like this miserable guy but after meanwhile Holden starts boring me. What a stupid &quot;boy\\"! He doesn't have any interests, the only thing what he can do is smoking. He told us what's happened in a few days over almost 200 pages and actually there is nothing extraordinary to mention except the blame with the prostitute (Sunny) and Maurice.Not everything was bad otherwise I didn't read this book till the end. Holden 's character is something where some youth people can identify themselves with: his critical attitude against the society &quot;for God's sake, everything drives me crazy!\\" he has no friends, no interests, feel some loneliness, a big smoker and observed by sex. But we discover in this adolescent a sensitive boy who loves his brothers and especially his little sister. His feeling give him sympathy otherwise this pupil was a big loser; somebody who doesn't matter if he is death or not.After this alternative guy ran out at Pencey he goes to a hotel because he is afraid of his parents. At the end Holden decided to go back to his sister and his parents but we don't even know the reaction of them and his future is also unknown. There are so many questions unanswered. The book would have got a special dimension if we had known it. But no for God's sake!The story is a typical American tale. It 's too foolish that a sixteen-aged junior runs away from school and lives in a hotel where he appointed a prostitute. So the language does: there is almost no sentence without damned, bastards, ... but I like it and it reads more fluently. So when you have a lot of time read this boorish book otherwise: Don't waste your time with it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the most overrated book I have ever read (and I have read many). Holden Caulfield is 100% unoriginal and phony and symbolizes the concept known as the &quot;White Man's Burden&quot;. Holden is the origin of all of his 'suffering'. He also symbolizes the hypocrisy of priviledged people (perhaps Salinger's intent). I give this book 2 stars for the simple fact that it could fool so many people for so many years. If you are interested in reading this book because it is 'the voice of your generation', then think again. Anyone, especially teenagers, who are suffering from actual anguish and emotional pain shouldn't waste your time reading this book because it will only annoy you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I picked up this book because I grew up hearing it's title, which always intrigued me. It is written in the style of a wishy-washy 16-year old, this is the ONLY reason I give this book two stars. Salinger caught the wishy-washiness of a teenager's viewpoint on life PERFECTLY, but this perfect portrayal of a mind without goals is exactly what makes this book a TEDIOUS READ. Caulfield, the main character, cannont commit to one sentence throughout the entire book without backing out of it a sentence later, with a &quot;or something,&quot; or a, &quot;if you want to know the truth,&quot; or another dated late 1940's cliche'. I dropped this book, and picked up Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which was written 220 years ago, and IT seemed less dated. Don't read this unless you are a student of 1940's America, and you like terms like &quot;I get a bang out of this,&quot; and, of course &quot;That crumby person is a real phoney.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I decided I was going to read this book and find out what all the fuss is about.

I can't imagine another book nearly as real, original, or subtly humorous as Catcher in the Rye. You might compare this work along the lines of A Separate Peace, another great novel, but I find Catcher in a league of its own.Holden is a modern tragic hero in the story as he sets himself apart from the phoniness around him while trying to protect the innocence of children. The funny thing is that Holden suffers from chronic lying and a personality only his sister Phoebe and a few teachers can stand. He fits the stereotypical teenage loner type with his hatred of Pency teachers and jocks, an apathy towards schoolwork, and his need to get alchohol. This characterization is balanced by Holden's ideals, his inability to grasp the concept of change, and his sincere love of his siblings(sister Phoebe, late brother Allie, and brother D.B.). If the book doesn't make sense to you then you should read it again.It's a great book, and even if you don't understand it, you got to give it credit for its originality.

Teenagers feeling overburdened with their lives will gain a lot from reading this book, as will the parents who love them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The reason I read this book is because it is a classic, and I want to be a person who know the classics, if you want to know the truth. What can I say, I have inferior complex. So when I started reading this book I kept wondering: what the sonlvabitch is talking about? It is not like a classical classic at all! But eventually I stopped being phony and start enjoying it just for the hell of it.This book is about this boy and he was so lost. You take a 16-year old boy, put some dough in his pocket, and place him in New York City, and boy, was he lost! He was smoking like hell and drinking his head off!But deep inside he wasn't that bad. He is quite an observer and even witty, if you ask me. He knows who is phony when he sees one. Well, he is quite a phony himself, but at least he realizes it. Another thing is that he is very kind and sensitive and all. He cares about if the ducks will go south in winter --- how many adults worry about that kind of question? We probably worry more about if our stocks will go south or not. And he knows that letting others to express their feelings is much more important than \\"sticking to the topic\\" and getting a good grade in Oral Expression class. That is pretty witty, if you ask me.I enjoyed that part about this museum he was talking about. It killed me. It really did. I used to skip class just to horse around this goddamn museum.Now that I am a parent and all, I will tell you what I got out of this book: you have to be there, when your kid is all depressed and lonesome. You can't just make a lot of dough for him and send him to a phony prep school and think you are a goddamn good parent. You have to be with him --- not to keep telling him to apply himself, but to listen to him. You know why he likes to shoot bull with Phoebe? Because she listens! That kid can listen! You have to be there when he is depressed as hell over his dead classmate and dead brother, when he worrys about not having enough sexual experience, things like that. So next time he doesn't have to seek guidance from some college guy who won't listen after all at 10pm in a goddamn bar! You can't just give the work to some psychoanalyst, you have to be the catcher who catches the kid before they fall off the cliff!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Catcher in the rye\\" is a novel about adolescence. It is the story of a fugitive, a sixteen year-old boy, Holden, who is expelled from his school three days before Christmas and doesn't dare come back home to face his parents. Three days of vagrancy and sordid, touching adventures, with worries and anxiety, in search of himself or the others. The story of a lost kid who looks for reasons to live in an hostile and corrupt world.I think that it is not so much the outcome which is important and interesting in this novel, but the functioning of the mind and feelings of this teenager who, beyond his teenage immaturity, understands the life with a spontaneity and a truth that a lot of adults do not use anymore. With his own words, he describes the world and the people. As he refuses to loose his own innocence, just the children (and especially his little sister Phoebie) enchant him. He wants to be a catcher in the rye to keep the kids from falling off the cliff: to keep them from the \\"phonies\\" of the world.In this book, we have a complicity with the narrator because he writes like he speaks and like he thinks, which also gives a humorous touch to the novel.\\"Catcher in the rye\\" touched me a lot by the worries and difficulties Holden is confronted with and the point of view he gives on the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book does not need fantasy or science fiction to be great - all it needs is a truth and understanding of a kids point of view, with the writing skills of an adult. For a character with such exact point of views, I find myself constantly agreeing with Holden.The little one linners such as &quot;that killed me&quot;, give such a great understanding, and are placed perfectly. Other books would have looked deminished with such short and precise sentences, but it only enhances the catcher in the rye.And to the greatest band (IMO) Greenday, this, is who wrote Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is really rather good. I like the straightforward way that Holden tells the story; to me at least, it wasn't hugely emotional or descriptive, he just sets these observations down (some of which are very funny.)His excuse for not sleeping with the hooker was that he didn't think he could \\"ever do it with somebody who sits in a movie all day long.\\" And fair enough. I think he really loved Jane, too. If you read Ghost World (it's not long at all) Enid says the same sort of thing about not wanting to sell goofy gus to a guy with a trendy hairdo. These are honestly, -at least in my experience- the kind of things you think when you're younger. It's not so much being chicken, but I think it's following your heart, and trying not to compromise (even with little things.) I'm still wondering what kind of place in the world kids like Holden and Enid would have.Holden seems to adjust his behaviour for different sorts of people, as if it's just to gauge them. He's observing them. I watch my younger cousin do this all the time at parties and it's really interesting. Holden sort of goes here and there, meets people and gets along with anyone, but he's perceptive and can see all this \\"phony\\" stuff that's going on. I don't really think he's being arrogant, because a lot of young people -the age group he mostly hung out with- want to be different. On top of that most people have to act phony for jobs. It's a part of life, sadly.I read through this in a day or two. It's easy to get into. Words like \\"classic\\" slapped across a book don't really mean a lot to me, and I even was a little wary of it because of all these great reviews, but I really enjoyed it.My favourite time in the book is when he is with Phoebe, it's very sweet.The only thing I didn't like about the book was some of the old phrases and bad language, but that is really minor."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the book \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger. It takes place in the 1950's. This story is about a 16 year old boy named Holden Caulfield, a boy in a mental hospital undergoing treatment. He tells the story from here about what happened in his life from the end of the fall school term to Christmas.Holden is a kid who is at his fourth school, Pencey, because he failed out of the other three, he just found out he is failing four of his five classes. After getting aggravated with some of his teachers and an argument with his roommates, he decides to head back to Manhattan early. When he gets there, he stays at a hotel and goes all over the city to have fun. He hangs out with some old friends and girlfriends. One girl, he gets mad at for not running away with him. He gets drunk with a bunch of kids and gets Luce upset because Holden was making fun of him.After getting everyone mad at him he heads to his sisters house where he finds out some shocking news about what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to catch little children from falling off a cliff. He got this idea from a poem by Robert Burn's. He thinks it says \\"if a body catch a body, coming through the rye.\\" But his sister reveals some news that changes everything.I thought this book was great. I could relate to Holden because he was a teenager. He did drugs and was pissed at everyone. He wasn't happy with school or how life was going. Many teens can relate to some of this, especially going through changes from an adolescent to an adult. Holden learns a very important lesson involving this in the end of the story.Overall, this book was great and I would encourage anyone to read it, especially teens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i wish more authors wrote books like this. This is one of my all time favorite books. Any guy in his early teens to early twenties can't help but relate to some of Holden's problims. Holden is a traggic hero and I love the way he tells things like they are. This is an absolutely must read. I never read books twice but I'd read this book again and again, etc..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is kind of a sad little book. Holden, the main character, is kicked out of school yet again and must go back home and face his parents. Of course, he really doesn't want to do this, so what he does insetad is go around the city doing things he probably shouldn't be doing. Considering that he drinks, even though he's underage, hires prostitutes and can't say more than two words with out resorting to profanity, one would say this is a book about a spoiled and immature kid. But it isn't really. Holden has a very particular way of looking at life, an almost adult way, in the sense of it being slightly wise and very melancholic. He seems to have a sadness inside of him that affects the way he looks at the world, and even though he does things that should be considered bad, you end up not seeing them like that at all, because he does them almost without meaning to.I say this book is sad, meaning that in its own way the narrator transmits to you a sadness without the actual content of the book really being sad. It is almost as though the book were too real, cruelly so, and that is what makes it so heartbreaking and at the same time so special. I have no clue if this is really the way teenage boys nowadays look at life. And I have a feeling it's not, at least not for most of them. But after reading The Catcher in the Rye, one can't help hoping it's true."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'll admit first that the only reason I read this book was because of a Humanities Final. After finishing the novel I honestly thought i got absolutely nothing from it. Until I let it sink in. As far as ease of reading, it was very easy to read in a couple hours. At some points I had to put the book down and do something else to get interested again but it kept you wondering what was happening, or what was going to happen. The events and the thoughts that go through Holdens head are easy to relate to. After reading it you can actualy relate Holdens character to society rather than a person. I thought the book was a great read, I enjoy books that leave you with something without the intention of it. Rather than a moral or life's lesson, it leaves you questioning yourself and others, and what the word happiness means to each of us. Great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" when I was a senior in high school for an AP English class I had. I started the book without knowing anything about it, and I was pleased to see that it wasn't the same as most of the other books I'd been required to read. Holden, the main character and narrator, has a colorful vocabulary, and he's not above dropping a few verbal bombs. He is also very genuine, telling things exactly as he sees them. This results in a rough, perverse book, that turns some readers off. However, the book needs to be this way. Throughout the novel, Holden constantly denigrates phonies and phoniness. If Holden told his story without his constant swearing and pessimistic attitudes, then the book itself would be phony. I have to admit, that even though I love this book, it does drag in a few places. But the parts that drag are necessary to understand the characters and plot. Even though this book is relatively old, written in the fifties, I think, it's just as applicable today as it was when it was published. You'll laugh while reading this book, and you'll find yourself wishing that Holden was one of your friends. He's such a stud! Read it and you'll see what I'm talking about. Salinger is a pretty good writer. Also check out his book called \\"Nine Stories,\\" particularly the stories \\"The Laughing Man\\" and \\"Just After the War with the Eskimos.\\" These stories remind me of \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Holden is a character that readers can really identify with. You can get this book at any library, so don't bother buying it unless you really like it. I envy those of you who have yet to read it. You're in for a life-changing experience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I enjoyed J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye I would reccomend it to any teenager, even if it takes place in the 50's Holden Caufield is still a very relateable person even to people growing up now. But what I did not like about it was that Holden seemed to complain as if noone else has every faced the same problems, even though they were'nt small and meaningless but there still not an uncommon thing. I don't really hate it but personally I don't like it. Overall I liked this book though, it was one of the first books I really \\"read\\" rather than reading it just for school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Annotation: \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is about an overly witty, know-it-all teenager named Holden Caufield. Although he is very smart, Holden has a history of getting kicked out of school for not trying hard enough in his classes. The story takes place at his current school Penecey, where, once again, he's gotten kicked out. He decides he shouldn't go home right away because he doesn't want to be there when his parents receive the bad news. As Holden gives his parents a few days to get the letter and cool off, he spends his time roaming around New York, having one small misadventure after another. Throughout the story Holden goes from staying at swanky, posh, hotels, to getting robbed by a prostitute and her pimp (the bell boy). He later decides that running away is what he really wants to do. Over time, through visits with his sister and meetings with other friends and teachers, he realizes home is where the heart is and starting over is always an option.Author Biography: Jerome David Salinger was born in New York in 1919.When he turned 18 Salinger spent five months in Europe in 1937. From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University. Salinger began his writing career, writing short stories for magazines in New York. Of his early work, a story called \\"A Perfect Day For Banana Fish\\" stood out. The Catcher in the Rye, his first novel, was published in 1951. Salinger later published Franny And Zooey (1961) and Raise High the Roof-Beam, Carpenters and Seymour -- An Introduction (1963) as well as other short stories. After the literary fame of The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger became an outsider and a loner. He moved from New York to New Hampshire where he continued to write novels but did not publish them.Evaluation: The Catcher in the Rye is about a young teenager, Holden Caulfield.Holden epitomizes the growing pains every young high school student. After he gets kicked out of school he decides not to go home right away and spends his time roaming around New York having little adventures. This is a story of a boys journey of figuring out himself and the world around him.I really enjoyed reading \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". I enjoyed the main characters sarcasm and how you could relate to how he felt. The story of how Holden decides to deal with his issues is funny, witty, and poignant. Although I haven't gone through what he has, I could relate with how he felt slightly lost at times, and how he got so wrapped up in his crazy ideas. A really important part of the story, I thought, was how every time he went to do something crazy or had some wacky idea, sooner or later, there was always someone (whether is was a teacher, friend, or his sister) to snap him back into reality and make him realize that it wasn't a good idea. But I also thought it was sad that he had a support system all along but never realized it. I thought the book was extremely well written and was tremendously funny. The book reels you in with it's witty style, and gives you the wonderful feeling that everyone, at one time or another, goes through the awkwardness of being young, and the satisfaction that everything will turn out okay in the end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye begins at Pency Prep in Pennsylvania. Where a sixteen year old, Holden Caulfield, has gotten expelled out of his fourth school. After having a scuffle with his roomate, Holden decides to head home to New York three days early without letting his parents know he's home. Once in New York, Holden checks into a hotel room and wanders around the city. At the end of the book Holden writes his sister a note to meet him at the museum because he wants to tell her he's going to move out west. Holden didn't end up going."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. J.D. Salinger's style writing was ingenious. This was a book I could not put down for hours at a time. The way the author put one interesting thing after another made you want to keep on reading. Plus, he made the main character a very cool person. It was easy to relate to him. These are the reasons why I really liked the book.First, I like how this story showed great character development for Holden Caulfield. He just seemed to change right in front your eyes. At first, he was a student that had just flunked out of Pencey Prep and had no direction in life. He was constantly judging people by calling everybody a phony. Anyone that he thought was to cocky or just pretending to be someone else was a phony. He hated people like that. In fact, the main reason he hated school was because he thought everyone was fake in it. The only person he seemed to like was his roommate Stradlater. But, he still thought Stradlater was a little obnoxious because he was madly in love with himself. He also thought very highly of his sister Phoebe. In the later chapters of the book you see his character start to change. He ends judging people less because he realizes he should be focusing on keeping the world of children innocent. For example, at the very end of the book when all of those walls had \\"F*** you\\" written on them he wondered how that phrase could affect the children's minds and actions. So, he tried to erase every sign that he saw to prevent the children from seeing it. This event just showed that he was looking out for the children's innocence. I also liked how Holden matured a little bit throughout the novel. He did this by showing some sympathy for people. For example, when the prostitute came into his room he couldn't go through with it because she seemed too real. He couldn't do that to someone who seemed to genuine. Also, he felt bad after leaving Mr. Antolini's room because of what seemed like a homosexual advance on him. He thought he was rude about it and wanted to go back to apologize. There were lots of different sides of Holden that if read carefully you could pick up. He was one of the most interesting characters I have ever read about and I really like him.Second, I really liked the perspective that the book was written in. It was written in a style of first person I have never read before. It is because the whole book Holden is telling you a story about this portion of his life where he had a realization on what he was really meant to do. So it's almost like a story in a story. In using this style you can understand a lot more about the main character because Holden tells us what's on his mind. What I mean is he could you be telling you a story about this person and in between sentences be like \\"Yeah, I hated him because he was phony\\". It's just cool because you find out what he was really thinking. It helps you understand his problems and also helps with his development.This book was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. It is full of excitement and drama that will keep you reading and reading. The author goes so in depth with his story telling that you feel like you actually know this person in real life. I felt like he was one of my friends because I ended up knowing so much about him. This book was so good that I don't have a dislike about it. In my opinion its perfect. The best part of the book is finding out how the author got the title. So, just read it yourself and find out what this book has to offer.By: Justin Malchano"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would recommend this book to people who are in the teenage years; the reason is because the book is about a rebellious teenager who flunks out of school. The main character is Holden Caulfield. The story takes place in the 1950s; Holden Caulfield narrates the story from place where he is receiving mental therapy.The story starts off pretty slow. Throughout the first and second chapter Holden doesn't do very much; he watches part of a football game and goes to meet up with his history teacher Mr. Spencer.The book starts to get interesting when really start to lean what kind of person Holden is; you know he is a lazy, rebellious teenager, but you start to see how he really is later in the book. I find it interesting how Holden is nice to people his dislikes. For example he is friendly to his cocky roommate Stradlater, even though he dislikes him.From this point out the book get more interesting every moment. When he gets on the train to go home he talks to some kids mother that goes to his school. He tells her how great her son, when he really is a jerk and not many people like him. There is nothing to special about this book but you just want to know what is going to happen next to Holden.I find it annoying how Holden constantly changes his mind and chickens out of doing things. I also don't like how he says stupid things to people that drive them away from him. Despite the boring first chapters and some of the annoying things Holden does I found this book very interesting and funny."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger was the first book in my life that i have actually enjoyed reading the entire way through. Usually kids find books relatively boring, but the way Salinger's imagination takes off in this book is just astounding!I found the main character, Holden very similar to myself. There for could probably relate to many kids who read this novel.I have never read a book where you have to think so deeply about life. The odd thing was i understood everything that Salinger was talking about. The symbolism is all through the book. Trying to link things together to better understand them was such a fun aspect of reading it. For example his obsession with the ducks in the central park pond symbolizes Holdens' purpose in life and where he's going with his life. The whole book is like this, symbolic meanings are everywhere. The title of the book is the largest symbolic meaning, and also the most important symbolic meaning; but you'll have to read it to find out.Holden is a seventeen year old boy who is very confused about life. His rebellious attitude toward everything is quite funny actually. I enjoyed how he called everyone a phony except for his own family and one girl who he liked. He thought if someone was very talented at something they were phony because they were \\"too good\\" at it. I couldn't help but laugh at that.Although I laughed at Holden's rebelliousness, there were times where I felt where he was coming from. The \\"dont care about anything\\" attitude I could really relate to. Holden doesn't care about anything but his family in this book. He's getting kicked out of Prep school in New York City, because he failed 4 out of 5 classes. It's not even that he doesn't care about his education rather than he's so opinionated that he thinks school is a waste, because its preparing you for a phony life.Holden is the most opinionated and spontaneous character i have ever imagined. Which makes this book perfect for teenagers. I would strongly recommend this book to all teenagers. I believe everyone could benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for a book report and I actually enjoyed it. This book quickly became one of my favorites. It was a quick and easy read. This book also never got boring. As a high school student myself I could relate to this book. This book also has cussing in it, which will also draw younger readers. The story is about a lonely and depressed high school student, named Holden Caulfield and he gets kicked out of his prep school. He has been kicked out many times before but this time he decides to leave a couple of days early. After he leaves he goes to New York City. That is where most of the story takes place and where most of the events take place. In this city he has many experiences for good and bad. And through all these experiences he is trying to decide if he should go home and go back to school or to start a new life. People influence through out the story like his friends and family. I don't want to give away the ending, but this was a great book and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is one of the greatest novels ever written by an American author. And the sad story of Holden Caulfield is probably the best novel ever written about adolescence. Like all great fiction, this book has many layers and angles, from memorable characters, a gripping (and subtle) plot, poignancy, and humor. The underlying conflict within Holden between childhood innocence and adult phoniness, a conflict we all face in life, is timeless. You could read this book five times and find new insights in it each time. A stunning work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked this book, it's as simple as that. I had never read it until this year (my senior year in high school), and was one of the few that hadn't. I had always figured that since it was a classic, it would be boring; many classics have been praised by all kinds of critics, and it seemed to me that half the time, the books [are bad] (i.e. Animal Farm, The Red Badge of Courage, Lord of the Flies). However, what I like about \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is that it is written from the main character's point of view, and the way it is written is basically the way the kid talks. I thought that helped make the book a good one, because the way I see it, the reader can't identify with a seventeen-year-old kid in a book as well if they don't really feel like the kid is talking to them, and when you read this, it feels like the character (Holden) is actually talking to you; he makes a lot of sarcastic, cynical remarks that make the reader chuckle rather frequently, and I thought that added a lot to the character. Another thing that I think is great about this book is that Holden is one of those kids who is slightly troubled; he's breaking rules left and right, he fails all but one of his classes and has been kicked out of two schools. When I was reading this, I realized that I know people like that, that I've grown up with kids that did that kind of stuff, and that makes the book all the more interesting. I think that one mistake that people who have not read this book make is they expect it to be a novel, but it's really more of a character analysis, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll probably really enjoy this book a lot. This is one of the few books I actually enjoyed reading in school, the only other being \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" If you haven't read this book yet, then I highly recommend that you do. It's not heavy or complicated, and it's a book that many readers can identify with in one way or another."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is about the loss of childhood and innocence. It is about trying to stay a child and delay or reject adulthood. The book recognizes that adulthood presents problems that are not clean or easy and involve compromising ones values and beliefs. It's about the recognition of how the loss of childhood leads to a potentially less enjoyable life. That adulthood is not all it's cracked up to being and it mercilessly shows the hypocrasy and games that adult's play including the denial of who they actually are.It is a stunning and extremely honest book in it's portrayal of an adolescent's observations of adulthood."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I checked this book out at the library the other day and finished it that very same day. I believe it is now my new favorite book. Holden Caulfield is such a great character who narrates the book with a mix of humor, cynicism, and nostalgia. Holden has trouble making the transistion from childhood to adulthood due to the phoniness of it all. Longing to be a &quot;catcher in the rye&quot;, he wishes he could save children from &quot;falling&quot; of a cliff into adulthood. This book should be read and reread by everyone. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Unlike the norm, Holden Caulfield is an anti-hero protagonist. This book is a document of the first few days before Holden suffers a mental breakdown. Holden is obsessed with \\"phonies\\" and \\"bastards,\\" which are just about the entire adult and adolescent community with a few exceptions. The innocence of childhood are the only things in his world which is truly pure. Adulthood totally destroys this fantasy of his as he grows up, still holding on to his own lost childhood. Basically, Holden doesn't not want to grow up at all and enter the \`phony' world of adulthood. Holden knows he has to grow up, but that's the thing that scares the hell out of him, like anyone else. Holden's a brave coward with his futile attempts to keep childhood=innocents and ward off adulthood= vile.Throughout the book however, Holden meets some adults who aren't phony at all that scares the hell out of him because it brings his set world into a state of flux. Which is very ironic because Holden ( who is only 16 years old but sounds like a grumpy old man) himself is a phony too, a phony in his perspective of one. He is \\"yellow\\", a liar, shallow even and wants to be accepted like anyone else his age.There is so much connections and truly natural human qualities throughout this novel which I couldn't possibly list. Now I know why we have to read this in my school. I have never read any other book in my 16 years of life that was even similar to the feeling I had when I closed this book. It was very odd and didn't understand it at first which is why I didn't like it at first, but that really changes. It was definitely something new to read and urge anyone to read this book and really analyze it. We are, in fact, Holden Caulfields oureselves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Its amazong that i am even writing this review, i think that writing reviews taints the published work, i am writing this more because i read someone bashing the book, which is absolutely rediculous. i am glad there are people that dont like it actually. The book is a single read in my opinion, read it once and be absorbed, and you either get it or you dont. It captures a certain time in life and certain feelings accurately and absolutely, that is what is stunning. IT also captures a thought process as it occurs, few books do this so well. If you are young and dislike the way the world works, and are a dichotomy yourself and you realize it, i think you will like the book. stop reading reviews too right after mine and just read the book or dont."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can't see how people can rave about this being pointless. It's sad that so many people are so shallow. I guess these people can't contemplate a novel any deeper then Harry Potter. The book is about real life, real emotion. Its a classic story of the rejection and fear we ALL feel as teenagers. Open your minds. The reason the author wishes to be alone, is because he sees how people really are. For example, those who can't see the meaning of this classic novel....."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love this book. I am a fifteen-year-old girl and I can really relate to the character of Holden Caulfield. He's headed toward a world that he doesn't want to live in; a world that he sees as phony and dangerous. He doesn't feel like he belongs. I found his comments to be funny and his flow-of-consciousness writing to be realistic. Some people see the constant cursing as bad writing, but it's not. It's realistic. That's the kind of person Holden is.Many people find this book pointless and boring. What many don't understand is that this is a character-driven book, not a plot-driven one. And also, things are not as they seem. Because Holden is narrating, it's hard not to simply accept everything he says. But then we meet Phoebe, and Mr. Antolini, who point out where Holden could be wrong. It can be hard for the reader to understand that though, because Holden doesn't think he is wrong.While there *are* bad and phony people in the world, Holden is wrongfully blaming everything on other people. He distances himself from everyone--it's sort of like a case of Social Anxiety Disorder, in a way. But he never comes out and says that. The reader has a responsiblity to analyze Holden, because he does not explain everything to them--he can't. Although he does go into great detail about certain events, items, and other people, he can't explain much about *himself*, and that makes it interesting. But it's a wonderful read, because it delves into the thoughts of a sweet, screwed-up kid who just doesn't understand how to interact with people.I think that if you were to read up on the subtle hints and character analyses in this book, you will find that it's much deeper than it appears during the re-read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When this book was presented to my English class by my teacher, I immediately thought, &quot;Oh by, another boring book!&quot; However, that thought was blown away after I read the first two chapters and became hooked on it. I began to read further and the further I read, the more interested I became. I couldn't put the book down. It was like attached to my hands. I guess you could say that I relate to the book somehow. I would represent Holden Caufield and my brother would represent Holden's brother, D.B.D.B. is in Hollywood writing scripts for movies. My brother has an A.A. Degree in film. Holden has a boring life and he cannot think of what he wants to do. That is me. I have this thing where I can't make up my mind on what I want to do in life. There are several parts in the book where I wanted to cry, I'll admit that. I really did. :)The story itself was outstanding. The characters had the right touch to them and the language was great. The best thing about the book was that it was based on the point of view from a teenager. I won't give away what happens towards the end of the book but I will say that I cried while reading the final two chapters! I really did. :)I reccommend this book for anyone with a heart for reading. If your a teenager, I strongly suggest you grab a copy of The Catcher in the Rye and begin reading it to see what I have been talking about. This is my favorite book in the whole world. I believe that J.D. Salinger did a terrific job writing this book. I'm glad to have been introduced to it. It's the only book that I had to read for English that interested me.I hope you'll take what I have said into consideration and buy this book! It truely is a great book. It really is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suspect there is very little I can add on The Man, The Myth, The Legend, but I do really dig this book...I recently gulped this one down in one sitting. I'd read it twice before years earlier, and one additional reading several years before that. I didn't read it straight through until this last time, however; and for a book that took 10 years to write it reads as a kids ramblings in the course of what could be a single afternoon. This, naturally, speaks of the considerable craftsmanship behind it.The language is infectious, as is Holden's disdain of (drum roll please...) &quot;phonies&quot;, and I'm sure everyone has experienced someone affecting &quot;Holden Speak&quot; upon discovery of CITR. But, it does get in deep. In fact, I had to read &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, &quot;Nine Stories&quot;, and &quot;Raise High The Roofbeams...&quot; in the following weeks, I was so into Salinger's writing. But, I digress.Great book. Great character. Great writing.Now, can we please have &quot;Hapworth&quot;????We've been very patient..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Simply put - if you have never read this book, buy it. It's a timeless piece that is as fresh and modern today as it was when it was first written. Don't be fooled by peoples assertion's that its fame has been garnered from its vulgarity or its abusive use of directness."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hate poetry because it doesn't get to the point like communication should. When I was assigned this book at school I spent time looking for some hidden meaning. I came to the conclusion that salinger was almost retarded when compared to vonnegut or C.S. lewis's complicated writings. After thinking about the book during the summer, I realized that this book wasn't trying to prove anything (even Salinger says that himself) it was just a simple book about life. I knew what Salinger wanted and why he wrote it that way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Most people hate this book either because they think Holden is a whining spoiled brat or because they don't like the writing style. Well then, that's their preference... Allowing these things to annoy then shows they do not truly appreciate the profound meaning of the story. They are acting exactly like Holden: a shallow boy. The writing style is to provide realism; it is meant to get the reader depressed, to get the reader to see through Holden's eyes. But Salinger isn't restricted to writing in a depressed glum tone; he shows his literary ability with many of the other various believable characters, such as Phoebe. This book exemplifies the iceberg idea: you can only see the small peak of an iceberg but underneath the water is a mountain. With this book the words may seem like useless and boring rantings but there is an enormous amount of meaning lying beneath the words. If you are looking for a \\"fun\\" entertaining light book don't read this; this book is meant to be read not for its suspenseful plot (it has none) but it's universally profound meaning. This is a fantastic story about a boy desperately struggling to maturity, a boy learning about life. I encourage everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To make a long story short: this is a great book, one of the best ever written. I read this book last year in 8th grade and it kept me interested until the very last page. The author, J.D. Salinger really does a great job creating sometimes sad and dramatic moments while narrating the story in a very informal way, like he's your friend. This helps the reader to see everything through Holden's (the main character) eyes even more. You become immersed in the story.Although Holden doesn't appear to be very smart, I think he is a genius. If you take a closer look at what he says you can really get a lot out of this book. I promise you won't want to put this book down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The theme of this novel is the confession of a truly innocent, unselfish young person who believes he is guilty of failure in his responsibility to people. Holden Caulfield has not been able to continue for any length of time in a number of prestigious schools his parents have sent him to, because he cannot accepttheir standard of striving for material success. And yet nobody seems to sympathize with his spiritual goals, particularly his ideal of subordinating everything to love, by the example of Jesus. He eventually finds refuge from his extreme crisis of despair when he rejoins his baby sister Phoebe, an &quot;ordinary&quot; little child with the genius of a spiritual sage who makes Holden resume his life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can I say? It's a classic! I've been on a classic spree lately. After reading this, I immediately polished off Lord of the Flies. While I can say that I probably rathered Lord of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye isn't far behind.I'm sure you've read the other reviews of this book and they've told you plenty about the story, themes, lack of themes, morals, lack of morals, and character analyzation, and all that stuff. So I won't bother.I really enjoyed this book. It was fresh and original to me, and I am really glad I finally read it, after always hearing so much about it. If you like any sort of literature, you should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I did not like this book when I first read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, because I thought that he is telling his domb life after he was expelled. However, it wasn't. This book was about Holden having new experiences in different views as he had. As he stays in New York,he is telling all the bad things about everyone whoever he meets and said everyone are phony and stuff. But at the end of this book, he begin to think how other people will think if he says or think somethings. That was shown when Holden tells Phoebe that he is not going to West anymore. Even though his journey is only 4days long, he grows up a lot. In this book we can know and feel Holden's growth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All I can say is this is by far one of the best books I've ever read, and probably will stay that way. JD's style of writing is so amazing, and I simply love listening to Holden. This is the kind of book that, after reading it, you're never the same."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Thhis book is amazing. It is about a boy named Holden Caufield and his journy through the life of a prep school. Salinger takes an unapealing bad boy and makes you intreged by him, even love him. You just keep wanting to learn more about this strange but lovable boy. When i finished this book, i almost missed Holden. I loved this book and strongly suggesst it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a very funny book to me. It centers around a young man (I forget his name as I read this book two years ago, but plan to read it again soon) and his crazy life style, with girls, a little too much swearing, smoking, and &quot;Interesting&quot; friends from school. He has a little sister named Phoebe (isn't it amazing, I remember HER name) who is not mentioned often but who sort of is an influence, and this book just made me happy, sad, and full of mirth all at once. Great book to read out of or in school (in my case, I read it out of school)...The story of 'his' interesting life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many people complain that this book is boring and pointless. I can't understand how you could call this masterpiece \\"pointless\\". It is a tale of easily the most intersting character of literature I have ever read of, and his escalading battle with mental depression. I have trouble believing that someone could not see the truly amazing patterns and symbols this book holds that all catch up to each other at the end. Many have complained that there is no real ending. I don't think people were seeing the symbolism through all of the amazing (and disturbing) narrative. The book clearly has an ending- and a fabulous one if you have payed attention....One of the best written novels ever made, Catcher in the Rye is something I, and many other teenagers, can relate with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"GOTCHA! No, J.D. Salinger didn't appear at a booksigning last weekend, but I wish he had. So do millions of his other readers. As an author with my debut novel in its initial release (as well as a high school teacher for over twenty years), I am a great admirer of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. By all counts and by all measures, Salinger's great novel is one of the finest books ever written by an American. It has now been fifty years since THE CATCHER IN THE RYE was first published, and Salinger's story of Holden Caulfield rings as true today as it ever has. Holden's angst-filled voice remains heartfelt and honest. It is a book that everyone should read at least once. It should be read several times. It is a masterpiece, and Salinger should be proud. I am certain he is. Now, if he'd only agree to go on a book promotion tour. There is no better way to see America and meet the American reading public!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are so many writers who have tried over and over again to somehow capture teenage angst in they're books and failed not so with Salinger's Catcher in the rye. Holden Caulfield, the narrator of the book is a troubled teenager, struggling in school and hating those phonies who attend it. His grades stink, but we can tell that he is one bright kid, and the way he or should i say Salinger wrote this book is raw and non-candy coated wich was the point all the other writers out there missed. Salinger wasn't out there to write something that has that cliched good ending at the end of the book, nor a love story between two struggling teens, he wrote about the rebel inside all of us, the guy who screams to be heard. Holden listens to that voice, sure it gets him into trouble, but he's honest and true to himself, and all those times we've neglected to listen to ourselves, we live through Holden. Honest and dark, sad and moving, some chapters are hard to get through, and just when you think Holden can't sink any lower: he does. A book for all types of people (hey this is the book John Lennon's killer raved about).After reading it for the first time, you'll start reading it all over again up to a certain point (those who've read know wich one), since you know what's ahead second time around it will make the dark parts even harder to take. The least this book will do for you is remind you of the days when it was you against the world, when everyone around you was fake, that sure is alot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What a fantastic novel this is. Salinger works in deceptively simple ways: as the book is going along, the reader is not surprised by any pyrotechnics, but rather is gradually pulled into Holden Caulfield's mind and is life. Readers, especialy younger ones, can relate intimately to Holden's turbulent emotions. Since the time Catcher in the Rye was written, only a few books have so perfectly captured what it's like to be young and disaffected. The most recent example is Asher Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, a modern-day equivalent to Catcher in the Rye, although nothing will ever match this classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a story of a couple of days in the life of a sixteen-year-old, just after he's been expelled from prep school. This book is an absolute classic and should be read and cherished by generations, the story of Holden Caulfield is truly one of America's literary treasures.FinancialNeeds.com"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although many children across the country dread having to read this one for an English project, I could not put this one down. It is written very well, but rambles at some points and uses COLORFUL dialogue. So if that offends you this is not for you. It is also repetitive within the main character's endless monologue. Never the less this is a humorous story that gives the reader a new point of veiw. I suggest it strongly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What is so great about the book, Catcher in the Rye, which makes it such a critically aclaimed piece of work? Not some fancy language, not some fascinating content, or even some pioneering new issue. What is so great about this book is that when you read it, you realise that how Holden feels, thinks, acts, is exactly how u felt, thought and acted when you were young. Salinger is able to capture the essence of youth. I have no doubt that this book is perhaps one of the best ever written, and to me, it is my personal bible. That is what is so great about the book - that it is honest, true and ALIVE. Anyone who has ever had a childhood will enjoy this book and be totally immersed in the lead character, Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye had been on my reading list for the longest time before I actually settled in to read it. I think I waited to long.Had I read this when I was fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen, it may have impacted me more than waiting until I was twenty-one. By this time, Holden Caulfield was not a dream to me, but instead he was a mistake.There really was no strong plot, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Catcher in the Rye was an enchanting look into the life of a boy- young man- that I really feel should be read by teenaged boys (and girls). Why? I'm not sure. As I said, during my teen years I would have probably found Holden to be a hero. I would have strived to be more like him.Now, looking back on the story, I realize that I was like him and I should have strived to be less like him.The novel is an oxy-moron. Maybe it would best be read by parent and child together and discussed at the breakfast table (if those still exist). When I have children, that's the way I'll hope to use it (if those breakfast tables still exist)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger is commended for his world-acclaimed &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, which is so beautiful, both young and older audiences may enjoy it.The main character is Holden, who is a teenage boy that the majority of an audience will understand; Holden is a character who outwardly seems tough, but the reader will discover that he is struggling with himself inside.J.D. Salinger does an impressive job by using subtle symbolism. The plot is well-developed and aided by the right amount of description of characters and settings. Holden speaks in first-person as the narrator and tends to ramble on, making the format and style of this book highly original - and thus, enjoyable.A book that must be read, for it is emotional, touching, and fun."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't know how many times I've read it since my first time in high school, but seeing this anniversary occasion makes me know it's time to read it again.

Holden Caulfield ( the main character) gets tired of school and his surroundings and leaves. Salinger is a brilliant writer by the way he brings teenage life to reality so readers can understand what its like. He writes about how his life is impacted by what goes around him in his journey through New York. While in New York he searches his life to find some kind of truth in it. He goes through a depression and almost loses it but the dramatic events that happen change his view of life.In the beginning of this book he writes about how Holden struggles through different prep schools. Each school he tries to help out some of his loser friends but not one changes so instead of confirming to their ways he leaves and heads out on his own.This book is a must read for all teenagers, or whoever is considering buying it and reading it or giving it to someone, I strongly believe you should. Take the risk."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book at school,but the teacher kept missing parts out which contained sex etc... but then i saw it in a bookshop and remembered how much I liked what i had read of it. So i read it and it was the best book i ever read,i have no negative remarks about it whatsoever.Holden Caulfield on the outside seems a negative guy,but on the inside you can tell that when he says 'I dont want to do anything when i grow up etc' he is just saying that because he is obviously trying to act tough all the time.I really enjoyed this and anyone can read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I decided to re-read this book. This may be the first book in 15 years that I decided to re-read - but I thought it was worth it (and it only takes a few hours to read). The Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic and inspiring book. I recently ran into a few people who never read the book. My question: why? Get the book right now and read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is my favorite book ever! The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a 16-year-old-boy who is not sure who he is, until he goes on a 48-hour journey for self-discovery. Holden has many things in common with teenagers, which is why I recommend this book. This is a book written in the language of teenagers which makes it interesting to read. Filled with symbolisms, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a book which can help teenagers find their true self and the truth about life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading the critically acclaimed book by J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye. I found the book easy to read and enjoyable. I think that people who fall into the age group of 17-25 can enjoy the book a lot more than most people, because I feel that they can relate to Holden. The book is a story about a couple of days in the life of Holden Caulfield, a boy who sees the world through different eyes. Holden is almost always depressed and we get to follow him from Penncey Prep School to New York City and we meet &quot;phonies&quot; all the way. Over all The Catcher in the Rye is a very enjoyable book and it is just as good as what I've heard about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You might have heard of this book because a teacher assign this book for you to read in english class or whatever. I end up reading this book because i randomly choose it from a stack of book in a bookshelf. I needed to do a report on a book and i randomly choice this one. I didnt know what it was at first, because the version of the book i had only had the title on the front and nothing on the back to kinda tell me what the book was all about. I got caught in reading this book for hour when i read just the first page. It really interest me alot, this was the first book ever that i read which is about how a teenage boy really think of life, and this book tell it alll, it didnt forget anything! As you read the book, you'll learn to see how the character is and get to know him REALLY well and how disturbed this teenager is. Overall i think this is a great book to read. I would this book in my TOP 10 favorite book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; Written by J. Salinger was a great book about a teenager with a foul mouth and a short fuse for a temper. The Setting was contrary to the bizarre actions of the main character. Though Holden Caufield was an overall outcast of his time, many of todays teenagers can really relate to his obscure way of expression. This is an extraordinary book and I would recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book i read was &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; by J.D. Salinger. This book was the best book i have ever read. The reason i fell this way is because usually i hate reading boooks. I usually cant keep reading any book for over an hour withourt taking a break but with this book, I couldnt put it down. The story was very detailed and also very interesting. The author was very good because he never kept you board or confused. I Liked this book because It was different. The author jumped from one thing to another and kept you on your seat. He also let you think that a certain thing was going to happen and it wouldnt and i liked that alot. &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; was a very good book and i recomened it to anyone that likes or hates to read like my self."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye--a overall just great book..one that I can identify with since I am in high school right now.

I still had notes I had written in it when I was in high school almost 20 years ago. The book became my journal as my own thoughts were written on the side pages of the book. This book remains influential because it is a timeless story for the confused, disgruntled, and frustrated youth. Holden Caulfield is a literary icon, the best friend any 16-year-old could have."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently made a vow to reread some books I had skimmed getting through my high school English classes. I knew I had to read Catcher in the Rye, what a great work that was well worth the time it took to finish the book.This book read like a building top of a roller coaster, you never knew what was going to come after the top of the coaster, then you plunged down and twisted around inside Holden's brain and all around his journey towards New York City and his frivilous spending and wild times and adventures.I relate a lot to Holden as I am someone who often has learned to hard way in life. Holden seems to refuse to do things the way he is supposed to, and I love the character for that.You really should not go through life and not read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading this book was almost a religious experience for me - I enjoyed it that much. If you don't know the plot of the story already, its basically the story of a High School student (Holden Caulfield) who hangs out around New York for a while after he's flunked out of yet another high school. Before he goes home, he wants to make sure his mother gets the letter and has time to read it over before he gets home so she won't explode on him. However, the true beauty of the story lies in Holden's commentary throughout the book, not in the story itself.Holden is very cynical and skeptical; more so than your average teenage high school student. Nearly everything he sees he immediately dismisses as &quot;phony&quot; and begins to go into great detail about how superficial or stupid it is. And the thing is, Holden is always right. Though some people think he is nothing more than an obnoxious misanthrope, Holden holds a lot of insight into the world we live in. Anyone who does not give this book four or five stars obviously does not understand the meaning behind the book.While the book is often extremely funny and witty, it is not a book that is meant to be read by junior high students who picked it out for a book report because it looks shorter than the other books. Nor is it meant to be read by conservative adults who think that a book like this is nothing short of blasphemy. This is a book for anyone who has ever felt alone in life, for anyone disenchanted with the world we live in, and for anyone who simply wants to see the world thrue a new and beautifuyl set of eyes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in 9th Grade English (to be fair, I still AM in 9th grade English). All i do is keep reading it over and over and over again waiting until my birthday when I'll get the rest of the J.D. Sailinger books. Including of course the memoirs about him by Margret Sailinger. Until then I relate almost every to something from Catcher in the Rye to my everyday life. Like, that annoying book who sits next to me in Math to Holden's classmate at Pencey Prep, Ackley. All in the is by far the best piece of literature anyone over the age of 12 could read. I Loved it! Read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a tenth grader, this novel was assigned reading for me but i actually read it before we began. I started reading it in math and finished it in about 4 periods, or eight hours. I felt I could really identify with Holden, I mean who can't (except all you phonies?). His brutal honesty is identifiable as well as humrous. Salinger uses a combination of teen-age slang and comical albeit negative view on life to create an affected dumbness of Holden which proves sometimes it's smart to be stupid. To those who say it is not a great piece of litereature or how amazing the diction is well it's not. But it makes for an amazing read which I couldnt say for Hemmingway or Dickens. Much like the guitar sometimes the simple is better and more effective than the long drawn out complex progressive. Intelligence can only be so advanced before it becomes stupid. The Catcher in the Rye never lost interest as did a Tale of Two Cities with it's drawn out pages of contradictions. I mean what's better some Pink Floyd long-guitar solo or the quick lyrical solo of Nirvana's Heart Shaped Box? Sometimes the simpler the diction, the more effective. I think anyone from ages ten to one hundred will enjoy this, but if you dont want your kids getting off that carousel of innocence then dont let them read it. And dont ever tell anyone anything you read because then you will start to miss the book. Enjoy..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read some of the reviews and it's mostly from 2 opposite extremes of love or hate. No wonder Salinger feel compeled to retreat from society, the venom sometimes is too bitter a pill. I always thought Catcher in the Rye is about family or specifically relationship between siblings. The ending where the sister is pleading Holden to stay is one of the most poignant moment that I've ever read. It's not the world that he's angry about, it's the disconnection from his family and it took a display of love from his sister to finally pull him back. I've always felt a quiet introspection everytime I read the book and a greater appreciation for my family and especially my sisters. I think what Mr. Salinger is trying to say is that nothing is more important than family, nothing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"We are first introduced to Holden Caulfield, the narrator of this story, when he is seventeen. From his voice, we are lead into three days of his life when he was sixteen, just expelled from prep school and alone in New York. Now, that isn't the most exciting plot in the world, and I know many have said that the plot is downright mundane. It isn't the plot, however, that makes this book such a literary classic. Through the eyes and words of Holden Caulfield, we are handed that rare glimpse of the heart of every rebellious teenager in the world. There is not a page that goes by without Holden complaining about a phony teacher or a phony act, and by the fifth chapter, you start to realize that it isn't the world that is phony but rather the boy himself who sees it that way.A look at the rebel in all of us is hidden deep inside the heart of Holden Caufield's narration, and within the 'goddamns' and the'phonies', we begin to realize the alienation that he feels is what each of us felt as we grew up in a world that moves a little too fast around us. There is also an underlying humour in Holden's depictions of various scenes and conversations, as if he sees everything as a joke on himself. An altogether thoroughly enjoyable book, something every teenager must read as we face the rushiing waters of life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger is a genius. When I first heard of this novel and decided to read it for a class assignment, I was not thrilled. For one, the title sounds terrible, and, two, anything labeled as an American Literature classic usually means BORING. Well, I was terribly mistaken. This book truly is an American classic. From the first page to the last, you will be completely mesmermized by our hero, Holden. This book was written from the heart and the best way to describe it is that it is real. It is written in real language, with real feeling, emotion. It is about real life from the eyes of a teen. I would recommend this book to people of all ages who are looking for a good laugh, or just want to read a darn good book. Once you open the pages, Holden will become a part of you, and I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the review of someone else's on this page, who said you like Holden less as you get older. I don't agree with that statement. I think the older you get, the more you like Holden, because you realize how perceptive he is, and yet there is still that young innocence about him. I've also read &quot;At Home in the World&quot;, a memoir by Joyce Maynard, the Author who had somewhat of an affair with him when she was 18, and he was 53. And if you are an avid J.D. fan, it's strange once you read her book. Apparently, J.D., or, &quot;Jerome David Salinger&quot; was very much like all the characters in his books. Smart, strange, confused; looking for more out of life than what life could ever give you. Even in her recount of their year long correspondance-turned romance, you never doubt once that what she is saying isn't true.And so, even with all his seclusion, his hatred for most of the &quot;real-world&quot; characters, and his private collection of writings that were probably brilliant, you have to respect him for creating Holden. It's always nice to read that book and take a deep breath, because you are reading about a character who has real flaws, real insecurities, and seems pretty genuine."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a captivating coming of age story. The novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield, ia an immature and naive teenager whose witty, pessimistic narration has captured readers of all ages for decades.Throughout the novel, Holden is alienated by both child and adult world, for his failure to meet the standards of either. His childlike and derogatory outlook on life seperates Holden from his peers. Salinger captures the true essence of teenage angst and confusion in this revolutionary story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"By far one of the best books I have ever read.

A classic story of a young man looking for direction, regardless of the era in which it was written, all young people have gone through this stage in their life.This is part of what makes it so fun to read, his style flows very well and although the whole book takes place over a matter of a few days, you feel like you are with the character every minute of every day and can visualize his whole surroundings and his thoughts and how and why he sees everything how he does.Truly a fun book to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger was a surprisingly interesting book! As a group we all agreed that it seemed unappealing at first, but in the end we found it to be the best book on the summer reading list. It described the experiences of a young man named Holden Caulfield after he was expelled from Pencey Prep School, a boarding school for boys. The author places Holden on a captivating journey through New York City and vividly describes every detail of it. These thoughts, adventures, and reactions are what make the book so easy for a teenager to relate to. J.D. Salinger created a story of excitement and intrigue that captured our attention and will do the same for you. We strongly recommend this book to people of all ages, especially young adults."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since I am a teenager, this book helped to realize that I am not alone in insecurities and mistrials. He says everything that is on his mind, which is probably why this book is all about 1-2 days in his life. Although I think he drinks way too much, its still a good book"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; reminded me of waiting for a bus for about three hours, getting up to get the newspaper and then missing it. It wasn't that it was tedious, because I was hooked from nearly the beginning to the end, and it wasn't that it was poorly written, because J.D. Salinger wrote from the perspective of a confused and angry seventeen-year old so perfectly, I just about believed that Mr. Salinger was Holden Caufield. But after finishing the book, I was left with an unusual feeling that I couldn't quite put my finger on, until a day or two after reading the book. That feeling would have to be disappointment; the ending came a little too abruptly. I wish it would have continued into Holden's adult life. I would have liked to see what sort of places he would travel to, what adventures he would face and what people he would encounter. In conclusion, I thought &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; was an interesting and well thought out tale of innocence lost, and was clearly ahead of its time in philosophy and structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm reading this novel for my English Literature coursework, and find that Holden is just representing every generation after him. We all go through some form of not understanding ourselves and he represents that, even though he can deem misunderstood.For a girl reading this, he reminds me of some shy guy who sits quietly in class wishing he was somewhere else, somewhere larger than life, soemwhere he can do something without being used or bullied. However, like me and a few million other young people he can't because society won't let him. That's why he's so weird and philosophical, he wants out of the 'phony' life people box him into.He is probably trying to tell all the corporate investors that he dos'nt want to be spoon fed into society.If anything I feel sory for him because I can relate, but then he can also be abstract and not really give you anything. Because of this his real truth is underneath his pride, or his lack of asteem, so in turn he seems superficial and lacking something. He's complex with the contridictions, so his character is deeper than a whiny little kid. This can sometimes be misunderstood, as just the weirdest guy ever, but he just does'nt know what's out there for him. He's scared of himself, and what is ahead, which is true of all of us.Apparently Salinger had to study young people for the character of Holden, rather than writing form his own point of view. It works, however many of our older generations tend to disregard our intergrity, in a way Salinger did not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To me this book is very good. Some people may find that this book starts off slow. To me though this book starts off fast enough for me. you will find that this boy describes how some peoples life go. He will show you that life is not always fair but sometimes you just have to deal with it. In this book the author dives right into the book. There is no delay. This book is worth you entire summer to read it. If you don't understand the book then just put it down for a little while and let you mind do the thinking for you. I suggest that you read this book as soon as possible. There was nothing that I did not like, everything that was in here I liked. If you are 13 or older you must read this book. The reason why I say 13 is because this book has alot of cursing in it. Otherwise dive right into the book. Jerome David Salinger was born in New York in 1919. His older sister&#8217;s name is Doris. His father, Sol, was in the meat and cheese business. His mother, of whom he was very fond, was Irish Catholic. The catcher in the rye was his classic book that everyone knows him by."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What a fantastic novel this is. Salinger works in deceptively simple ways: as the book is going along, the reader is not surprised by any pyrotechnics, but rather is gradually pulled into Holden Caulfield's mind and is life. Readers, especialy younger ones, can relate intimately to Holden's turbulent emotions. Since the time Catcher in the Rye was written, only a few books have so perfectly captured what it's like to be young and disaffected. The most recent example is Asher Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, a modern-day equivalent to Catcher in the Rye, although nothing will ever match this classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I always felt that J. D. Salinger was Holden Caulfield. In reading Catcher in the Rye we get a glimpse of J. D. Salinger through Holden's eyes and mouth and what he thought of the world in general. Holden's description is so vivid that I sometimes found myself in that exact moment in whichever place he happened to be. I could hear him in my head, but at the same time I'm not so sure that he and I could be friends, as I had learned long ago to expand my own vision and expectations on the real world. Yet I hold Holden Caulfield dear to my heart for honestly there have been thoughts that have reflected some of my past. Perhaps if I found a bit of Holden and some better realism in a man I would find the perfect Mr. Right..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"At no time in my life did i think that anyone could understand what my life involved. But to discover a book based on the life of a adolesant just like me, i found phenomenal. Holden, the protaganist, tells us of three complex and interesting days in his life while he is on the verge of a breakdown. The novel tells us of how he searches for the perfect relationship, one which he can rely on. This special relationship turns out to be that between himself and his sister phoebe. Overall, i found this an easy book to relate to and if you consider yourself a reblous teen, you will find your self picturing you in the place of Holden. Too good for words, and will stay in the hearts of teens for generations to come."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, the language Holden uses is really good and the slang words suit him perfectly. I liked how JD Salinger gives life to Holden to the point that you feel identified with him and the phoniness of the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; By J. D. Salinger was one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. The main Character, Holden Caulfield, in my opinion was a whinny immature, little child, like many people I know. I did not sympathize with him when he would complain about anything and everything or when he would get into trouble. I did however like the main message, in my opinion, that I believe Salinger was trying to portray, which was that you need to find out who out who you really are. This book was fabulous, and I would recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 15 and felt (as do many teenagers) that I was Holden Caulfield. Forget that Holden came from a priveleged, urban background, while I was lower middle class and from a small town. The experience of feeling alienated, wondering if you were even sane, and discovering that the world is populated by fools and &quot;phonies&quot; provided all the identification any 60s teen would need.Rereading it now, in my late 40s, I have a somewhat different, perhaps more mature perspective--I have made my peace with the &quot;phonies&quot;, as we all must to survive in this world. In fact, I have even come to see that the phonies can be lost souls in their own right and perhaps deserving of a little compassion. But Holden still speaks to my &quot;inner adolescent&quot; and his righteous anger at the ways of the world invokes something beyond nostalgia in this reader. Holden's experience in post-WWII America reflects the confusion and spiritual hunger we &quot;post-Moderns&quot; are still experiencing. We emerged from the 40s with no easy answers and no absolutes. Holden had no idea, but in his own awkwardly adolescent way, he was walking the Existentialist path."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the most famous books of our time that you can read over and over again. The Catcher in the Rye is about a young boy nmed Holden Caulfield who isn't quite the best student at school. He gives you his views on phonies, who are the majority of people on this planet, groupies and school. Holden takes you through an adventure, in which he gets kicked out of school and travels to New York to go home and face his parents. On the way there he meets and talks to moms, prostitutes, teachers, phonies and his sister Phoebe. He acts in most instances like normal teenagers would act. Kids like lying to parents about thier own kids, telling them stories about how goodie goodie their son or daughter is even though you hate them. Kids also like to act as if they were older, kids love to run away and go do something sparatic and giving support to thier siblings is another thing kids do. This book is really easy to read and the description of characters is outstanding. When you read this you think it really happened in real life. Salinger did an excellent job describing events that you feel you have personally experienced. This is a definite read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An ageless story about the feelings of teenagers as they are lost in an exclusively adult world.

There is a weak plot, but it doesn't go much of anywhere because it's not what's important. What the book is really about, is character, human nature and such. Things like that, while a plot would be nice, they can really get in the way sometimes. That said, if you pay attention, you will likely find the book to be charming, humerous and very interesting. There is a lot here that people can relate to yada yada... Notice that the only bad reviews in here are people who are whining for a suspenseful plot... what the hell do these people do with the rest of the words in a book anyway? No book is 100% plot. Go watch a movie or something ... but not Bringing out the Dead; it has no plot... although I still liked that movie it wasn't nearly as good as this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book more times than I can count.

Really, I think that Hanson show us all troubles of life that disturb kids in this time of life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If the current take on life is that it's pointless, then this book captures the modern mood. While Dostoyevsky specialized in showing the negation involved in centering one's life on anything other than the Ultimate, Salinger's book is about the pointlessness of it all. He's a master ironist, for the pointless things include his book! I'd never want to spend ten minutes with this guy. Unfortunately, the book is often given to kids to read in their late teens, when they're already at the point of questioning everything. No wonder Turgenev's Bazarov has so much (second-rate) company. A truly malign book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you like cynicism, you'll like this book.

At first I thought it was good solely because there was a prostitute in it, but now I see how it tells the tale of a cynical teenager. I can really relate to Holden Caulfield, me being a cyincal teenager myself. But this is book is for people who are made angry by everyone that isn't cynical."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an incredible book, in the first place. Salinger seems to have a great deal of pain, and contradiction troughout the book. From the beggining he states that he doesn't like to talk about his &quot;lousy childhood&quot; and this contradiction is present in almost every line. He gives the impression that he is writing because he has to, because something bigger than himself imposed it. He writes in a slang, with a lousy vocabulary, which is - as a matter of fact - what really happens in a teenager's life. Sometimes you can feel the extreme anger when he writes, yet he cannot stand against the intolerable pression of his own mind, and he simply... writes. This is an american modern classic, and should be read twice: firstly when we are teenagers, secondly when we reach maturity. Anyway, this is an astonishing book, and whoever reads it will be amused, I guarantee."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this a few times: in 7th grade, in 9th grade. I don't understand reviewers who say they cannot relate to Holden 'cause he is a nutcase who is into whores and alcohol. I didn't drink or have sex before college and didn't want to, and I'm not crazy, but there is something in here I think most everyone can relate to: the ideas of not fitting in, of people being &quot;phonies&quot;, of wanting to feel safe... Don't get offended by sex and drink; appreciate the ideas here, people."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am an italian 18 year-old boy, who has just finished to read the book. I heard of some people who think that in Holden there is nothing of the teenagers of today; i don't agree!! I know that the most of &quot;us&quot; would never want to spent a night with a prostitute, or to get drunk as Holden does, and i agree it is a disgusting style of life, but at the same time i am pretty sure that almost everyone on the earth, teenagers and not, sometimes feels to be depressed, alone, scared by what is around us, weak....I liked this book because teaches how to solve certain problems and how to respect those people like Holden who seem bad people, but actually are really, really generous."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book twice. When I was 19 I read the book, and in all honesty I didn't like it. When I turned thirty, I read it again. Now I understand why I didn't like it. I was a spoiled kid who was too self-involved to understand Holden Caulfield. Yes Holden is self involved and self-important. He develops into exactly what he hates by the end of the novel. The truth of the matter is that I was too ignorant to understand the novel.To the point - this is a great novel. I hope every teenager who reads this in school has a teacher who properly explains the character. Without a true understanding of Holden, one cannot apply the book to one's life. And let's face it, if you can't apply the book to the real world, why read the book?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in the reading class of summer school. I'd like to mention that I'm a ESL student and my gramer isn't that good. First of all, although I had some part which I couldn't understand, I simply liked this book. I think I've been having similar feeling like Holden has. For instanse, I really like very young kids or old people. I couldn't get along with the kids around my age. I always had the feeling people don't need me, and seeking people who simply like me and don't hurt me. As I reading the book, &quot;the catcher in the rye&quot;, I remembered what happened to me last winter at my school. Just hate people and don't know what is going on around. Even though liked the people, or wanted to like people, but I couldn't do that. I think that &quot;winter&quot; makes people depress a lot, and I believe that Holden has the same feeling, or much bigger than mine. Holden, I think, wants to escape from everythin which bothers him and make him rereaved, but both tring to deal with the plobrems and escape form the plobrems aren't easy. That's why everything is hard to him and makes Holden so sad. I think that most people around my age have this strange feeling;have to be grown up, but afraide to being gruwn up and want to be child forever. Again, I think that I'm not compretery understanding this book, and I think when I get older I would understnd this book more and different way. That's why I didn't give parfect score for this book. When I could undersatnd what the book was telling to people, then, I would give the parfect score for this book. Lastly, I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In the novel The Catcher in the Rye the author J.D. Salinger writes of a teenage boy who has once again been kicked out of school and leaves a few days before the start of break. He leaves to New York city where he goes through many hardships and we find that he has had a nervous breakdown. I find this story to be boring and repetitive, and I find the amount of bad words disturbing though possibly correct for a boy of his age.Holden Caulfield is a sad, depressed young man but I never feel sorry or bad for him. He never seems to be very important to me and I do not care for the character, though there is much that I would wish to change about him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a book about a spoiled, whiny, rich kid whom we are apparently meant to believe is some kind of hero. He complains about everything, but doesn't do anything except give us the priveledge of letting us know his opinions (like I'm doing, now). \\"Phoney\\" is his word for nearly every human being who has ever lived, and everything they like to do. Among these are movies and live entertainment, which he claims to hate, but pays to see. This was first published in the early '50s, and the only black character I remember was someone our protaganist, Holden Caulfield (how I hate that name), hates because he dares to make a living at something for which people admire him.I guess teenagers in the '50s were really hard-up for anything that seemed risque for the time, while almost having something approaching characterization and a plot, for them to imagine this to be a great novel. I think this is the most overrated thing written by an American in the last century. J.D. Salinger is the real phoney.I gave it two stars because it's actually better than some of the things I have given one star (not saying much), and I only gave those things one star because Amazon wouldn't let me give less.And Holden doesn't get expelled from his prep school, he just leaves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the most controversial books in the XX Century, more than 50 years after being first published, J. D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" has assured its place in the literary cannon. Dealing with issues that were too hot for the 50s --like adolescents talking so openly about sex, and drinking and smoking-- the magnificent novel faced some negative critics by that time, but after the 60s it started to be regarded as it deserves to.One of facts that made \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" so popular is the fact that Salinger tap into the emotions on the readers in a way it had never been done before. And in the 60s --with the counterculture --, the book was seeing as the story of an individual's alienation within a heartless world. By that time, the novel's protagonist, the unforgettable Holden Caulfield, represented young people all over the world who were dissatisfied with the political and cultural moment.As the plot of the novel is widely known, nowadays it is much more interesting to review and comment it rather than simply summarize. To begin with, the main character, Holden, is a person who cannot connect with other people -- that's why he is always moving from one place to another. The only supporting character who has two different moments with him in the novel is his youngest sister Phoebe -- all the others appear and disappear only once, like his schoolmates, a girlfriend and a teacher.This absence of connections seems to run in the Caulfield family for a little while -- since the youngest son Allie died. This death, alongside with the suicide of one of Holden's schoolmates, has an important resonance in the protagonist's life and attitude towards the world and other people. It seems that he has always been let down by others (parents, friends, siblings...) and he (un)consciously decide to stop connecting with people.Moreover, he is very judgmental of everything and everybody. But this peculiarity makes of Holden a very human figure. Most adolescents behave in this way. He is always criticizing and philosophizing about people who are boring, insecure or phony (like he says all the time). Probably this kind of behavior disguises his own fears and insecurities. He is hardly close to any adult. The only one who tries to establish a tie with Holden is a former teacher, Mr Antolini (who, by the way, happens to be the most human adult in the novel, but it is normal, since Holden is narrating the story). However, using a lame excuse, the boy fails to establish any emotional tie even with this man. As a matter of fact, he cannot have an emotional tie with anyone even with his little sister, who he claims to be \\"little too affectionate sometimes\\", when she tries to embrace him.Therefore, Holden is the kind of person who usually victimized himself -- as he says to an old teacher, he feels on \\"the other side\\" of life. However, the more we learn about him, the more we know that this alienation is a way of protecting himself. The connection -- or even interaction -- with other people confuse and overwhelm him, and his cynical sense of superiority serves as a type of self-protection. But this alienation turns out to be the main cause of his pains. He needs love and contact, but he can't deal with them when he has them.Probably Holden's loneliness is the main motif in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" -- that in the end is a bildungsroman, a novel that shows the growing of a young man into an adult. His lack of structure to connect to others haunts him throughout the whole narrative. This problem results in his absence of having intimate relationships and even close friends. It is so clear to most readers, but Holden himself can't see it. It feels like when we are in the center of the problem we cannot see the solution.Reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is an unforgettable experience to any reader, be he/she and adolescent or an adult. Probably the best approach is to read this novel in many periods of one's life. The response will be different every time. But good old Holden will always be the same: impossible to be caught."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for my high school english class. I had moderate optomism about the book. The Catcher in the Rye is about the misadventures of a young teen named Holden, who just go kicked out of his forth private school. I automatically thought about a rebelellious teenager whih grabbed my attention. He goes from one location to another, from school to NYC, to a mental hospital where he tells this story. Many people respect and appreciate this book and the work of the skilled author, J.D. Salinger, but they also say that you either love the book or hate the book. As much as I can respect this book, I have to say I can't stand the story.Salinger does write the book in a style that I like. The scenes and descriptions described in the book are so vivid and realistic that I can easily picture everything in my head, detail to detail. The characters that Holden encounters have the same detail put into them as the settings and situations, from their looks, to attitude and demeanor, to even their bad habits.However, as good as the detail is in the books, the story itself is the root of any good novel. This is where this book's quality plummets badly and my optimistic attitude therefore plummited dramitcally. First off, this novel is lacking a large element that puts a good book together: plot. I read the book, beginning to end, and there is none. There is not a single thing that would show that the story has a plot or a task at hand. Most would say that the task for Holden is to get home after being kicked out of school, but a large chunk of this book is all side treks, diverting away from the main situation at hand, resulting in a novel about nothing. This really makes the book very boring and pointless. I then found myself wanting to put the book down quite often after only reading a few pages.The second element to a good book is a good protagonist, or main character. The main character in this book, Holden, is a kind of protagonist that many just don't like. He is your stereotypical rich snob, coming from a wealthy family who can afford to send him from one school to another. He also has a snotty, pessimistic attitude about life, other people, and himself. To all the people around him, they're all &quot;phony&quot; and he's better than them, but when he thinks about himself, he degrades himself also. I was able to relate holden tomany people in my school which once again showed the detail of this book. I beleive this is very hypocritical, but he admits that in the book. He also gets very depressed easily, so you don't really see a happy side to this person, or any side that would say he's motivated to do something, or anything for that matter. He just brags about his sister, drinks, treats women poorly, and spends a ton of money, all while under heavy depression. Holden is the kind of person you either feel sorry for, or just want to smack in the face. Both feelings are not feelings a reader should have about the protagonist.The overall mood of this book is the final element that makes me want to put the book down after a few pages. Holden's attitude gets him into lots of trouble and lots of bad situations. From one encounter to another, it all ends in sadness and depression. Imagine having to read one depressing story to another, in perfect detail. The only good thing I can say about the mood is that the author writes it very well. However, when I read this book, I always had to stop myself from getting myself depressed after reading all of Holden's misadventures.To summarize, imagine sitting in front of a rich pessimist and hearing him ramble on and on and on about everything. There would be no point, no happiness, and no end. Imagine having to hear the rambler for a grade. Can't stand it? Neither could I. Sorry Mr. Salinger, but please put your writing skill to better use. As much as I respect the quality work of this author, I couldn't stand reading this book...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"That's about it .... I read this when I was a teenager and I read it again later on, trying to figure out what exactly was supposed to be so great. Both times I was amazingly bored. With the character, with the whole plot or lack thereof, whatever. It's well written, it's a perfect portrait, but I just didn't care... sort of like the Basketball Diaries. Again, didn't really care, and that had lots of drugs in it to make it interesting.Everyone I know had a more interesting real life than these people. Maybe it's just the way it's described; if someone were really telling this story I'd be interested, but it's just so blandly written. It's like he took some great event and turned it into porridge.I just don't relate ... I must be some sort of freak. Three stars because I'm afraid someone would come beat me up if I gave it less, and after all I've read worse written books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'll be quick to say that The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book. It brought new meaning to 'required reading' and sparked debates like few I had ever witnessed before in a classroom.However, a lot of people don't appreciate the writing style of J.D. Salinger. Brilliance is not always appreciated or recognized, and of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Many people became irritated at the redundant language, excessive affirmations (&quot;It really was, if you want to know the truth&quot;), intense and long digressions, and overall hypocrisy of the character we know as Holden Caulfield. The way I see it is that Salinger knew exactly what he was doing. He did not digress for pages at a time simply because HIS mind was wandering. It was Holden's mind that was straying and the structure of the book mirrors the content perfectly. Salinger made conscious decisions in this work regarding language and organization, but these only serve to enhance Holden's character. Eventually, this DOES get annoying... but for many of us, not to the point where we want to put the book down. It exposes us to Holden, having a feeling for him (probably frustration) that we can relate to human beings.Regardless of negative criticism, The Catcher in the Rye will continue to be one of the most popular American books regarding adolescence. Any character that exposes our own fears, our own insecurities, and shares our observations can win us over easily... and Holden Caulfield is no exception.The bottom line is, the book is incredible... but it's just too much for some people. I guess the only way for you to know... is to just read it yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"... Simply put. Read it at least once a decade, if not once a year. All first-person narratives pale in comparison to Salinger's cynical watershed. The only bad thing about this book is that it doesn't make you feel any better about your own place in this world; that is, if you happen to be one of the many who see lies and corruption everywhere they turn. It will, though, give you peace in the knowledge that you are not alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher and the RyeThe book The Catcher and the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a very interesting novel. In his unique writing style, Salinger jumps from subject to subject to subject before returning to the original topic at hand. This book basically portrays a chunk of a young man's life as he gets kicked out of a private high school called Pencey. He slowly leaves campus for home without trying to be too depressed. Holden Caulfield, as the character is named, is set in his way of thinking and its very abstract at that. The book takes you on these small adventures and you can tell that they are exaggerated. He thinks about things too much, and his mind is especially stuck on women. He doesn't like his parents much but has three siblings that he gets along with. He's always reminiscing things he's done or people he used to know, again particularly the females. He doesn't consider himself smart but he sure talks like he does. I know he's not preaching, he's just talking to people who care to listen. I liked the book to start, but it got old pretty fast."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":".:My \\"2-Chunk\\" View:.The classic novel \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" by J.D. Salinger, demonstrates the eremitic, yet everyday-life of a teenager named Holden Caufield by exhibiting the agony he experiences constantly but eventually displaying there is more to him than one perceives. Holden gets kicked out of Pencey Highschool--one of the many schools he's been kicked out of already- and on his way to his dorm, he decides to visit one of his acquaintances when \\"all of a sudden,\\" he says, \\"I changed my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do, I'd get the hell out of Pencey-right that same night and all... I just didn't want to hang around any more. It made me too sad and lonesome\\" (p. 51). Depressed of his life, he depreciates the many failures and downfalls that he has been reproved of and refuses to atone for his heedlessness and imprudence. Holden neglectfully ignores better opportunities in addition to neglecting his problems and usual life-obstacles by manifesting his hate of the world and his aimless futile of his life. Negligent of insolence, his ten-year-old sister, Pheobe, even persists he doesn't \\"like anything that's happening\\" which \\"made [Holden] even more depressed when she said that\\" (p. 169). Pheobe finds the right words to portray Holden's personality and most likely the main reason why Holden is insecure and unhappy--because there's nothing he takes the time to enjoy. Holden, however, listens to Pheobe and although he doubts her, he cares about what she says thus portraying the affectionate side of him and conveying his character as a means of possible hope within himself. Although incredulous, despite the many hardships Holden encounters, the author is trying to depict the misery of a teenager that he or she goes through is something that many misunderstand and that there's always something deeper then many descry it as.---.:My Opinion:.I was astonished at Holden's attitude and use of words, but of course characteristics such as these are necessary to portray the type of character and set the mood. Constantly, however, Holden always seemed to get side tracked telling a story then suddenly jumping to something completely irrelevant. Most likely, most novels start out slow-however! I found this book slow until the very end. I can see why this book is considered a classic because its value to society it confers, yet I never found any excitement in reading it.This book in my opinion isn't exactly a story, but more of a reality check. Honestly, when I finished reading the book, all I could say is, \\"Okaaay?\\" I was definitely going to rate this book a \\"1\\" until I read other reviews and realized how unperceptive I was being. I contemplated about what the message was and what kind of character Holden represents in society today. I considered pensively about the irrelevant details and the simple, constant use of certain words, and finally came to a conclusion that everytime he talked to someone they wouldn't listen to him. Then I realized that was exactly what I was doing-I didn't want to hear his \\"boring\\" stories that had nothing to do with anything! The whole time I was thinking, \\"What is he so depressed about?!\\" but I realized in the end that that's why Pheobe made him so happy-- she listened to him.So I changed my view about things and ruminated that Salinger's message of a teenager's deeper feelings is exactly what this book is. The novel, \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" is a teenager of books with deeper meaning, just like Holden.Strange, huh? How we judge something or someONE before we actually stop and take a deeper look?\\"Everyone sees who you seem to be, few understand who you really are.\\" --Machiavelli"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"'The Catcher in The Rye' is an especially good book.... one of the best I ever read.In this fabulous book by J D Salinger, there is this hell of a crazy guy called Holden Caulfield. He is kicked out of his school because he had failed in every subject except English. He has two older brothers... one of them died and the other is working in Hollywood. He's also got a younger sister who's his favourite.As I said before Holden Caulfield is a 'close to crazy' guy. He is the narrator of the story. Mr. Salinger uses slangs and very informal writing to describe vividly what is going on and what are Holden's feelings.What happens is that after Holden is kicked out of school, he goes to live in a hotel, and then goes to his teacher's house... but does not like either of them. In parts of the story he talks about his love life... how he gone out and made time with his girlfriends and all.After all that stuff, Holden goes to his own home and talks to his favourite little sister Phoebe about his situation secretly... because he didn't want his parents to know that he's been kicked out. He decides to go away somewhere far away from his living place because he hates his present home. But Phoebe wants to go too... and for her sake Holden stays and that's the end of the book.It is named 'The Catcher in The Rye' because of a very small reason inside the book. Once when Phoebe asks Holden what he wants to be when he grows up, this crazy guy answers that he wants to be at the edge of a cliff where all little girls are playing and he just wants to catch whoever is in the verge of falling off. He names this dumb occupation as the 'catcher in the rye'.In all, this is a fabulous creation by J D Salinger. There is very good humour and descriptiveness, and it didn't take me long to list 'The Cathcer in The Rye' as one of my favourite books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE LAST TIME I READ THIS BOOK WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND BACK THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT, 13 YEARS LATER, IT IS STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I EVER READ."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;THE CATCHER IN THE RYE&quot; is basically about a kid name Holden Caulfield who is in high school and is having a hard time passing his classes. Holden is a kind of person who can't concentrate on is priorities and he is confused of what he wants to do in his life. I believe that the main reason he feels this way is because he is not over his brother's death. Holden really loved his brother Allie who died. When Allie died Holden got so depressed and angry that he broke all the windows in the house with his fist. Ever since his brother's death he hasn't been the same. He dropped out of four high schools and he also got in small fights with people who were once his friend. Holden had a hard time growing up and one of the reasons for that is because he is very picky, in the book he talks about how much he hates phony people. Basically Holden has suffered a mental disorder when his brother died. I felt that this was kind of a sad book because Holden seems to be very depressed through out the book. If you like reading books that are serious and kind of emotional then I would recommend you to &quot;THE CATCHER IN THE RYE.&quot; On a scale of 1 to 10 for 10 being the greatest I would give it a six because overall I thought that it was an ok book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book three times in the last five months. I can't get enough of it. If there's anyone in the world I can relate to it's the protaganist, Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand how some can give this book so little credit. Since I was young I knew that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was considered an excellent piece of literature, but I didn't know much else about it. For most of my life I thought it was a book on fishing in the country. I read the book for the first time several weeks ago. I chose it for an independent work in my Advanced Placement English class (Yes, high school, teenager, the point of view is different, I understand.). I was hooked (pun, I know) by the first line. Salinger perfectly captures the psyche and manner of not just a teenager, but a human person. To me, the plot was more than fulfilling. Like another reviewer, I also wondered if some crisis was about to enter Holden's path.However, I was greatly relieved that there was not. This allowed for a great study of the mentality of the character in ordinary life. Such a development would have made the story as phony as the Hollywood spew-outs that the book decries.(By the way, to this particular reviewer, &quot;grab a gun and start shooting the phonies&quot;? I'd suggest a good therapist.) This is what I consider writing not worthy of my time. The plot was intensely believable, and brightened by the fact that Salinger describes personalities that we know exist in perfect detail. The reader can indentify with Holden's observations because everyone shares that cynicism on some level. The reader can digest that cynism and use it to create a more accepting view of life. The ending is blessedly simple and provokes a good amount of thought on relationships in life. Holden's conclusion on life is one we can understand, but not one with which we have to agree."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as an assingment for school but considering what I had previously heard about this book I was somewhat disapointed.

Did i get over it(23 just graduated.computer engineer) ofcorse i Did all of us do.Did i learn anything from that awful unforgetable period? just like Holden in the end I dont know what to think and thats what i liked most about the book the idea that in those 2 days our hero may have experienced a nervous breakdown depressing alienating thoughts ending up in an asilum eventualy maybe getting back to school and sadly becoming a phony just like the rest of us but also just like Holden missing all his friends and the events of these 2 days I 2 miss that period in my life where I wanted to be different to have a real image of mself not a phony one.I like this book because Through Holden and even for a short while i could again experience that period and maybe this time get to learn more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i loved this book. even though i could not relate with everything that holden was going through, i could understand a lot of his problems. his actions prove that teenagers have a lot harder lives than most adults want to admit to. holden is the poster child of evrthing that is screwed up with this world and shows that we seriously need to fix it. even though it was written a long time ago, it easily transposes it self to the modern time. everyone should have to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this when I was twelve years old, because I heard it was pretty good, and you have no idea the affect it had on me.

I can relate to Holden Caufield even as a 20 year old architecture student more than 20 times a day.

As it turned out, I could hardly finish this book due to Holden's incessant whining, &quot;Oh, I thought maybe I'd do this, but then I was bored so I didn't&quot;... Poor Me, Poor Me, oh yeah, it's so tough to be a rich kid with every opportunity that life has to offer laying at his feet.

Subjects of his kind are few and far between and worshipers of his ethos contradict themselves with un-Holden-like gestures of 'coolness' and materialism. No wonder Salinger 'pukes', as he might put it, at his cult following, ALMOST the antithesis of what he was trying to promote.(PR)I met a girl outside a nightclub with an American accent. &quot;Have you read 'The Catcher in the Rye'?, I asked. &quot;Yes!!!!&quot;, she replied, &quot;I spent a time being in love with Holden Caulfield!&quot;. I was pleased, but then she tried to shake my hand in a stylised 'cool' manner. I tried to respond but failed...oh...but she turned on me; &quot;Hey, get with it, man!&quot;, and walked off, not annoyed, but none too impressed...the point is 'The Catcher in the Rye' is a comment on society. It is densely planned but sounds like the simply written diary of a complicated, compassionate, emotional person. It is hilarious and tragic, the author engaging one in a seemingly non-technical rollercoaster of truth, of the way life should be and the way people could be. There is no effect of Salinger distancing the reader with any form of over-stylised excess. Holden is talking TO you, not at you. He becomes the reader's friend.(PR) This is no adolescent book: it is universal and for anybody who has sense and compassion enough to understand: the adolescent eyes of Holden Caulfield are used simply as a means of making the point: he hasn't enter the world so his plight becomes more powerful. He doesn't want to because he is more mature...ironically.(PR) The Vespers of wit clothe the more sombre truth in a short, to-the-point novel, written by a perfectionist with no frills, about a man who so longs for an escape route from imperfection.

It was slow, had a terrible plot (or lack thereof), and bored the hell out of me.Holden Caulfield does NOT embody anything (like despair, cynicism, and realism as many people say), except for annoyance, and perhaps whininess. Seriously. Not only am I not sympathetic (or empathetic) with him, but I feel the urge to reach into the pages and slap the stuffing out of him.I think perhaps the worst part about the book is that its not even like Holden DOES anything. Hell, things dont even really happen TO him, either. He just drifts around, which would be fine if interesting things happened to him... but they dont. ..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having been an Honors English student in high school, lo, those many years ago, this was on our recommended reading list. I didn't like Holden Caulfield then. Now, the father of a daughter approaching her teenage years, I like him even less.I reread the book recently, and the question is the same now as was it twenty five years ago: \\"This is classic literature?\\"While relatively well written, this story has been done to death since time immemorial. And, frankly, promulgates the self absorbed teenage stereotype.Holden Caulfield is NOT a stereotypical teenager.Holden Caulfield IS a hypocrite. He IS a narcissist. He IS paranoid. He IS a cynic without the true experience in life to jade him. In short, he is a poseur desparately seeking some self importance to which he is far from entitled.Although certainly alienated, and just as certainly an intelligent underachiever, he is, at root, a spoiled brat in dire need of having his backside tanned.While there may be some merit to the idea that there are no bad children, only bad parents, young Master Caulfield bears the greatest responsibility for his situation. His willfully shallow character prevents him from seeing anyone or anything outside himself.No, this is not \\"classic literature\\". It is not even an accurate portrayal of teenage angst and alienation. It is the story of a puling spoiled rich kid who doesn't get life his way.Well, welcome to the world, Young Man, because that's just the way things are."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read many of the reviews on Amazon about this book and what strikes me is the limitless array of opinions, feelings and assertions about it. I first read it, like just about everyone else, as a teenager. While I didn't identify with Caulfield, I did find in myself qualities about him, Stradlater and Ackley. For those that view Salinger as out of date, you have to cut him some slack as he was writing about teen angst in the early-post WWII era when generational detachment common. His settings are wonderful and conjure up a NYC not quite in touch with itself, just as Caulfield found. Yet his internal conflict of identifying phonies (including himself) and loathing them leads to his own self-hating and near ruin. Yet, seldom have I ever read more touching passages between an older brother and a younger sibling (sister Phoebe) or a recollection of a lost sibling (brother Allie).I've read this book over my life at ages approximate 16, 27, 40, 52 and just finished it again at 60. Each time I have taken away a different impression but always do I hope that Holden eventually found himself and is living somewhere happily in California, London, NYC, Timbuktoo or even Cornish, NH."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wrote an essay on J.D. Salinger my senior year of high school. The more I researched him, the less I liked him.Is his writing very good? Not really. One of his college professors named him the worst writer in the history of the school. It's a very repetitive style. I give him credit for at least having a unique style - that plain, to-the-point narrative - but in my opinion, his short stories are FAR better than \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"\\"Catcher\\" is rather simplistic, and like \\"American Psycho,\\" its point can be gathered within five pages. I prefer \\"Psycho\\" simply because I find Ellis' similarly repetitive narrative more humorous and unpredictable - I liked the character Patrick Bateman even though I simultaneously despised him. I didn't like Holden at all. There has to be some kind of connection, and there isn't.Salinger had a yearning for his own childhood. He experienced a lot of terror once he reached adulthood (including losing friends in WWII) and he idolizes childhood as a state of naivety and innocence (as seen in stories such as \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\"). Unfortunately \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - his ode to his own childhood and the destruction of innocence - is a masturbatory effort that gathered a reputation for being controversial, and like many novels (yes, also \\"American Psycho\\") elitist critics jumped on the bandwagon and began hailing it as an underappreciated American classic. Now it IS appreciated, and in my opinion, far too much - the praise outweighs the worth of the novel.The narrative is the most disappointing aspect. \\"Crummy\\" this, \\"g**amn\\" that, etc. And I hate to say it, but Holden is a sixteen-year-old and his knowledge of grammar doesn't extend past that of an average eleven or twelve-year-old.In some ways, I can understand the praise for this novel - it does have a valid point - but I think it goes on too long and the narrative isn't very effective, and in that regard I think it fails as literature and the elitist critics who praised it back in the early 1950s helped solidify a reputation for the book that, in all actuality, it probably doesn't really deserve."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those books you read because you almost feel like your missing something if you don't. Its one of those books that will be remembered throughout history as a classic. A book about a boy who is trying to find himself; something most can probably relate too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I gleaned an effortless though not cursory entertainment from this read. The book is deceptively simple due to the believably juvenile narration of the protagonist, 16-year-old Holden Caulfield. I immensely enjoyed the flavor of some of the retired teenage lingo of days gone by and felt as though the book was in fact an entertaining--if not long-winded--story told aloud around a campfire by the teen himself.There are several predominant themes integrated into the teen's ranting and wanderings which give depth to what some might perceive to be a shallow and boring tale about an angst-filled teen and his mundane existence at a college prep school in the mid-twentieth century. The most interesting of these to me, and what seemed to me to make his character convincing, is the somewhat hypocritical yet passionate stance Holden takes against what he calls \\"phonies\\" throughout the story. The duplicity he observes in the people around him irritates him and arouses in him a kind of self-righteous distain, even though the faults he condemns are blaringly evident in his own life. I can relate to this speck-in-your-brother's-eye kind of vision of the world. More than anything though, it seems that Holden in justified in his cynicism because he recognizes his faults and condemns others more for their self-deception than for their phoniness.Holden also has a sensitivity to the true meanings of over-used words and phrases, which I find appealing. He condemns the use of the word \\"grand\\" as excessive, and the wishing of \\"good luck\\" ill-fated. He is a lover of the truth--even in his own delusion--and words to him should say what they mean. I agree, and his insight made me empathize with his struggle and love him as a character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i dont think the people below me know good lit from a hole in the ground. this story continues to transcend from the generation it was written in, all the way to the present. i have read this book for the second time in my life. as i was reading, i saw the development of holden and truly enjoyed his voice through the pages and in my head. people of all ages should have no major problem relating to holden in any way. at some time in our lives, we face something in our life, that makes us take into consideration that the people we know and the places we live may not be exactly where we want to be. holden came to this decision at his early age and through his rebellion from school and the relationships he has in his life. we can see the place where he exists now and many can relate to that. holden's voice is the universal voice, at least for myself, that keeps telling me never to just settle for what exists in my life and to actually go out and get what i want. in every book, someone is going to pull something different from the story, just open your mind and enjoy it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Growing up in our society is onerous and can be very difficult. J.D. Salinger's Catcher and the Rye seizes the essence of adolescence. Lost, angry, and directionless Holden Caulfield is the epitome of an average teen. His attempt to navigate the world of the \\"phony\\" adult wears his soul and he comes to question the point of repetitious survival. Any teen that has come to find themselves stranded in a world of hypocrisy will relate and love this kid. His strength, although jaded, will inspire hope in any reader and instill an absolute conviction that there is an intact, innocent beauty in this world.\\"What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.\\" (Holden Caulfied in the Catcher in the Rye)Jerome David Salinger accomplished this feat with the publication of the Catcher and the Rye in 1951. This book is ostensibly an autobiography of the author who was born into a wealthy Jewish family in 1919 and grew up in elite Manhattan, New York, witnessed perplexing contradictions of adults and peers, and had a difficult time finding where he fit into society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hadn't read Catcher since high school until I read it again the summer before teaching it to my 9th grade honors English class. I remember loving it as a kid, but as an adult, it blew me away. As a kid, I picked up the humor, but I don't think I picked up the poignancy -- I found myself crying in many scenes: at the museum with Phoebe, when Holden dances with Phoebe while hiding in his parents' apartment, when he finds out his teacher is a pervert -- what seemed funny then is emotionally gut renching now. Suddenly it seems more obvious why Holden is depressed and how he perceives his world. He refuses to see the world through rose colored glasses; rather, he sees right down to every last fault and phony utterance. I can't believe how much better this book got over the years. If you have never read it or haven't read it recently, you owe it to yourself. I love books about schools, and this is probably the best (A Separate Peace is quite good too). For those who love New York, there is a lot of local flavor here too. If you want to know what it feels like to feel alienated as a teenager, this book is a must. Not that it's all depressing: you'll laugh out loud at some of the early scenes dealing with his roommates at prep school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J. D. Salinger's, \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" is a classic novel of an adolescent who discovers the truth of human nature when he leaves school early. The themes and observations expressed in this story are classic, for all generations. The characters are realistic, and well defined. They are also easy to identify with, especially the lead character Holden Caulfield. Holden tells us the story of what happened to him during the days after he left school, which he would soon be kicked out of, and went out into New York City on his own. During the time Holden is in school, and when he is out on the street, he meets many people. Holden is able to give a character depth and recognizable characteristics simply by telling a one story about the person. For example, the story of a boy he barely knew named James Castle. James refused to take back a comment he made about somebody; he was then ruthlessly beaten by the kid and his friends. When he could no longer take the abuse he gathered up the strength to run and jump out the window, killing himself instantly. James is only talked about this one time in the novel and doesn't contribute anything crucial to the plot. He does, however, show us different emotions of Holden (such as caring for others) as well as telling us about another interesting character who some may be able to identify with. There are so many characters Holden meets, even the small ones add to the story and leave an impression on the reader. Through Holden's short journey of self-discovery, he evolves as a character and goes through many emotional changes, ranging from depression to overwhelming joy. He starts as a depressed adolescent who's angry at the world and its \\"phonies.\\" After meeting so many of these adult phonies, who he despises, and realizes that his dream is to protect the children, like his beloved sister, from becoming phonies. By the end of his journey, he realizes this dream is unrealistic, and that you must let children live and enjoy their innocence and freedom. This shows how people can change and how you have to take time to realize the truths of life. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is told through the viewpoint of Holden Caulfield, a young teenager. When he describes the way people look, or an outdoor landscape, the descriptive language is limited to a teenager's vocabulary. Although he can observe people accurately, his description of his surroundings could be more detailed. If he did do this, the book may have not been as realistic. Though the story is great without the description of physical characteristics, I think they would have made the reader feel more connected to Holden by seeing the surroundings through his eyes. Today, \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" is hailed as a classic for all time. This however, was not always so. When the book first came out in 1951, parents were afraid that their kids would leave school, and that the adult language would corrupt their young minds. This is highly ironic in that this is exactly what Holden wanted to protect from happening, and many people felt he was causing the corruption of children. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" has connected, at some level, with almost all of its readers. It is a timeless story of self-discovery and realization. The characters are memorable and captivating. This is one of the great American novels."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am sure there are millions of Caulfields out there in the world.

One of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not much of a reader, but this is probably the best book I've ever read!

Well anyways, the thing that sticks with me from &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is how Caulfield strives not to be a phony."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"( )Okay, I am now stating that I am not any kind of English buff or literary critic of any kind. I am a high school student and read The Catcher for an English assignment. I have to say that I really enjoyed the novel. I actually read the book &quot;cover to cover&quot;. I bore through Arms of the Man and Scarlet Letter. Note: ( ), I really enjoyed The Great Gatsby (There are some brownie points).The Catcher provided a style that was realistic and complex. Many find this difficult that Holden comments on several situations at the same moment, but when you think about it, that is exactly the way that humans function. Come on, you can not tell me that when you were talking to someone and never find yourself thinking about that time when... ANYWAY, The style and the graphic dialogue create a dislike for the Catcher. When people found out that I chose the Catcher, they would say all this stuff about the language and how bad it was and how they could only get through the first page. After talking to all these people I could have sworn I had the edited version. The abrupt language provided a break from the classic style and made the novel realistic. Have you ever seen Good Will Hunting? Any they are complaining about the Catcher?I will say that on the way through the novel that I skipped over the symbolism/ extended metaphors and did not find any, but going back over the symbolism is very coherent. So you can find them, look for the comparison of ducks on the frozen pond to Holden's personality frozen to the world and the Catcher in the Rye saving the child from the cliff of adulthood. (Just a little help. These are not found in Cliff Notes.)I love Holden's character. Holden is a gentleman at heart and does not present himself as anything he is not. He provides an interlude from the society of &quot;phonies&quot;. To Holden, phonies are everywhere. A phony is anyone who presents a different personality according to the audience whom they are presented with. Being a phony is typically an adult trait. Please do not get bitter on me, but let me explain. It is typically an adult trait, because the child idealism does not include the need to impress people. Holden engulfs himself in the ideal of innocence mostly found in children especially Holden's younger siblings and Jane whom he places on an angelic pedestal. Holden explains that such innocence can be discovered in adults through his example of the drummer. Holden admires the drummer, because the drummer's job consists of a few miniscule notes and the drummer never bores and plays every performance with pride. Holden finds honor in the drummer.Holden provides an extraordinary character and a change in pace from the American literature found on the English department bookshelf. I fell in love with Holden and by the end I felt like I really knew him. By the end, I felt sorry for him and all I wanted to do was to give Holden the gift of a really good friend and a fake ID. If you enjoy more psychological kind of novels and preferably on the younger side, because of the subject matter (and plus if our parents knew how we think then what would we do then?) then The Catcher in the Rye is a good bet. If you like the action packed thrills then save your money. ( )Nuff said."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book when I was fairly young, during my pre-teens. I really didn't get it, but now, I understand. I could now understand how he feels and the J.D. Salinger did such an outstanding job and impressed me so much, this is the only book I really consider a teen classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story of a wild youth who gets thrown out of boarding school and goes to New York City is one of America's most popular storys. I have a hard time reviewing novels which mean this much to me, but I will try my best. Instead of focusing on the plot like everyone else i will try to place this novel in a broader context.The name Holden Caufield has entered America's collective lexion, representing &quot;rebellious youth.&quot; Despite the fact that this novel was released in the 1950s, it is still a top seller today, appearing near the bottom of the top 50 charts from time to time, usually in the summers when the students buy their books. When Kevin Smith named Ben affleck's character in Chasing Amy &quot;Holden,&quot; everyone in the country knew exactly when he had in mind. This novel is so important that it is truly a shame that Salinger does not continue to publish. Perhaps someday we will be able to get a peak at the notebooks he fills with words daily at his house in rural New England. But we might not.CATCHER IN THE RYE is one of the great American novels of the 20th century. It deserves to be mentioned alongside INVISIBLE MAN and THE GREAT GATSBY and THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Catcher in the Rye is the only novel I have been assigned in grammar school, high school, and college. I have taken something new from it every time. What else can you ask for? Its insight into human nature, plain and simple."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An absolutely wonderful work of art. I cannot express how great this book is. Never have we been so close to deciphering the complexities that encompass puberty. 5 STARS A+"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in 8th grade. I was still slightly ignorant in the &quot;ways of the world&quot; you might say and, while I understood what Holden was saying, I didn't want to believe it. I read it again in 10th grade and then again this year, my senior year. This year is the year I finally clicked with the book. It's sad that some reviewers disliked this book because it &quot;had no plot.&quot; It's not about what Holden is doing, it's about Holden's reactions to the world around him. After reading some of these brilliant reviews I feel like reading the book again.If anyone feels like intelligently discussing the book feel free to e-mail me at cgmjthom@ismi.net."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is the knight of reality fighting with the corrupt world of phoniness. He is not the hero of a book that is published to make profit. Holden Caulfield is the manifestation of anger to people who perceive human relations as acting.They only act and the worst thing these dandies do ,they alienate the others who cannot act phonily. Reading this book will uncover the masks of phonies. Please read to save yourself from being phony."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having long since left behind the self-obsessed years of my youth, I was horrified to recognise the depressing narrow-mindedness of my teenagedom. I cringe to recall my own narcissistic concerns at that age. Thank goodness that maturity brings a certain degree of peace with one's lot. A beautiful novel, out-dated, but still quirky and trendily 'retro'. Throughout, Holden reminded me of the dysfunctional Perry in Capote's In Cold Blood, and I was always expecting him to sink to Perry's grisly level of rebellion against an apparently alien and unaccepting world. Read it- you might as well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"can someone tell me if it is true that a lot of serial killers have read this book and it became their favouite? my friend told me this and i was curious if it was true or not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD's book connects with people who knew how it was to be young. It shows just how the way of life in any generation don't really change. They take on different forms, modified to suit the current time and space, but basically they're pretty much the same. This book has influenced me in the way I view life in general. It was fun and moving. I wish every teenager gets to read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this novel from the very beginning. Salinger's narrative is engaging and warm and makes one feel intimately familiar with Holden Caulfield on page one. This is a 'can't-put-down' book. I mourned its ending and was compelled to read it all over again. Salinger is a masterful writer and has created one of the most endearing and human characters in American fiction."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm 42 male, I was supposed to read this in high school but didn't. A friend who constantly lies, 30yo, he lies about everything to everybody, grand stories, &quot;he could be the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life&quot;, told me to read this book. I love the earthy american writing. I understand my friend better, but goddam, I feel sorry for him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is not like most classics, it is spoken in words that most teenagers are all too familar with. Personally, I feel this book swears a little too often, but in a way the voice of Holden Caulfield really makes the characters come alive. If you don't understand what this means, just look at how he describes his kid sister Phoebe. You can really imagine what is going on and that is one of the best parts of this unusal, but intriguing book. While I prefer classics like To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, this is one book I shall not soon forget!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"WOW!!!!!!!. So many reviews about this book. That must tell you something. This book is my favorite book i have ever read. I can still remember in my high school english class reading it. I believe many people in there adolecents feel connected to this book like i did when i first read it. Like when Holden said he was sickened by the people that go to the theatre, not because they like it, but because they have nothing else to do. To truely appreciate this book you need that understanding. I highly suggest you buy this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger put into words what it is like to be a teenager, in any age or era. He has the intolerances, the hang-ups, and the general points of view of a typical adolescent male nailed exactly on the head. Never, in all my readings, have I encountered a book that I relate so closely with as I do this book. Although the language is coarse, I would reccomend this book to any young person mature enough to understand the meanings behind Salinger's words."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Still CURRENT! After you read this you'll wonder what in the life of a teenager has really changed from the 50's to the 90's.It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant &quot;I know everything&quot; attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and &quot;don't give a damn&quot; attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic.Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, &quot;what the hell is this kid thinking?&quot; Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers!Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, 'Alien Rapture', which has a real page turning plot. I highly endorse buying this book. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D Salinger is just about the best book I have ever read. From the very begginning of the book until the very last words, I could connect with this mysterious character Salinger created. Although Holden was quite hard to figure out, he stil had a very strong sense of humor. With a smart-alec tone to his thoughts you gradually find out his past and his present. In the entire book you embark on a journey to uncover Holden's true self. In Holden's mind you go through the same typical midlife crisis a teen would. This was a very good book and deserves a spot on the bookshelf next to the Harry Potter series. I advise anyone of any age to read this book and think whats beyond the words. People have interpreted this in so many ways and theres no entirely correct way. Great Job, Salinger.Tweedyyy :))"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An insightful high school English teacher introduced me to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" It was a book report assignment not only to capsulize the story but also to address my personal experience reading it. At that time - as I recall - I found Catcher daring and quite revolutionary in Holden's exploits and language. Rebellion in those days was often repressed and silent. Holden broke that mold and for the first time I met a literary character with whom I could empathize. He represented freedom to express and the guts to criticize.Now, fifty years later - motivated by Sallinger's death - I reread \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" A very different experience, indeed! By today's standards and my own personal evolution, Holden emerges as a complaining, negative and whining fellow. You want to take him by the shoulders and shake before dragging him to the nearest mirror for a hard look. Still, the book is a classic - a product of its time - and offers new perspectives in the revisit. It works on many levels and is a must read for youngsters of today who are bound to appreciate the differences, and for seniors who take pleasure in recalling the rather stilted days of their youth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remember reading \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" in a high school literature class. I was always awed by the story of Holden Caufield...literature's most famous juvenile delinquent. And reading it is the only way you can appreciate the late JD Salinger's work, since he NEVER will allow his books to be made into movies...even posthumously."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that because this was required reading for me in High School when I read it I didn't really absorb it because I felt forced to read something I wasn't really interested in. Maybe because at that point in my life I was into bucking authority so some extent and, ironically much like the main character Holden Caulfield didn't much like school. Now much later in life I decided to read it again to see why this book is still so popular nearly 60 years after it's release.Salinger was in his late twenties and early thirties when he wrote this book however it's written like a teenager at the time might talk in terms of phrases, sentence structure, though processes etc,. and it's very well written in that respect. It captures the angst and anger of youth, being somewhere between a boy and a man, wanting to be an adult but still having to rely on adults to a certain extent who are making decisions for you that you don't necessarily agree with. This is the life of the books main character Holden Caulfield. Having re read the book I get it now. The story and emotions seemed familiar probably because I could reconcile it to my teenage years. I found Holden Caulfield to be fairly unlikable at times, he thought everything and almost everyone was dumb and then I wondered to myself was that peoples perception of me at times in my youth? At times inn my youth I was like Holden Caulfield in some ways. The last chapter of the book is Holden Caulfield reflecting on his youth . It really brought the book full circle and gives the reader a sense of Holden Caulfield the man being reflective on his youth.The writing style in interesting because it's written like someone is sitting with you telling a story keeping you involved in the conversation by using phrases like \\"I told you about that earlier\\" It's writing in a one way conversational style.Some of the phrases used in the book are a little Leave it to Beaverish by today's standards. To off set that the God D... words appear a lot in the book really to the point of over use I think. All in all a very good book, I'm glad I took the time to re read it. Perhaps now I have a little better understanding of my youth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I reread this book every so often,I seem to get some thing new from it every time I read it,I had to buy a new copy as I wore the old one out,I think I know what will be found in the authors safe now that he is gone,I think they will find the original copy of the book with a note on it that says \\"THATS ALL FOLKS\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book was received brand new, excellent condition & very fast delivery.

No problems. I would definitely buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can I write about this book that hasn't been written before? Nothing I guess.I will only say this book is a classic of English Literature, and as such it should be read during the formative years of every individual, namely in school.Holden Caulfield will live forever in the history of American rebels.If you have never read this book I recommend you do so as soon as you can, You will never forget it, this story will stay with you throughout your life, it has for me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For what I paid, the product was satisfactory and in excellent condition.

Thanks so much! RIP JD."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was browsing around amazon for some of the top most rated books and this book was among them so I decided to give it a read. Towards the beginning the book seemed pointless but I carried on anyway, hoping that soon it would turn interesting but that never truly happened. I am a teenager and I didn't really enjoy this book. Maybe I am too young to understand the \\"retaining child-like innocence\\" message in this book. I wasn't very fond of the slangy language either."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am not the smartest person, but I have to say that Catcher in the Rye is totally overated. The whole thing is about a teenager who is a total loser who can't have any type of relationship because he is too selfish. He is kicked out of boarding schools. He can't go home. He can't do anything right simply because that would be an admission to following a basic social rule. Total crap, don't waste your time, unless you like being mad at a fictional character.I was mad at myself for reading this book, but after the realization of taking the bad with the good, it was sort of a consolation. I still recomend skiping this one though."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Did I miss something here? What in the world was this book about? How can anyone say it even has a plot, let alone is worthy of being considered a classic? This pessimistic teenager gets kicked out of school (his third one) for not applying himself. You get the idea that he's smart, but he just doesn't care about anything. There are random references to his dead brother Allie, maybe that's a cause for his disillusionment with the world, but it's never really verified. This story was disappointing in that nothing significant happened. I kept waiting, and turning the pages, but at the end of the day it was a disappointment."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"How this book ever got to be a classic is beyond me!! I read it all the way through because I'd heard of it for years. I kept thinking it would provide some lesson in life. I was sorry I ever read it!! I obviously missed the life lesson."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A rambling accounting of about 3 to 4 days in the life of a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Holden is mentally unstable, and a bit distraught over being expelled from another expensive boarding school. There is absolutley no plot. It is exactly like reading the mind of a teenager with no personal motivation, or ambition. Mildly amusing, mildly depressing, rampant profanity.This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Yes, that includes the House of Night series, and the Cirque Du Freak! I was very disappointed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to slow down at the scene of a vehicle accident for the sake of curiosity. It offers no literary value or edification whatsoever.When I started reading it, I kept expecting it to get better, or make some kind of point. When I realized it wasn't going to improve, I felt far enough invested in it, that I decided to finish it reguardless of my low opinion."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has been touted as one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century. I had always meant to read it and finally got around to it just recently. I must say I do not see the \\"masterpiece\\" quality to the writing nor was it much of a story, quite frankly. I would bet that if this were floated to publishers today it would never see the light of day."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I believe that works of art, be it sculpture, painting, music or literature are a product of their time. Those that are destined for greatness are rediscovered by sucessive generations with Michagelo, Van Gogh, Mozart, and Shakespeare as examples. Salinger's works in contrast, seems dated and aimed squarely at the angst of pampered American Baby-Boomers.Although I enjoyed this book as an adolescent, a recent re-reading of it made it seem self important and irrelevant. I actually wanted the main charecter to shut up and get over himself.I imagine Holden as a current day overweight, balding, middle manager working in MidTown, with and ex wife, drinking problem, large pharmacy bill, and chip on his shoulder caused by the world doing him wrong.To me, this novel has not stood that test of time that some other great works from the era such as Slaughter House 5, and Lord of the Flies have."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book can only be summed up as horrible. The book \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a very hateful and shows how unpleasant and repulsive one possible character could get. It doesn't even seem like one person could harbor all that hate towards his own people. Just despising them behind their back or a full fledged argument, we can only imagine the thoughts of the critically acclaimed author J.D. Salinger of the \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" J.D. Salinger has created one novel only being \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" which only adds to the mystery of why he seems so strange. He graduated from New York University and lived on cruise ship for awhile. Salinger is current age is 88. It can be said that some people have no idea of how this book got so famous for its unique outlook and radical ideas for the time or as simple as life really does suck.To loathe such a book could not be don't but to love this book would say too much. The book having cursing and bad language through out definitely made it clears of the time period and the description of the character's traits. He never looks at the good side of anyone, except for Phoebe who seem to have more of a romantic bond than brother and sister. The fact how he scornfully hates everyone he meets, even the girls he says he \\"loves\\" (if he can possibly love) but then thinks about them negatively. Holden would be referred to today as a modern day emo kid. The only thing is he does not dress up like a transvestite but everything else is but 100% true. The Catcher in the Rye's ending is the most anticlimactic end of all times and just for that part alone I would give -5 out of 5. The book is intended for men mostly, women can read it too but it is too sad. For readers that preferably are not going through any troublesome times.Thus concluding that the book was not a good read at all and it is surely not a children's book. As the language being really cynical and hate being thrown everywhere. Also showing minds of people who flunk out of school and are just lazy by nature. This book is like the hand manual converting regular folks into axe murderers. This story was not enjoyable and dragged on \\"toooooooooo\\" long; I'd give it 2 out of 5."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a book that I hate to love. And it may sound strange, but it's the things in this book that I dislike that makes me like it so much.Holden, (the 16-year-old main character) uses certain words and phrases in practically every other sentance which gets really annoying, but it's these times that his character becomes so real and likeable to me. He has a 'voice' that is both common and unique at the same time. I found myself smiling, if not laughing, alot - which is always a sign of good writing. I think my favourite part is when Holden is pondering the phrase F*** YOU. To me, his thoughts here are very deep and profound. These few paragraphs gave me the best 'image' into how he sees himself and the world around him.The 'Catcher in the Rye' may not be the greatest book ever writen, however, I certainly think it is worth the read, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I realize I should have read this book earlier in life but somehow escaped the assignment. I'm a little confused by the fact that it is known as a classic...I finished it feeling like I MUST have missed something. It killed me, that book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Picked up and read on vacation in my \\"Should Have Read These in H.S.\\" list.The collection of thoughts, the strong personality of the main character (even in his yellow weakness) - are impressive - the books and music mentioned are now on my search lists.Holden reads much older than I'd expect - but perhaps in fair keeping with the time in which he lived. Some of his inner conversations and observations had me saying \\"Yes! Yes!\\" - how can these awarenesses of human beings general ugliness be so universal yet remain un-addressed. So many and so self-absorbed... \\"I like it when somebody digresses.\\" And The Catcher in the Rye is a masterful example of just that."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of America's most beloved and misunderstood novels, written in pitch-perfect prose, straight from the heart. Interesting how so many would condemn this novel, along with Twain's Finn, without ever having turned a page of it. Should be read four times: in adolescence; in one's tweens; on the cusp of middle-age; and right before they throw the switch."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love this book, and have read it several times over the years - and will read it again. It's masterfully written, full of amazing and realistic detail, and incredibly modern for something written sixty years ago. While reading it I kept thinking to myself that it was MORE modern than most books written in the past few years. I also got the feeling, as I read it - and I base this on nothing but gut instinct - that this book heralded in a new dawn of writing. Kudos Salinger!I can't help but love Holden Caulfield, despite all his depression and misery and angst. I don't know if you'd call it a criticism, but everything about him is pre-conscious, yearning to get real and honest and become true to himself, but at the same time so lost and blocked. My gut vibe on Caulfield is that if he were real and grew up to be an adult he would never really get conscious. I just don't see it happening with him. Like, for all his beauty and caring and humanity, he's just too self-hating, self-destructive, traumatized, and dishonest to really ever become truly conscious.And if the life of J.D. Salinger (whom I will assume is the model for Holden Caulfield) is any indication, then I'm probably right... Ugh.So, I only give this book four stars because of its lack of consciousness - lack of deep self-honesty woven into its pages. Aside from that, everything about the book is downright perfect."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first 300-page book I've ever read in one sitting -- and I'm not a big novel reader. I just couldn't wait to see how it ended. There is so much symbolism in the book, you almost need an algorithm to keep track of it.So, why is this an American classic? Do you other reviewers even need to ask? This is literature at its finest. The writing is excellent -- try to remember that books were not written in this conversational tone in 1951. The genius of this book is that the author is talking directly to the reader through Holden Caulfield! YOU are the psychoanalyst! This is what most people (and reviewers) overlook about this novel. The burden is on the reader to (gradually) figure out the protagonist's pathology -- just like a real psychologist would.Other reasons this is an American classic: the masterful use of foreshadowing, irony and symbolism.I won't ruin it for you if you haven't read it, but go get it and read it. Buy it on a Friday, though, since you probably won't be able to put it down until you finish it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in summer school, probably when i myself was holdens age in the book. Its about a repressed \\" trustfund kid\\", who has a bitter cynical view of his friends and everything i guess he should like. But there are a set of events that change things, and open i think from my opinion anyhow holdens feelings. I think its an exceptionally great book, with important life lessons. And show you that sometimes these crappy things you feel that consume your life, really arent so big and looming compare4d to others things. And if you dont let them continue to be...i recommend it. I think its great"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First off, I don't understand why there's so much hate around this novel. I'd say it's one of the best pieces of American literature I have ever read. The reader's brief journey through Holden's transition from the innocent over to the \\"perverted\\" adult world. From Holden's encounter with the water-spitting perverts to Holden's date with Sally in New York, the Catcher in the Rye is a great example of what the teenage years are like. This excellent novel is one that I truly related to, being a teenager experiencing some of the same feelings that Holden feels. While I don't know what it feels like to lose a loved one like Holden does, I understand how he feels about sexuality and that struggle to maintain what is innocent in the world, and I even could experience some of what it would feel like to lose a loved one through Holden's touching rhetoric in the novel. Some people might be offended by Holden's swearing, but I believe it helps us see more eye-to-eye to Holden. If the novel was written in a more articulate manner, the theme of the struggle for communication would be harder to convey. Furthermore, we relate more with him and feel like he is one of us. In several points of the novel, I felt myself laughing when funny parts happened and crying when sad parts occurred. The Catcher in the Rye is a touching novel that every teenager should read in order to preserve his character, something Holden would be very proud of.EvanP.S. I'm \\"Holden\\" on to my past as well...I think I belong in a mental instution and need to be psychoanalyzed. I came to that realization after reading this novel haha =]"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"So I've been on a \\"classic book\\" kick, deciding that with all of the reading I do, I should try to work in more well-known literary novels. The ones I should have been reading in HS or college. Catcher in the Rye was on my list this month.Interesting book...although not my favorite of all the \\"classics\\" I've read, it definitely left an impression. Amazing descriptives and it really puts you in the mindset of Holden Caulfield. And you might be shocked at what you feel/think about. It's easy to slip into this character and get lost in how he is feeling and who he is and what he's dealing with. A close look at a hard life. For those merits alone it's worthy of a Pulitzer in my opinion. (Although it notoriously did not win one.)It's an easy read, nothing to be intimidated by, and it's short at only 250 pages. What do you have to lose? I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger follows Holden Caufield on his two-day journey after being expelled from Pencey, a private all-boys school, for \\"not applying himself\\". Holden spends his journey in bars, hotels, and bus stations wasting away time. Being written in the early 50's, his risque cursing and sexual conversations only attribute to his troubled mind. In a world of phonies, Holden wants nothing more than the truth.After his brother's traumatic death at age 13, Holden Caufield wants to simply preserve his childhood and innocence. He tells his sister Phoebe, \\"...I have to catch everybody as they start to go over the hill...I'd just be the catcher in the rye.\\" He wants to protect himself and other children from the phony and lost world of adults. Unfortunately, Holden is trapt in the adult world and must experience situations beyond his years. Although he feels his innocence is lost, he still believes in the innocence of youth, as shown by his sister riding on the carousel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Maybe you've heard too much about it.

Read it. You'll really like it. Promise.(And, when you're done with this get Franny and Zooey and read that!)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this novel in 6th grade. I was enthralled then, and I've read it three times since, all at different periods of my life. I still love it. Holden is a character who faces a conflict that many of us do: how do we preserve innocence and purity in a world that seems to far removed from both? The answer is, of course, that we can't. Innocence and purity are transitory. They cannot last in the corrupted world in which we live.Yes, the slang and the situations in the novel may be dated, but the overall human situation is one that will never be dated.I usually don't say this, but I am hard pressed to understand how anyone cannot love this novel. I'm really surprised by some of the one-star reviews. I can't find one aspect of this novel that isn't great. To me, it is Salinger's masterpiece. Even if you read this book on a purely superficial level, you'll still be glad you did. Beyond some of the weighty issues it deals with, it is super entertaining."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many people believe this is a true classic work of literature. I believe English literature died when this became a \\"classic.\\"The \\"protagonist\\" of this book is nothing but a whiny man-child. It is 224 pages of a kid living off his parents' success while wandering around NYC complaining about \\"phonies.\\" The last bit is rather ironic, as Holden Caulfield is nothing but the absolute definition of a phony. I believe this book demonstrates the true definition of the phrase \\"first world problems.\\" A smart (that's debatable), bored and rich kid gets kicked out of his big prep school because he didn't do any of the work. This is the kind of person who I wish would have been drafted to fight and die in some icy foxhole in Korea, but alas, his rich family would have bought his way out of service.Now, I am not some Bible-thumping conservative upset by a book. I'm a registered Democrat (and not a Blue Dog, but more of the Occupy subset) and I feel censorship is one of the worst evils any authority can commit, but I feel this book is trash. Salinger is no Hemingway, Steinbeck or even Hunter S. Thompson (who, while stoned off his mind, at least talked about something that really happened).This book does not need to be banned. It needs to be ignored."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is such a phoney!

Salinger brought my mind to the book I read so many years ago and loved. I decided I wanted to read it again and have it for my \\"favorites\\" library. I purposely ordered what was labeled \\"hard cover\\" as I wanted it to last. When I received it, I found it to be unreadable. the letters and lines were incredibly close together making reading a chore rather than a pleasure. It is an important book and this printing and publishing of it doesn't measure up to its worth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's summertime again, and so I'm putting together my summer reading list and this book is #1 for me (first not necessarily best though).I read this one already a long time ago in high school and I think I liked it \\"OK\\". They said Jodie Foster read it and then she went INSANE and tried to kill the president. Then! I think it made her a lesbian also. I don't know. It was a long time ago.Anyway, any book that can do all that is gotta be worth another read through. Plus! now I heard theres a guy who wrote a sequel to it so we have that to look forward to. Its like 2 for 1 except I'm told you actually have to buy them separately (for now -- hey J.D. Salsbury! how about a compilation edition and save us some money huh??).Okay I will be reading this again but! since I already read it and I remember it was pretty good I give it FOUR STARS. Good job J.D.! Youre book is right up there in the top 20% of books EVER WRITTEN.I'd have maybe even given it FIVE STARS but then what do I do if the sequel turns out to be even better?? Its like if the first gymnist in the Olympics gets a perfect 10 and then the next one is better then she was and now your stuck now, scoring-wise.Its going to be a good summer for literateur if this trend keeps up.

I could sort of relate to it but, his situation is much more extreme. With him droping out of high school and me going for a college it was different. This book was a white trash love story which it made it somewhat interesting. Also I would look up Gene Autry Fan's review on this book and barf from the contradiction on his part and gave me a laugh."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are a shallow person, this book will mean nothing to you what-so-ever. In 7th grade I read this book, and I am currently in 8th Grade, I was always considered Intellectual and I read at a College Level. But enough banter about myself. Getting to the most awseome book of all time, Holden Claufield undergoes a struggle in his life. He dropped out of high school, and Lives in new york, his younger brother died when he was 10, and he always remembered the words of his brother \\"The catcher in the rye, the Catcher in the rye, I want to be a catcher in the rye\\" and Is aghast when corrected to find out it is \\"Catcher in the Rough\\" The book is summarized by basically saying, read this.. You'll understand why. (Why Mark Chapman killed john lennon after reading this remains a mystery to me as I am sure to J.D salinger.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a good book. It got a little boring in some places."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked this book cuz the guy who tells the story is funny because his thoughts just trail off sometimes. This book has ALOT of swearing so if that bothers you, you wont like it. But overall its a good story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield has easily become a name familiar to most teens experiencing trouble on their quest to adulthood. J.D. Salinger represents the pain, struggle, and confusion of being sixteen through the eyes of Holden, an expelled prep school student. The book takes place during the course of the days immediately following Holden's expulsion through his last minutes with his &quot;phonie&quot; roommate and his journey through New York City. He struggles with being able to define himself to his parents and to himself. In Holden's search for truth his own physical and mental state become endangered. Holden stays in different locations in the city and wants to just return home; however, feels that he has lost his chance at being a dutieful son. In visits back to his favorite childhood spots, Holden confronts his coming of age and realizes that its just not the same anymore. He spends great time focusing on his sister and appreciates her for her childlike innocence and kind-nature. Salinger brilliantly captures the mind and voice of a misunderstood teen through the use of informal, almost conversational speech. Inside every person, there was once a lost teen exploring the world as they know it and reaching out beyond the grasps of the familiar and the expected."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a candid look at one character's perspective on social life. Holden Caulfield is an engaging character you will grow to love. I initially wanted to read this book to see what all the hype was about and while some might find that it drags in places, it is truly a must-read. There is a sense of irony in Holden's opinion of &quot;phonies&quot; in his circle of friends. He himself tends to tell people what they want to hear, but you quickly realize that as he sees it, he has a good reason for being a &quot;phony&quot; himself. There is a subtle, yet justifiable, reason for his actions that you won't notice until the end of the book. Holden is such a simple character, though, that you can't help but like him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I once heard that John Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is one of the most frequently banned books in US High Schools today, right up there with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Farenheit 451. Not surprisingly, all of these books are on the reading list at my school. Catcher is a real classic, a book that manages to offer an insight into the mind of a depressed teenager who feels that the world has alienated him. Many children may read this book and think about how Holden Caulfield was a sullen loner who isn't like them at all, but upon frequent thought they will discover similarities between Holden and themselves, and realize that, at heart, he is a normal teen: trying to grow up in an unfriendly world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It takes a certain amount of personal struggle to understand and appreciate this novel. A mental health issue may also help. I am merely a 17-year-old, so possibly my opinion doesn't matter to you, but this book matters to me. Everyone is looking for someone to connect with, and Holden Caulfield has transcended his &quot;innocent&quot; era of the Fifties to speak to many a troubled teenager. And, no, not just to schizophrenics. His days alone with the world are the ultimate description of the most difficult stage of life. It is absolutely necessary for this to continue as mandatory reading, if only for those select few who will look past the &quot;goddamnits&quot; to see the true spirit of a boy struggling to grow up and still hold on to his childhood. Holden keeps his dead brother's baseball mitt; I keep my Barbie doll. What do you hold on to?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is the truest, saddest, and most honest book that has ever been written. All other literary classic's dull in comparison to J.D. Salinger's. To Holden's feelings of insignifigance in a cold world to his love of the innocence of children. From his stark thoughts which everyone feels but most choose to deny. To the love he feels for those untainted by the &quot;phoniness&quot; of the adult world. I urge all people to read this book, your life will never be quite the same. &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; rings true to me more than any movie, book, or song I've ever experienced."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Phoebe gets on the carrousel at the end of The Catcher in the Rye and suddenly the carrousel is the rye field with the kids playing in it. Only this time instead of Holden, (Hold-on), wanting to catch any kids that fall, even though he is afraid of Phoebe falling as she reaches for the gold ring, he decides not to do or say anything because if they want to grab for the gold ring,(grow up), you have to let them. Holden at the end here is no longer the catcher or savior Christ figure. In fact in a way he is more of a Buddha figure sitting there feeling so damn happy, having a Satori-like experience of acceptance of change and impermanence very much the same insight as Siddhartha sitting under the Bodhi tree. Suddenly, as it rains like a bastard on Holden, the carrousel changes from rye field to the great wheel of birth and death with Phoebe, Holden, Salinger, and all the rest of us holding on and going round and round. ((( ))) Somewhat speculative I know but I do know this much. Those literary critics who can't see the carrousel as the rye field are going to miss a little too much. Oh and it's no accident that the song &quot;Smoke gets in your Eyes&quot; is playing on the carrousel. Here are the words to the song for those who don't know it. THEY ASKED ME HOW I KNEW.... MY TRUE LOVE WAS TRUE? I OF COURSE REPLIED, SOMETHING HERE INSIDE, CANNOT BE DENIED, THEY SAID SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIND, ALL WHO LOVE ARE BLIND, WHEN YOUR HEART'S ON FIRE, YOU MUST REALIZE, SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES, SO I CHAFFED THEM AND I GAYLY LAUGHED, TO THINK THEY COULD DOUBT MY LOVE, YET, TODAY, MY LOVE HAS FLOWN AWAY, I AM WITHOUT MY LOVE, NOW, LAUGHING FRIENDS DERIDE, TEARS I CANNOT HIDE, SO I SMILE AND SAY, WHEN A LOVELY FLAME DIES..... SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Often when people read Catcher, they do not understand Salinger's intent. Most do not see the reason that he wrote such a book. The reason Salinger wrote this book was to comment on Holden growing up to face his adult life. Holden grows immensely through out this novel. As he goes through each phase of his life, he matures while commenting on the fakeness of the world. While Holden understands the &quot;phoniness&quot; of society, he is unversed in the ways of the world. Going into the city, Holden is exposed to many elements of life that force him to mature not only spiritually, but mentally as well. To be able to fulfill his mission, Holden must first be able to understand the culture of his society and surroundings. Salinger, through the voice of Holden, tries to show the reader that what is on the surface is not always what is true. While the book does show autobiographical elements, Salinger is not telling his life story. This book is a great example of depth in a novel. Holden's language is not an example of crude intention, but rather, it is necessary to show Holden's immaturity as well as his cynical outlook. Often, Holden is shown as a hopeless cynic with no hope for the world. However, Holden is a model realist, and often, the world is a gloomy place to be. In the end, Holden, with the experiences of his life guiding him, he realizes his place in life, not as a catcher, but as an informer. Salinger wrote a wonderful novel in The Catcher in the Rye. He perfectly portrayed the life of a young man struggling to mature and accept all aspects of society while understanding his purpose in the world. This novel is wonderful to show maturing adolescents that life is confusing and maturation is part of being here."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My opinion of The Catcher in the Rye is a well thought out one. I have read most of the reviews that gave the book a poor rating, as well as most of the ones that gave it high ratings. After reading the reviews of many impressed readers I came up with one opinion; some can relate to Holden, while others cannot. I have just had to pacify myself with the fact that I don't enjoy this book. It disappoints me. So many of the readers had wonderful reviews, but I firmly believe that I just don't have the personality to appreciate the graphic language and bad attitude of Holden. Though out the story, I felt pity for Holden. Because J.D. Salinger did a good job of making him appear as a venerable character, I found myself wanting something good to happen for Holden. Needless to say, it never did. I realize that Lady Luck does not sprinkle her fairy dust on everyone, but the constant negative attitude and bad judgement of Holden annoyed me to the point of distraction. I'll admit, though, that I couldn't put the book down, but only because I was curious to see what everyone was raving about. I was so eager to get to the climax that I turned back after reading through the last chapter. &quot;Where is it?&quot; I wondered. I thought I had accidentally neglected to comprehend some magical work or phrase that would pull the story together. I had no such luck. I was left in a perplexed state. If I &quot;missed the boat&quot; on this book I am thankful. I just don't want the pecimistic attitude it takes to benefit from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is so true. Speaking as a high schooler, I cantotally relate to what Holden Caulfield is going through. At first, Iwas annoyed by his attitude and hatred towards everyone, but then I was that this is what every high schooler feels. I found myself agreeing with Holden regarding his detest of all the fakes in the world. He is looking for a place where he can be himself and a person he can trust not to betray him. I'm normally not one to htink about a book even when I'm not reading it, but with Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, that is not true. I found myself constantly thinking about Holden and trying to comprehend his emotions and feelings. He is very confused and tired of everyone's phoniness. This book was fast-paced and fairly easy to read. I would not recommend this book to anyone that was younger than a high school age because of the language. One negative of the book was the offensive, very often used, adult language. Other than that, this book was excellent. I would recommend it to everyone of an appropriate age, eespecially any teenager that is sick of the fake attitude that most everyone in their school carries."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as a sophomore in High School and didn't think too much of it. But 15 years latter the book name still pops up in references all over so I decided to give it another read. Well it is defiently worth the reread if your in the same boat. So much of the book makes a lot more sense today and I see it's words in action today better than I did back then. The greatest thing I find about the book is it's simplicity in story and words showing the shallowness of people and life yet it still brings out the bright spots out there that make it all worth while when you look deep down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Our Book Club just finished reading another angst ridden novel about several young adults coming of age called PSEUDO COOL.

Either way, the style of writing was awesome. The character &quot;Holden&quot; just becomes a 'friend' of yours in a way. And through everything he goes through, regardless of the scenario, you don't lose interest, it only keeps growing. When i read it the second time, i was able to follow more, just the writing style, and it was just so smooth and free-flowing. Honestly, a great piece of work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is my favorite! Chuck's too"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To quote the author, Catcher in the Rye is the kind book were, &quot;Once you've read it, you wish the author was a great friend of yours and you could ring him on the phone whenever you wanted&quot;. On first sight, we are stuck by Salinger's simple style, and as readers we grow more and more appreciative of Holden's language, as he appears to draw us closer and closer as first a friend, then a confidante. We notice upon further reading the downward spiral the lead character's mentality is beginning to take, but never does the book become painful to read, our sympathy for his character remains unaltered. Perhaps this is due to the singular style of writing that Salinger seems to possess, the ability to expertly involve the reader, or perhaps it is due to the sensitive, real - world characterisation. Whatever the reason, seldom has a book representing aleination from modern American culture (see for example Lolita or A Confederacy of Dunces) been so sensitively and delicatly construsted. After reading such a book, you will find your view of conventional society radically altered!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i never thought that i would read a book that made me understand myself so well. i mean this book might have made people feel depressed, but it made me realize what i want in life. it was beautifully written, and i hope that someday i will read a book that is as amazing as this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is absolutely incredible.

This is a must read for everybody!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is probably the most interesting character I've ever come accross. I think that everyone can see a little bit of themselves by peering into Holden's mind and seeing the seemingly small, insignificant things that &quot;kill&quot; him or depress him. The book was also surprisingly funny at times - I often caught myself laughing out loud."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand when people label Holden as a bad seed or an awful person. Did you not read the part where he explains his 'catcher in the Rye' theory? If more people had a heart like that-a true beneath the surface kindness- as does Holden then i believe we would all be thatnkful. Of course there are 'catchers' in all our lives. Be it a caring friend a confidant, our mother or father, whomever was there to help us through a rough time. to keep us from falling off the cliff. Unbeknownst to him, holden did live out his dream. i think his character saved many adolescents 'playing in the field'. Also, jane is so symbolic! it's amazing. I truly recomend this book.

Salinger!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To all the morons who say this book is boring because it has no plot, why don't you read The Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence and find out what boring is! You guys give me the royal pain. You don't have to be a psychopath to get this book, just human. I'm not a smoker, I'm not a drug addict, heck I don't even swear. But I adore Holden because he's an idealist. He won't throw an snowball at a fire hydrant because it's too white. He won't sleep with a prostitute because he feels sorry for her. He doesn't want kids to see the &quot;f*** you&quot; sign because it'll pollute their minds. He feels bad for the nuns since they don't eat anything swanky for lunch. People say that Holden is cynical and doesn't care about anything. But he does care, not about materialistic things, but simple things that really matter. Now, that's more than I can say for some people I know."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"and it's true, every word of it! a pure ramble of beatific prose poetry, poured forth undiluted by yet another madman searching for truth and beauty along the road of life... of course! of course! this i get! what I DON'T get is why everyone thinks Holden is a phony. That judgement is external/societal, and therefore phony itself! The whole point is that Holden ISN'T a phony. He thinks for himself instead of bending to society's will at every turn. Whether he gets it &quot;right&quot; or not just isn't the point! He's honest about what he sees, true to himself and seeking truth and beauty in life, whereas most everyone around him has given up on it to some greater or lesser degree. Some entirely.

He's REAL and honest and genuine in his intentions, regardless of how misguided they might or might not be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"OK, art is not an easy concept to grasp, and you cannot explain it in a 1000 words. Better read Kant and his Critic of the Judgement. A book needs no plot to be good, it does not really need anything in particular.

Everyone does it now and then whether it's out loud in the open or even under your breath! I could actallu relate to what this boy, Holden, was actually going through! I mean... I could be sooo carefree just as much as he can! I think that the purpose of this book was for the author, J.D. Salinger to put himself in this book. If you have done a little research on this author i guess you would understand.?! The begining paragraph totally caught my eye....Didn't it do the same for you? I mean just as Hemigway said, &quot;Why use the five dollar words when the one dollar words are just as good!?&quot; Anywayz.. Don't be a bum and read just the first couple chapters or even the first couple of pages and put the book down... GIVE IT A CHANCE!! Obviously because it was written by a different author then all the other books you've probably read it will naturally be different!

Salinger that is a well known and loved story about a boy who is facing many hardships and problems as a 16 year old growing up in the 1950's. What makes this coming of age book so popular even to contemporary readers is its characters and conflicts that can be easily related to by many.The story starts out with the main character Holden Caulfield being expelled from his fourth school after failing four of his five classes. The trek back home 2 days before his family was expecting him starts his adventure of wandering the streets of Manhattan. There he encounters a variety of people from old girlfriends to a prostitute before making it back home too ashamed to admit to his parents of being expelled.What makes The Catcher in the Rye such a good book is the character Holden and how the author portrays him. He is easy to relate to in his troubles with life, sex, and personal conflicts, but what makes him unique is how he approaches situations. For example, early in the book when Holden is on the train home to Manhattan, he is approached by a woman who had a son that went to school with him. Though he didn't care for her son at all, Holden makes up stories about the boy of how well liked he was at their school just to see her reaction and to possibly make her happy though they were all lies. He is quick to point out the hypocrisies of adults, and the people in which he viewed as \\"phonies\\" all the while secretly wishing to retrieve the lost days of his childhood.The Catcher in the Rye is a book that all must read and experience. It is better suited for an older audience, who can better relate to Salinger's words, and shouldn't be read just once. It is a book that should be appreciated for its depiction of its characters and outlook on the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really enjoyed teaching this book in my class on American Literature. I think that most of my students really enjoyed the book--in any case they enjoyed it more than most of the other \\"classics\\" they have been force fed throughout their education. So many of the texts that students are required to read in school have nothing to do with their lives outside of the classroom. Students in my class frequently remarked that this book was \\"different.\\" I think that reading about a young man who has many of the same thoughts and problems as them made the reading experience not only more enjoyable, but also more academically productive for my students"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield said things I could never say, those things I would never say if I had the chance.How many teenagers felt that way reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\"? That's why teens are reading this book. That is why more often than not, they enjoy it more than writers like William Faulkner.J. D. Salinger was not a shock artist. He did not use offensive themes and language to stir up publicity and talk about freedom of speech. He employed his freedom of speech as a tool to communicate, not to infuriate. As a result, he wrote a magnificent book looking into the psyche of youth. What makes Salinger a classic writer, and wealthy publicity hounds like Eminem and Howard Stern noisy wannabes is that within his language, there is truth.While Holden searches for himself, and the meaning of life, he was a younger version of those in the Beat movement, or James Dean. Readers go from \\"Catcher\\" to Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road,\\" with the same easygoing, streaming thoughts kind of way.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" grabs at the introspective self. Like so many of the Oprah books are for women, \\"Catcher\\" is the for teen male. (Did I offend the teens guys, or the Oprah fans?)I fully recommend \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" It is close to being a literary masterpiece, and will intrigue even the passive reader.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I personally found the \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" to be the best book I read in high school. It well depicts the life of teenagers today, capturing and well expressing how ignorant and impulsive behavior only leads down a very narrow and steep path to the hard reality of life, felt by the main character Holden Caulfield.Holden, the novels protagonist and narrator is extremely ignorant, hard headed, unmotivated and jealous, who puts down everyone and everything around him. Holden seems to be obsessed with picking out the faults of everyone around him, calling anyone he who doesn't see things his way \\"phonies\\". He also seems to believe that people are all liars and have alternate agendas to stab him in the back. He is so obsessed with the actions of everyone else around him; he doesn't stop to realize how immature his own actions really are. The character Holden Caulfield well relates with many teenagers growing up; confused, ignorant, and, self centered.The novel also expresses Holden's constant struggle with the preservation of childhood to adult hood. He feels that growing up in today's society will corrupts the growing children of tomorrow's future even though he would never admit it. Holden very confused, is only able to relate with his younger sister named Phoebe, she is Holden's salvation and is the only person that is able to get Holden to think straight.The author well captured high school ignorance in its prime, making this a book that all high school students should read. Catcher in the Rye a piece of reality mixed in with a little bit of Salinger's creativity, creating an intense, yet heart felt novel about a young boy alone in a big world with almost no one to turn to. I fell this novel would be appealing to people who enjoy watching reality television shows, and for anyone else looking for a good science fictional novel.Ultimately, this novel only covers three days of Holden's life, with no real conclusion leaving it open ended and perfect for a continued novel. I felt it as enjoyable, and a good read, excellent for anyone who feels like the weight of society is unbearable, because Holden Caulfield and the Catcher in the Rye might just be the three worst days you've ever read about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher for the first time in high school, as part of the freshmen English class readings. Liked it, but didn't really get into it. Then, like any other hot-blooded, cynical, somewhat awkward and introverted youth, the onset of teenage depression and angst promptly arrived. Without really realizing it, I picked up Catcher again and re-read it. This time, something, somewhere in the brain, clicked. It was rather an epiphany, not unlike suddenly being able to see three-dimension in a two-dimensional drawing, or being able to suddenly spot intricate pattern in an otherwise ordinary cloudy sky. Since then, I must have read and re-read Catcher all the way through high school and college for what seems like a hundred times. Catcher in the Rye provided me an outlet, a voice, and a listener for all the raging teenage emotions. After college, the passion for Catcher has somewhat dissipated over the years. But occasionally, I flip through the book before going to bed. Gone is the intense empathy with the story and the narration. Instead, a wave of nostalgia washes over me every time I flip through the pages. It's amazing how a simple little book can capture, catalog, and evoke so much feelings and emotions that are associated with growing up. In my opinion, Catcher in the Rye is quite possibly the ne plus ultra of the genre, even Salinger himself could not outdo. Funny, melancholy, and quietly moving, if this is not great literature, I don't know what is. The only books I've read since then that call to mind Catcher and definitely worth checking out by fellow Catcher-philes are \\"Bell Jar\\" and the graphics novel \\"Ghost World\\". For people who simply don't get it, forget about it, you never will."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like most Americans I read 'The Catcher in the Rye' back in high school because it was the thing to do. I didn't care much for it then, and I forgot nearly all of it. However upon re-reading it thirty years later I am surprised at what a concise, insightful and moving story it is. Alternatively humorous and depressing, the book is reminiscent of 'The Great Gatsby' because it completely evokes an bygone era without a word wasted.As for the story, it's about a tuned-out, turned off teenager escaping from a boarding school in the 1940s. The young man runs off to New York to try to make some sense of his life and make amends with his family, especially his younger sister. No, nothing terribly exciting happens in these several days. But the author really makes the reader feel compassion and pity for the fellow. We're not exactly sure why he's so disillusioned with life but we desperately want him to \\"change the channel\\" on his depression and despair.Bottom line: quietly disturbing and moving. Kids: don't bother reading this book. Instead tell your parents to read it .. again!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is a bit of Holden Caulfield in all of us. Holden narates this classic novel with his terrific insights into society, it's standards and what we're expected to conform to. Holden's story is really a simple one. Leaving his snobby prep school and keeping his secret from his parents he's on a journey. Along that journey we learn the inside of Holden's thoughts. Who among us hasn't felt what Holden feels and thinks. His naration is a terrific honesty of society. I love Holden and I love Holden's little sister Phoebe who he seeks out in the book at her elementary school as she is the only one, his little sister, that he can confide in. I've read this many times. You must read it at least once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of those classics that I read as a teenager. I don't remember my reaction then (except for the nagging feeling that it was something I was supposed to appreciate because it was a classic and because I was right around Holden's age). So here I am 40 years old, reading it again. And I think it's magnificent. As a teenager, I probably thought Salinger was a lot like me because of the voice he has created for Holden. As an adult, I think Salinger is a brilliant stylist because he obviously \\"captured\\" the voice of an angst-ridden (and for good reason!) teenager. There is so much complicated stuff to consider amidst a seemingly uncomplicated tale. And it's always fascinating to consider what literature sticks around and what doesn't. Just for grins, I checked out the Pulitzer site and discovered that Conrad Richter's The Town won in the same year that Catcher in the Rye was eligible. Makes you wonder which 2005 titles will still be around 55 years hence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first book I have ever read that truly captures the emotions a teenager feels and thinks. I can relate to this book in so many different ways, which kept me from wanting to put it down. From beginning to end it was a page turner. The characters are so well developed I felt as though I could picture them in real life. J. D. Salinger did an amazing job with this book.At the beginning of the Catcher in the Rye, you are introduced to the Narrator and main character of the book. Holden has been presented to you with no limitations on his expectations or thoughts on any specific topic or item. He for the most part hates everything around him. Holden often makes references to people being \\"bastards\\" or \\"phonies,\\" I think this shows his dislike for people around him. I think he does not like these people because he is not very self-confidence about himself. He has some background with different topics that have greatly influenced his life and make him the person he is. The death of his brother, his love for his sister, the resentment he feels for his parents and a relationship he once had with a young girl all make up the personality of Holden.The story line of this book is very interesting. Overall, the whole thing takes place in 3 days but because of the detail used in the book and all of the flashbacks it seems like it is happening over a longer period of time to me. The setting is described in such detail that I can visualize the boarding school bathrooms and the nightclub Holden goes to very easily in my mind.I think this book is an example of excellent writing. It is a fast read and very enjoyable, as long as you have a sense of humor and remember this is how a lot of teenagers think and feel. I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least a freshman in high school or older. This recommendation is due to some of the language and the fact that when I was younger then a freshman I would not have fully appreciated the great writing this is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can not believe all the people who wrote such terrible reviews of such a literary classic! Holden is such an wonderful character, and there is so much symbolism here that I think is easily missed by many people (too much to explain here, email me if you want to discuss it). When I was first assigned the book for English class, I read the first chapter and faked the rest, but after a few months, I could not stop thinking about Holden, I read the book over and over. I can get enough of it. Salinger is such a wonderful writer!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While the actual writing was a little lacking, the story and the reality make up for it amazingly. Holden is such a real character; if anything, he's a little on the extremes, but the elements that compose his extremes exist within every one of us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; by J.D. Salinger. Personally I give the book, a 3. The book was not at all a good read. I started the book having high hopes for it. Maybe they were too high. I expected a lot since it has been banned from libraries. I know that there were a lot of cuss words in it, but that just relates to how a teenager would react in that kind of situation. But I think the author did a poor job of showing what it is like for a teenager to think the world should give him everything he wants. I think the only reason this book became so acclaimed was because the way iit was written and the time it came out. The book would not be rated as well if it were to come out today, than when it did in the mid 1900's. I am sure many people disagree with me about what this book had to offer, but I think that if they guy who wrote this was an author it should have been written a little bit better. For God's sake I hope he didn't write to many mre book like that. I don't think society could handle it. I would have recomended he take some writing classes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A couple of weeks ago, I picked up &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; by J.D. Salinger and I couldn't put it down. All my friends were saying stuff like-it's the stupidest book ever written-i don't know how anyone could like it-that kind of stuff. But from the moment I read the first line I was engrossed by Holden Caulfield's insights and experiences. I think a lot of teenagers related to this book because it's a fairly easy read but most importantly it relates to us. I thought that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; kind of paralleled &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; because both of them are coming of age and they don't like all the hypocrites and &quot;phony's&quot; in the world so they try to get away from them. They both are going around in circles that they don't like-Huck is tired of trying how to be civilized-and Holden doesn't like all the people that are &quot;phonies&quot; in the world. So the book is kind of sad-because this is how the rest of Holden's life is going to be. Holden Caulfield is a darker, more serious Huckleberry Finn. But at the end of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; Huck breaks off from the circle and goes out west in search of the new territory-but Holden seems to be going around the same circle for the rest of his life. Holden loves his sister D.B. a lot because she's the real thing-she loves him for what he is and she really cares about him. He also likes the nun's because they're good people. The scene with the woman on the train is also funny because he's such a terrific liar and he's going on and on to that woman about what a great kid her son is even though he's the biggest jerk out of all the kids in PencyThe story kind of relates to J.D. Salinger because he isolated himself from the world once his now-famous novel became a success.I don't know-it's hard to describe-whatever, nevermind. But this book touched me in a way that no book has ever touched me because that's how much teenagers feel like. I'm fourteen by the way-that's all i have to say about that."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are a lot of things I want to say about this book,and I dont know how it would turn out.Besides,ive already submitted a review of this work once &amp; it never appeared,so if this still doesnt,amazon can eat crumbs.Anyway,this book has moulded me into a lot of diff. emotions &amp; outlooks since my initiation into it.The first thing that has struck me after re-browsing through it so many times is how much I could relate to the lead character in almost totally anything,except for his looks.His feelings,thoughts,&amp; overall attitude &amp; reaction to the modern world around him has blended a a bitingly poignant similarity with the reservoir of my life essence.The precise detail of the language in close tasks of observation towards movement,human behavior,the insight a single place brings,events &amp; others is so blindingly accurate to the person conscious &amp; involved in these life scenarios.A lot has been said about Holden's personality,but one thing id like to point out is that Holden may not represent the teenager in general,but there are a lot who are like him.Your nerds,your outcasts,the people you spit,bully &amp; make fun of are but a few classic examples in this.The boy at the back of the classroom.The fact that this book is one of the most reviewed books in this site &amp; has never ceased in its popularity is a testament on how a work of art that has touched an inert origin &amp; unflappable realistic view on man &amp; life respectibly can endlessly fascinate &amp; arouse the most natural of human instincts,fans &amp; detractors alike.The most important though,is that it is able to erect a benchmark where someone could go back &amp; continously solidify his/her relationship with it,gaining more incomparable insight with the passage of time.And this book succeeds in it all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in high school, and since then have made it a point to read it atleast once a year since then. So far I've read it 4 times. The relationship between Holden and his sister reminds so much of the relationship of mybrother and I. It's weird that I think in a very similar way to Holden, and he was supposedly a &quot;mad man&quot;. Everyone should read this."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I myself being a teenager enjoyed this book immensly. It was a very truthfull and honest portrayal of teenagers in general. However I felt that the main charachter Holden Caulfield was to cynical and to mature. His philosophies on life are not that of a teenager rather of an older person who has seen how horrible life can be an has become cynical and bitter because of it. Although teenagers are at times very deppresed they always have a sort of idealistic hope."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of the greatest American(if not the greatest novel) of the 20th century. The story of the anti-hero Holden Caulfield is one that EVERY teenager should read. The time of the setting may have been different, but the themes are still true today. This novel solely captures the rebellion, uncertainity, reckless, and heart of adolescence. It's more than that though, it is a beautifully written story about a boy who is observing reality with eyes that evently tear him down. In the end, no matter what age you are, you might be realizing that Holden Caulfield ,is or was, you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I rushed to read &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; after I watched &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; by Mel Gibson.

I knew it was a classic, and a classic, by definition, is a book that has stood time. I found during and after reading it, that it's just a boy, telling you his thoughts. The swearing gets to be tired and completely unnecessary. The things that this boy does are repeatedly stupid and leads me to wonder why I would ever want to know his every thought. Don't expect a novel that you'll love to read/have read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Teenage rebellion is a part of every American's life, whether in thought, idea, or action. J.D. Salinger's character of Holden Caulfield has managed to embody the spirit of the teen rebel. Many of us have withheld personal information from others for fear of our parents. Many people have been disgusted with all the phonies of the world, of people who are not true to themselves. And many of us are, like Holden, guilty of being a phony ourselves. Holden Caulfield is the conflicted and confused person we all are or were at one time of another. The person who acts like nothing bothers them or that they know the ways of the world, when really we've only just began to explore the world.

I read this book in english when I was 16 and am reading it again at 17 because it was so incredible. It truly touches you at an emotional level, unlike any other book.However, the thing I have found about this book is that you either get it or you don't. It takes a deep thinker and person who is willing to dive into the depths of human emotions. You cannot even begin to understand this book if you have no concept of, or have a difficult time understanding symbolism. If you cannot grasp the importance of it, it will seem like a pointless, boaring novel and you will probably never understand; its all up to you and how deeply enveloped into it you are willing to go. At face value, you will not get much out of it, and, unfortunatley, some people are not willing to go beyond that.It is absolutly worth reading because, even if you don't get it, its not that long and if you do get it, it can influence and change your life in ways you never thought a book could."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is incredible.

On the contrary, it is hilarious and has a plethora of latent meanings that make a person question the world. If you didn't like the book do yourself a favor: get a book of literary critism and read it. You probably will decide that you really did like it but you just didn't understand it. There are lots of reasons why Salinger does things the way that he does. Find out why.

Reading has and dose come hard for me. I wolden't then or now speak the way that J.D. wrote in this book, but because as a young person I hear the language all the time, it really didn't affect me. (Plus young people today say wors) I read it because it was required and I also choose it because of its controvery. I wanted to know what my parents read when they were in school and what all the comotion was about. It really is a great book. And my opion is that if someone dosen't want there kid to read it or teachers don't want to teacher it in their class room, then that individual has a very large problem they need to sort out within them self. Young people today (as did the young people of the time the book was first releasd) have lots of things they deal with and J.D. brings these issuse out in away that gets people to understand that its ok to have problems and it's ok to be a little &quot;flawed&quot;.

Salinger in the highest regard, I was not sure how others viewed him. Through the years, I heard more and more people sing his praises. That is why, when I had my first opportunity to teach literature in an introductory college Lit. class, I chose _The Catcher in the Rye_ to represent novels.This novel brought together a class of 23 students who had, for the most part, resisted reading anything longer than 5 pages. Many came in the first day after it was assigned already finished with the work. The students were eager to discuss and investigate the work; many expressed that this was by far the best work they had ever read. When given a chance, more than 75% of the class chose to focus on Salinger for their term papers.Even if the word of one 25 year old book-loving English teacher bears no weight, the word of 23 students should. Not one student disliked the book--they may have disliked Holden, but they thoroughly enjoyed reading about him.As for censorship, these students probably pegged it right. They stated that those who hate the book and call for it to be banned do so because they are the phonies of which Holden speaks. I can't know if they are right, but they gave me something to think about!_Catcher_ spans the ages of time and readers. It truly is a book worth teaching."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book should not only be read but studied by all students during their first or second years of high school.

I stole a copy of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; when I was in high school. I didn't really feel all that guilty about it at the time. I mean, after all, it's the sort of thing Holden would've wanted me to do. It's the sort of thing he would've done himself.When I did it, it was for somewhat selfish reasons, for &quot;Catcher&quot; helped influence my manners as a free-thinker in the midst of living in the South and having all of these preconceived notions passing as facts passed on to me. I was told, in fact, not to read it by a number of my classmates, who felt that it was dirty or anti-Christian.Instead, that intrigued me to read it all the more. When I realized it was about an adolescent, basically going through the same sort of struggle growing up outside the norm, driven insane by those who don't understand him, I was hooked and have kept it near me ever since.Whenever I think I'm crazy, I turn to Holden Caulfield. Whenever the world makes no sense, I turn to Holden Caulfield. Whenever I feel like running away from obligations that seem to make no sense at all, I turn to Holden Caulfield.Holden has a lot of timeless, meaningful things to say, and the reading of &quot;Catcher&quot; should be encouraged because of that. He's a brilliant, fully rounded character interacting in a number of very real, very frustrating situations, much like children (and adults) today face.It's worth multiple reads"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm 52.

For example, George Steiner, uncomfortably aware of the book's vitality, cannot bring himself to consider it a modern classic; Salinger is secondhand Dostoyevsky.American literature has fought a long battle to gain due respect from the European 'literati'; even in Britain, with it's supreme tradition, many are now looking to the American novel as more dynamic, healthy and wideranging.On a personal note let me mention my favourite line from Catcher, viz &quot;I'm sort of an atheist&quot;.A statement that does not permit qualification, succintly reflective of Holden's confusion! (I agree with view of howardstaunton (below), that Holden should not be viewed uncritically as hero figure) And typical of the care and craft Salinger took on the book's style; this is no pulp fiction!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the rye is, on one level, a story about a young, dissatified American youth, but on a higher level, it is an assasination of culture and society, and the people within. He takes people, and figuratively speaking, shoots them. He shoots them down by showing them the side they don't like to see. The book could have started out with &quot;I don't like your kind. And this is why:&quot; It is honestly written, and captures the energy of a young boy bringing coming to terms with his surroundings. Perhaps one of its greatest contributions is its &quot;catching the state&quot; of adolescence, particularly American adolescence, which by nature, is rebellious against all forms of establishment. But most importantly, it works beyond adolescence, as the essence of the work persuades us to critically examine &quot;the phonies&quot; of OUR society"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is very engaging. I had a hard time putting it down. I think many of us can relate or at least sympathize with Holden Caufield. At first whim the ending may seem lackadaisical but once you look back on the meaning of the book and its main character it makes more sense."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book a few times in my life, roughly every decade since high school. Each time I find new or different meaning in Holden's struggles. It's too easy for us to say, \\"snap out of it!\\" as some suggest; but I think that really turns a blind eye to the real internal struggles that many teens have today. Moreover, how we deal with \\"phonies\\" is a debate that many of us have well into our adult life. This book still hits a cord for me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye has many relevant meanings for the teenagers of today. Holden Caufield's confusions and frustrations are those of most teenagers who want to connect with other people and belong to a certain social quota. J.D Salinger presents to us a novel full of symbolism, imagery, and adolescent complexity that fufills it's overall goals of giving us a glimpse into the life and psyche of a troubled and disturbed teenager who tries making connections with people he doesn't know ending up in, as mean as this may sound, humorous failed attempts. The overall theme in this novel doesn't comply any moral as did Ovid's fables back in ancient Greece. Catcher in the Rye tends to be more interpretive in that manner. Holden's inability to truly connect with people is due to his inability to immature and let go of pain.\\"People never notice anything\\" (Pg 9). It's in this quote that we really see what type of person Holden really is. Nobody around Holden seems to understand him, seems to understand his angers and confusions. Everyone is just as about as \\"phony as he is\\". It's in these beginning chapters we notice that something is wrong with Holden. something that doesn't quite match up. He's a white male with well-off parents that can afford to send him off to boarding school and he purposefully flunks out by not even attempting to study. It's not until later on in the novel that we learn of James Castle and his brother Allie that there is a reason for this rebellion and personal wall that he has erected for himself. It's how Holden breaks this wall that makes this book powerful and a very compelling and humorous read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, it's a classic. It's a relatively quick read, and for some reason I was surprised by how much I liked it. It didn't really 'speak' to me as it might have done if I'd read it when I was younger, but I enjoyed the story and the narrative style. It's amusing to have the narrator obviously exaggerate and lie to you for his own ego.If you're a teenager (maybe an older teenager, now that I think about it - particularly males) or an adult who never read this, pick it up and give it a shot. Worst case is that you'll be a bit bored for a few hours. More likely you'll both enjoy it and be enriched by it at the same time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I could read this book a thousand times and never get tired of it. I really can't think of any other book that I can say the same thing about it. I was just entering college when I read Catcher in the Rye the first time. It took me only two nights to finish it. I thnk the reason I enjoyed it so much is I could really relate to the struggles of Holden Caufield, the protagonist. I went through all these same crazy emotions when I was still finding myself at that age. Now that I finally know what I am doing with my life, it's kind of like recapturing my youth every time I read this book. So, if you haven't read this book yet, please add it to your list. It should be on everyone's list."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Whether its about teenage angst or depression, this book is simply fun to read mainly because Holden Caulfied is simply funny. At times, I settled on the idea that Salinger's main character was a budding Jerry Seinfeld, with his \\"wry\\" commentary on human foibles, especially those around. Having read this book as a high school requirement, I found it much more fun and enjoyable this time around."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Picked up this copy at a used bookstore. Great book. : )The whole book seemed like one big conversation, I didn't like it too much at first but then it's what i began to love about it. It was like what at first seemed like flaws, became exactly what made the book great. The use of \\"goddamn\\" was weird too (not that i have a problem with cursing...do it a lot) it was used so much...but whenever I hear that word again...I'll think of Holden Caufield. A wonderful book that has very emotional and true moments that I can relate to, I can't wait to do my essay on it for school. A wonderful start to a new school year. Thank you so goddamn much, J.D. Salinger.4.5"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by JD Salinger is a controversial book about the challenges of adolescence. The main character, Holden Caulfield, describes a few days in his life that occurred earlier; he writes from a psychiatric facility. The reader gets to experience, primarily from his youthful point of view, the struggles of his adolescence.Holden is a sad, lonely, depressed boy growing up in a wealthy New York family during the 1950's. A younger brother has recently died of leukemia, an 11 year old sister lives at home, and an older brother is in California. Holden has attended---and failed out of---many boarding schools. Holden's dad is a successful lawyer, but little is shared about his mother.Holden is an adolescent lost in the chasm between childhood and adulthood. He is frightened of the changes he knows are on the horizon, and puts up an armor of cynicism to guard against being hurt and moving forward. He views most adults and many of his peers as \\"phonies\\". The impact of the death of his brother is also a significant factor in Holden's life. As the story ends, it is hard to be optimistic about this character's future.Catcher in the Rye is often read in high school, but I think the poignancy of the book is lost on the typical teen. The perceptive college student will probably be better able to identify, empathize and laugh at Holden and his escapades. Despite some of its dated references it still holds up today as a terrific read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I do not at all understand the bad reviews on this book. I have read it probably 7 times and I still love it! I think these readers are putting too much thought into the story line instead of the magic of the character. Holden is the most memorable and facinating character in any book I have ever read. He is very likeable and endearing, not to mention, funny. The story line is obviously not much of one, it is just about his life while trying to hide the fact he was kicked out of school from his parents and what he does in the meantime. Although, he has such a good heart who loves his brother, parents and sister so much he will do anything for them. If you read this, read it for the warmth of the story, not the story itself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read somehwere, long time ago, that J.D. Salinger never meant for \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" to be considered a young adult novel. I happen to agree with him. The fact that protagonist Holden is a high school boy only helps the story plot but his emotional struggles are universal for any age group.We follow Holden in his last days at his private high school and see first hand interactions he has with his teachers, roommates and schoolmates. On his return back home, he runs into series of experiences that remind everyone of their own coming of age experiences. Holden is troubled and emotionally unstable and slowly we learn that deep roots of his angst are due to his younger brother's untimely death from cancer and his schoolmate's suicide. Holden is bright, emotional, caring and highly sensitive child. He comes from a well-off family where he experiences sheltered life and does not know much about outside world. His teachers see his intellectual potential and are deeply disappointed that he is not studying hard in school. It is only one of his former teacher's that reaches to the roots of his emotional troubles and attempts to convince Holden that education is important so that one day, Holden can clearly verbalize what he feels and communicate it to the outside world.I was so touched by reading this book. Everyone should read it and the more mature the person is, the more important this literary jewel is to the reader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a disgusting, filthy book that should, God-willing, NEVER infect another child's mind"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hi, I've read this book, and I must say that I have read the damage that it caused, according to stories I have read.

It seemed to not really have a point, but drag on anyways. It might have been better if it was shorter because then it wouldn't be as drawn out. I also thought it was confusing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"never have I ever witnessed such depravity and hypocracy in one book. I dont think anyone is more hypocritical than holden caulfield. he constantly complains about phonies, but he is in fact very phonie. he constantly lies to everyone, so they can sympathise for him (ch.8). he conceils the fact that he's yellow (ch.13). he also conceils the fact that he's emotionally wounded (ch.20). and while conceiling things about himself, he hates stradlater for conceiling the fact that he's a slob (ch.4). at the end he tries to remove grafitti with swearing in it, but he swears all the time and in front of his little sister (ch.25) he says he wants to be a deaf mute so he won't have to engage in useless conversations, but he constantly wants to have conversations with strangers (ch.8). and the whole concept of being a catcher in the rye is utterly repulsive. no wonder I had to read this in school (thank god I'm done with it) along with &quot;to kill a mockingbird&quot;, it's the perfect book and perfect concept to spoon feed to usefull idiots."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is so random!! More random than Alice in Wonderland even!! It's about a boy who's flunked out of like five schools and is prolonging telling his parents about his latest release by spending five days in the city. WHO FREAKIN CARES?!!? NOT ME!I can understand why people like books such as Gone With the Wind, Rebecca, and even Of Mice and Men. But why this?? There's almost no moral (except the last chapter), no plot, and no characters you even get close to! Every other word that comes out of Holden's mouth is a curse and that really annoyed me! He used the words &quot;phony&quot; and &quot;that killed me&quot; so many times, I could almost tell ahead of time when he was going to say them!And another thing! You know how he's always talking about Jane? And then we don't even MEET HER! I WAS SO MAD!!! The star I gave this book goes to and ONLY to the last sentence!The rest is a big fat waste of time! Dull! Boring! A real snoozer! Don't, I repeat! DON'T waste your time on it!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was just about a boring kids life. It was just one big introduction to a book, which is the worst part of a book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The main idea behind The Catcher in the Rye is the psychological downfall of a sixteen-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield. I picked up on this towards the end of the book. This plot and the cursing make this book very depressing. However, the thing that annoys me the most is the way Holden keeps trailing off in the middle of story. He moves from one topic to another and back to the first several times throughout the story. I'd rather him stick to the point and maybe get to his subtopics a little later. In the story, surprisingly, Holden brings up how, in one of his classes, students were penalized for regression---trailing off in the middle of a story. It's odd because he is in the middle of the main story when he starts telling this one. It made me pretty mad. Also, during his few days alone in the world Holden does some of the messed up things; he pays for a hooker to come to his hotel room. I couldn't believe that. The kid is only sixteen! The best part of the story is in the last few chapters. Holden finally decides to go home and stay home instead of living alone in a cottage in the West. In the ending, not only is there a surprise but also a message. If you are not really open minded I don't recommend this book. If you are open minded, knock yourself out."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I dont know how this became such a widely like book because it is terrible. The book has no plot whatsoever, and has no ending. The book is so bad it made me want to kill myself. I feel like Holden should have jumped out the window when he wanted to and save me the other 100 pages of the book. I urge u not to read this because your not going to like it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is absolutely, by far the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. I will forever harbor a profound resentment towards J.D. Salinger for subjecting me to this torture and for consuming valuable time from my life that I will never be able to restore. As a person who has always held a passion for reading, I am appalled that this piece of literature (if you can call it that) was chosen as a classic, and can only attribute this substantial indiscretion to this decision being made under the incapacitating effects of alcohol, or by shameless bribery on the part of the author. I strongly believe that there is no justification for Salinger for writing this book when his entire vocabulary consists of all of three words, all of which are obscenities, and one of which is consistently and irritatingly misspelled. Because I was assigned to complete the reading of this book, and will surely forfeit credit if I ignore this responsibility, I will continue to suffer through it and will labor under the hope that something miraculous will occur, causing the book to take a turn for the tolerable, and the pain to cease."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In J.D. Salinger's over-hyped classic, we meet Holden Caulfied an overly sensitive, introspective, aspiring Ph.D. who goes underground in New York for two months to find enough money to finish med-school. Through several telephone conversations (the ultimate dramatic device) with his aggressive domineering father (one can only imagine the Kafka influence), we see Caulfied as an innocent lamb on the cusp of an emotional meltdown. He finds himself taking up many degrading jobs -from coroner to male escort- all in which he repeatedly and unconvincingly sees the dark side of humanity, until he ultimately finds himself in a nihilistic state of despair.Though his language may be course and even archaic by today's standards, the story, in its entirety, along with Holden himself, is not. His faux-naf tone and attitude are unconvincing at best and utterly annoying at worst. The prototype of the cynical young adult, he has inspired generations of readers to avoid medical school -with all its \`pretense and pomposity'- and become summer camp counselors- the purported \`soul cleansing' career he ultimately chooses. We can thank this book for the surplus of unemployed camp counselors that continue to wound the economy.I think that what bothers me most about this book, is that being a med-student myself, I found the grad-school portrayed here -Pency school of medicine- to be an inaccurate, and potentially harming version of the seemingly sacred institution after which it was carelessly modeled (brief note in passing: possibly the most annoying part of the book was when he called the Pency school of medicine \`ennui-city'). Holden's dissertation on \`the correlation between alcoholism and small New England coastal communities' -as he put it- was absolutely absurd and preposterous in my opinion; almost bordering on sacrilege. My advice: skip this one kids; buy the cliff's notes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye was a very entertaining yet desturbing book. The story opens up as a boy telling a story in first person point of view. About how he ended up in a California rest home after sufering a mental breakdown. He goes about telling the reader about him self and the problems he encountered in boarding school. Holden Caulfield is a 17 year old high school who got kicked out of his boarding school for not aplying him self. Holden failed all his subjects except for english. Holden goes on to decribe his rommate Ward Stradlater who goes on a double date with Holden. On apon returning from the date Holden and Ward get into a fight over the way Ward was treating his date. Holden then leaves and boards a train for New York City. Holden tells about how he was expecting to only stay in New York for a couple of days but it turns out to be longer than that.Holden wonders around New York finding all kinds of encounters. After wondering around New York Holden calls his student advisor to meet for a drink. While there his advisor calls Holden inmature and Holden gets mad and leaves. He goes home and wakes up his sister and askes her if she could give him her Christmas money to borrow. She gives Holden all he had and promises she wont tell their parents he returned. Holden then goes to his former Engish teachers house and sleeps on his sofa. When he awakes his teacher is patting his head, Holden gets scared and runs away to the train station. He decides to head west, he leaves a note for his sister telling her to meet him when she arrives she comes with her bags to go with him. Holden refused to take her with him so instead he took her to the zoo. Holden then stops telling the story and is not sure if he is going back to school or not. Then the story ends with Holden in the mental institution confused on where his is going or if he is geting out."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It baffles me to no end that anyone would give this book a five star rating or that it is considered a literary classic with a \\"powerful\\" theme. Not only is it intellectually barren, but is horribly written. Tedious and repetetive, it is literally the worst book I have ever encountered. It should be banned, not because of controversial language or subject matter, but so it cannot be inflicted on humanity any longer. It is truly a crime that this book is elevated to a position of equality with works like To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"unless u would want to see the world from the eyes of ordinary 16 year old, it is a complete waste of time n money ... there's no depth in it and as u move on to chapters the story wears off disappointingly, n u would feel like reading a diary of some teenager ... u get nothing out of it really - to be honest i didnt even finish the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The narrator of this story is presented as an avid reader, yet he speaks with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure.By my count, he uses the catch-all phrase \\"and all\\" 174 times.He accuses most adults of putting on a false front, so, by my count, he uses the word \\"phony\\" 47 times. A student with above average literacy skills would likely look the word up in a thesaurus.His little sister Phoebe, who is presented as an honor student, is likewise verbally deficient.

Holden Caulfield has been booted out of the latest school as he has done so on several occasions. The book is Caulfied's thinking and opinions about various things, but comes across as little more than incoherent juvenile rambling if not outright verbal diorreah. If I sound a little annoyed, I am. This is because I had heard a lot about this book, being a classic of its time and considered it as essential reading.I like reading books that are interesting and informative if not motivating and inspiring. This one is far from it and essentially surrounds the rambling non-issues of Holden. Moreover, there is neither a story nor a plot to the book.However, there are a few things about the book that I liked: Salinger does a terrific job of writing the book from a teenager's viewpoint. The book is almost akin to listening to the ramblings of an unsure teen. Second, the relationship between Holden and his little sister Phoebe is developed in a delicate way and is at times touching. Third, Holden's occasional observations are occasionally reflective of the unadulterated insights teenagers are capable of having before formal and structured college education takes over their minds.While one can see how people may relate to the insecurities of a teenager, I for one could not and do not relate in any way and am therefore unable to recommend this."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read a lot of books. And I can say without doubt that this is the worst book I have ever read. Yes, you probably disagree with me. You'll say, &quot;Well, it's a classic book!&quot; The only reason you think it's a classic is because you've been TOLD it's a classic. But hear me out. Here are some reasons this is the WORST BOOK EVER:1) BAD writing. My english teacher told the class that when we are writing anything, the opening sentence has to grab the reader's attention. Read the first page. It doesn't make me want to keep reading at all.2) No plot. This book just keeps going and going. It's just Holden rambling on and on. It doesn't make any sense. When he is talking to Mr. Spencer, he is thinking about ducks. No, that's not a typo. He's thinking about DUCKS. Maybe there's some deep symbolic meaning in that. That gets me to my 3rd reason.3) TOO MUCH SYMBOLISM, NOT ENOUGH INTERESTING STUFF: the problem is, too many writers focus on deep meanings and symbolism and themes instead of having an interesting, fun to read book. Personally, when I read a book (such as my favorite, The Wild Road, by Gabriel King) I read it because it is interesting, and it's a page-turner. I can't put it down. This book is the exact opposite.4) A lot of profanity, not enough INTERESTING STUFF: yes, there is quite a bit of profanity in this book. And a lot of fighting. I just skip the fight scenes altogether, skip Holden's conversations about ducks, all that filler. Cut all that stuff out and you'll only have about 10 pages of reading material. I'm not exaggerating.Anyway, that's about it. I'm sure I'll think of something else later. If you have to read this for your english class.. well..

He sees the world in a childish, cynical way more suited for a spoiled ten-year-old. He refers to everyone as phonies and bastards and uses a limited vocabulary to repeatedly rehash subjects that weren't interesting the first time around. I have nothing against J. D.

SalingerWhat exactly is The Catcher in the Rye? I suppose it's a not-quite-coming-of-age novel, an exploration in alienation, and a post-Freudian experiment. It's also a collection of ramblings from an unreliable narrator. But the digressive and repetitious nature of its language often reads like poetry, not prose; the cadence of the narrative has chips on both its shoulders.I've read some reviews referring to The Catcher in the Rye as \\"dated.\\" There's some truth to this. For example, today's teens may not be able to relate to a world populated by phone booths. I know when I read about Holden Caulfield wearing a shirt and tie, I think of some fantasy America before my parents were born. But the themes are not dated. Last I checked, teens still have hormones and are in a constant search for alcohol. They still have problems with girls/boys and with their own emotions. They often feel dark and do dark things. The props might be different, but the teen's world hasn't changed much in fifty-six years.Perhaps the most dated aspect of the book is its great writing. There isn't much edge and style to popular writing today. Harry Potter has taken over the minds of far too many kids, young adults, and adults. Yet if you were to compare the quality of the writing in The Catcher in the Rye to that of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you would find the latter laughable. At least, I hope you would.For me, the best aspect of The Catcher in the Rye is its sustained style. When I read it, I feel a master of language at work. When I read a contemporary bestseller, I am often entertained, but I'm rarely challenged. I consume these books and then discard them, never to look at them again. With The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger has done something unprecedented and fresh. He shows his readers that new writing is still possible, that writing is a craft to be honed and studied. When entertainment and craft come together as well as they do in The Catcher in the Rye, literature is born and reborn. That's what makes this book an indispensable classic and not a disposable piece of genre fiction."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many reviewers find this a coming of age book for adolescent males. I can see this point but I think this statement fails to indicate the multiple levels on which this amazing book plays. The book follows the journey of the confused and disillusioned 16 year old Holden Caulfield from his expulsion from prep school to his journey home. Along the way Holden meets a variety of characters which Holden discusses in his sarcastic worldly tone, which only serves to illustrate how innocent and confused Holden (and every adolescent)truly is. Through the eyes of Holden, who is caught between his childhood and manhood, J.D. Salinger captures the moment in an adolescent boy's life to which almost every boy or man can relate. But the purpose of this review is not to praise a book which has been praised up and down but to recommend a book which can capture a teenage boy's imagination and interest where other books may fail. Where as many \\"teen books\\" can be boring or deal with topics on a level which is to the say the least \\"boring\\" to an adolescent (and why not, they are written by adults), \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is not preachy, stilted or artificial but hits its mark by conveying thoughts that any teenage boy will recognize and may be surprised to find that he is not alone in these thoughts. How J.D. Salinger reached back in time to pull this off is amazing. One word of warning. The book has racy parts but this does not affect this recommendation. Trying to stimulate reading in a teenage boy? Skip the science fiction and fantasy and try some reality."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a high school junior who just finished this book for class. I can't say enough about it because, not to sound corny or anything, it made me re-evaluate my life.

Almost everything Holden goes through, depression, anxiety, fear of growing up...teenagers can completely relate to.

He is hyper-judgmental, finds phoniness everywhere, and exhibits in spades many of the same flaws he criticizes throughout. He is, in short, the quintessenial, timeless, 16-year old kid. An idealist, and a hypocrite--and, of course, hot to trot.Not a lot happens on the outside in this story, which usually frustrates me. But I finished the book a couple weeks ago, and I keep thinking about it--this kid, and his little sister. And I hope he hooked up with Jane."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I tried and tried not to but I can't help but like this book. Holden is a reprehensible jerk!

Holden's view of the world is somewhat accurate. Phonies suck. But such is life.To the young people reading this book for the first time: hold on to your copy and re read it about every five years. The meaning will change and only then will you understand what I mean.Short of running away and living in a cave in Montana alone but for your own ass (er, donkey I should say), choosing your most important battles will get you a lot farther in life than trying to fight them all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was at the core of my teenage years.

I am 15 years old and all I got out of this book is no wonder adults hate teenagers. The narrator, Holden Caulfield, complains throughout the story. Basically he is an umotivated rich kid obsessed with sex. Maybe I am an exception to the whole teenage thing, but I really could not relate to his view on the world.

I, too, had not read this book until my 20s. And I, too, had thought I was missing something. But I echo your comments that this book was not great nor was it bad. It was just ho-hum. After I finished the book I wasn't enlightened, happy, sad, or anything on the spectrum of emotions that lie on either side of average. I probably yawned and said, \\"well, done with that one.\\"Holden is one of those characters who represent people that I have never particularly cared for in life. In fact, people like him annoy me something fierce. But, as these reviews and history shows, there are a great number of people who can relate and who love this book. I only give it two stars, because it was just an average book for me.

Will pass on."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you really want to hear about it, when I told my story over fifty years ago, I thought it'd be just a bunch of phony people who read it on a bus or something and then it'd be thrown in the garbage and that'd be it. But, for some goddam reason, everyone wants to keep hearing my story, and it's corny as hell, really. They all read this book with pies in their eyes and try to figure out the darndest things, like what it means when I ask the cab driver about where the ducks in the pond go in the winter. Did it ever occur to anyone that I may just care a whole hell of a lot about ducks?When I was thrown out of Pencey before that Thanksgiving, my life was all but over. Sure, I knew that Stradlater and all the others would have swell jobs down on Park Avenue someday, but at that time, I sure as hell wouldn't. So, except for scoring with Sally Hayes or some guy's little sister or something, it was all just downhill from there and I just wanted to get home and see Phoebe and ride the carousel. End of analysis.Why my story is still discussed in colleges and prep schools is something I can't explain. It kills me. I'd have two hemorrhages if I'd known that those lousy few days in my life would still be talked about now that I'm your grandfather's age.I'm here to tell you--yes, Holden, yours truly--that I grew up and moved on and you really ought to be hearing about the rest of my dismal life, which is rather downhill, to tell you the truth. I could go on about the phony run-ins I've had with the kids from my past. But, you know, now that they're ancient, with gray hair and all, I don't feel like discussing them. I really don't.I hate it when I knew someone long ago and their face is like an old photograph in my mind and then they show up for real and they look all gray and old and nearly dead or something. It kills me, it really does. But, the funny part is that each person, deep inside, is still the same. They're just in a wrinkled body, is all. Take Ackerly, for instance. I saw old Acklerly ice skating at the park last winter, and he came over to talk and he still sits too close to me on the bench, and all he talked about was getting out of his wet clothes and taking a goddam shower. See, things stay the same.So, enjoy this old tale from my past, but know that I grew old, just like you. I wish I could tell you fancy stories, like my brother, old D.B., out in Hollywood, who gets to meet all the stars. He's got more stories than you can shake a stick at, old D.B. does.But me, I'm just sitting here alone on the edge of some crazy cliff, watching ducks flying overhead and thinking. I can still see myself in the glass eye of that carousel horse in Central Park. The horse has fresh white paint, and in the reflection, I look the way I remember myself. Even now.

Why? It certainly is not because I was forced to read this for school - I actually read this book of my own volition because I'd been hearing about what a classic it was, and I am an avid reader. So I pick it up and started reading it.I freaking hated Holden Caulfield. Now, I have read the other reviews on here (five-star) and dissertations on the deep meanings within the book and etc etc, so I listened with an open ear and mind on why people liked this book, and I respect that. I am not trashing anyone who liked this book, everyone has different tastes. But that doesn't cause me to hate Holden any less. I found his character utterly shallow and his adventures pointless especially since he got himself booted out of a private school, and this book a waste of paper, and that's how I feel about it.If you found this book to be awesome and learned something from it, then I'm happy for you, and I'm also glad that others could at least get something out of this book even if I didn't."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is a classic, and it is not hard to see why so many people have enjoyed it. Following a very short period in the life of Holden Caulfield, an adolescent full of teenage angst, in the process of dropping out from society - this book is poignant, well written and really gets into the mind of the protaganist.This is an authentic voice doing something for the first time that has now been much repeated. It deserves its classic status because of what it does. It speaks of that teenage angst at a time when teenagers were just being \\"invented\\". It speaks into a changing culture, and it has been much studied and much copied in the following years.But whilst recognising this was a seminal work, and one that thoroughly deserves its fame, I have to confess that as a reader I was less than fully engrossed in it.Holden Caulfield is a wonderful protaganist because he is so human. He is dropping out but he is not a nasty character. His love for his sister in particular was a powerful antidote to a kind of dark nihilism that might otherwise threaten the work.Nevertheless I did not really enjoy reading about this snippet of his life. There was no grand story here - the book is really all about the character and viewpoint. Many people will love that, but for me it did not click. That is perhaps a reflection on my own tastes though, rather than this work.So whilst I will score this at between 3 and 4 stars, your mileage may vary. It is one of those books that the reader will probably enjoy more, the more they have to bring to it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's funny how people are always making a fuss over nothing, and trying to take away certain rights, such as the right to free speech, or the freedom to read! Then you see the stuff they complain about and it never makes any sense. I can see why some people had such a problem with this book, the main character using g.d. like a comma more than a word lol. He smokes, drinks, he drops out of school, he's an atheist, he even buys a prostitute, he's the poster child for \\"evil\\" lol. But the thing is, I can think of 1000 books more offensive than this one. (how about the most violent, racist, sexist book of all time, the Old Testament) Everybody should have to right to write about whatever they want, and people should be able to read whatever they want. But so many people out there are \\"phonies.\\" I think these days if you find your kids reading a novel, you should be happy, end of story.Anyways, now that I got that off my chest, on to the review...Catcher in the Rye is a fiction novel by JD Salinger written in 1951 but takes place in 1949. The story revolves around Holden Caulfield, a teenager who has just been kicked out of a fancy prep school called Pencey because he flunked all his classes save English. He talks about his indifference of being expelled because he doesn't much care for school and he felt as if all the people there are \\"phonies\\" and he even has a physical altercation with one of them.He then decides to leave and not go home to his parents but instead hang out in New York for 3 days living like an \\"adult\\", smoking, drinking, staying out late, hanging out in bars, even buying a prostitute. Throughout the book, he is just trying to find someone to talk to that he can connect with, but he never seems to manage to do so. Holden even seems a bit crazy at times, he'll feel so strongly about someone or something for a moment and then the next moment he hates that person or thing.After all the living he does in New York he decides to head home and sneak in the house, not to see his parents, but his sister Phoebe, who he's crazy about. Phoebe is pleased to see him, but gets angry with him when she realizes he was flunked out of Pencey. She tells him it's because he doesn't have any ambition and doesn't like anything and doesn't want to do anything with his life. Holden disagrees, and after thinking it through says there is something he wants to do with his life, he has this strange fantasy to be standing at the edge of a cliff watching a group of children playing a game on a field of rye grass, and every time a child gets too close and is about to fall off the cliff, Holden would catch them and save them from falling. He wants to be the catcher in the rye.After he sees Phoebe, he leaves and heads to an old English teacher of his, Mr. Antonili. Once there, Mr. Antonili gives him a place to stay for the night and gives him a lecture on life. He tells him that the mark of the mature man is to live humbly for a cause, while the mark of an immature man is to die nobly for one, which is in contrast with Holden's idea of being the \\"catcher in the rye.\\" After the lecture Holden goes to sleep but wakes up to find Mr. Antonili rubbing his head, which Holden perceives as a sexual advance and he rushes out the door to sleep in Grand Central Station for a few hours.Holden then decides he will hitchhike out West and get a job as a gas station attendant and live in a cabin right by the woods. Before he tries to leave he heads to Phoebe's school so he can wish her goodbye. He gives the secretary a note to give to Phoebe telling her he's leaving and to meet him at the museum so he can say goodbye. But when she shows up, she's carrying a suitcase and says she's going with him. When he tells her no and to shut up, she starts to cry, depressing Holden. Holden then says he changed his mind and he's going to stay and they should go to the zoo together. He begins walking to the zoo and Phoebe walks along opposite side of the street, following him but trying to avoid him. After the zoo Holden takes Phoebe to the carousel, while he watches her ride it, he realizes that he cannot be the \\"catcher in the rye,\\" that he needs help himself. So at the end of the novel we are talking to him in the future, he is in a some sort of hospital getting better, and is seeing a psychoanalyst, and even says he will be going to a new school soon. When asked if Holden will actually apply himself this time, Holden says, \\"How can you know you're going to do something until you do it\\" he says he will try to do better. He ends with saying he misses his all the people that are mentioned in this book, both the good and the bad.What amazed me the most about this book, besides the fact that it was banned, was how well the author told the story. I mean, if you think about it, nothing all that special even happened in this book. If someone just came up and started telling me the plot and events of this story, I would say, \\"Sounds boring\\" and move on, and this book would have been boring, if it weren't for the fact that Holden is such a good story-teller. The character development is amazing in this book, maybe the best I've seen in any book. The storytelling is what made this book, otherwise it would have flopped, a movie would not have nearly the same effect on me as the book did because as I said, nothing really all that interesting even happened to Holden. Ironically they have made a movie for this book which I have not watched yet, maybe I'll review that next but I doubt it's any good. Also, what's even more ironic, the fact that they made a movie when the main character, Holden, hated movies and actors and the like. Seems like an injustice to this book to make a movie, if you ask me.So, in conclusion, i really enjoyed this book, but I must say it left me asking for more. He kept speaking of Jane but never actually talks to her, we never even meet her, I was waiting the whole novel for that. You never get to hear from his parents, how did they take all that had happened? and what happened, did Holden stay in school, I mean so many things are left unexplained and I hate that, if you're going to invest our time in a set of characters then finish the story, that's the reason for the 4 stars, I can't get past that I'm sorry.But all in all, a great book, I'd recommend it to anyone. Heck, even kids, better they read a novel like this than listen to rap cds and play violent video games and just rot their brain cells away. I mean, at least they'd be reading...lighten up people!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is still the only book given to me as an assignment that I ever finished and it became one of my favourite books.I've read some reviews here, and while some people dislike the writing style, a lot of negative comments are because the reviewer doesn't like the main character, Holden Caulfield. Just as I titled this review, I don't like him either. He's self-righteous and \\"modestly\\" narcissistic and he is at times, incredibly immature. But he is a truly flawed character and he does have a sense of innocence below the faade. Holden talks a lot--he talks up a big game about himself and the things he did during the time after he was kicked out of prep school. But, what I love, is that underneath all the talk is a very obvious tone of \\"I want someone to like me.\\" He is a sheep wearing the ill-fitting skin of a lion. That comes out strongly in the end as well when he describes the famous namesake of being the catcher in the rye.The way in which this story was written exudes that lost, but achingly lonely undertone. The language tries to be intelligent, but is sprinkled with frustrated swearing and reiteration. The narrator sometimes gets off topic because he's obviously trying to talk a story up from what it really is. He doesn't really succeed, either.This book, as I read it, is a look in to a personality. A very detailed look. I think it is in that way what Salinger referred to as \\"autobiographical.\\" The plot of this book is to try and understand who Holden Caulfield is and how he is the epitome of everything he hates.I don't think it is about his \\"refusal to grow up,\\" but instead about his cautious fear of growing up. He very obviously wants to as we can see when he actually says something profound or worldly. But it's quickly glazed over with a \\"you know\\" or \\"I don't know\\" statement.So, no, Holden is not a hero. He is not something to look up to and he never claims to be. He is, instead, a real person. And there are a lot of people out there like him. I am a little astonished that so many people expected him to be a hero, that, after reading the book, said \\"I can't imagine who would look up to Holden Caulfield.\\" No one should. This book in so wonderful because it is not a harrowing tale or a story of a fictional event that could only happen once. It's not a story about someone who survives a horrific torture or gains a superpower. Nor is it about a good Samaritan who gets theirs in the end. There is not an evil force or an antagonist, and I'd venture to say there isn't truly a protagonist, either, because the second-person narration leads to some biases in that area. It is just a story. A story of a boy to whom a lot of people can connect with personally or because they know someone like him. It's a study of a certain type of humanity, I think. It's universal and crosses the time barrier, as well. The slang may be different, but these feelings and traits still exist today.Perhaps what I like the most is that it ends just the way a real story would...with life going on."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In homage to Holden Caulfield, I will try my best to avoid being phony, for I so know how much he hates it, and his hatred of people who put on fronts.I read Catcher in the Rye several years ago, early in my literary career. At that time, I had little experience in reading deeper than the plot. To my younger self, the book was boring and pointless, a journey around town with no mission. Its only saving graces were the alcohol and sex references that peppered the story. That memory is long ago forgotten.When the report was assigned, I was in trouble, for early American literature fails to excite me. Thankfully, a wonderful book was pointed my way, and J. D. Salinger opened my mind.I read The Catcher in the Rye once again, and this time, it was more than a boring journey. It was a Homeric journey through New York City. As I read, I personally noticed some odd parallels to Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. In my mind, Salinger kicked Jim off the raft, and dropped the raft into the middle of a swinging New York.After further research, I realized that I wasn't the first person to notice this fact. In fact, the compilations of essays in the library were riddled with comparisons. This makes it hard to narrow your wide array of possible sources into a scant three.Well, it appears that my phoniness detector is raging at full-blast, so I will finish the bull and answer the question I posed myself when reading The Catcher in the Rye.IS HOLDEN CAULFIELD THE MODERN DAY HUCKLEBERRY FINN?As I have stated, there are many similarities between the characters of Huck and Holden. In fact there are so many, I can't even begin to think where to start. With that in mind, I will draw a random card from the pile, and let my thoughts flow from there.The First and most striking similarity that is shared by both Holden and Huck is their use of language. As Carpenter noted, like Huck Finn, The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in the first person, by a boy who is badly \\"mixed up\\". One can notice the use of uneducated vernacular in both novels. (Holden) has a colloquialism as marked as Huck's. The language is different, but Huck's dialect stands out on the river as much as Holden's vulgar language stands out on the streets of New York.Another similarity that has been noticed is that \\"the quality that makes Huck Finn and Holden Caulfield brothers...is a common hatred of hypocrisy and a search for integrity.\\" In fact the wanders of both characters were filled with, more than anything, a search for the truth. Holden so desperately wished to get away from the phonies, the perverts, and the like. What he searched for was an inner truth, an answer to the inner monsters that plagued him. While Holden traveled twisted paths in his mind Huck's journey was more physical. He looked redemption in his family, peace in the south, and an end to the hypocrisy that is slavery for Jim.Both shared journeys. The journey to manhood just happened to be a part of it. For the heck of it, let's use a quote! \\"The journey...from holy innocence to such knowledge that the world offers\\". Even though the respective adventures were of far different lengths of time, the effects on the characters were similar. At the end of the novels, we see characters that want to get away.\\"In the end, Huck plans to \\"light out for the territory\\", and Holden has thoughts of fleeing west\\".You see \\"These heroes desperately seek truth\\", and in the end it scared them. The eternal truth is that life is not as beautiful as they want you to believe.It's not to say that Holden and Huck were carbon copies. They had their differences, but that is to be expected of two boys from different times, different places. \\"Where Huck lived in the rich heartland of America, Holden is the product of an exclusive New York City\\". Huck had outlets for his energy, be it Jim, or the commotion they caused on the banks of the mighty river. \\"(Holden) has objects for his contempt, but no objects other than his sister for his love-no raft, no river, no Jim, no Tom\\". Holden was alone, even when surrounded with people. Huck always had a friend close.Holden thought he had some friends, but they flirted with other boys. Even worse, some of them flirted with him. In the end, Holden feels alone, and unloved. Huck, on the other hand, always has trusted friends close at hand. It is Tom or Jim, but there is always someone for Huck to lean on. Friends are what make the man.IS HOLDEN CAULFIELD THE MODERN DAY HUCKLEBERRY FINN?To tell the truth, I had already made my mind up about the answer to my question before I even cracked abook. Yes, Salinger skillfully recreated Huck, and placed him in the middle of New York City. If this was the idea, I don not know, but the product is unmistakable. Sure, there are differences, but my theory is that Salinger changed some details to avoid a plagiary rap, but that is another paper altogether."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a very interesting novel, filled with highs and lows though the eyes of Holden Cauldfield. I thought it was interesting, I also didn't think it was very interesting. This book spanned though a series of about 3 days, and a very meaningless three days if you ask me.The book starts off at Holden's school Pencey Prep., he spends half of his day there explaining to the reader why he hates his life. This starts the book off on a bad foot, it made me feel that he might be a large complainer and possibly get on my nerves. Holden gets kicked out of his school because of his bad grades. He leaves school a couple days early and plans on staying in New York City for the night. His goal is to go get some drinks and find a girl.The book explains his adventures while in the city and his attempts to complete his goal for the night. I personally thought that this really had no point and did not interest me at all. I feel it could be interesting if you stretched the book out to more then a couple days. The book went very fast with a lot of events making the book hard to keep up with and easy to put down.Over all I felt that the ending of the book was the best part. And if your into a quick, meaningless novel, I would recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of my colleague has this dark side gravity about him. We occasionally have a conversation about the litarary works around us. He often surprised me with this dark taste. He introduced me to 'Gloomy Sunday' - a deeply surrealistic yet captivating dark poem. Then oneday he told me the book \\"The Catcher in the rye\\" by one JD Salinger. I was sceptical but the deep and dark anxiety in him made me feel want to read the book just to understand what kind of book was this.I read it on the way to Colombo. Finished in the hotel. I was surprised by the flow of the story. This story had been something of a learning experience, although of the darker side of human being. Well written, deeply realistic and too darkly lit through out - as often it is the case in the times of an adolescent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book, by Salinger, was amazing. The main character Holden tells his story of growing up in the world at the young age of sixteen. Holden is immersed in the pains of growing up, and fed up with all the \\"phonies\\" of the world. When kicked out of Pency Prep School, Holden spends a couple nights in New York. There he is surrounded by the pointless ideas of society, which everyone seems to believe and go right along with. Holden does not hold his feelings about this \\"phoniness\\" back at all. Some may see his comments as crude, but it is just how he feels. Our world today is so full of phony people and ideas that it is extremely difficult to no what is really true and right. It is important to not get caught up in these things and instead seek out the truth. This story was so good because of the themes' relevance to today's culture."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Is Holden Caulfield a freak or a geek? How would he rate in today's world? Is he mad, or just a prisoner in a mad world? Will he adjust, or fall into that chasm Mr. Antolini warns about?You can ask yourself a thousand questions about the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's lone novel, one of the most controversial and popular ever written in the United States. Critics may debate its merits, but \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" continues to reach readers young and old more than a half-century after its first publication. Like \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" it's one American classic that has lost nothing in the way of accessibility for all the time that's gone by.The secret is Caulfield, who pulls you in with his outsider status and sharp observational humor (\\"Sensitive...That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat.\\") He's a rebel, quick to spot \\"phonies,\\" but not at all belligerent and more than a trifle naive. You can look up to him and pity him simultaneously.The division of sentiment about the book evident as you go down the page is pretty reflective of how critics have viewed the book since it first came out. Yes, it was a selection of The Book of the Month Club (or as Holden calls it at one point in the text, \\"the goddam Book of the Month Club\\"), and praised in The New York Times, but it also attracted some snarky digs from the get-go that's only accumulated over the years, about it being a narcissistic book with a limited leading character and a thin plot. Others call it the ultimate zen masterpiece. This only proves its staying power. If people started agreeing on \\"Catcher,\\" it would be in danger of getting boring.Maybe the most sticky criticism is that Salinger the anti-intellectual is championing Caulfield's know-nothing posture, his desire to fight his own maturation and be unchanged by pending adulthood. Clearly Holden has this problem; he idealizes younger children to a fault and can't so much as bear the notion of revisiting a museum and facing the prospect of his having changed just a little bit in the interval between visits. Salinger writes about this affectionately and with comic understanding, but not in agreement. His voice seems echoed by Mr. Antolini's, who warns Holden of the danger of looking for something \\"their own environment couldn't supply them with\\" to the point where they abandon hope of becoming anything at all.Of course, then Mr. Antolini puts the moves on Holden, chasing him away and putting him at odds with yet another adult. Holden distrusts, but he doesn't dislike, and that may be his saving grace, the fact he can love more easily than he can hate.There are no easy answers here, just great questions, the kind many of us grow up asking ourselves without quite being able to articulate, at least not until we read this book. Holden's last words to us can be taken as either prayer or warning: \\"Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a must read for any young teen. It tells the story of Holden Caulfield and a few adventuresome days in New York City following his expulsion from his school Pencey. Holden represents most teens today, pessamistic and a little insecure, but deep down inside Holden shows he has a heart as he expresses his love and care towards his sister Phoebe. This is a great read and leaves the reader only wishing that Salinger had published more of his works."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently read The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. I did not like this book at all. It should die. Slowly. I can see the significance of it, but it seems that Salinger has a swearing problem. I'm not sure but this book may have more swear words in it that Mark Twain's Huck Finn and n-words. All of the swearing is funny at first, but after a few, um paragraphs, it gets too annoying. I have two words for Mr. Salinger: Paperback version, page 201, second paragraph. It is what was written on the wall."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that this book was an interesting novel. The context of the book is very conversational. I liked it because the Austhor let you look deep into the charachter to see what he was actually thinking. The reason why I rate this book a 3 instead of a $ or 5 is because of the plot. The plot is very slow movin and was difficult for me to stay with it. One third of each chapter is rambling about irrrelevant topics that arise is the narrators head. OTher than that, The style, perspective and thoughts of the author helped persuade me to rate this book a 3 Star."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First off, if somehow you haven't heard of this book before (you live in a cave or something), disregard any review that gives it 1/5 and says it has no point. This is obviously a review from a high schooler who hates the point of the novel (because it makes them see their own flaws). I read this book in high school and it was the best and most eye opening reading experience of my life. If you're a high schooler reading it for the first time I hope that you have someone to discuss it with so you don't miss the entire point of the novel like the 1/5-ers did.Anyway, get this book. It is incredible."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Overrated but still good nonetheless, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a book that wisely depicts teen angst and cynical adolescence. Holden Caulfield is a confused, scared and curious sixteen-year old which doesn\`t quite know how to interact. Holden avoids phonies like the plague and doesn\`t want to become one of them, so he ends up going from school to school without a proper plan for his future. Ok, so the story is far from spectacular, yet J.D. Salinger manages to create an interesting and realistic protagonist who offers some intriguing and witty observations about people and their behaviour. Salinger suceeds at portraying an immature, childish and spoiled kid that has trouble growing up. Both funny and sad, this book is not a masterpiece but it\`s an engaging and worthwile enough read. I expected better, if you want to know the truth, since the plot goes nowhere and the ending is a bit disappointing. Still, I really kind of liked the book, I really did. Holden was an amusing character, you could tell (especially his scenes with his little sister Phoebe). All in all, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a quick and appealing read that entertains while it offers some food for thought as well. I\`ve seen better, but also much worse.Catch it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was like some kind of addicting candy, I could not put it down it was just amazing!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book for the second time now (The first time in German and the second time in English; the original version is much better.), and I must say that it's great. The book is written so cool and easy-to-read. And although the book is nearly 50 years old it still fits for today. It acts about a boy called Holden Caulfield who gets expelled from Pencey. He goes to New York city instead of going home, and lives there alone for a few days. While you are reading the book you become Holden Caulfield. When he thinks about whether he is &quot;yellow&quot; or not, you feel as if you were Holden yourself. And finally the book is worth reading because of Holden's character. He is such an interesting and loveable person. All in all I have to say that you must read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must admit that this book was very disappointing because I expected a masterpiece and found simply a good book. I agree with the teen reviewers (no, I'm not one) who wrote that those who extol this book seem to have forgotten what it felt like to be a teenager. Incidentally, why was the main character so angry? After all, he was a rich, spoiled brat who had led an opulent life. Because he wasn't as intelligent and talented as his siblings? Oh, come on, what a whiner."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I expected at least a little more than a kid's three day spree in New York. Why do so many schools have students read this? It seems nothing more than a tale of very emotionally disturbed adolescent, and a perverted one at that. There must be about a dozen psychological terms to describe this kid, none of which are typical of the common teenager. It's books like this that give teenagers such a bad name, especially when they don't deserve it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that J.D. Salinger was just trying to develop a &quot;shocker&quot; with this novel, and all I got from it was over abused language and poor writing. I understand that Salinger was portraying a &quot;madman's&quot; point of view yet I feel he could have made the character a little less repetitive and more intelligent"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"for what ive herd this book sounds great and i love it the chartecters are so alive and i have read this book a million times and i am willing to read it again"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THIS IS AN AMAZING AND INTERESTING BOOK, IN EACH WORD, IN EACH SENTENCE, THE AUTOR WROTE SOMETHING BETWEEN LINES THAT MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND, HOLDEN'S FEELINGS, HE ALSO WANTED TO SHOW, HOW THE LIFE IS, AND THAT IF YOU DON'T FIGHT FOR IT, YOU WILL STAY ALONE FOR EVER."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a 24 year old writer and a very big fan of all of Salinger's writings. I have read many of the comments on this page, and although I am glad to see so many 5 stars, I must say I am quite disappointed in some of the book's reviewers. Simply put, no, not everyone could relate to Holden, and it is not a necessity that one should even like him, but this cannot be ignored: Salinger has created a timeless work of art that very few artists ever achieve in their lives. Salinger has accomplished a very rare feat - he has, unwillingly, become the spokesperson for a generation. When one looks back, how many artists, whether writers, musicians, or painters have accomplished this feat? These &quot;special&quot; artists come along perhaps once every decade or so. In the 90's, this &quot;special&quot; artist has probably been Kurt Cobain - and no one else. That is how rare these accomplishments come about, and so whether you like it or not, Salinger's The Catcher must be treated ! in this regard."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While I understand why Catcher in the Rye is a classic, I would have never given it that honor myself. It is certianly no mystery as to why many serial killers have enjoyed this book. Its protagonist is utterly discusted with life, and stays that way throughout the entire book. These feelings of utter disdain are exactly how I would imagine a killer's being. While this may reinforce the attitudes of the criminally insane, it comes over as sickeningly pessisimistic to me. Another problem is the utterly low level of writing quality. He uses the same phrases over and over again until it becomes frustrating. I never want to hear the phrases &quot;Phony&quot; or &quot;Goddamn&quot; again! Even moreso, I don't want to hear &quot;It really is.&quot; or &quot;I really am.&quot; once more, or I'll scream. I'm also suprised at the extreme amount of profanity. Sure, it's mild by today's standards (although the F-word is used a couple of times). But by the st! andards of the ninteen fifties, I'm sure it was extraordinarily shocking, and was probably one of the primary reasons that it was banned in many places. In the end, though, despite the juvenile writing and feeling of utter depression that it evokes, it still is quite thought provoking, and is worth a read (it's only about two hundred pages, so you should be able to finish it in a day or so). It's good, but hardly classic material."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is depressing, yet never seemed to lose my attention. The author uses interesting language that keeps the reader going. The stories of Houlden's life made me feel like I actually knew him....and near the end of the book I was worried about him. This book is well worth reading!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for English this past year. When the book was handed out, I thought...&quot;Great, another boring book.&quot; I was TOTALLY wrong. I loved it. I found that teenagers today can relate to Holden because of the STUDID things that teenagers do. I think that a lot of teenagers can relate to it because of the mass problems that we as teenagers have to go through..smoking, sex, meeting people, school, and parents"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In 1949, while &quot;recovering&quot; in a California sanitorium, 17-year-old Holden relates events that occurred during three December days in 1948 -when he was sixteen. He had just been expelled from boarding school and decided to 'take a vacation' in New York before returning to his parents' inevitable wrath. Told as a monologue, the book describes Holden's thoughts and activities over these few days, during which he describes a developing nervous breakdown, depression, and odd, erratic behaviour, prior to his eventual nervous collapse.Holden begins by saying that his account will not give any moral message. He will not tell about his &quot;lousy&quot; childhood and &quot;all that David Copperfield kind of crap&quot; because such details bore him. This is the kind of 'in the face' honesty that most readers of this book have identified with.The book is a perceptive study of one individual's understanding of his human condition. The book, which came out in 1951, still has a universal appeal to it. It describes the angst, alienation that a 'cynical adolescent' faces. This turns him into a rebel who hates people, judges people and often runs away.The book was banned in America after its publication, which added to its mystique and appeal. The book was considered 'obscene', 'filthy and profane', 'immoral' and has often upset people due to its rebellious views. John Lennon's assassin Mark Chapman asked Lennon to sign a copy of the book earlier in the morning of the day that he murdered Lennon. This gave the book even more notoriety."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To see anyone relate their experience reading this book as one that evoked jealousy of an illiterate is truly sad. This is, in my opinion the best book that has ever, and ever will be written. Anyone who cannot see the bittersweet irony and melancholy Salinger shares with the reader in this masterpiece of literature exposes their incapacity for depth of thought and feeling."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The novel begins with Holden, a boy in his late teens who has experienced a life with many mishaps and unjust occurrences. Pencey was the school he attended most recently, being one of many schools he had dropped out of during the past few years. He left school, ventured out on his own in the busy, chaotic city of New York. There, he met up with many acquaintances, experienced the truth in his life, and learned lessons to help improve his future. He faces the decision of what he is to do with his life, and ends up making a predictable pick.There were many educational, enjoyable scenes in this novel. One that kept me on my toes was when Holden was first beat up by his dorm mate, Stradlater. It was suspenseful, and the way he handled the situation helped reveal his personality. Another exciting part was when Holden met up with a fellow student's mother on a trolley. He told many lies to her, and ended up regretting it after he found out she was a genuine, generous woman, much unlike her own son. When the prostitute arrived at Holden's hotel room, something rotten was bound to happen. The description of this chapter kept me reading. I enjoyed reading about the way Holden described his everyday surroundings, and what he liked, disliked, which was obvious, because he was such an open character. There were many aspects that vexed me, because he was repetitive with his attitude. He seemed to despise nearly everything, all of the time. Even cheap luggage would make an impact on his judgment of a person, and he had many other prejudices along with that. At times, the writing style seemed dull and boring because he irritated the reader with meaningless remarks. Many topics that were discussed seemed quite pointless, and Holden lacked alot of common sense as a character.I would recommend this novel to readers 14 years and older. Some material is inappropriate for younger people. The book is easy to get into, and mostly keeps you interested. The main characters are complicated and easy to both adore and abhor. The book taught me a lot about life alone through the eyes of a teenager. Because of his peer pressure, he had to make many decisions that hurt him and hurt people he loved. The novel expressed bravery and a boy able to forgo his past and attempt to start a new life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the ultimate outsider's book. It follows the adventures of Holden Caulfield. At the beginning of the book, Holden has just been expelled from his elite prep school. In fact, this has been the third prep school he has flunked out of. Holden's problem is that he is hypersensitive to the faults of others and he easily recognizes the hypocracy in the world. He's always spotting out phonies and the irritating habits of others. He goes into the city and falls into a depression and nearly loses his sanity.This is a very powerful book. If you have serious problems with depression, I would recommend avoiding this. It won't be very good for your mental health. However, if you are well-adjusted, this is an excellent book. You can really delve into the mind of someone who is really losing their touch with society. I'm sure that everyone has a little bit of Holden Caulfield in them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an amazing book. I first read the book for a very silly reason, my favorite band (Green Day) wrote a song about Holden Caulfield so I decided if it was their favorite book, I had to give it a shot. A lot of my friends were also reading in in school so I figured it was worth a shot. I bought the book, not having a single clue what it was about. I was expecting some stupid book about life on a farm or something. It was so much better than I expected. I completely related to the feeling of just not fitting in anywhere, and not being sure of who you are. I completely fell in love with Holden Caulfied! For anyone who is thinking of reading this book, I say read it! You'll be sorry if you don't. There is quite a bit of strong language and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone uncomfortable with &quot;bad words&quot;. But read it!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books. The first time I read this book I was 13 years old, I wasn't very interested in reading books, but a friend of my family said that this book I would like. And he was right. The way that the narrator (the main character in the history) tells the history don't let you get bored when you read it, because it tries to be similar to the talk of teenagers. Something that I noticed was the parallel between Holden and my own life. I really recommend this book. After I read it I realized that I should think more about my acts and my life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book at ninteen and hated it for the first few chapters, but thankfully it was required reading so I was obliged to continue and thus it developed into one of the most meaningful books for me to date - years later it still holds a place of honor in my mind's anthology of great literature.I did not find that I related that much to Holden personally, but his general ideas, insecurities, and his desire to feel as if he has a place where he can belong and feel loved (hence the inclusion of the crucial character Jane, who is never actually in the story) are characteristics that not only teens but adults can relate to. In a way, it is a comfort to me becuase it serves to remind me of what it was like being a teenager and how throughout that poetentially difficult period in life we are not as alone in our feelings of confusion and desire to feel some peace as we may think we are. While I would not call this a &quot;feel good&quot; book by any means, the vulnerability that comes through in Holden's inner monologues is touching and heartfelt in it's truth. I love this book and think that it has something to offer everyone, no matter what age you may be upon first reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not do anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him.Overall though I thought it to be a disappointment... I'm glad I only paid $7 dollars for it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first read \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" the one thing I noticed was the parallel between Holden and my own life. I live in Los Angeles, land of many \\"phonies\\"--the same type that Holden appeared to be criticizing. Holden wants to be a genuine human being, one who can actually be himself. Instead of playing a role in life, Holden wants to live life. It is quite unfortunate that the life Holden wants to lead is not really achievable. We all have roles to play, whether we want to play them or not. Witness the scene where Holden calls up a prostitute -- and, in Holden's character, he does not play the role he's supposed to lead -- where he enganges in sexual behavior with her.Instead, Holden wants to learn about the prostitute. He cares for her. He wants to talk to her. Discuss things. Isn't that strange? Totally out of character. It is not what one would expect. That's Holden.Perhaps one of the biggest problem, though, is that people who do not want to be a \\"phony\\" -- those who would prefer to, in Thoreau's words, \\"march to their own drummer,\\" have a difficult time. Holden doesn't have many friends. He seems like a drifter. Doesn't really do well in school.Is this a lesson to be learned? Are the bums on the street former Holden's, unable to adjust to reality, drifting to find their authenticity somewhere in the world? It is certainly possible.On the prose: The prose is wonderful. Very readable, as many have mentioned. It's always very inexpensive and I recommend that everyone should have one copy in their book shelf.-- Michael Gordon, from Los Angeles."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book because of its brutal honesty and its irony. The main character Holden Caulfield is the extreme of most people, he thinks like the majority. It is ironic because Holden is everything he hates and everything he complains about. Some people may not like the book because it is so brutally honest and sadly a lot of people think like him. People are always judging and act the way they don't like others to act. Overall it is a book of bluntness and hypocritcal acts. I read this book on my own free time and not as a school assignment and I am glad I did. This book is for people who have a deeper sense of humor and not the generic kind. By all the irony and everyday situations it eventually drives Holden insane. Anyone can find alittle bit of themselves in this character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In this charming story we meet a young boy who refuses to become a young man. He is faced with the struggles of life as he overcomes his fear of growing up. I recommend this book to any teen who has encountered reality and has no other option but to grow up, or to any adult with a nostalgic desire to look back on those difficult years."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield can really tap into many of the wacky thoughts we all must have had at one time or another. My only regret after reading this book, in one sitting mind you, is that I hadn't read it 8 years ago when I was 16 going through many similar and confusing trials in my own life. I can only imagine JD Salinger must have had quiet an experience during his adolescent years to be able to articulate them so well through the eyes of this character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book took me by surprise. I picked it up at the beach one day and couldn't put it down. Holden is such a disturbed, but loveable character. He purifies himself by analyzing people so well. He can not be fooled. There's nothing really special about the book, other than the fact that it is truly titilating and extremely interesting. You never know what he is going to do next and it keeps you reading. I've read it three times already!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Yes, this book is masterfully written and has all sorts of crazy metaphors and signals, but it's not a good story. I could explain to you the whole plot and it'd take me less than three sentences. If your looking for a book that you could pick apart word for word and spend a decade studying, then this is the one. If you're looking for a book to read and get a thrill or some knowledge out of, then I'd reconsider this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book The Catcher in the Rye J.D. Salinger was very well written.The book is told by Holden Caulfield when he is 17 years old. However the story took place when Holden was 16. The book is written in more of a conversational tone. It's as if you got together with an old friend sat down to something to drink and traded stories. He often goes off on tangents that don't really have anything to do with the story. lt's not as though he sat down and wrote the story. It's more like he is telling the story to a friend or is writing a journal. The main character Holden is really quite the hateful person. The story starts right after Holden getts kicked out of a prep school. Later on in the novel he talks about how he hates the school and how he hates the people at the school. The thing is though that he hates peoplenb for reasons like; they hate other people just because they have pimples and don't brush their teeth, or that they won't let someone in their room, or that they like to go to the movies and they look forward to it. So he really hates people because they hate other people or they like something that he doesn't. Holden hated movies and thought that the people that went to see them were crazy. He never gives a reason for this though. So he's kind of a hipocrit in a way. Almost all the things he says about people are bad. He's not possitive at all. Except for when he talks about his little sister Phoabe. His little sister is 10 years old, but according to what Holden says about her she must be pretty smart and mature for her age. He is often talking about her and the things he says are good. He always says stuff like he wished you could have seen her, or that you should have been there, or you would like her if you could meet her. Wich adds a lot to the more conversational tone of the book. But from the way he talks about her she sounds like a pretty cut kid. I think the only person that Holden cares about is Phoebe. He doesn't seem to even care about himself that much. He just goes through life hating people and whining whenever he gets the chance to. However I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone. The book up to the end is really pretty good, but the ending is really terrible. In my opinion the ending of a book is the most important part. The novel doesn't really have a plot. I have looked and I can't find one anywhere. So I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone. The book was OK but the end ruined it because it sucked."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book, The Catcher in the Rye, is one of the most moving books written by Salinger. Read it with an open mind and look for yourself in the book. I promise that you'll see the world in a new light."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book as a 14 year old sophomore in H.S. I loved it and could understand how a book could make me cry and laugh and examine my actions and reactions. I was afraid to reread it because I taught I might not be able to relate as much being older. Guess what. I was wrong. I recently reread it and appreciate it even more now. This book is a definate MUST read, I would encourage any and everybody to pick up a copy for themselves and their kids. No one should be allowed to graduate their sophomore year without reading it. I own several copies of the book by the various publishers who have been lucky enough to publish it over the years. There will never be anything written that can even compare. Salinger is a genius."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The best book that I have ever read. As a seventeen year old who read the book for the first time more than three years ago, I truly resent people who claim that this book could only appeal to whiny baby boomers. That comment is ludicrously narrow-minded. This book spoke to me like no other book ever had before or has had since. I felt as if it was written for me. It was a truly incredible read. Hands down the best book that I have ever read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Dear Prospective ReadersI am very glad that I had a chance to read this 'one of a kind' book through the process of my life. I am confident that you will appreciate it as much, if not more than I. Holdens thought, perspective, and view of his life and his ambition captured me. Not to mention that he is a perfect gentleman. Something that we all should be.Pick up this book, read it, pass it along."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When you pick up this novel, you've really got to give it a thorough read. Not just read it. But really sink your teeth into it. The whole way through it. Read it twice even. Holden Caulfield is a supremely intelligent teenager who can't deal with what knowing what he knows. He understands the world and that is what makes him so afraid. To understand Holden you have to pick something which you can relate to him. A connection. His philosophy is so simple but it it such a hard thing to accomplish. In everything he must 'catch' the children before they cross over to the phony side. He is so bitter because he knows the phony side and refuses to cross the LINE. His brother's death triggered something in him that he never realized. A hatred and a vow to never let another fall through the cracks. He dropped Allie symbolically. If you read it, like really read it, then you will understand me. Because it is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"So I haven't read this book in about 10 years. I just randomly decided that I want to start reading again to help add some imagery and metaphors into my song writing - believe me, reading does this. So literally 5 minutes ago, I did a google search for this book, and the first thing that pops up is that JD Salinger died yesterday, the article was created at right about the same time I was thinking of getting this book again. Fate? I dunno???"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book after being told by a friend that I was similar to the Holden Caulfield character of the book. At that time I was struggling in high school and my parents were mad at me about my poor grades. This was the perfect book to read at that time.The book is narrated by a young failing student in a boarding school who runs off, stays in a creepy hotel with a prostitution business, he gets drunk at a bar, roams the city, goes to a movie, and runs back to his parent's home. He has cool adventures and comments to the reader on his disenchantment with society. The book is a page turner. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone who was deemed intelligent by their parents but struggled in school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Such a popular,famous or infamous little book depending on your view.Salinger's masterpiece and highly guarded work.A contributing factor in John Lennons'murder maybe,maybe not.Also associated with the Reagan assassination attempt.Why is this I wonder?\\"The best book ever written in the English language\\" quoted the salesgirl as I purchased it for my daughter for her high school reading assignment.She said it with such conviction,I think both of us were stunned.I said nothing,just smiled,you know, that smile that conveys \\"yeah,I know what you mean\\",too embarrassed to admit,\\"no kidding,never read it myself\\".Well read it I did,finally.A book I should have read decades ago. It wasn't required reading in my high school but I think I know why after reading it.It was a fun,fast read and kinda cool following Holden around.Seeing his anguish and disdain for those around him and the institutions he is forced to live within.Highly troubled yes,but you get the sense that he'll be OK in the end.His period of adjustment from a youth to a young man can be seen in his attitude,his choices and his need to be different.Love pangs,sexual urges,smoking,drinking all the rights of passage are explored through Holdens'eyes.It is kind of a warped,more psychiatric version of Ferris Beuller only a fifties version with less phone use,no texting,E-mails, computer use or outside influence from rappers,TV or other idiotic distractions teenagers are bombarded with today.Just pure emotional dilemma which must be resolved from within. I must say I enjoyed it very much,could not put it down for long with each chapter an adventure.What will Holden do now?How is this kid going to handle this one?etc.The sweet portrait it paints is probably wasted on todays youth whom I fear just won't get it.As a reader in my late forties,I could.Rediscovering 'Catcher In The Rye' was refreshing and diversionary. Just enough to take me away and escape to Manhattan for a few days.To be the companion of Holden Caulfield was fun and it will be for you too.Written in a clear,wonderful style as if Holden was talking to me, it is easy to see why this was so popular in its day and hopefully will continue to be read for decades to come by those who love good literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A great read for any age, from 10th grade to adulthood. It really makes you remember or really helps you have a kind of camaraderie with Holden Caufield. It is a deceptive book that it only takes a glimpse of Holden's life over a few days in his life where a million memories of previous experiences adds up to where he is at 'today'. It is a book about finding oneself, about finding ones place and realizing that it isn't all about sticking to the norms and what society wants you to be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had heard about this book for years. What a wonderful story it was supposed to be. I thought it was just slightly above childishly written and so full of vulgar language, (and I'm not prudish)it was difficult to really get interested. About 2/3rds of the way through, I got sick of it and never finished it. The seller shipped the book \\"as agreed\\" Save your money!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, written in 1951, is about longing for the simple truths of childhood, but ultimately struggling to cope with the issues that force a soul to grow. The book is psychologically arduous, as Salinger boldly travels deep into the mind of his protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden's views regarding people are rather bitter and disparaging. Despite his loose-tongued narration, he recounts his many plights in New York City with a plaintive undertone. Though he dances with women, dates pretty girls, and drinks with old acquaintances, nothing eases his despair and loneliness. Likewise, nothing abolishes his thoughts that all those people are \\"phonies,\\" and it almost seems that the only thing keeping him around them is morbid fascination in their shallow behavior. As the novel progresses, however, Phoebe is introduced, and the reader witnesses something very important in Holden's character. Essentially, Phoebe still retains the innocence and simple wisdom Holden subconsciously misses. They are the qualities that leave all humans in the process of growing up. His meeting with Phoebe forces him to realize how he is straying from his true self. Holden realizes that while he's been deeming society fake, he's been trying to find his place within it, and meanwhile letting a vague, superficial version of himself rise to the surface.This novel does the meaningful job of revealing the truth behind all people. While the act of hiding one's true self can be seen as an act of self-defense against others, it is essentially harmful to the soul. What makes this book unique is that it encompasses important life revelations over a short period of time, and from point of view of a teenage boy. The language and suggestive material in the novel (such as Sunny the prostitute and Holden's drinking) deemed it provocative, to the point where the book was banned in many school curriculums. What the advocates of these book bans didn't realize was that the \\"offensive\\" elements of the story (Holden's swearing, for instance) are necessary to show the vivid personality of Holden. In a wider sense, these elements are critical components that create striking realism in the novel. This level of brutal realism could not be achieved otherwise, for in real life, certain things trouble certain people, and if the author was working to portray real life, why should Holden's universe be an exception? The Catcher in the Rye is a very thought-provoking novel when the offensive aspects can be appreciated for the relevancy they have in Holden's story. As well, this can help a reader to understand Holden, and thus make his situations, thoughts, and the timeless themes surrounding them more relatable and real. Take the time to discover Holden's truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I decided to read this book because it caught my eye and I heard about it from a few friends. I also heard nothing but good things about this book. From the way it sounded I knew it would interest me. It was about a boy just about my age too and it sounded entertaining and not too hard to read.In this book, Holden Caulfield is a sixteen year old boy that gets himself into a lot of trouble. He eventually gets himself expelled from his school as a junior although he is a very intelligent and clever young man. He has trouble maturing throughout his teenage years, but this is a very funny and entertaining story telling of how a young and troublesome boy grows up. He gets very emotional at times and it does not help that the people around him are also very critical. Holden finally decides to attend a new school and be hopeful and optimistic about his very bright future ahead of him.I did not like in this book how Holden always found himself getting into a hole as he just got out of another one. He was always finding himself in a lot of trouble. Many mischievous boys can relate themselves to Holden in this book. They would also have to be very brilliant on top of that.I really liked how you could relate yourself to this book. He is a smart teenager boy that likes getting into trouble just like many other boys out there. I know at times I can find myself in a bit of trouble because I can be a trouble-maker. I like to stay away from that stuff as much as possible though. This book kept me entertained and always wanting to read more. It was not too hard to read either.I recommend this book to other teenagers, not only boys, but for girls too. I find this story very fun and amusing. It is easy to read and it is hard to book the book down. There is just one excitement after another, and it is very interesting. The Catcher in the Rye is a great story for many to enjoy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let's keep this short. Salinger's \\"Catcher\\" may well be the most influential American novel of the 20th Century. Holden Caulfield's discontent sparked the defiance that marked the 1960s and thereafter. Remember, \\"Catcher\\" was published in 1951. So it took a while, but soon everybody was walking around with a chip on his shoulder.The novel influenced our entire culture -- think movies, Marlon Brando and James Dean; think music, I argue that Elvis and the Beatles owe their free-spiritednes to Salinger. Campus unrest? Political activism? Don't Trust Anyone Over 30? The \\"youth culture\\" that exists even today. All that dates back to Caulfield's rebelliousness and his rant against \\"phonies.\\"Salinger changed everything. That one book did it all. The writing is original and pitch-perfect. Great novel!The Days of the Bitter EndThe Bathsheba Deadline: An Original Novel"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some wines age well, others...well, let's just say that they're best drunk young. I'd place \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" if it were a wine, in the latter category.I first read this book some thirty-odd years ago in a high school English class, and at that time I loved it. That same affection continued through several later re-readings (while I was in my early twenties), but recently, MANY years later when I picked the book up again, I couldn't get past the first twenty pages.What happened?As I started reading the book, good ol' Holden began sounding just like Beaver Cleaver to me. I mean, whenever Holden said something, I heard the Beav's voice -- his pitch, his inflection...you know -- the works!Holden as Beav (or the Beav as Holden): the resulting goofiness wasn't quite what I imagine Salinger was shooting for. And as much as I enjoy watching reruns of the Beav, this transmogrification of Holden into Beaver Cleaver completely ruined the book for me. I could no longer take Holden seriously!If I'd written this review 35 years ago, the book would have received a VERY STRONG five stars. Today...well, I feel I'm being generous with three. My advice to all who love this book: either never watch \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" reruns, or, if you've ever been addicted to the Beav and that show's gang of cutups, never read this book again!Let my personal catastrophe be a lesson for you all. Oh, if I'd only known!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Wow! Kind of fun to read, but a classic? I don't think so."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield was this young man raised in the upper middle class area of New York City. His life as a young man was put into these guidelines and if you didn't do what everyone else did something was wrong with you. He became depressed by the shallow people he was around. Holden wanted to be himself and bend the rules out loud. Doing so he found himeself in alot of situations good and bad. In this wonderful story Holden finds joy in the simpliest things of life. He's a very good listner. He believes everyone and everything has a story and he wants to hear it!If he could change the world he would.............."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a depressed nervous boy who undergoes a rough learning process following his expulsion from school. His complicated situation is caused by his continuing search for a true meaning or quality of life. Holden is tired of the \\"phonies\\" that surround and have daily contact with him. He looses interest in school and quickly falls into trouble. Failing to maintain his grades in private school force him to be dropped from the program entirely. Holden then commences his search for his true self and wanders the streets of New York while battling his growing depression. He meets new people and runs into past acquaintances that simply confuse him even deeper rather than helping him sort out his emotions. At one point, Holden tries to just go home but cannot bear his mother's disapproval and his father's constant lecturing. Instead, Holden goes to the one person who seems to be able to clear his mind of troubles, his sister Phoebe. Holden's depression is temporarily lifted during a conversation with Phoebe, but quickly returns and forces him to move on. Holden experiences both mental and physical trauma and realizes that he must find professional help soon, which is exactly what he ends up doing.Holden Caulfield is my favorite character. He represents what most teenagers go through at one point or another. I can very much relate to him. I have also run into the \\"phony\\" people that Holden did. \\"Phony\\" people are those who appear to be one thing when they are clearly another. These \\"phonies\\" portray false images to gain acceptance in the crowd. These false people end up hurting themselves and sometimes the ones surrounding them. I understand Holden's disgust towards these false people and appearances.I like this book very much. My favorite part is when Holden returns to his hotel room after a night of heavy drinking and socializing. He meets Maurice the bellboy on his way up on the elevator. Maurice is secretly an amateur pimp. He agrees to send a girl up to Holden's room in a few minutes. What I like about this part of the book is the whole action and dialogue coming from Holden. He really acts like a drunken 16-year-old. When the girl finally arrives, she has a fight with Holden over her price. Maurice ends up having to come up to the room and punch the lights out of Holden. I think it is a very well developed story with an excellent plot and great characters.I honestly recommend this book to every one. It will give readers a chance to look inside the developing mind of a 16-year-old boy and see what it goes through. Parents and teenagers alike will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Contrary to popular opinion, I think this book is slightly misunderstood. J D Salinger's famous novel is actually very amusing and witty. It is not all morose teen-angst and frustration. By far the most enjoyable bits of the book, (to me anyway!) are when Holden is making fun of the 'phonies' around him. Like the guy outside the cinema who has to take a step back before he can speak just so everyone notices him. That cracked me up. I don't quite know how this book has gotten such a strange reputation as being connected to psychotics and conspirators. It is a shame because there is a lot more charm to Holden than a bunch of loony bins."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden's character is so believable (despite what other reviewers have said) that he actually reminds me of somebody I used to know. His language, thoughts, and actions are so similar to many modern teenagers.When I read this book in high school I remember it made me laugh out loud and I truly enjoyed it. I decided to read it again last year (my senior year in college). I was still equally impressed with the book, but I'd forgotten how depressing it was. Holden is a negative optimist whose emotions run high and low and really take the reader there with him.Not just a 'coming of age' book, but certainly a classic that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book should be a coming of age ritual for all adolescents. I remember picking this up, in the dredge of hormone burst around fourteen or fifteen that left me with a constant snicker and cynicism I was not accustomed to feeling. Right away, the growing cynic in me began yelling &quot;amen Holden preach on!&quot; as he nailed those phonies for what they were and went it alone. Me and Holden, we had it all figured out. However, while reading the book a transformation and realization took place. The more I identified with Holden, the more I could see how his outlook was dragging him into a depression. I started to disagree with the outlook, and while sympathetic, I felt like there was something more to people. In a way, this book helped me grow up, helped me realize just how arrogant I was, how scared I was and how much of the world was left for me to discover. I have never found another book so perfect for the time of my life when I read it. A masterful work. A great painful gift that every young man should experience. The Catcher and The Rye showed me what a great book can do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. salinger, is my one of my all time favorite books. I first read it in 8th grade, and i read it all in one day. i really couldnt put it down. some people say it drags on, but i think it builds up more and more.With each page Salinger take you more and more into the world of Holden Caulfield. and In almost every way you can relate to this young man, or feel a sense or empathy because we have all been in similar situations to him. In no other time as anyone in literature fully described what its like to be filled with teenage angst. so check out this book if youve ever been a teenager."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book. I'm fourteen years old, and I first read this book about 2 months ago. I really connected with Holden Caulfield more than any other character I've read about in a story. At the time I read this novel, I had basically dropped out of school; I hadn't gone in over a month (I have since returned), and I was feeling really depressed, just like Holden was in many parts of the book. Reading this book made me feel better because it made me realize that there are many other kids just like me; There are lots kids who don't like school and don't have the best relationship with their parents. Many kids don't agree with all of society's rules and values. I realized that other teenagers also felt that the people around them were phonies. It was very interesting to read about Holden's adventures in Manhattan as well. Holden Caulfield is an amazing character. This truly is an excellent book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the type of book that few people will understand. You will either love it or hate it, and it all depends on your state of mind. If you can identify with a character who feels out of place from society, who doesn't really have plans for the future, and who sometimes finds himself to be his own best friend, you will love this book. If you can't set your mind to think this way, you will either hate it, or respect the author's point of view, but not connect with it. Holden is more than a prep school drop-out, Holden is a generation. A generation that looks at society and says, &quot;Why can't it be different? Why do I have to follow these rules, or standards?&quot; Holden is ultimately a character who strives to gain a life much more simple than his own, a life that is much more of his liking, a life that many of us wish to have."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After finishing this book, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. I agree with one of the previous reviewers, that the last 3 pages were the best. I got tired of Holden's whining throughout the novel and was waiting for something fantastic to happen. It didn't. I can understand the turmoil Salinger was trying to portray, but the resolve could've been better."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is awesome, there is no doubt about it. The story is one of the best but i get tired of people trying to figure out what the book means and what salinger was trying to say. I hate it when people say &quot; it was a book about reconstructing todays society&quot; well it could have been but the beauty of reading is interpreting everything for yourself and finding the meaning by yourself. There is no wrong answer. I promise you that you never will get tired of this book and you will read it and reread till the pages are worn out. remember its a great book to read not to study."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Right now I am sixteen and in the midst of adolescence. I have heard that one can't truly understand the book till they are past this stage, and I tend to agree with them, because every time I have read this book, I have gained some new understanding of it. I see many of my friends in the book, it captures the pretentiousness of adolescence perfectly. I can understand now how naive and ludicrous Holden's statements about &quot;phonies&quot; are, but at the same time it seems holden is trying to make all his scattered cynnical views convalesce into something more concrete. And there is something quite romantic about his journey through New York. Definitely the book's strongest points are the characterizations. You have to love how Holden describes Stradlatter and all the various girls he goes out with.This year I am going to read the book again for English, and I'm sure that it will once again be a completely new experience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the Catcher In The Rye for the first time when I was 15 years old. At the time I was too young to completely apreciate the quality of the story. When I looked at the story again when I was 17 I was amazed at how much sense Holden Caufield made. Holden may be the most realistic character ever created. Granted he is not entirly believable, but most 18 year olds are not. This is the kind of book that you can read in two days it's so good. The finnest work I have ever read in my young life!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To be brief, the book was well written and a great literary work. To say the book was gripping might well do more to psychoanalyze the reader than 2 years of therapy. It sums, quite neatly, the lack of philosophical fiber that permeates throughout the masses. But of course that's the point isn't it? Holden grapples with this aimlessly. While exemplifying depression, he walks about a sort of measuring cup... What a situation seems to be... how he feels about this person or that. No rational observation, mere whimsical regard, while juxtaposed with the non-understanding phonies, happy in their ignorance. There is nothing promising in this book. It's the type of material that one ought &quot;push&quot; against. It's the antithesis of ego, and consummate overwhelmed confused depressed id. IF one reads this and is put of by the language and the erratic and also repetitive sentiments, one must remember that the book feeds emotionally not rationally. You are feeling at that moment the same repugnance and contempt the main character feels. That is why it's a great book. Litereature should make you feel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was filled with non stop nothing. The most exciting part of the book was the end. I burned it the night I read it. They should have called this book catcher in the fire."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book emphasizes on the life of an adolescent who is going thru some rough times."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love to read interesting books but I hate them if they are assigned to me. We were assigned to read J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for English class a couple of weeks ago and I just knew I would hate it. Accepting the challenge, I read the first page and knew that it was quite different from all the other English assignments. After the first four chapters, I found myself not going to sleep for trying to stay awake to read what was going to happen next. Being a teenager, I could relate to Holden somewhat for the exception of his excessive swearing and smoking. We are alike in that we both like helping those in need and hate to see vulgar words on elementary walls that distract a child's innocence. This novel will lead you to look at life in a totally different aspect. I recommend those who are searching for themselves to read this book and get a clue..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books I have ever read. Holden is such a great character in this book, that you start to become him and act like him in your everyday life. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to find symbolism because this book is slam-full of it. I have rated this book as one of the highest in my life. It's great! READ THIS ONE!!!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a truely good book. No joke. I had to read it for school and I figured it'd be like every other &quot;good book&quot;, like to kill a mockingbird. this book is simply good. Its the best book i've ever read. I could identify with this book more than anything else in my entire life. I'm a 15 year old kid and I loved it. I give it my best reccomendations but be ready to think about the stuff he says its truely deep."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being something of a grouch myself, I looked forward to reading this one, knowing in advance something about the main character. Yes, he has a lot of grievances about the world, but they're not particularly entertaining, as, say, Jonathon Swift's were in Gulliver. Add to this the absence of a storyline and you get something disappointing, in my opinion. And I'm sure there are about ten thousand people now disagreeing with me. If you want to read some nasty insights about the human race, stick to Gulliver's Travels....in my opinion."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger is a magnificent book. It is a bittersweet, satirical book about a young man's view on the world. If you hate phonies and fakes, you'll loove this book. If you haven't read it do so, and if you have, do so again, I promise you, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I Think the book is great,it is much better than most of the books people call,Masterpieces.Holden said the things people have always wanted to say but never had enough nerve to say.That type of fresh-faced,no-holds barred sarcasm,is refreshing.because after reading all of those other fictional teenage novels,The Catcher in theRye is the most realistic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I picked up this book and looked at it as &quot;just another stupid book we have to read for English&quot;, and it somehow ended up on my Best Books List. I became attached to Holden Caulfield, and his whole world, and actually even felt like I was a part of it at times. I highly reccommend this book to anyone looking for something different, something creative, and for anyone looking to read an exceptional piece of work"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield is probably the coolest anti-hero you'll ever find. Salinger wrote a book in which everyone (everyone I know) can identify with a character who can't identify with anyone else in the book. Amazing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Without going too much into detail, William Burroughs once stated &quot;Art makes people aware of what they already know though they do not know that they know.&quot; I cannot think of anybody unable to empathize with the protagonist's disillusionment with the world that surrounds him. This is not the sort of book that speaks for a specific generation or sub-culture of society. This book speaks of and for the solipsist and the solitary. I habitually purchase copies for friends who haven't read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It changed me more than any other book I have ever read. The story of Holden Caulfield, a modern day Hamlet, is both touching and eyeopening. Holden represents something deep within us all. If you read any book make it this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I picked up this book expecting an insight into the adolescent mind (actually it wasn't that long ago since I WAS an adolescent and I wanted to see if the book jibed). It was an insight, all right, insight into the head of the biggest whiner I've ever read (or met, for that matter). All the dopey protagonist did was wander around calling everyone phonies. I just wanted to smack him about the head and tell him to SHUT UP and pull himself up by his bootstraps (actually jockstrap would have been a better course of action). What would be an insightful book is one written about the weirdo/stalkers who have had copies of this overrated tome with them (John Lennon's killer had one so did the guy who killed the actress from tv's &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;, etc.) I find it very hard to believe that people wanted this book banned. If anything, it should carry a warning label saying, &quot;WARNING: Extremely insipid book&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I Love this book. All I have to say is if you want to read a good; easy to read book read this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just like everyone else, I read this book in high school and then again several years later (when I was 22). I didn't have much interest in reviewing this book until I read some of the other comments. While reading Catcher, the book never came across as controversial or &quot;vulgar&quot; to me, and I am shocked that anyone would interpret it as such. Such opinions (granted, they were few) are more of a comment on the antiquated opinions and values of their authors, rather than the content of this classic novel. One need only look at how many young kids (anywhere from 12-18) have fallen in love with the book; whose passion for reading, and thus learning and expanding their young minds, has been triggered by Salinger. What a gift to give a child. Maybe it was because I thought I was &quot;too cool&quot; to enjoy a school assignment, or maybe I was just a dumb acne-faced kid, but I never embraced any book in such a way. But I feel as though I missed out on an intimate experience with literature that took some 5 years later to achieve. The point is, in an age where your kids learn more from MTV than from you, consider yourself lucky that Catcher in the Rye finds its way into their minds."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought the book just for something to do after my car accident. Me being 16 and all I didnt have much life after I lost the car. I love the way I could fly though it. All the &quot;old slang&quot; I understood pretty well without grabbing for Mr. Dictionary. . Holden was in a situation that I know I could relate to. (Well not the prostitute part but..same feeling running through my blood though.) I agree that the world is full of phonies and it just surprized me that J.D. wasnt trying to shove some typical hog slog story down my neck. (Like all the other &quot;Great Writers&quot;) Just read the book. If you want to know what kids have to put up with (from parents, society, school cheeses, and the pain of loosing someone that just made your day when you'd do nothing but childish things) then read the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is a young boy not quite sure what life in general is about. He takes the reader on a journey through his mind, where he tells us how he feels about things, sharing many ideas that many of us agree with but are to afraid to say. We see that Holden doesn't have all the answers, in fact that may be what makes this book so appealing. Altough the reader may at times be appalled by Holden's attitude, judgement, and fierce language, we also find him to be irresistable. When Holden realizes he is about to be kicked out of his prep school, he decides to leave early and not face his family quite yet. Instead he decides to take control of his own life. Alone in the city, Holden tries to discover just what he has to offer. There is really nothing special about Holden except for the fact that he is like so many of us, just struggling to survive."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't usually give out a full rating but with this one I did.You have to be patient with this book in the beginning. But you needn't wait too long before you fall into the actual story. Unfortunately, I found it took a lot of patience and consideration to keep up with the style of writing used. It's written in the way of a story being told by the main character with too many grammatical errors and much too much over enthusiasm and repetition. But that's the real 'colour' that J.D. Salinger provides for this book.Holden Caufield attends a long line of prestigious schools one after the other because he has a habit of being 'kicked out' or 'leaving' at his own free will. From this you can guess how strange his personality is. He is quite an intellectual when it comes to literature and the arts but he fails to show much interest or concentration to either. This is why schools keep kicking him out after a long period of trying to tell him to wake up and study-he fails most of his subjects. He is overall from what is described in his book-a very stubborn and yet free willed, impatient boy who wants to live quietly but not think too deeply about his future with any realistic sense.The whole story starts with Holden who has decided to tell us all about what happened 'last Christmas'. After being kicked out of another of his schools, Holden knows that he will have to go home on Wednesday and face his parents giving him a huge big lecture as they usually do about the way he has been neglecting his schoolwork. But what really bothers Holden is the fact that he has to stay at school and waste his time in dormitories UNTIL Wednesday. So he decides to use the time he has left before he goes home to his own benefit. He decides to go and have a good time for a change. The book talks about what Holden does to use up the two days before going home and how he decides to run away and live in a cabin next to the woods instead and not go home.This book is worth the read and worth having on your bookshelf. Holden is a very strange and interesting character and so flexible that most of us will probably find one part of him that is similar to us, you'll read the book and stop at one sentence that makes you stall because you know he's right or that the sentence is talking about you. By the time you stop reading the book you'll realise you've made the shortest little journey across the road but it'll prove to you how amazing a little imagination can be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was curious to see what all the hoopla was about, but was sadly disappointed after reading this novel. Salinger excelled in certain areas of the novel, bringing to life a post-war adolescent, catching the themes, settings, etc. of the day. Not bad writing, just not a classic, a la Hemingway, Steinbeck, etc. I will admit, I couldn't put it down: I was waiting to discover where all the \\"classic\\" was, but never found it, much like Holden never finds what he's looking for (at least as far as I could tell in one read)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I chose to read this book for my research paper in my junior year AP English class. I always had a feeling I would like the book, but I did not expect to love it as much as I do. Holden's story can be enjoyed on a basic narrative level and on a complex symbolic level. One of the great things about this novel is that, like &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; it is a good vehicle for exposing young readers to the art of symbolism. There are countless symbols in this book and it is good practice for more complex works by authors like James Joyce. I also would like to take issue with those who don't like the book because they feel it is simply an &quot;angry white male&quot; book. I am a liberal in politics but I am totally against the politicizng of literature. However, those people's resentment of the book is not warented because I believe this book to have many anti-capitalist elements in it. But that does not matter to me. I love this book becasue Holden is the eternal teenager whom young readers will be able to relate to for another 50 years."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book two years ago, when I was 18. It was really easy to identify with Holden, that's what makes this book so great! It's about growing up and innocence. Innocence under pressure. When you're a kid you are taught many things and made to understand many things and when those things turn out to be not true or 'fake'. You feel sick about it. That's how I felt and I probably would have to been to afraid to find out what's 'real' in this world, if I hadn't read this book. In a way I was able to learn from Holden Caulfields mistakes. For that I am forever thankful to JD Salinger. I think he's a great artist. And for those people who don't like the profanity, you are missing the POINT, completely."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great tale of the alienation of youth and it examines that which we hold dear in society. Holden Caulfield is the protagonist, a sixteen year-old expelled from school for apathy, but he is intelligent, and picks up on many inconsistencies and hypocracies in society. This is two days from his life, and it is edgy and entertaining after all these years. Brilliant writing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If the purpose of a true book rating system is to effectively display intellectual opinions about a book, then this system is not working. If a kid is required to read Catcher in the Rye for school and is unable understand it, he/she should not be bragging about it. Catcher is a classic and one of the greatest books of our time and if these little kids who cannot grasp its concepts can't bring up any legitimate gripes about the book, they should keep their opinions to themselves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Cynical teenager, Holden Caulfield is expelled from yet another prep school. Deciding to leave early, he spends two days in a void, after his time at this school and before confronting his parents about the rejection. He roams his hometown of New York City, pondering his sketchy future and looking sneeringly at the lot of phonies and conformists that make up the society. The entire book is written in the insignificant tongue and stream-of-conscious of its protagonist whose observations are sharp amd stinging. Many people walk about in an aura of pretense but never really seriously think about it. This book will change that. Every condemnation of a braggy peer, self-absorbed night club crowd, pretentious movie, show-off piano player and the serious consideration that it may be best to just leave the world behind and find a new career in a faraway western town is so sharp and well exaplified. After the Second World War, society called for a return to normalcy, including steady incomes and material status symbols. Salinger is the only writer I have read to display just how much is wrong with that and I am sure anyone reading will see how little the book's themes of psuedointellectualism, clique-monging and celebrity worship have deteriorated. I greatly enjoyed what the book was written about and I also liked how the book was written. In chapter 8, Holden walks from a hotel lobby to a cab. On his way out he thinks about an old friend, her personality, her family, her lips. One feels less like he or she is reading about a walk out to the street, but reading the thoughts of the main character. An irreplaceable book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger revolutionized what it means to be a teenager in America, and I thank him for that. The Catcher in the Rye explored what every teenager goes through--sex, independence, and coming-of-age. Holden Caulfield is an angry young man--angry at his family, at the world, and at himself. His anger is reflective of what virtually every teenager goes through. I want everyone to rememeber that when they pick up this book. It makes the book all the more worthwhile."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The theme of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, centers on adolescence and the loss of innocence. The protagonist and narrator is Holden Caufield, a sixteen-year-old boy from a wealthy family in New York City. He has just been expelled from another boarding school for academic failure. Holden's pessimistic outlook on life makes the reader think he has no hope left in the world. Yet, Holden is only shielding himself from more damage to his early loss of innocence. This moody, yet sensitive character foolishly spends his money, hoping to find a temporary haven from his emotions. Holden's emotions only escalate and nearly cause him a nervous breakdown. In many ways Holden can be compared to Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. Both teenage-boy runaways, they are keen observers upon unplanned travel routes. Salinger's stream-of-consciousness style of writing makes the story very real. The reader can relate and keep up with the narrator's thought process, even when he rapidly changes subjects. Salinger's dynamic characters become genuine people in a believable setting. Salinger's capture of adolescence in this novel is profound. There is much in Holden's irrational decisions that make this novel very truthful. Salinger's creation of a teenage boy, who constantly debates with himself on decisions of morality, is a character with which all adolescents can relate with in one way or another. Though some may find The Catcher in the Rye, offensive or controversial, it is representative of an adolescent and his struggles to find assurance in a world of doubt."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I haven't read The Body of Christopher Creed, however I think that it should be used in conunction with The Catcher In The Rye in the education of young adults. &quot;Catcher&quot; will remain a timless classic for quite some time, but it has moments where it tends to loose a readers interests. Holden's use of langauge in the story might be slightly offensive to some while to others it may be nothing out of the ordinary. Some of the terms he uses are quite out dated and often hard for a modern young adult to comprhend in nature. &quot;Catcher&quot; poses thoughts and ideas that many young adults can often relate to and comprehend on a deeper level than some of the modern novels that deal with issues not all of us have faced. This, in turn, gives us a strong reason to continue moving forward in our reading selections while still holding on strong to the timeless classics such as The Cathcer In The Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Pretty good. Interesting idea of writing a whole book based on a few days. Holden's character is quite interesting. He seems like a pretty lonely guy. It seems a bit contradictory for him to call everyone a phoney when he lies all the time. He is also quite judgemental. But he percieves the world quite interestingly. I can really relate to him. The things he talks about i can instantly understand (except for the bit about him practising on a hooker)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really liked this book. I can't count how many times I've read it. I'm 15,and I'm a girl. Alot of the reviews on here keep talking about how this is a great book for guys and how every guy should read it. I guess I'd just like to add that girls should read it too. It's very intresting, and really funny too. It's the kind of book that you can read over and over and never get sick of. All you people who come on here and complain about how bad this book is are really bugging me. One person said that Holden was the biggest whinner they had ever heard of. Geez, listen to yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is a wonderful book. It shows us that part of us, that is not allowed to see the light. J.D. Salinger has written a book that does not allow you to hide those feelings and emotions."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I came to this site after reading the reviews of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig. Out of pure curiosity i have been reading reviews of all my favourite books, next I shall go to Catch 22. I just HAD to write something here to contribute to this communal worship. . . I have read this book maybe 15 times over the years and its not because i am looking for hidden depths, etc. It is because Catcher In The Rye is so IMMENSELY READABLE. The prose is addictive. I pick the book up every now and again, usually when the impression has faded or whatever, and one paragraph is all it takes, I end up reading the whole thing again. This is one of those books you wished carried on and on. DO NOT LEND IT TO ANYONE!!! YOU MAY NOT GET IT BACK!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 15 yrs old, I read this book and found it very interesting. Holden is abnormal, but that is what makes it interesting, It is a great criticism of society. For all those people who don't like how things go for the upper class. GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"How is it that some people can dismiss The Catcher in the Rye with the simple phrase &quot;I didn't get it&quot;., or &quot;there's no plot.&quot;? Those that love this book, and we all know exactly why, feel for these poor people. This is a truly timeless book and reading it is not a spectator experience. The reader must, and I say that emphatically, read between the lines with this one. How can someone read this book and forget it? Does any one not know what it's like to be Holden? But that, in itself isn't even the point. If you don't understand what I'm talking about, I can't even begin to explain it to you. But for those of you that do know, you understand what it is about this truly amazing, profound and real masterpiece that has the potential to change a person's view of the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I totally loved this book. I am 17 and I could really relate with his feelings and actions. I was amazed that it was written in the 50's and is so like the world know. It keeps your interest the whole way through. If you are a teenager, or want to remember the days, this is a terrific book for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I Have read this book and I think that it is a great book for teenagers. It is well written, it describes Holden Caulfield's life in great detail, and it is extremely funny. It is written to show the slang that Holden uses in his writing, but does not make you think that the author too is using slang. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've just finished reading this book. And my first reactionwas to surf the net and read as much about this book as possible. Iwanted to relive some of the magic through the eyes of others who love this book. Needless to say, the book was sheer reading pleasure as much for it's language as for the thoughts expressed by Holden. The ending was so moving I could'nt resist calling my little sister in India right away. This book definitely rates as one of the very best I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read. Salinger writes well on Holden's thoughts and feelings. We know exactly what he feels about people, aka phonies, and society. I would recommend this book to anyone despite its controversies. In fact read every single banned books for they are banned because they raise clever yet, rebellious questions. This book enforces that we shouldn't be controlled by phonies in this cynical world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that this book was very mind-reaching and in-depth. The character Holden expresses his deep dislike for conformity in his own unique and individual way. It gives the reader a look at someone else's views of society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book was a good one in the whole, but the ending was not fulfilling. The ending leaves many questions unanswered."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really enjoyed the novel. It was the first book I read where I could really understand the character"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book, The Catcher in the Rye, is a book that shares ever thought of ever action a teenager of age same as mine experiences. This book is of a boy who does what he in his view is right. He is not your average teenager, but like every human he has thoughts of everything. If we deeply think about everyone complains about many things in the world. Holden has a heart and many other characteristics of deep thought and that is what makesthis book so great. This book is just a example of one boy who expresses what he belives and acts on it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was easy read, and a good narrative. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no plot. You will definately like reading about Holden Caulfield's life. As a teenager, I easily identified with his story about life and relationships."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was an easy to read book. As I read this book, it felt as if I were reading about myself. If the book wouldn't have said that it was written in the 50's, I would have thought it was written in the 90's."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a very enjoyable novel to read because it helped me realize that I am not the only person in the world with problems. It was very easy for me to relate to the novel right when I started reading. I give it a two thumbs up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger really wrote a winner with this novel. In no other book that I have ever read have I felt more involved than in this one. Holden Caufield, a sixteen year old boy encounters every part of life that a teenager could come across. It is definitly a book that any teenager can relate to. Even though the novel was written in the 1950's, it seems as if it takes place in today's times. It was extremely easy to read and has a very developed plot. I recommend it very, very much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading this book, I feel as though it was a good story depicting the life of a teenager boy who goes through the struggles of adolecent life. I enjoyed reading it. It kept me interested the whole time I was reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this book was pretty interesting, but kind of pointless. I didn't like the ending. I think they should have said more details on how he ended up in the mental institution. They also left you hanging with a lot of thoughts. They never told you what happend with Sally or Jane. This book didn't give me a sense of closure after reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Judging from most of the other reviews listed here, the legions of hopelessly disaffected and jaded among us found this to be a most engrossing novel. I fear that those few who have managed to mature out of their self-righteous and idealistic teenage years will find this to be a monotonous, uneventful narrative that is wanting in meaning or purpose. While the book may serve as a reasonably good study of the cynical adolescent mind, that is its limit. With each page I expected some gleam of insight--or at least a plot twist--to emerge out of the confused, miserable rant, but instead I was dragged reluctantly through to the end of the novel without being offered even a shred of intellectual interest. If you're seeking great American literature, stick to Hemingway or Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"ok. although it wasnt as long and boring as The Grapes of Wrath, and it wasnt as difficult to read as WAr of the Worlds, at least those two books had a point and a moral! This book follows a whiny rich highschool dropout who curses at everything he sees and ends practically every sentence with \\"is such a phony\\" or \\"it killed me!\\" He spends so much time telling you how much he hates the movies, and how all actors are phonys, and all these things he would rather do, and where does he end up going on a date? to the movies. He tells you about all these guys and how much he doesnt like them because their either flicks or phonys, but who does he hang out with? Who does he force his company on? Those flicks. Those phonys. He tells you how depressed he gets too. His sister kissed him on the cheek and he got depressed. How lame is that? And in the beginning of the book, he's talking with his teacher and he tells you how much he hates it when people repeat themselves, as his teacher had done. What i find funny is that Holden repeats himself too. He'll say something like this: \\"He's such a phony. I mean he's such a phoney.\\" and he does that all the time! say something, then in the next sentence put \\"i mean\\" in front of it and then proceed saying the same thing he had just said. This book was a complete joke! i have no idea why my teacher wanted me to read it. its completely worthless. if i could, i wouldnt give this book any stars. dont waste your time! you have much better stuff to do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is supremely overrated piece of garbage. It provided a few chuckles, and was of interest to me as to how privileged young people in New York spoke in that era, but it has only attained its status as \\"classic\\" because of the controversy it caused upon publication in Truman era America and also thanks to three generations of high-school English teachers desperate to be thought of as \\"cool\\" by their students by assigning a \\"dirty\\" book in class. It's really hilarious to me how the cover of my edition is printed in a very stark and naked style, with only the title and author laid out against a red background, as if front-cover art or back-cover blurbs would detract from the gravitas of this very serious \\"classic\\". What a joke. This book has no artistic or philosophical merit whatsoever and only warrants notice as a cultural icon of mid to late 20th century America, to our people's eternal embarrassment and shame. Holden Caulfield is a nauseating adolescent with a vocabulary limited to swear words and slang, who goes around getting drunk, thinking about sex and being depressed about the supposed phoniness of everyone but himself. The book appeals to the supercilious, self-centered, oh-so-sensitive, \\"I gaze upon the world and weep\\" type of teenager to whom the character of Holden gives reinforcement for their idiotic, anti-social behavior. Of all people, they should not be reading this book (not that anyone should), let alone having it assigned to them by adults who are supposed to be preparing them for maturity and responsibility. This book belongs on the ash-heap of literary history. Completely worthless."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have heard about this 'brilliant\\" work of literture for many years. But until now have never read it. After reading it, I never missed anything. This is nothing but a priviledge wuss trying to be something that he never will be--a mature useful part of society. He constantly whines, projects his uselessness on others and has little to no ability to see that the phoniness his so hates in others is nothing but his own personality reflecting back to him. if he had to actually be responably for one second of his life and didn't live of the wealth of his parents, maybe just maybe he might amount to something. I wish I had the time i spent on reading this dreck back."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I know this is required reading in high school. I know it's supposed to be hip and cool. I also know it's supposed to be based on a classic piece of literature. But it is one of the most overrated books of all time in my opinion. Perhaps it seemed new and innovative when it first came out, but now it's so overhyped it's disgusting.One of my biggest problems with the book is there is no background story - Holden was shipped off to a private school and asked not to return, apparently not the first school he was eased out of - but there's no reason given. Was he destructive? Did he threaten the other students? Or was he merely bored and didn't do schoolwork? Apparently he wasn't that troubled that they booted him out, the school intended to allow him to stay until the end of the semester. I get the impression the reason's a bit more than slacking off of the schoolwork, but it's never given. And in this age after Columbine, it's difficult to figure out what he could have done to be booted from school.The other problem I have is it's all from Holden's point of view - you don't know if he is behaving as crazy as he sounds or he's terribly self-conscious or exactly what is going on within him and around him. There's no description of how the outside world views him, really, just brief spots where others interact with him. He seems utterly miserable and depressed, but I'm never sure if it's the fact he's been booted from another school or he's clinically depressed and needs some sort of intervention.Read the book - if that's your choice or assignment - but know that if you don't think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone. And if you do think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone, either."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read this, I didn't really like it- I didn't like the idea of an immature narrator like Holden. I read it again, and when I was more mature and could look at it without getting involved with it, I realized how much I was like Holden. There are some books that capture a generation, that capture an emotion- this isn't one of those books for me. But yet, this book captures me altogether- rather than capturing a global emotion, he captures Holden, and in turn, captures me. (It makes perfect sense in my mind, at least.) I've even written songs including ideas from the book:&quot;It's true, we can't be catchers in the rye/Children must see the writing on the wallBut asked when innocence is lost, reply/that innocence is never lost at all&quot;I've seen movie characters named Holden (no doubt inspired by the book)- Mel Gibson was addicted to the book in &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;- and people have been killed (notedly John Lennon) by avid book readers. This book is as much a part of America as apple pie, mom, and Charles Manson- but yet is only a description of one boy getting kicked out of school and struggling to grow up. Yet it is more than that- it is the trials and tribulations of a boy trying to get through childhood in that transition stage. When he still wants to hold on to ideals, but when reality is seeping in. I identify with Holden, as do so many others- it's simply amazing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book last year for my AP English class.After hearing all the hype about how it was a great American classic I was excited to read it. Ufoetunately, I was waiting for the plotline that never came. This book goes absolutely no where. It drags on and onwhile Holden complains about virtually everything and then th story just ends. Nothing extremely interesting or, as far as I'm concerned important, happened in this book at all. Just the abnoxiously cynical thoughts of a brooding teenager who's P.O.ed at the world for no good reason. Just another teenager and that's all. This book was a complete let down in my opinon and I wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. I really don't understand why people think it's amazing, it's terrible."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love the theme and concept of the story and what Salinger is trying to convey. It is interesting an engaging. On the other hand I hate Holden Caulfield. He is terribly annoying and mean spirited. I understand how he fits well into the construct of the story but I know if I met someone like that in real life I would punch him in the face. He is so unlikable that I cringe whenever Holden speaks. If I could relate to him in any way I would have liked him more, but I do not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really don't understand why this is hailed as such a monumental work of fiction. I just checked the book out today from the local library. I have reached 38 years of life and never had the opportunity to read it. The only reason I did so was because of a song by Streetlight Manifesto, in which the lyrics refer to both Holden Caufield and Salinger himself. So in an attempt to find a deeper meaning in the song, I decided to read the book.It only took about 3.5 - 4 hours read, but I didn't draw any deep or meaningful insight from it. It's not really a great book, and it's not really a bad book, so I gave it a 3."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i just finished reading 'catcher in the rye' noting that it was never assigned to be read by my class in high school, even though other classes read it and all and carried it around school....the teachers probably thought that my class was a bunch of idiots (I really do) who wouldn't get the point of it even if they bothered to read it, which most wouldn't and then they would have to suffer through asking questions about the book to students who (like me) were just pretending to have read it, and couldn't care less about applying myself to english or any other subject for that matter...and instead of reading together and getting something out of the book together, the teacher and all of us would find ourselves completely trapped inside the painful drama that the book was actually about - but we couldn't say one word about it. We really couldn't. I think that we were the book. I really do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Why not add another review to the already hundreds in favor of Catcher in the Rye. Why do we all keep adding our opinions even though we know they'll be buried in the abyss?Read this book and you'll see why.Holden Caufield, our protagonist, speaks as honestly and openly as the youth of our culture today. This book could have been written a year ago and you'd likely never know. The satirical bite of the main character rings true to your soul and when you finish the last page, you're either sorry it's over and you go back to page one and start over again. This is one of the original page-turners."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many people say that Holden is a cynical and bitter character; unrealistically negative in his views of the world, but as a teenager, i know how tough things can get, and how frustrating life can be. Although the storyline only stretches over a few days, it never lost my attention.Holden is a physically mature 16 year old, telling the story of 3 days in his life. It involves a young prostitute, many bars, women, girls, boys confined to a boarding school, and a young man, definately not a believer in the human race.Holden leaves his boarding school without permission, and spends the next three days almost wandering the streets of New York.Although not at all a major aspect of the novel, the fact that it was set in the forties appealed to me. We only really experience this with the date given, and when Holden goes to see a film with Cary Grant in it.A highly interesting and unique novel. It should be read by all!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I find this book iritating to the core. The main character wastes away his young life complaining about how crapy society is and how phonie everything is asnd does this for ever an ever and ever. I honestly do not know why this is a \\"Classic.\\" It has none of wonderfu; messages you find in other classic books, such as For whom the bell tolls and to kill a mocking bird. It was a torment to read, only heightened when I found out that the author is just like his character...a reclusive, winey, utterly self absorbed man who refuses to actaully try to change the world, instead just hiding away from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye.The Catcher in de Rye, written by J.D. Salinger is a good book. It's about a young boy, Holdon. He's only 16 years old. He tells us the story of his life. It's a funny book, sometimes one has to laugh very hard. Other times, it's a little bit boring.Holden, the main character of the book, is kicked out of Pencey Prep, when the story begins. He tells about his life at Pencey. It's funny how he describes it: he's only sixteen years old, but sometimes you think he's an adult. He's very clever, but also very lazy, that's the reason why he's kicked out at Pencey. That part of the book I like most. Certainly when he tells about his roommates, I had to laugh a lot.The second part of the book, when he left Pencey, is more complicated. He is in New York all the time, and he doesn't dare to go home because his parents will get very angry. They don't know yet that he's kicked out at Pencey. He misses his little sister Phoebe most. He's spending much money. He goes to cheap hotels and he drinks a lot. He calls old friends and he thinks a lot about his childhood, about his dead brother Allie, about his life. He always uses the word \`phony', for instance for people he doesn't like. That word is cool, but he uses it too much, I think.After strolling in New York a few days, Holdon decides to go home. There he finds support by his little sister Phoebe. She's a very nice person, he likes her very much. In the end of the story, he goes home, but he doesn't want to tell what happened then.It isn't an easy book to read, there's a lot of spoken American language in it, for instance \`helluva' and \`watcha', I don't like that much. The vocabulary isn't easy, a few times I had to use a dictionary. The story is fascinating, but you spent a lot of time to read the whole book because there's much text on each page.The story has a few strange turnings, for instance when he left the house of Mr Antolini. Some things I didn't understand, but the story in general, I understood. This isn't a boring story. In the beginning, I thought it was a stupid story, because I didn't understand a lot of words. But when you keep reading, you start to understand the words better because you are in the English mood.At last, what I liked the most about this book, is the title, and how it's explained in the book. Holdon is standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. He has to catch all the little kids - that are playing there in the big field of rye - that starts to go over the cliff. That he does all day. He's the catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not knowing much about the storyline or theme of this &quot;classic&quot; book, I began reading it without any expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by the candid nature of the the main character's language and inner dialogue. Its rawness and bitter tone does not compromise this adolescent's view of the world.His dismissal of the &quot;phonies&quot; of an adult's social world is quite mature. This noncomformist stance in a world full of &quot;phonies&quot; makes him genuine, but refreshingly not alone. This book rings true to those who have ever felt they &quot;see through&quot; all the social nonsense necessary for those who care to fit into a mold within high society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those books where your interpretation changes as you yourself change. I guess that means that you have less sympathy for the character, an angst ridden adolescent, the older and more mature you get.Yogi Berra said it best....to paraphrase &quot;I thought Catcher in the Rye was about baseball, but it was just about some whiny kid.&quot;That being said, the book, released in the early 1950's, portrays Holden Caulfied as the paradoxical &quot;all-knowing/totally confused&quot; adolescent. The story takes place over a period of several days after Caulfield has been expelled from prep school. His cynical observations on his sorry state of affairs and his contempt for teachers, phonies and apparently all adults in general ring amazingly contemporary despite the book's being nearly 50 years old.I read this book in college, then later as a married adult and parent. It speaks volumes to the alienation of youth in a fast-paced engaging prose. For those who read this growing up, it is worth another look from an adult perspective. You'll be amazed at how different your reaction will be from the first time you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was weary about reading this book at first, but after I got into it and could not let it down I realized how good it was. J.D. Salinger was a great writer of how he wrote excactly what Holden was thinking! I would recommend this to anybody!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is well detailed and descriptive classic novel about a young mans life. I feel that this book should be mandatory for all 9th grade English classes to read. The story is basically a three day diary of a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden has just been kicked out of or expelled from a preppy, Catholic, all boy, private school in Pennsylvania. He is sixteen and a junior in high school. The experiences of a sixteen year old young man in 1950 effectively and exactly relate to experiences of sixteen year old in the year 2000. Tough the slang may differ a bit the details and plot still exists in todays every day high school boy life. This book starts of with a junior in high school being expelled. Written in first person, we the readers listen to what Holden has to say about being expelled, his feelings and his preppy school called Pencey Prep. Holden first tells us about his older brother who is in Hollywood, his younger brother who passed away and of his sister in elementary school. Then he jumps in to describing what a phony his school was. The details and myriad descriptions put us the readers into the dorm environment or in to the Pencey Prep. hallways and student life. Holden tells about his friends which arent really friends but instead just plain perverts that use girls, sporty jocks, and the usual nerdy pimply dorks. He soon decides he has three days left till he has to be home hat he will just leave the school right away and go explore the streets of New York. This is where the adventure and typical high school boy routine begin. On many occasions he is at a bar wanting alcoholic beverages and sometimes he gets them, and others he doesnt due to under age. Then he is stuck spending the night at a friends house because he has nowhere else to stay. Then he is left with wanting or having a prostitute for the night. He is also thinking about all the guys at his old school. He gets back flashes of what they used to talk about and in many cases the main topic was sex, which is very typical of high school boys even tough you may not know it. As you continue on reading you begin to think the thoughts he is thinking, feel the sorrow for his brother, and kind of miss the jerks he has left behind. Until he wants to visit his sister to tell her he is going away. In the end the story takes a big U-turn. It takes a U-turn because we the readers are positive that Holden is going to go far away until he tells his sister he isnt going anywhere. As you have just read, I have given you, the reader a well detailed and thorough summary of the book. This is exactly what J.D. Salinger has done in The Catcher of The Rye. This book does not have any weaknesses what-so-ever just many great strengths. I would recommend this book to sophomores and above. The recommendation is for this age level because once you are a sophomore then you have the actual high school environment and feeling inside of you. This book would be good to read as a class in freshman year only to show a different style of writing that uses redundant words such as phony and to show a vastly descriptive classic novel.This book is intentionally for people who like to have something seem real to them or enjoy to read about how the grass was green or how he left and on what day and so on. J.D. Salinger does a marvelous job on writing a novel on three days of a young mans life. Many authors would have left these great details and descriptions out but Salinger chose to keep them which is the whole purpose of this unique, classic, truthful, high school novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, some day when I'm old and gray, maybe I will get why this book is an all-time master peice. (I doubt it! But I might.) I seriously disliked this book. I know what you are thinking, &quot;what about the symbolism?&quot; What about it? I did catch the under lying things in the book. Like for starters, what &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; means. Holden was so feed up with people dying, that he wished that he could wait by the edge of a cliff, and when a kid comes running out of a rye feild, Hoden would &quot;swoop down&quot; out of nowhere and catch the kids. To me this book seemed entirly too whinny and used too much compulsive slang. &quot;Crumby&quot; and &quot;Phoney&quot; were seriously over used to the point that it made you sick in the stomach. I'm not denying that it was a humourous book at times it was just too &quot;loose&quot;.(The topic swayed from thought to thought). But it did make me laugh sometimes, I'll give it that. But I just don't understand why people think it so great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Absolutely the best novel I was ever forced to read.(Eighth-grade English class...)So good in fact, I've read it at least a half dozen times over the years. In Holden Caulfield, Salinger has created one of the most enduring and sympathetic literary characters of all-time. I think it is safe to say that most of us, whether we'd care to admit it or not, can find a little bit of Holden within ourselves. Holden is the perpetually troubled child. Emotionally wrecked by an ugly, unforgiving world which shattered his hopes at an early age, Holden constantly rants and raves. Hurling venemous attacks on the evil &quot;phonies&quot; whom he believes are to blame for his woes, Holden ostracizes himself from everyone except his loyal sister Phoebe. The beauty of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is that the story, and the sentiment it provokes, is still relevant a half century after its original publication. True, most of us won't go as far overboard as Holden does, but certainly his disenchantment will strike a universal chord with many people at various times of their lives. So go ahead and read it again and don't be surprised if you have a different perspective of Holden with each reading. Perhaps you'll loathe him, or perhaps you'll love him. Maybe you'll laugh hysterically. Maybe you'll simply shake your head in disgust. No matter what, you'll never be bored reading this all-time classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"NEVER EVER READ THIS BOOK !!!!

If he was alive I would like stalk him. Everybody should read this book. It's my favorite book ever, and he says so many memorable things. Every character is awesome, and its so well written. I finished it in 3 days and I'm possibly the slowest reader on earth (those were school days). There is so much metaphor, and it's not confusing at all, and its a totally new voice in books. Even though its been so long since it was written, I still love it 50 years later"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book. Sure, it's a little crude, but so is the real world. Holden Caulfield doesn't sugarcoat things, and neither should you. So if you don't like it, go to Russia."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think The Catcher in The Rye is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a must read for every young person.The realist portrayal of a sensitive teenager's coming of age is almost unparalleled in the annals of literature. I could identify with a lot of situations the protagonist finds himself in and the sharp words with which he expresses hiumself reminds me of myself at that age!&quot;A Portrait of the artist as a young Man&quot;, &quot;The Way of all Flesh&quot;, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; and &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;.....these are some of the books which, I believe, share the spirit of &quot;The Catcher in The Rye&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I was reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; by J.D Salinger, it made me think about the world that we live in today, and if this situation that Holden Caulfield is in,realistic. Throughout the novel, Holden encounters many different women, for mostly the same reason, and need I say more. The boy is just 16 years old, and has been kicked out of school for his grades/actions numerous times, without his parents really caring or knowing about him and his education. I find that hard to believe that the parents of today's age would allow their child to go through this. Even though this story takes place in the 1950's, i still do not believe parents in that day and age would allow it either.When Holden Caulfield runs away from school before Christmas break, I find it hard to believe that all of the people of Manhattan, wouldn't question him. Why a 16 year old boy would be able to check into a hotel by himself, and go into a few bars with 30 year old ladies and be served. Correct me if I'm wrong, I beileve that you have to be at least 18 years old to check into a hotel room, and 21 years of age to be served alcohol in New York.The one part of this novel that I did enjoy was how Holden speculates the people in the society he lives in are so dumb that they would actually write a four letter word, followed by a &quot;you&quot;, on his tombstone. Even though I can't see that happening, I found that very humorous. I also love the fact that he calls everyone &quot;phony&quot;, when really I think he is phony. He seems like he is the person who has a negative outlook on everything in the world, except towards the end of the novel, when he is optimistic about his future.Overall, I'd rate this 3 stars out of 5, which in my mind isnt too bad. There were many points in the novel that made me laugh and really think about some things. But what brought the score down was, I didn't like how Salinger had the society play dumb in the novel. There are numerous times where Holden gets away with things that in my mind, would be shocking if he were to do the same in today's world. If Iwere to recomend this book, I would recomend it too mature teenagers who like fictional stories. A few changes to improve this novel, could of made my review a lot different in a positive way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've just read this book for Literature class. Now, maybe after some going-through-the-book-in-class, I might be able to understand all the &quot;hidden meanings,&quot; but according to my instinct, I really don't see anything valuable right now.When I first picked up this book, I thought, &quot;hey, I've heard of it before, people say it's really great!&quot; So i started reading it with the great hope that it would be good. Boy was I disappointed! When I read the first few chapters I thought, &quot;This Holden guy SEEMS to be a fun person, now let's get into some plot!&quot; Then all through out the rest of the book I just kept looking forward to something, ANYTHING! I'm like, &quot;Something better happen soon, there's like, 20 more pages left in the book and I STILL don't see any point!&quot; My was I dissapointed when I saw the last page! I'm like, what happened? This is IT???! Whaa? Sure, the language and all the stuff that the author used can help someone to relate to Holden, but there has to be a story to help people see his point! I know Holden's supposed to be confused, but what solved that confusion? Phoebe? It didn't seem that way! Anyway, I don't think anyone today is STUPID enough to go on the streets of NY for three days just because he/she is confused about the meaning of his life! I don't even think that Holden is confused about the meaning of his life. He is just afraid to confront his parents with the news that he's kicked out of Prep school! I don't see the point: if he is afraid to confront his parents, he should TRY not to flunk almost every subject. If he decided to flunk, then he should be able to go home and not be scared! What's wrong with him?Another reason to not like this book. I think that this book is really stereotypical. And to say stuff like &quot;Holden represents the confused youth of today&quot; is stereotypical too. I agree that many teenagers today are confused, maybe I am too, but I think it is REALLY rude and stupid to use a character like Holden Caulfield to sort of represent us. Maybe Holden's fantasy about his cottage in the west is similar to some of the fantasies that we have today, but a fantasy is a fantasy. And many of Holden's other foolish acts really evened out this more &quot;sensible&quot; fantasy.That's my thought. I can't believe I just wasted all this time to make my point why I dislike this pointless book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand why we still read this book. Although I understand that this book was monumental in the era in which it was first published, it doesn't really relate to the world today. For one thing the main character (Holden Caulfield) is very different from the teenagers we have today. In instances we find that he swears incessantly and has and incredibly pessimistic view of the world. This is something that most teenagers experiance but Holden carries it to another level. His consistant tounge slashings and bad talk of those around him make him a character to hate, yet strangely many identify with him and find him quite interesting. In my opinion the few days wespend with him over the 2-hundred something pages are incredibly hard to go through and I had to force myself to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since I have read Catcher in the Rye, I believe that the book should be read by all young readers. This book deals with every day problems that young men go through in their everyday lives. There is now a book with a fictional character that young men can relate to; I understood most of Holden's problems throughout the book. I haven't read Counterfeit Son, however I think all young adults should also read this book today. This book deals with kid napping. There are a lot of kid napping cases now more than ever. Kid napping has risen tremendously around the world. Many young adults do not know how serious this issue is. After reading the reviews for Counterfeit son, I finally understand that issue is more serious than I thought. Mature young adults should read both books because both of them relate to the problems we face in society today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read The Catcher in the Rye in 9th grade, and immediately fell in love with the voice of Holden. The style in which it is written flowed so easily in my mind because it sounded- if only the language and not all of the opinions, like the voice inside my head.Salinger is subtle, and yet wonderfully blunt. He goes out of his way to explain the details of Holden's thoughts, but does not reach to extend to you the actual events surrounding the beginning and end of the book.I find this to be a blessing now, though it was frustrating at the time. I frequently read online journals in which the events surrounding a particularly difficult patch in life are described in painful detail, but the thoughts of the person writing during those times are not adequately explained. It makes the events seem almost unreal even though they are supposedly accounts of real life.This account of teen angst, however, is believable. Holden's character and story are tangible to the reader. Never for a moment did Holden seem unlike Holden, nor the significance of a thought or event become less significant than it should.The Catcher in the Rye is an absolute a classic. Salinger so perfectly put himself into the shoes of an angry and depressed teen that it's almost impossible to think that anyone but Holden actually penned the novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'd give &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; 2 1/2 stars if there were 1/2-star ratings here. But basically, this book just wasn't as great as everyone says. It's overrated to a degree, but I still found some merit in it. There wasn't much of a plot, and it wasn't very well-written, but it does have some rather interresting, likable charcters. Holden Caulfield himself, though, is just annoying. He complains about everything, gets depressed easily, repeats phrases like &quot;I really did&quot; and &quot;If you want to know the truth&quot; at least 50 times, and swears a lot. I'm 15 years old, and I can safely say that Caulfield is NOT the embodiment of teenage cynicism. I know some kids who are pretty dense, but most of us aren't nearly as obnoxiously pessimistic as Caulfield. Yet I mannaged to choke down the book in a few days. I only read it because I didn't have anything better to read. I will say a few good things, though. Salinger, via Caulfield, makes some rather interesting observations about the different kinds of people in life, sort of like a Horacian observer with a Juvenalian attitude. I will also say that I think the writing was DELIBERATELY bad, as Salinger was trying to make it sound like a real adolescent was actually writing his book, and he succeeded admirably in achieving that effect. But by and large, I didn't like the book and probably the only reason Salinger has been so reclusive for the past 50+ years is because he's ASHAMED of having written this mostly unenjoyable book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield said things I could never say, those things I would never say if I had the chance.How many teenagers felt that way reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;?While Holden searches for himself, the meaning of life, he was a younger version of those in the Beat movement, or James Dean. Readers go from &quot;Catcher&quot; to Kerouac's &quot;On the Road,&quot; with the same easy-going, streaming thoughts kind of way.&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; grabs at the introspective self. Like so many of the Oprah books are for women, &quot;Catcher&quot; is the for teen male. (Did I offend the teens guys, or the Oprah fans?!)I fully recommend &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; It isn't a literary masterpiece, but will intrigue even the passive reader.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Fifty years after it was first published and thirty (something) years after I first readThe Catcher in The Rye, I decided to reread it to see if it had the same impact as the first time. Holden Caufield's lost weekend in New York seemed so risque and daring when I read it as a teenager. I was most impressed with the language he used and wished that I could be as fast and loose with my language. Thirty years later does add some perspective and in view of language use today, The Catcher in the Rye seems awfully mild. Holden is obviously an imperfect and confused hero in search of finding his way in the adult world which he both covets and despises. He is not well equipped for this quest, frequently failing to communicate is desires and feelings to the world around him. Caufield's pathetic attempts to communicate and involve himself with others leads him into further isolation.Holden Caufield, the teenager created by J.D. Salinger is a strangely vulnerable young man at odds with the phonies of the earth. After being expelled from one more prep school Caufield gathers his resources and spends a weekend in New York City before planning to return home. Caufield is an amusing and obsessive youth who has an opinion about everything. Holden a disorganized and directionless dweeb is true to his own values and morals. He is loyal to those he loves and cares for his sister Phoebe and friend Jane, while despising those who do not live up to his standards.If you have not read this book it is high time to give it a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think someone forced to read this book [for school] is not going to enjoy it as well as if you read it on your own. I haven't been asked to read the book for school, but I read it in my own time and enjoyed it. Reading it for a class, I think, would have ruined it for me. Holden is easy to relate with. He's a thinker. You share his thoughts throughout the book and I found myself agreeing with the majority of them. Though it was a fantastic book, I don't think it deserved as much acclaim as it did. I don't think it was a work of genius or a hard book to write. In my opinion, it read almost like a journal, almost. A journal where you are revealed every detail and every thought. If you were to reach into your mind and dig out your inner thoughts, I'd almost garantee you that they would match up easily with Holden's."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just read a bunch of other reviews talking about how boring this book is, and how it's just full of complaining, has no plot, etc. To me, that is the beauty of this book. I can read it over and over and still love it because my attraction to it isn't based on &quot;what's going to happen next,&quot; which wouldn't really encourage multiple readings. After reading every word Salinger has written, I just sit back and revel his genius. He has created a character who is almost a real person, with miles of background to his life and every thought leading to another. I often go for the great plot-twist too, but maybe I'm strange in that I prefer a different style; I would take something that I can understand and connect with that moves me with its honesty over an exciting suspense-type story anyday. This is the sort of thing that lingers over time because there is so much more beneath it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this book was the book which affected me most.i'm a chinese,in such a country,the mode of education was very strict.in such a system,the student has few problities to resist the teaching system,although it is old and not be liking."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought this book was a very interesting book to read. This is a very good book about a young man going though some tough times in his life. The book takes place during only four days, but in these four days you get to know the main character very well. One of the reasons I thought this was a good book was because I can relate to it because I'm a teenager and the book is about a teenager. You also meet up with a very interesting character whose name is Phoebe. She was my favorite character in the book even though she was only in the book for about the last fifty pages. Everyone I have talked to that read this book shared my opinon that this was a very good book. For this reason I would recomend this book to anyone no matter what age, race, or sex. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought this book was ok the first time I read it but I really didn't get it, so I read it again. When reading it the second time I realized why The Catcher in the Rye is considered such a great book. It is very realistic and accurate in showing the life of a 16 year old. I found it kind of surprizing that Holden's life in the 1950's is kind of similar for teens now in 2001. The book is about a junior in high school who got kicked out of Pency Prep because of poor grades. He decides he wants to leave the school but he doesn't want to go home so he goes to New York City for a few days. Holden doesn't want to go home because he's afraid of his parent's reaction to him getting kicked out. While in New York Holden gets into some trouble but the whole time he is telling you about his feelings and opinions about things and people he encounters. I love how everything in the book is realistic from the language to the feelings to the situations Holden gets himself into. These are all things teenagers can relate to which is one reason why teens love this book so much. I know I liked it a lot and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading this book, I wouldn't go so far as to say that there is a Holden Caulfield in all of us. I will say that no matter how contentiously worded they are, Holden's complaints about society are warranted. The basis of his cynicism -which is, in short, the cruelties and shortcomings of human nature- is no less a substantial basis today than it was decades ago, when the book was written. Holden's psychological state magnetizes the analytical reader, and is a queerly nagging force that makes it almost uncomfortable to admit when som off-the-wall comment he spouts makes sense. There are no answers to life's questions in this book, but I recommend it to all who know better than to expect answers from a depressed and lonely teenaged boy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"So, this was recommended to me as I liked F. Scott Fitzgerald's work but was wanting a bit of change. It was quite a bit of change, in the wrong direction. Every other sentence is filled with curse words.

All those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go Yale, or maybe Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn't go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was dying, for God's sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him. Boy, she was good looking. But you should've heard the conversation they were having. In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was doing, he was giving her a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide. His date kept saying to him, \\"How horrible...Don't, darling. Please, don't. Not here.\\" Imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me. - J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye.The Ivy League schools have been the standard for high quality thinkers for at least a century. I used to think that Ivy League schools produced good thinkers, even if they were elitist. That is until George W. Bush. Here we had a graduate of 2 Ivy League schools and he admittedly did not read a lot. Bush also started a war to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden, then stopped thinking about Bin Laden a year or so into the war. Our current president also graduated from 2 Ivy League schools. President Obama is well read and a thinker, but seems to be as disinterested in the job as George H. W. Bush, also an Ivy League graduate. I am afraid that the Ivy League's highest profile graduates have not represented them well. The elite is just not what it used to be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was so horrible, I had to force myself to finish it.

It turns out the character is just as annoying now as it was when I was 14. So of the reviewers have sad this novel shows \\"universal\\" problems, that some how I didn't experience. The character is really probably clinically depressed and lacks social skills. The character also rants about phonies, but he comes across as the phoniest person in the book. The character is neither endearing nor insightful into the human condition. Pretty much this book amounts to the most annoying, depressed, dull and whinny person you can imagine ranting for 200 pages.

Maybe in it's time it was revolutionary, exciting and shocking for the main character in a book to point out that most people in society are fake and to question everything but today it's been done so much it's tedious and depression. Who wants to hear an adolescent whine on and on page after page about how other people suck?He doesn't try to see the beauty or goodness in anything and in the fifties this may have been an interesting and new perspective but in today's very cynical world it's just dull. And I don't believe half the people giving this book great reviews really like it.If you want to read about adolescant angst try a book with a character who actually has some self awareness.

I actually know someone who still talks like this in his late 40's and I can only handle it in small doses.The dialogue does ramble on & on at times and I found myself shaking my head.I'm glad I read it and I think it is important but I do not think it will be for everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Maybe this story has simply become dated over the years because it didn't have the impact on me that I expected. This certainly isn't on the level of Huck Finn, To Kill A Mockingbird, Life of Pi, nor even The Tale Of Depereaux, but it is different than anything else I've read. Perhaps the appeal of this book is that it's written from the perspective of a teenager, in stylized teenaged writing, about teenaged issues. This could be one of those books that appeals more to a specific audience of those going through puberty than it does to the general reader. Still, Holden Caulfield seems like more of a whiner than a cynical adolescent to me.Reading this book is like being stuck in an elevator with a sixteen year old boy for the duration. It might make for a good psychological study of that particular insanity that teenagers go through as their brains develop in the presence of an overdose of hormones, but as a story it lacks a plot. This is about a kid wandering aimlessly through his life, such as it is, both literally and existentially. It could theoretically give aid and comfort to those teens in a similar situation, but I can't imagine it helping me much when I was that age. The main character is supposed to be a young radical, smoking and drinking despite being underage, but it all seems much too tame in these modern times.I suppose that the moral of the story is supposed to be that everyone undergoes these psychotic teenage episodes, even the preppies. However, this point is made in a monotonous, rather repetitious and boring manner as our young angster wanders about NYC looking to rutt, having just been kicked out of yet another fancy boarding school. If the rich kids have these same problems then maybe we should all stop feeling sorry for ourselves and think about poor Richard Cory. It's all just a little too ham-handed for me and it really bothers those kids who really were cool and all to have to listen to those who just think they are. Sometimes I just say crazy stuff like that, I'm a madman sometimes, I really am."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought this book because I had heard it was a classic, and my children were required to read it in high school.This is a well-written book about a self-centered boy who considered most other people (especially adults) to be idiots. His sister was the only person he respected. He was a loser, having been ejected from several private schools. It could be assumed that he represented the disenchanted generation of the sixties and seventies, but I did not find them this negative.

I finished the book I was reading a few days after his passing and decided to finally read this alleged masterpiece -- and masterpiece it is, indeed. I wish I would have read it when I was 17, but alas, I waited until age 31. Nevertheless, I remember what it was like to be 17, and honestly, I related to the character Holden Caulfield a lot today; even as a married father and professional \\"phony.\\" I can only imagine how utterly groundbreaking this book must have been when it was first published in 1951.What I loved about the book: I could say \\"everything,\\" because I did, but I'll give a few specifics. First, I loved the voice in which it was written. Holden is sarcastic, snotty, and just way too cool for almost everything -- just like I was when I was 17. I loved the exaggerations and hyperbole. I identified with his descent into near-madness, being in that awkward stage between childhood and adulthood, not knowing what to do, not really understanding or not wanting to deal with the consequences of your actions, really just not being ready to grow up. As Holden wanders New York in a sleep-deprived stupor, he explores these issues within his mind; he jumps from one feeling to another, and breaks down and cries more than once. It truly is a powerful novel, and one of the three best I've ever read. Five stars all the way.The book is just 214 pages and a breeze to read. If you haven't read it, you should. I've been reading a lot of \\"classic\\" novels lately and this is the first one that I know for a fact I will be reading again in the future. I could see myself reading this every couple of years for the rest of my life -- it was that good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is tied for my favorite book of all time. This one is about the coming of age of one Holden Caulfield(?) after he runs away from school. The novel is told through his point of view and allows you to know everything he's thinking which is excellent for this story. Holden is smart, hilarious, and sensitive in a way that allows you to connect with him instantly because he tries to hide how vulnerable he actually is. He reminds me of a kid version of Chandler Bing on Friends. Basically, Holden wanders around what I think is New York if memory serves and gets into all sorts of fiascos. He has a keen eye for observance and is wise beyond his years. Though he is but a teen, I constantly found myself thinking him to be a young man much older. Along the way Holden meets various friends and people, most of whom he dislikes. Those he doesn't dislike are special indeed though. Salinger uses these people to tackle greater themes through Holden's relationship with them. A quick example would be the girl that Holden met and played checkers with. He repeatedely says throughout how she \\"never moved her back row\\" or something to that effect which doesn't make much sense until you meet Holden's athletic and womanizing schoolmate and learn that he has a date with her. Holden desperately wants to know from him if she still never moves her back row. She represents something pure and virginal for the boy and he doesn't want her tainted because he cares about her. Something else I really enjoyed was when Holden met his sister Phoebe. She is a few years younger than him and their relationship is beautiful and touching. He really goes on and on about he before we ever see her and it's obvious how much he loves her. Once they do meet, he angers her and what happens as they make up is something special. There is alot of symbolism in this novel, too much to talk about here. Check out the significance of Holden's hat and also his baseball glove. My favorite part comes when he explains what the Catcher in the Rye truly means and when he'd done that, I knew this book had gone beyond. If you want a nostalgic look back at childhood and growing up that is filled with humor and wit and also well-written relationships, this one is for you. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, it may be that they are pre literate.

This isn't a poorly written book by any stretch of the imagination. My problem stems from the fact that you have to deal with the spoiled complaining of a teen who probably didn't get beat up enough in school. I understand the awkwardness of being a teen, but a couple hundred pages of listening to a jerk complain about \\"phonies\\" was more than enough for me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What was reported of the book by the seller was true and was delivered on time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm teaching this book to my 10th graders, after making an inquest and asking all of my friends and acquaintances what book really changed their lives in high school. I was a bit squeamish because it has curse words galore, and because some of the subject matter may be deemed inappropriate for polite conversation, but the kids are really responding to Holden's cynical, alienated internal dialogue, and it's really uplifting to see them identifying with a fictional character as if he were a real person."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although is book was written in 1951, but is still speak the hearth of typical teenager. Seventeenth or for anyone that whose feel they need to escape from their normal life and to go explore the wild side. Once this boy step into the wood; can he choices to stay or will he be able to find his way out without losing a part of him? I enjoyed he's journey very well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had never read this book in high school. I kept seeing it on lists of \\"great books\\", so I decided to read it. I was immediately drawn into the character and what was happening with him. After a short time, however, he starts becoming repetitive and annoying. His vocabulary is liberally salted with the words \\"crazy\\", \\"phony\\" and \\"goddam\\"; and he is continually critical of and hateful towards everyone around him. As the book continued, however, I realized that he was suffering from depression and was reaching out to those around him, however ineptly. He was still annoying, but I felt more compassion toward him and wanted to find out what was going to happen. After finishing the book, I put it down and thought \\"Huh\\". I went online and read some interpretation and explanation. It was definitely thought provoking. I can't say that this was one of my favorite reads, but what it says is important. The WAY it is said can be annoying, but perhaps that's necessary - an immature, depressed person may be exactly that. It was definitely worthwhile."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is a fiction novel about the hardships of life as a teenager.After sixteen year old Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of his fourth school in a row he ventures out into the world to find what makes him happy. Eventually, he decides that what he truly wants to be is \\"the catcher in the rye.\\" He describes one of his dreams where he is keeping younger kids from falling off the edge of a steep cliff while they are playing in a field of rye. This is the only thing he wants to do with his life to make him happy.I found this book to be very interesting and it was fairly simple to just sit down and read without hesitation. This book would be a good choice for teenagers because it's easy to relate to for all of the problems that teens have to go through like school, love, family, and their future.Although this book is about the hard times of a teenager it has many humorous parts. The author often talks about Holden's relationships with girls and how awkward some of them can be. He is also never afraid to say any of his thoughts out loud which makes the book enjoyable and entertaining.This book was a memorable story and has become one of my favorites. However this book is difficult to understand in some parts because of the wide variety of vocabulary, but after you get past that it's a great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A week in the life of Holden Caulfield, a confused and troubled teenager who has just been expelled from yet another school and is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. That is the plot of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". It's a pretty flimsy plot, but the writing is beautiful. Salinger has given Holder Caulfield the voice of a lonely, immature young man who doesn't understand how immature he really is, and that voice is pitch perfect.Holden Caulfield is one of those characters who you will either love or you will want to slap silly. I am one of those people who fits into the former category, whereas my father is one of those who fits into the latter category and I think the difference is largely due to the fact that Holden Caulfield reminds me of me, whereas my father can't identify with him at all. It's impossible to determine which category you will fit into. However, a large number of people have managed to draw inspiration from this work over the years including Bill Gates, Tom Robbins, Stephen Chbosky, and a convicted murderer or two.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is J.D. Salinger's first novel and it introduces themes that would appear again in his later works. People who have read and enjoyed this book, may find Salinger'sFranny and Zooeyalso to be of interest for the parallels between Franny Glass and Holder Caulfield. Both are youths who insist that everyone in the world is a phony except for themselves.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is often considered to be the first teen novel ever written and one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, if not, of all time. Regardless of whether you agree with this or not, it's a short novel and it wont take you long to read it in order to form your own opinion."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading this book at a boarding summer school, I feel an immediate connection to it. Escaping from a prep school, Holden Caulfield, a teenager failing every subject except for English, is ready to move on, but he doesn't know how. He often wonders where the ducks in Central Park will go in the winter, but he is actually thinking about his future when Christmas break comes. The protagonist lets his anger, resentment, and fears out as he goes on describing a story of his own. The meaningful plot makes me understand about life more than any other book. The ending of this brilliant masterpiece is like a slow- motion romance movie. Holding his loved one in the air, Holden is finally satisfied with his life, something he has never experienced before. It has been a while since I finished reading this book, but I still think of it everyday. J. D. Salinger created a deep and meaningful storyline for the readers to think and develop it further. Everyone should read it over and over again, and carry it around like a bible. It is truly a literature classic!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Unfortunately this book was not on my reading list for High School. It is a shame because I would have enjoyed it then, just as I enjoyed it now. Anybody can relate to some aspect of this novel.

Bottom line, is great book and everyone should read it at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is written in the first person and tells the story of a teenager, HOLDEN CAULFIELD, who is struggling with the normal teenage crisis of misdirection and apathy. I don't remember reading this book in High School. Perhaps it was assigned and I ignored it.I believe the story would have resonated more with me when I was about Holden's age (16) than it does now. The book is an easy read and the story and characters are very real. Why is it a classic? I don't really know, perhaps it was ahead of its time; perhaps the prose was unconventional. I enjoyed the story but didn't feel much connection with the characters even though Holden reminded me of kids I knew in High School, perhaps even a little bit of me.

The story of a boy struggling through school and getting kicked out. Im sure pretty much everyone can relate to Holden in someway.The story is about a boy named Holden who attends private school and has been kicked out of a couple and is now leaving his current school called Pencey. Summed up the whole book is him telling his life story.The book didnt really impact my life that much. I did some research about the book and such and what I found was that supposeably this book encouraged Mark Chappman to kill the beloved singer and song writer John Lennon a former band member of The Beatles.I personally thought the overall book was good. It didnt take me long to get into and didnt take me long to finish but i also enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the book that created a new generation. J.D.Salinger realistically portrayed the protagonist Holden Caulfield, who absolutely despises phoniness and becomes initiated as he travels in New York City.

When I asked, she told me the book was &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; and I seem to recall that I orginally thought it was about a baseball player's drinking problem. She gave the book to me when she'd finished and I was soon in hysterics of my own: at fourteen I wasn't looking for deeper meanings.Rereading &quot;Catcher&quot; about six years later, after having weathered a few Holdenesque travails of my own I found myself identifying (and sympathizing) with old H.C. and his often off-centered points of view.Twentyfive years later I found myself back where I'd started: enjoying the humor of the book as I had that first time. Personally I find Catcher&quot; the perfect &quot;rite of passage&quot; story, even if the passage is the long corridor of years that make up a lifetime. It has been there for me, in different incarnations to suit the times, as joker, teacher, and amusing friend. What more does one need to call a book a &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am English and I first read this book when I was around 20. I am now nearly 50 and I am trying to encourage my American husband to take up reading.

I still enjoyed the book; that inimitable way Holden has of expressing himself..so American..so different to the way we speak in England. Yet my husband did not enjoy it. He did not understand the pathos that I saw in the book..he did not see the funny side of things..he, an American himself, could not understand Holden's way of carrying on..to him, Holden behaved very badly and was a crazy mixed up kid.

I can only feel pity for anyone who did not grow up in the &quot;fifties&quot; when the world learned, through Salinger, that teenagers were people too"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In what may be a truly unqiue viewpoint among this plethora of reviews for J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; I am a fifteen year-old who loved the book precisely because of how much I hated Holden Caulfield. The only thing I could possible hate more are the critics who present Holden as the perfect epitomy of the adolescent experience. Holden is everything we detest about the maturation process of teenagers -- the fear, the frustration, and the angst. Yet he shows few of the &quot;decent&quot; qualities of any teenager that would allow him to be the rule of adolescence rather than the exception, as so many critics (mostly baby boomers) would have you believe. Certainly this is evidenced by the fact that both his fictional and real-life peers, at least most of them, do not flunk prep school, solicit whores, wander the New York bar scence, and dance with forty year-olds in a dank hotel. Yet of course, I can identify with Holden, precisely because his depression and anger (what else is it?) occupies us all at one time or another. But Holden is the extereme. His ceaseless ravings against &quot;phonies&quot; (the word occurs about every 10 sentences through the book) drove me absolutly nuts! So many times I pleaded with Holden to simply chill out, if that is the right phrase. His endless frustration with almost everything in the world is obviously a looming aspect of any kid's adolescence, but it is by no means ubiquitous in our lives! To me, Holden is simply out of touch with the world -- a world, ironically, that he despreatly hopes will accept him. Of course, read the book. Of course, triumph at how well Salinger captured teenage angst. But please, don't suggest Holden's beliefs are the indelible stamp inevitably paralleling all of our lives from ages 13 through 20"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Listen - this book has probably gotten more mixed reviews, more shares of both 1's and 10's, than any other novel out there. It's not the messiah of the literary world, but it's not vulgar trash either, so let's put a stop to those theories right now. It's a book that, for some people people (myself included) struck a chord and parallels real life so completely that you feel for Holden as you would for your closest friend. Having reread this book just after finishing my first year at college, and my first year in the dorm life, it holds new meaning and truths that I skipped over (I think) the first few times I read it. It is a treasure trove of wit and truth for people our age, if you're a little cynical with the world, or maybe just think that books can do a bit more than just depict the world in a picture perfect image with no four-letter words, then this book might just click with you. This isn't everyone's book, though - if the language turned you off (as I know it did so many people) then don't toss off Salinger all together: try Franny &amp; Zooey, almost as great a read, with slightly more refined characters and lifestyles. Either way, you'll get the read of a lifetime"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was referred to by a teacher in a school for gifted students as-&quot;one of the filthiest books I have ever read&quot;I guess that's one way to see it.I see it as a wonderfully funny and sad experience of our world, where education is done by people who are not educators to students who have other agendas than education and where families have no parents and no children and where the world has lost those strange creatures formerly known as human beings.Not to despair, however, because the book is wonderfully alive with humanity, and is also bizarrely edifying and real"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Imagine.....a novel that can be enjoyed by young and oldalike...an assignment that students will actually _enjoy_ reading....abook that will remain true and relate to members of multiple generations. Somehow, J.D. Salinger has created this masterpice which has - and forever will - withstand the test of time.Far too many times have readers been heard muttering \\"That's me - I'm Holden Caufield!\\". Holden represents the restless angst that all of us have experienced at one time or another throughout our lives.High school students may enjoy the book because they think that Holden is \\"cool\\" or rebellious. The more mature reader may pick up on some of the deeper meanings throuout the story - far too many that he can relate to. A warning to the reader who looks deep into the words of Salinger: this story will provoke some sort of self-exploraton and/or reminiscence about ones past.This is the book of the 20th century.

Holden and Salinger's Glass family have provided me thousands of hours of pleasure. No one can ask more of an author"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger is a very interesting person. Although, he would not want you to know that. His views in Catcher in the Rye mirror his real life experience (i.e. his dream about escaping the real world and living in a log cabin in the middle of the woods). Salinger writes in the vernacular- a sure sign of what was to come in literature during the sixties. He writes about life as a teenager so convincingly that I thought at times he was writing about me, about my feelings, my emotions. Not that I am on the urge of a nervous breakdown like Holden; I am just saying that Salinger expressed his intelligence by writing fiction so eloquently that it seemed to be the truth. If you've never read Catcher in the Rye you are missing out. It will surely establish itself as one of the greatest American novels ever written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As one reviewer already noted, Holden is a phoney. I didn't read this book in high school, but many of my college friends did, and loved it. A few of them even started smoking because of this book! I wasn't so impressed. I like Salinger's voice for Holden, but the character isn't that likeable and nothing really happens. The book doesn't break any real ground other than its use of the vain saying &quot;god damn.&quot; It's entertaining, but don't expect to find the meaning of life here."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You're all missing the point. You complain of having been forced to read this book, and perhaps you shouldn't have read it...you can neither comprehend nor understand it, and thus, cannot possibly appreciate it. You come from the MTV generation. You like movies with Keanu Reeves and Brandy, music like Matchbox 20 and Alannis Morisette, and books by John Grissham and Stephen King. These media have subliminally established criteria with which to judge cultural output. Not surprisingly, pop culture meets all these criteria in full. The single largest criterion is that a piece of art (movie, song, or book, etc.) must have an exciting plot, one filled with action or adventure and one that will neatly wrap up at the end, leaving no loose strings untied. The moral, usually very basic and cliche (if there is one at all) will be so blatent and overdone, that it will usually make me sick. That is why, when all of you read The Catcher in the Rye, you were dissappointed. The plot is not very important, and is non-normal to boot. The plot is not integral to the theme, so much so, that the story could have taken place almost anywhere (granted, New York was great because of such things as Broadway and Central Park), and anyhow. This story is not about plot at all, but themes about which Salinger felt he wanted to write. It is about phoniness. It is about hypocrisy. It's about a young man standing on the edge of adulthood, realizing he does not want to be a part of the adult world which he sees waiting ahead of him. Has any other author written so completely, yet at the same time so inconspicuously, about someone's mental collapse? No, this book doesn't have a surprise twist at the end, or a car chase, or anything of that sort. And, no, it doesn't have character development. Holden is, for the most part, a static character, but an interesting, even provacative, static character. Another thing you all have to realize is that it is possible to appreciate an artist's (in this case, an author's) work while at the same time disagreeing with his beliefs. If you don't feel sorry for Holden, or if you think he was a pathetic, pitiful person, you still should be able to look at Salinger's work and view it simply as a different, but still valid, viewpoint. This brings me to my last point. Open your minds. Don't let pop culture influence your judgement of art. Doing so makes you no more than a pre-programmed, conformist robot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Bonjour! This book is C'est Magnifique!

It contains situations all of us in this world will, or already have gone through. Mr. Salinger wrote this book with so much style, I read it non-stop for two days!!

Instead I was forced by my teachers to read fast paced thrillers like Great Expectations, Silas Marner, The Scarlett Letter and Return of the Native. It took me ten years to discover that books were actually written to be enjoyed rather than endured. Had I read Catcher in the Rye as a teenager I would have seen it as a great adventure by an angry young man. Today I read it as a cry for help from a disturbed young man. If Salinger wrote the book today I can't help but wonder if Holden, rather than taking a road trip to New York, wouldn't just steal his fathers 357 and blow away all the people who he believes wronged him. I also wonder how Holden himself, now in his sixties, would critique his own actions. Would he be ashamed of his behaviour or proud of tell his grandhildren about it? Somehow I believe even though he may look back fondly at his actions, he wouldn't share that with either his children or grandchildren."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was the turning point of my life as an English student. Holden's first-person vernacular expresses the inner, repressed voice of many, something unqiue to this book alone.

Beyond the initial reactions, the teenage world of conflict between isolation and acceptance is powerfully portrayed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is vividly written.

Holden is truly depressed and no matter what happens know one can stop him from spiraling into chaos.

Salinger. However, as I wrote the review I realized many things that led to me having a negative view of the book. The foremost problems are the lack of a plot, the lack of character development, and the lack of ability to relate to the main character.The \\"plot\\" in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" revolves around a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield. The reader follows Holden of an aimless romp through New York City as he does whatever his mind leads him to. There are no conflicts that lead up to a climax, and there is no definite resolution.The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a depressed boy who hates everything he sees. He is constantly comparing everything to his dead brother, Allie, who he views as the only perfect person in the world. In addition to this, Holden is both a heavy smoker and a heavy drinker. At one point he even orders a prostitute, although he doesn't have the willpower to do anything with her. The character is the same at both the beginning and end of the story - He doesn't want to put any effort into his schoolwork. This shows that throughout his journey he did not improve upon his main problem.It is very difficult to relate to Holden because of his actions. He acts so negatively all the time that many people cannot find redeeming qualities in him, and thus find it difficult to sympathize with Holden. When at the end it appears as though he got no gain from his troubles it crushes the hope many readers still hold that he could improve.While the writing is good, good writing cannot make a story all on its own. The lack of plot, character development, and a relatable character make this a novel that is difficult to enjoy. There are very strong messages that are put forward in the story, but they are hard to receive. I give \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" a 3/5."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye thoroughly disappointed me with its plot, but after reflecting on it for a while I realized the point was not to create a riveting story that people would enjoy, it was to show the reality of a life, a life living in the simple agony of depression. In some form or another it seems people are very disturbed at the cut and dry simplicity of the book.What Catcher lacks in plot, it makes up for with character. You either love or hate Holden, there is absolutely no in-between. Personally as someone who has suffered a lot of grief while trying to grow up and blow away I found it easy to empathize with Holden. Yes, he cusses a lot and a lot of things bug him, but honestly you must not be very observant if you did not catch some of the important questions Holden asked or some of his thoughts towards life. In Robert Burns's poem Catcher in the Rye, the original text is \\"if a body meet a body coming through the rye\\", but Holden is mistaken and thinks the line is \\"if a body catch a body\\". This is one of the most important elements of the novel, as it represents Holden's attachment to innocence. Holden says he wants to be the Catcher in the Rye and to catch children before they fall off the edge of the cliff, a cliff that Holden thinks he has already fallen off of.That's not to say there is no plot. Holden makes some very interesting interactions during his final days at Pencey and in New York. It is these interactions that are extremely important and show Holden's true character. For example, when Holden's room mate, Stradlater, returns from a date with Holden's old neighbor Jane Gallagher, Holden is concerned that Stradlater has had sex with her even though he doesn't even care about her. They get into a fight and Holden ends up with a bloody nose, however this is one of the first scenes that shows Holden's grip on innocence.I think it's hardest for people to relate to Holden if they've never felt the grief of the transformation into adulthood. At the ripe age of sixteen it is easier than ever for me to understand Holden's despair. If everything could just stay the same, and we could be frozen into a period of time where we feel no longing for the past or expectations for the future, and all the phonies don't exist yet, then the heart would feel less heavy. Holden merely longs for a past we aren't even sure we can believe we had. The reader only get's to see Holden as he is now and it's disappointing for a lot of people, but it IS the story. Holden is not going to change. That's the point, he's finally gotten to the point of not changing because he's so stuck in the past. If you don't open up and let society in a little and give the phonies the time of day you might just end up a bit crazy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"well this book was the only one that i enjoyed reading this year. all the books that we read in my class were okay and i didn't really enjoy then nor really paid attention to them but this book this book was the only one that catched my attention. the way of the writing and the descrition of things it just cought my attention and his little adventures that he went through in such a small time they were fantastic so weird to be read in a book. it was easy reading it too becasue it didnt have long or hard words and i could relate to the character in some of the scenes. the main character was anoying sometimes cause of how he talked but hes a good character and he made the story enjoyable. i would totally recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger is unlike anything else I have read, and I am glad of that. This book is spoiled by the expectation that Holden is relatable to every teenager in the world. Pieces of Holden can certainly be seen in some but he is not in every man. Holden is pessimistic and unhappy with his situation but for all his complaining he has no desire to change. He chooses misery when he could attempt to achieve more. Holden is going through an experience of finding himself that everyone faces but the expectation that everyone faces it exactly as Holden does makes the story suffocating.Another thing that made this book difficult for me to enjoy was the language. Adjectives are replaced with swear words, which only causes me to feel further from Holden. Yes, as a high school student I hear it often, but Holden's reliance on curse words is not present in any one I know. The language adds to the feeling that the novel is a cloud hanging over your head. Everything is grey and seems hopeless in the world Salinger creates. This assists Holden in an inability to see the good in any part of his world. The people he comes in contact with are all phonys or perverts. While he sees himself as flawed, and accepts it, he expects everyone else to be perfect.Another downfall was this book's lack plot. Each event simply happens without building up to anything in particular. While what the story needs most of all is a change. This book may have once had the potential to build up to a restoration of faith in humanity, but instead it only brings forward more doubt and pessimism.Overall the thing I despise most about this book is that it lacks hope. There is no chance that things could get better. Everyone goes through growing up in their own way, sometimes with experiences similar to Holden's, yet each must find something that helps them move past it. Salinger seems to have forgotten this in Catcher in the Rye.Despite all these flaws, it is understandable why this book is considered a classic. Salinger does a good job of creating believable characters, whether or not you like them. The story isn't hard to wrap your head around and so it can be read quickly. Catcher in the Rye is not one I would read again, but perhaps some will find insight in this story. I do not recommend this for anyone who is easily swayed by the things they read. It would be all too easy for such a person to adapt Holden's negative view of the world around them and forget that there is still good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"his Book \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D Salinger was introduced to me in my sophomore year. I believe this book can really relate to most teenagers going through a somewhat rebel phase.Holden is a teenager who seems to think everyone is a phony. He lies about pretty much everything and anything. A powerful theme I found in this book is \\"Alienation as a form or self-protection \\". \\"Don't ever tell anybody anything, if you do, you start missing everybody.\\" Holden's character basically isolates himself from everyone because he feels that either they don't care about his problems because he doesn't or just the fact that letting people in on his life will cause him to grow some type of affection towards them. Holden is pretty straightforward throughout the book but uses terms like \\"kills me\\" to show that something actually got to his hardened heart.Overall this is a great read I strongly recommend this book to any teenager.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the best narrators ever.

The way it's written, the main character, or outdated social norms seem to annoy many people to the point where they can no longer even attempt to enjoy or find meaning in the novel. People fail to see how original this book is, considering the fact that it was written at a time in which questioning the norm would be frowned upon. And this book questions everything about our society and culture that most just willingly accepted.Catcher in the Rye is an odd recollection of a couple days in the life of the main character, Holden Caulfield. The story is an interwoven thread of Holden's account of this time and his past memories, thoughts, and feelings, that pull the story way off topic. It's jumbled, it's clumsy, it's amusingly random, and yet it's so real. Holden's voice stays true and consistent throughout, and it feels like he's talking right to you and explaining his world to you as best as he can. There are no frills, no exquisite detail or anything else added to the story. It's straightforward and direct.The way the story is told definitely something a lot of readers will hate. The improper grammar also will cause some to cringe.Readers also may not like the digressions, or the slow pace, or the long ramblings Holden sometimes falls into.It all depends on what you think makes good writing. If you think of good writing in the sense of correct grammar, beautiful descriptions and a flowing plot that moves constantly forward, you will probably dislike this book.But if you read it with the hope of getting into the mind of a troubled teenager and learning about the way he sees the world, I think you will enjoy this book. I think that a lot of people will be able to identify with Holden and his feelings and confusion and worries. And although things have changed a lot since the time the novel takes place in, I found that almost everything could be adapted to fit in today's world. The ideas behind everything are just as true today. However, the reader has to remember that people had different viewpoints at that time than today, and so a lot of viewpoints were different.This book is wonderful. I was skeptical at first, but after reading this story, I found so much I could connect with and so much that is and will forever be true to humanity. It's not for everyone, but I think some will be able to really appreciate it for what it is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's book The Catcher in the Rye is a good book teenagers can relate to. This is a coming of age novel about a teen age boy named Holden Caulfield. He got kicked out of prep school and instead of going home he stayed the weekend in New York City. Holden has to deal with the death of his younger brother, troubled sexuality, and the feeling of loneliness. On the edge of a nervous breakdown Holden has trouble dealing with the phoniness of the adult world he is about to enter. However, \\"It's really ironical, because I'm six foot two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of my head - the right side - is full of millions of gray hairs. I've had them ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve.\\" Holden still tries to hold on to childhood.I personally like the writing style of this book. The style is from the 1940s, but it is easy to understand. You are able to imagine what the narrator is talking about. You can also easily imagine the setting almost like you were there. Holden, the narrator never really describes his nervous breakdown, but it becomes clear in the novel he is growing unstable.What I like most about the book is the way you can relate to it in some way. You can understand or imagine clearly what Holden is going through. This is an all out good book I would recommend other people to read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one whom the Lord in His mercy has made trustworthy.\\" -- 1 Corinthians 7:25 (NKJV)My last reading of The Catcher in the Rye came about 50 years ago. I loved it then for its validation of so many feelings I had about how fake most people were. My friends and I had wonderful discussions about specific chapters that helped draw us closer together.I didn't feel any need to reread the book until Kenneth Slawenski's new biography of Salinger caused me to wonder what my reaction to the book would be as a new grandfather, rather than as a young teen.Sometimes rereading a book enjoyed in youth is simply a trip down memory lane. In this case, I found that my memory of the book was quite fresh. Knowing what was coming next caused me to appreciate more of the storytelling skill that connected all the episodes and chapters together. Being older and having read a lot more, I could also appreciate a lot more of the literary references that went over my head before.Having become a nonfiction author who loves to use stories to convey \\"truth,\\" the writing craft was much more apparent this time. In particularly, I had failed to appreciate that each chapter is really a short story . . . but that each story proceeds in a sequence that builds into a novel.On the first reading, I picked up that something was wrong in Holden Caulfield's life. On this reading, that hidden pain screamed out at me.I also now see parallels to Don Quixote that I missed before because I hadn't yet read that seminal novel.So what's the story about? In the space of a few hours and two cities, Holden Caulfield stands astride the worlds of childhood innocence and adult cynicism. His desire to do the right thing and to protect the innocence allows him to stretch across that \\"impossible\\" chasm. The lessons are much more universal than what a \\"coming of age\\" novel usually portrays. The lessons here are more like those in Huckleberry Finn than they are in novels about teens dealing with their angst.The theme is actually broader than that. As much as Holden is repelled by people, he is also drawn to them. He's making a spiritual pilgrimage from youthful, critical judgment of all into loving all those in God's creation.Ultimately, it's a beautiful story that will bring out your finest sensibilities. When was the last time that a novel did that for you?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Oldie but a goodie.. My book club reviewed tis book and agree that itis a good one to read over and over again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While reading The Catcher in The Rye by J D Salinger, one should keep in mind that the book is writing in the point of view of a teenager. Also keep in mind that this book takes place in the early 1920's. Therefore the customs and ways of life are way different than they are today. The book is about a boy who doesn't really understand himself or anything that is happening in his life. It's about a teen that goes against his morals and values to try and figure out who he is. Through out the book the teenager experiences a lot of different situations.Holden is the main character in this book. In the book he is the one who narrates everything. He explains everything in great detail. You would think that being the character that he is, that detail wouldn't matter to him. Holden is a teenage boy who drops out of a school called Pency Prep. He decides to run away for a while, that way his parents can get over the shock of him leaving the prep school. Holden would have gone home, but this wasn't the first time he had dropped out of a school.Stradlater, Holden's roommate at Pency is a jock who Holden doesn't stop talking about. Stradlater seems to be the kind of guy who really likes to use girls. He goes out on a date with a girl named Jane, who Holden knew from his past when he used to live in New York.Jane is the girl that Holden talk about a lot in the book. Jane and Holden used to be next door neighbors with each other. Holden and Jane used to play checkers with each other in the summer.The theme of this book is showing how an unmotivated teenager develops morals and values by finding himself through out the book. By figuring out what he wants to do and what he cares about, Holden finds himself.Through out the book Holden travels to a lot of places. He is really confused and is embarrased and afraid to go home, because of what his parents will think. Holden tired to figure out who he is, and along the way he makes friend and he looses some. There are times in the book where he does care about things but then there are other times where it seems that he has no dignity and that he doesn't care about anyone, sometimes not even himself.What really makes Holden change at the end of the book is that he goes home when his parents aren't there and visits his sister Phoebe. He talks to her and she tells him that she wants him to come home and stay home. Holden doesn't know what he wants to do. Phoebe makes a big impact on Holden at the end of the book and he makes a decision that he has to live with. But I think it's a pretty good one.At the end of the book things are solved but it doesn't really say what happens to the characters. The author ends the book by having Holden say that he doesn't want to say anything else and that he doesn't want to tell you the rest of what happens.I really disliked this book. The narration was really bad. I think that having Holden always contradicting himself made it really hard to understand what he did believe in. I also didn't like it, because the ideas in the book were really random. Holden goes from leaving his school, to getting drunk, to finding a prostitute, and then going to a museum with his younger sister. I think there were too many ideas in the book. So many that it almost made the book misleading. And another big thing was that there was too much swearing that occurred. There were nasty words that were said on almost every page in the book. I was told that this book was really popular, and still is, but I don't understand how a book that has really no ending to it could be called a classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I did not like the book Catcher in The Rye by J. D. Salinger. I thought that the main character Holden Caulfield is very arrogant and opinionated. He knows that he is mentally loose, but he goes on through the story without getting any help. Anyone who has different beliefs than him is a phony. Anytime he is socially insecure about himself he makes a wrong decision, like when he blows the smoke in the nuns face. Holden is especially uneasy about his relation ship with girls. In my opinion all he really needs is to lose the attitude and to listen to someone that can help him.The part of the novel that I did enjoy was when Holden finally went home to visit phoebe. Holden has a true appreciation to her innocence. This is the final reason on why he stays home and does not go out west. I also liked the fact that the story began and ended in the mental hospital, which helps to explain some of Holden's mental trouble. Holden uses some language that shows his instability and why he has failed out of three schools.I think that Holden feels that he has to keep up to his fathers' standard as his two brothers did. In my opinion part of the reason for his mental breakdown is due to the death of his brother Allie. He references Allie several times in the novel when he is asked what makes him happy. Again this relates to the loneliness and depressing attitude of the story. Overall in my opinion, I do not recommend reading this book due to the negative character and unnecessary language."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book on the story of a boy. I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought this book was one of the most depressing books I have ever read. I thought it was a bad book and gives a bad example of teens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If Salinger had a broader vocabulary this book would probably be a worthwhile read. The insight into an adolescent boy's thought and emotion is interesting. Parts of it are pretty humorous. Unfortunately almost every paragraph of the first 5 chapters is rife with unnecessary cursing and swearing. (Yes, I know some kids do talk that way, but the story would have been just as potent without the bad language.) I stuck it out through the ninth chapter, and gave up. I don't want Holden's &quot;edgy&quot; language in my thoughts, or my speech."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Possibly. The main character is a rude foul mouthed teenager. As a \\"coming of age\\" story it fails miserably. The lack of plot could be overlooked if like Fitzgeralds 'This Side of Paradise' the main character were simply a deeply flawed narcicist wondering about aimlessly, were it not for the lackluster writing of the author.In reading 'Catcher in the Rye' I found myself yearning for the end; waiting, hoping for a \\"point\\". The ending came, the point of the story never did. It read like the juvenile ramblings of a lost teenager and not an intelligent one at that.I view the time I spent reading this book as well as the money I spent on it as a complete waste. My biggest regret is that I shall never recoup the time lost which could have been better employed reading something worth while."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Cynicism, ennui and negativity... it must be a guy thing.Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from boarding school and is rambling home.

Seems like a no-brainer that the grrrls won't understand. Well, I suppose it's good training for the rest of life..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a really great book, but the ending wasn't so great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I honestly tried to find merit in this book. I've read countless reviews and commentaries on the book to see if, perhaps, there was some larger issue I was missing. Most people's statements as to this books merit center around the \\"through a teenager's eye\\" idea.THAT is my problem. I was a teenager once. I KNOW teenagers now. I have a friend with a 12-year old. She's TWELVE, and she is more eloquent, well-stated, and articulate than the character in this book. She's even more articulate when she's being a WHINY 12-year old. I've never met a single teenager (without significant learning disabilities) than cannot speak AND write better.Aside from that, Holden seems to portray the maturity of a 13-year old boy. Of the older teenage boys I know (ranging in age from 15-17), none of them are this shallow, inarticulate or self-absorbed. All of them have a broader grasp of the world and their own future.I cannot relate to this book from my own life and experiences. If there is someone who can enlighten me with information as to WHY this book is a classic that is not and does not border on pretentious crap, I'd be grateful."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is what society calls good? Ive spent weeks on end by my self in situations like this and let me tell you as an adolcent teen it doenst work like that. The book over analyzes things. Like the over emphais on sex, smoking and drinking. While both are a mjor part of a teens life they do not entirely consume it. And prostition? Come on, would an 16 year old really resort to a hooker? All in all the writing was good becuase as you can probably tell i have no respect for proper english. The swearing was tried and poor, It was like a five year old trying to impress his brothers older friends. After reading the whole book im left with questions, not about what happend, but what would compell a person to write a story in this style."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read this book I thought that Holden had the world figured out.

I grew up in a blue-collar neigborhood where you went to work young and school was secondary. Unfortunately, most times you were judged by your cloths, your car and how much you had in your pocket. By the time I was ten I read just about every sports book in my local library. However, when I picked up this book in 1964...I understood the true importance of reading. Salinger is a carpenter and his tools are words. This book moved an entire generation."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I like the negative reviews better then the positive ones. I think the negative reviews capture Salinger's phony point better then the positive reviews.We all know some &quot;Holdens&quot;, most of us never really bother to get to know them. Some of us can't handle even thinking about them (see any really negative review). I knew a &quot;Holden&quot; that killed himself in 10th grade. This book made me really think of him. Too bad he didn't have a sister like Phoebe.Salinger takes you inside his &quot;Holden's&quot; head for a few days. It isn't pleasant. Holden can make George Carlin look like an optimist. Salinger jumps right in - it's raw and has an edge.Very good book. I don't think it captures the same feeling in 2002 as it did in 1951. I can't believe it came out in the 1951. We're talking about 1951, most people couldn't handle Elvis shaking his hips on TV!

I had just read &quot;The Perks of Being a Walflower,&quot; which is an excellent book by...someone that slips my mind at the moment. However, the book was a diary type thing with the main character writing letters to this person that we never meet. I'd thought the book would put me in the mood for reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; a 'coming of age story.' Unfortunately I was wrong. I thought that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was about some guy who complains about his life the whole time, and when he's not doing that, he's talking about some girl. Now, okay, I'm female. So, maybe this book is really great for guys, but it did not speak to me whatsoever at all. The book is also written in the 50's so a lot of the slang and morals are out of fashion and not understandable. At the end, he finally made some great discovery or something. And the ending wasn't all that bad. Maybe if I could have related more to the book I would have enjoyed it further. Therefore, I'm just warning all you girls out there, that it's not exactly a wonderful experience"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I started reading this book prepaired to be bored out of my scull.

That's the only word I can think of that sums up the book. It's TRUE. The book is about Holden, who was just expelled from school, and how he wanders around New York City for three days before finally deciding to go home. Holden is angry at how the world is, and at how people are. I felt that Holden was seeing the world through the eyes of someone going through the transition from childhood to adulthood, and is angry at the insincerity of the world. He doesn't want to be a part of it, but at the same time, he lies a lot and sometimes tries to be something he's not. He's a teenager. At any rate, just read it for yourself. People will try to tell you what to think of this book. They analyze it to pieces. Even if it's no more that a good story to you, just make the decision on your own."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this was an amazing and touching book. i usually dont enjoy reading books, but holdens story touched mine and many others hearts. this is truly a materpiece"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sometimes people forget that literature is really about reminding us what is it like to be human - to succumb to feelings of sadness &amp; hopelessness &amp; futility, to want to escape, to want to love &amp; protect, the way we contradict ourselves etc. This is partly why I read, to discover parts of myself in others &amp; know I am not isolated. Catcher in the Rye was the first novel that really opened up literature for me. It struck me totally (I remember opening it up to scan the first page or so - something I usually do - &amp; not looking back up until about ten chapters later). Holden Caulfield is a very real character, for me immediately identifiable. For months after reading the book his voice floated around my head. It tapped into my own feelings &amp; thoughts at the time with what we are presented with daily, expected to grow up into &amp; be a part of with little thought (it sounds so cliched, but it's true!) I mean, I read this more than forty years after it was published (3-4 years ago), &amp; it is a meandering, conversational, slang-filled book, but it still has not worn much at all. I think it is one of the great novels of the 21st century. (What's this stuff about it being full of profanity? get a grip, there's only one f-word in it &amp; even that's blanked out, talk about living in a dreamworld if you think youth don't swear in casual conversation - even by 1940/50s standards).

It was the key to the biography falling into place and being easier to read.Thre was something I still do not understand. It is supposedly a &#34;favorite of serial or mass killers&#34;.

As it is set in New York I started reading it on the plane from New York to London. And did I enjoy it?! Man, what have I been thinking, waiting so long? I got so much on terms with Holden Caulfield, that I started to write like him in a couple of letters I wrote. The evening I arrived in London there was a brilliant documentary about J.D. Salinger on TV. I was totally absorbed, and enjoyed every page of the book, admired Salinger's portrayal of adolescence. Such a comic and touching novel. I continued to read it on the train up north through Sweden and at some stage laughed so much I had to put the book down - people were looking strangely at me.

True, the book is about a couple of days in a sixteen-year-old's life, but there is a point, a reason in which Holden Caulfield explains about those particular days of his life. There is a process of alienation which occurs throughout the book and finally comes to a hidden conclusion at the end of the book, which results in having to read the last chapter very carefully to find out about Holden's whereabouts at that point. I had to read the last chapter three times before I finally understood where he really was and why he didn't give details in that chapter. All in all, this is a fantastic book about alienation and adaptation only for those who truly understand it, and for those who don't understand the meaning, it is a funny story about a cynical teenager's life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a wonderful book of observations from the eyes of a teenager.

I also thought the the story and the other characters could have been more developed and more 3 demsional, as a result of this it would help the reader feel a much more personal relationship with the main character.

No doubt the story is a classic, but I found it somewhat distracting to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was an alright novel. It talked about a lot of real issues that face many people in the world. The novel was also very desciptive and sometimes you could get wraped up in it like you were there. Parts of it were heart-warming, like when he talks about his brothers and sister. Also when he talks about his dead brother you could tell he was a really sensitive guy. However, the novel did have a lot of cursing and most of it was about women, drinking and smokingand so on. All Holden, the main character who told the story in first person, talked about was being depressed and hating even the smallest things. It was kind of ridiculus of how many stupid things made him feel depressed and it got old after a while. If you read the book for long periods of time it could even make you depressed. He also acted very craze(mentaly) and most of his decisions were extremly childish and you would say to yourself why would a 16-17 year old do that. Besides that the book had to do with a lot of real-life problems and it could even give a little tug at you heart and that is why I gave it a rating of three stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger's work, The Catcher in the Rye, is a timeless tale that applies to life today as well as it did when he wrote it. The main character, Holden, is a young man with whom many young people can relate today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was clear to me that I wasn't going to get attached to the plot ot the book about half way through with reading it. It isn't a book you would read for a suspense and a awesome ending either. It is more of the narration by the main character in the book named Holden that really draws you to this novel written by J.D. Salinger. The Catcher in the Rye was a book that i enjoyed becuase of this style of writting. I often found myself laughing out loud because of the different things Holden would be saying out loud of thinking in his head and sharing with the reader. It made very good attempts to show the fustration of Holden and did a great job of keeping it real. By the middle of the book you sort of knew exacltly what to expect from Holden but you still never kne what he would say. Lets just say he rarely surprised you through his actions or what he told the readers. Although few of us go to the extreme in some cases as he does but it is sometimes easy to relate to his fustraion with the simplest things. Don't get this book if you are into a great suspense but if you really enjoy reading new styles of writting and different kinds of books &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one that you will definitly enjoy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it and it just gets better every time. You get to look into the mind of a boy, Holden, who is obviously having trouble dealing with life in general and even though this kid is not all there you can connect with him. Some of the things Holden feels I am sure we have all felt before such as the way he looks at people as &quot;phonies&quot;. He looks at society as being full of people that just aim to please others and don't speak their mind even though he is one of those people. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like Alex in &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; Holden jumps off the page due to the wonderful narration.

Holden's story is of course &quot;dated&quot; at this point but chances are I'll probably think of him on those days when I feel like I'm about to go over the edge myself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was completely in awe of the way Salinger captured the human thought process and experience. I felt as if I was within the mind of Holden experiencing his stream of conciousness. The book had an increadible insight into the human mind and condition; that of uncertainty, hopelessness, self-doubt and anxiety. Through the eyes of a distraught and troubled teenager I was able to learn so much about myself. I would highly recomend this book to anyone who is facinated by humanity and has an open mind. What makes the piece so real is also what makes it so disturbing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i've reviewed this book before, in the summer of 98. i've reread this book a few times and i love it. i really can relate to Holden especially since i have also been clinically depressed. This novel is great because it combines humor with more important themes like death and the difficult transition into adulthood. i love the scene where Holden's old teacher can chuck his exam paper on the bed. also Ackley adds humor with all his crumby habits. i really don't understand why some people hate it, i guess it's a question of taste."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The catcher in the rye\\" is the story of some days in Holden Caulfied's life, as he tells it in the hospital where he was taken after his \\"meltdown\\". In his own words, \\"I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy\\".The plot is quite simple, mainly what happens when a particularly sensitive teenager gets kicked out of school, and decides to travel alone a little bit instead of just telling his parents what happened. However, even if the main premise is common enough, the way it is delivered is what makes this book so special that it has become a classic. Salinger makes us get to know Holden, giving the reader interesting insights into his musings, likes and dislikes (yeah, generally mostly dislikes).You want some examples?. For instance, and regarding teachers, he says that \\"You can't stop a teacher when they want to do something. They just do it\\". Or when he starts to think about the things we say over and over again, without giving them any actual meaning: \\"I'm always saying \`Glad to \`ve met you\` to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though\\".Holden's views are interesting, and different readers will interpret them in diverse ways, specially if their age isn't the same. To teenagers, Holden reflects the highs and lows they have to deal with, and their struggle with the \\"phony world\\" of adults that sometimes seems so weird, so wrong. To adults, Holden is a part of themselves that they somehow lost with the years, the innocence and the shock before things they have grown accustomed to with time.There are quite a few symbols in this book, but you will able to understand it even if you don't know a thing about symbology (or aren't interested in it). Despite that, I'd like to share with you a specially important symbol, the catcher in the rye that gives this book its title. Holden wants to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up: \\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\\" . He doesn't know why, he just wants to come out from somewhere and catch little children before they fall from the cliff. In a way, that shows how much he wants to preserve their innocence, against a phony world that tries to corrupt them...I really liked this book, and I found it engaging and very easy to read. I'm not from USA, so I didn't have to read it as obligatory reading material for school, but I ended up reading it all the same mainly out of curiosity because many of my American friends recommended it to me. After reading \\"The catcher in the rye\\", I must say that they were right, and I would like to recommend this book to you, if you haven't read it yet. And if you are forced to read it for school, please JUST GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY. I know it is hateful having to read something merely because someone says so, but in this case that will work to your advantage... What can I say?. This book, unlike so many others, is really WORTH YOUR TIME.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the best book that has ever been written since the start of modern literature. Ok, the beginning of my review could seem a bit cheesy but the impact this book had on me was so striking that i don't even know where i should start from. However, the more you read about the \\"madman stuff\\" that happened to Holden Caulfied in a cold December in NY city after he got kicked out of prep school, the more sympathy you feel for him, the more thoughts and feelings you share with him. He's just a nonconformist teenager that really hates movies and hypocrisy, has to deal with a lot of peers and adults that turn out to be extremely phony and ready to deceive each other for their personal interest. He realises his perception of the world is different from the one he had in his childhood, when everything seemed fine and everybody loyal to one another. Therefore he wishes he could look after all the young kids who aren't yet aware of the hypocrisy that affects human beings and these feelings are really strong whenever he's next to his little sister Phoebe, who could be regarded as the epitome of sincerity and need of protection.You will fall in love with Holden's forthright way of thinking, you'll end up sticking up for him during the tons of arguments he has with \\"phony bastards\\" such as his arrogant and conceited roommate Stradlater or a pimp that tries to fix him up with a young prostitute, you'll get very emotional when reading about Holden's deceased brother Allie, you'll be amused when the starring of this book is taking the piss out of his nerdy roommate Ackley, you'll get really involved while reading about the topsy and turvey relationship Holden has with girls and sex, you'll be glued to the pages of the book when Holden narrates about the good time he had with Jane - a girl he is very fond of - and how different she is from the others, you'll end up taking a taxi and asking the driver whether he knows where all the ducks and coots go in the wintertime when the lagoon is very icy and frozen. You'll change your way of regarding people, I mean, you'll start loving people you are getting along well with, you will literally hate people that do not give you any kind of vibe.You'll realise how rare Holden's sincerity is, above all in a particular society where a teenager's biggest concern is the quality of his leather suitcases that could look tacky if compared to his roommate's ones."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book started out pretty good. In fact, the middle was fair, but the ending was atrocious.This book is about Holden Caulfield, a young man that isn't enjoying a whole lot of life. He's been kicked out of yet another prep school and he's on his way back home to be chastised by his family. The book is in first person and it is Holden telling the story. Throughout, we are introduced to several of Holden's old acquaintences and what he thought of them. The story progresses all the way to the point where Holden returns home and visits with his younger sister.And THEN.... bam.... the ending... which wasn't there.I really didn't enjoy this book much. It reads quickly, which is about the only thing going for it. Even in it's briefness, it was wordy and had many two page paragraphs, which most high school English teachers would blow a gasket over. I enjoyed the slang, but it seemed overdone.It's not one of the worst books I've ever read, but in it's in the lower 10%. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who actually enjoys reading for a well thought out story with a good ending. I would recommend it to high school students who have reading requirements. Like I said, it reads quickly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can't imagine a literate teenager who would not enjoy this book. Salinger perfectly captures the adolescent worldview: most people are \\"phonies\\"; the world is more twisted and sick than our parents and teachers would have us believe; and, the prospect of sex is altogether pervasive, exciting, and scary. Holden Caulfield, the book's protagonist, relates an adventure that is no less compelling because it is realistic. Who wouldn't want to escape into the underside of New York City for a week or so after being tossed out of prep school? Be careful of your peers who take this book too seriously, though: Mark David Chapman, after he shot and killed John Lennon, pulled \\"CATCHER\\" out of his pocket and calmly sat reading it while he waited for the police to arrive. Best line: Sickened by a woman who pretends to be moved by an artistic performance, while treating the children with her unkindly, Holden remarks that she is \\"as compassionate as a goddamned wolf.\\" [The book, of course, was written before people *liked* wolves.]"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i have always heard about this book but never actually read it. then one day my junior year in HS i saw it lying somewhere under a seat and decided why the heck not? so i took it...after reading this book in two days i fell in love and decided to keep it. the only thing that upsets me is that the cover is plain and boring yet the story behind it isnt at all. i have read this book many times over and over and it is the best classic i have ever read. i recommend this book to everyone. Holden Caulfield is one character you wont forget."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really do not see where all the confusion lies in getting the point of the book. Holden is having a very difficult time trying to work through the death of his younger brother. As adults, we can more predictably go through the stages of grief, but, as adolescents, we struggle through the death of loved ones in the context of our struggle for identity. We not only try to find a career for ourselves but also prove our loyalty to our friends, imitate role models, solidify our sexual identity, and form ideologies. Often, we say and do the opposite of what we mean because we find our feelings are so intense that we could not admit it straight out to the people around us and ourselves yet still be accepted. Imagine how hard it would be to go through your teen years having lost a sibling. Holden really does try to reach out to all the people he meets, but unfortunately, cannot express concretely what he is feeling; instead, he acts out with smoking, drinking, losing sleep, and searching for sexual escapades. Eventually, he runs himself down physically and mentally. Sadly, many adults do not see, or do not want to bear the responsibility, of getting teenagers to better express themselves and instead shame them. This book is a wonderful portrayal of an adolescent as he journeys down a path of depression and self-destruction until his family and the health-care profession intervene with acceptance and love."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Cacher in the Rye ( by J.D. Salinger )My opinion about the bookAlthough I was not acustomed to the particular language used in this book, I found it rather pleasant to read. It is a simple book, with a simple storyline and easy characters. The main character isHolden Caulfield. Holden has been expelled from school and he is afraid of the reaction of his parents, so he leaves school and takes a room in a hotel. He wants to give his parents the time to calm before he faces them. (This is are the big lines of the story.)The book is written completely from Holden's perspective and you really get to know him after a wile. I like Holden Because you can't really tell if he has an inferiority complex or if he's just not intelligent enough to really understand what is going on around him. He has only one vision of the things and it doesn't come up to him that there could be other visions. (that's why sometimes he doesn't quite understand the reaction of certain people around him.- Why Sally likes &quot;The Lunts&quot; e.g.)The autor describes the other characters who interfer with Holden as closed chapters of Holden's life. (e.g. Ackley, Stradlater, Sally,...)I like that. It is like sitting in a train and you look outside and you see everything going by without having seen it correctly when it was in front of you. The atmosphere described in the book is somewhat dark, melancholic and dreamy. It is the perfect setting for a guy like Holden. You sometimes can recognize yourself in him because he struggles with the same little troubles we have to deal with. This book is easy to comprehend also because of the simple way of thinking of the characters and their natural actions. The people in this book are very natural and that is good because everyone likes natural people in books (e.g. NOT James Bond).The book is not too thick and you don't get bored easily, but you have to follow the story. I like this book because it is different. It is the story of the life of a person like there are so many other lifestories. The simple formulations of the thoughts of Holden and the easy analysis of the characters would make it almost a book for children if the situation of those characters hadn't been so actual and recognisable for a more adult public. In fact, it is a simplification of a story that describes the failure of the life of a man who doesn't know what to expect from the future.I enjoyed this book and recommend it to others.This was my opinion about &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am so sick of everyone who thinks there are some intelligent critic that knows more about everything than everybody else. No doubt, they will look at this review, notice that I choose not to use any &quot;big&quot; words and deem myself not on their level.The simple fact is that this book is the 1 book that I can actually read without getting bored. The reason.....it shows the truth behind every &quot;phony&quot; thing in this world. Who cares about all that other critic rhetoric. The beauty in the book is that it tells the straight forward, no BS truth. Read it, enjoy it, read it again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was seventeen when I first read this book and quickly became obsessed with it. Why? Because, unlike so many pieces of literature, it didn't FEEL like literature. It felt like LIFE to me. I was a young man, and it struck a chord with me. The story doesn't consist of situations that feel carefully plotted...they just seem to HAPPEN, as they do in life. And the writing style isn't typical high-brow creative-writing-class style. It's real...as if someone were telling a story and you were listening. Okay...so Holden may have his problems, he may be misguided, he may be at fault in certain situations...but he isn't perfect...that's the point...he's just a human being...like any of us. He hasn't got it all figured out...or even close. He's just working with what he has...living the life he's been given. And he's honest...when he errs, he admits it full-on and takes responsibility. And when faced with dishonesty, he recoils in disgust. The fact that there are people who CAN'T UNDERSTAND why so many readers relate to Holden is astounding to me. He's just like so many of us in so many ways...he's confused, he's discontented, he's fed up, he's lonely, and he's bitter. It's our faults, not our virtues, which make us human. And Holden Caulfield embodies so much of the human spirit that over a half-century after the first printing of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; so many people still find this book fascinating...because they can look at Holden and say, in at least a few instances, &quot;I've been there.&quot; And whether we like to admit it or not, there's a little bit of Holden in all of us. It's his faults that make us real...and it's his virtues that make us shine."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this book is one of if not the best book i have ever read. the book is so true to life it is almost scary. some things bother people or depress people, but you must get over them or you will end up like Holden"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently read the Catcher in the Rye, and I didn't think it was all that great.

It also seemed very likely that he had bipolar disorder.The reason why I think I was able to keep reading the book up until the end is because I can kind of identify with Holden. Aside from that, Nothing.It was basically a book where nothing happened and I was very disappointed with the way it ended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To give \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" 5 stars is like giving \\"The Complete Works of William Shakespeare\\" 5 stars. I'm not kidding.I read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" in the 8th grade. And, okay, I was a little bit more than entranced by the (shocking!) use of profanity. This was, after all, 1968.But even more, I was mesmerized and enthralled, I was even swept off my little flat feet, by Holden's sensitivity, his absolute purity of heart. Okay, he does wrong things, he engages a prostitute, he flunks out of a very expensive private school when he knows his poor parents have already been put through absolute hell (his younger brother Allie dies of leukemia at the age of 13 and this has already happened at the time the book is being narrated). But at the same time, he is an innocent. He is caught up in place and time that he can't make sense of, simply because he is who he is. He cares, and he tries to take care of others who are lost and floundering. It is so obvious that he is a diamond among rhinestones.So he doesn't fit in anywhere, and neither do most of us. We're just trying to find our way. This is one of the most brilliant studies of adolesence ever written. Holden feels, he lives and breathes, he is, for all his flaws, or maybe even because of them, almost a Christlike figure.J.D. Salinger wrote a book about an adolescent who was, in his way, much like an archetype of innocence. For this he is should be lauded as a literary genius. This book should be taught everywhere as a sort of guidebook to values clarification for the youth of America.Totally aside from that, it is very funny and compulsively readable. No one can possibly be bored with this book, despite its seeming lack of plot.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a life-changing book. Read it. You will never be the same."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I will never forget the first time I read the scene in this book in which Holden's sister, sucked into his fantasy world, is dragging her suitcase through the rain to go on the road with him. The pathos that emanates through Caulfield's cynical narration swept over me. I had to put the book down and think about it.Could it be, that after all these years, Holden's character is still contemporary and relevant? He does not say \\"dude.\\" In fact, for a disaffected, youth he is rather articulate about what is wrong with the world. The world is full of phonies.There is, surprisingly, a lot of Buddhist philosophy expressed in this book. Holden's stoicism is almost Zen-like. But there is more than that. By the time you have read the first few pages, you are inevitably drawn to his character, for all his rude cynicism. How does this work? How did Salinger pull it off?Salinger wrote in a bunker, detatched from his home. He allowed no one to interrupt him, not even his wife. He brought his lunch, in a lunchbox, and ate it there. In my humble opinion, Salinger was able to create Holden because he had the time and space to think it all out.If you have not read this book before, you will, once you have read it, never forget it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has a lot of humour involved in it and its fair share of swear words, oh and \\"phonie\\".

He reminds me to keep if real and be candid with everyone.

I related to his feelings and identified with so many of his comments that I was enthralled in the book for two days and did little else but read it.However, I am not sure if I see what all the hype is about. I wasn't aware that feelings and comments like Holden's were all that uncommon, so why is the book so controversial? Sure, it came out at a time where society was significantly less open about certain topics, but by now, with all the crap we allow to infiltrate the media, it should be old news that teenagers are cynical and irrational and hate everyone, even the people they love, if that makes sense.Am I wrong in saying that I found absolutely nothing wrong or unusual about his thoughts or behaviors? Thus I also did not understand why he was apparently in a mental hospital at the end of the book. I was under the impression that it was pretty much accepted that the entire world is full of \\"phonies,\\" and, yeah, it sucks, but you just kind of have to learn to deal with it in your own way, right? Holden was not mentally ill.I think it is interesting that Lennon's assassin was carrying a copy of the book when he shot him, so I guess he thought Lennon was a \\"phony\\" and that was his way of dealing with it? Also, in the movie Conspiracy Theory, Mel Gibson's character buys a copy of the book every time he sees it, but he's never read it. The book didn't seem to be all that relevant to the movie, in my opinion, but it is another interesting incedent in which this book appeared.Honestly I really liked this book because I really like Holden and related to him, but I fail to see what the big deal is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have to say I haven't read this book since High School. But I think I would like to read it again. Because I doubt I understood it back then.All I have to say is it sounds like many people are giving it a bad review for swearing and behavior generally unbecoming of a teenage male (and then calling the good review posters 'close minded'). This is sad. Whether you like it or not, nowadays teenagers drink, swear, and, well, at least TALK about prostitutes. I know, I was a teenager once. Most teenagers aren't impressionable enough to take up drinking, swearing and the use of prostitutes after reading this book-- if they don't do it already. So you can relax, parents. This book may have been edgy for 1951; nowadays I would think it equates with a PG-13 teen drama.I'm giving the book a neutral 3 stars having not re-read it, but I wanted to get my little comment out here.PS, it's the story that counts, not the 'plot'."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I should have read this book when I was in junior high, 9th grade at most. Perhaps the archetype for the modern me-against-the-world genre, the book is written and read like its character - on its own terms.One thing I enjoyed reading Catcher(which is a breeze, if you don't know) is Salinger's characterization. Holden Caufield is a thorougly original literary creation, and this is precisely why he resembles some of us so much. Making a stand against growing up, the adult world, Caufield's account of life is entirely internalized. His is a world so many of us encounter in the tender-rough years of the midteens - desolate; the people around us - alien; anything that makes us tick - wrong and immoral.Holden Caufield has become synonymous with rebellion, so much so that it was inevitable for him to become a symbol. Breathing life and a fierce air of independence into his hero, Salinger made him so understandable because of his own inability to understand anything. Caufield's inner life, the momentousness of noneventfulness that is the all-too familiar teenageemotional rollercoaster is given full expression. Neither a novel of adventures nor really a novel of \\"ideas,\\" you might call this the novel of protest - not of social protest, but of man against the world.Caufield is the expression of our latent dissatisfaction and bitterness with the way life shoves us along and time steals itself. He is the audacity to walk out on a dishonest lecture class, to escape the friends who all seem so ignorant during a soul crisis, to ditch the drudgery of duty and responsibiliies on a whim. Caufield is Peter Pan with a drinking habit and leery eyes. He has vigor and the failure of rebellion. Caufield is a palpable reality of the man who tries to step outside the sphere of the life he's thrown into. He finds the door, but finally sees it's lonely on the other side. Much like the choices we make when we open the door, Caufield steps back."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For the teenages and preadolences alike who read this novel the broad range of feelings in the goings on within Holden reflects an inner part of what we all could be. The catcher in the rye beautifully answers the question of what would happen if we decided to flunk out of our classes and try to make it on our own. His experiences in dating women, social affairs, and life in general reveal his character as being one of a loser in the eyes of the read. Such a loser that we, ourselves, have to question weither or not we embody at all. Do we, in fact, have problems with women, social functions, or school? For the vast majority of the population that is definitely the case thereby making the reader better able to relate to this boy who has moved in a downward spiral from some of our nation's top schools down to a mental ward reflecting upon the life that, at 17, had all gone terribly wrong.The simple and collequal tone that Salinger gives to his protagonist gives a personal feeling reflecting almost a diary the likes of which far escape Anne Frank or any other such form. The less than eloquent style of writing and speaking that plagues Holden from progression and mirrors his lackluster work put into English provides empathy for a boy feeling as though the world has been coming down upon him as we all do during various points in our tumultious lives, and unlike us, Holden cracks under the pressure and gives into his most basic of sinful desires. While living in a motel he calls upon the services of a women of ill-repute, but backs out at the absolute last minute. When money runs low he has to go back to his sister to ask for some, money that would be taken from her piggy bank. Here a sister looks to help his brother during some of the lowest points of his teenage years. The love between the two shines through, and by the end of the novel the amount of love felt by the Caufield family toward their mentally scarred child comes between the lines.After finishing the novel and before reading it again the idea of who would be to blame for the crime against this young man's well being and general mental health. The family did little to acomidate their son other than pay for him to go an expensive school on the east coast, yet lent no other real moral support per se. The ipso facto education provided by the universities did nothing to remedy the ills in academic and social areas during his stay on campus. Finally Holden's own inability to be mature enough to face to his final sense of failure by going back to his parents all let up to his eventual crack.Salinger looks only to mock the american education system or the lack thereof in prestigious high schools such as Pencey Prep. There he recieved just the same education that he would have while being at a public school, while being provided with more of the types of people that could correctly balence his life. In effect giving him a better chance to steer clear of any problems that he may have had. In the end the paranoid feeling of \\"don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody\\" presents Holden's despiration and sadness at his current state of affairs. Life is beautiful? Hardly, to Holden Caulfield life can be a horribly and competative place the likes of which we all struggle to survive in. What a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this for the first time this summer.

That's the timeless, universal quality of this amazing book. It captures whatever alienation and disgust with society in general are really about, ad distills them into one character that just about everyone I've ever met thinks describes them, at some point in their lives. Once you are done with this book, you will want to read something else that evokes the same emotions, that is written as well, as convincingly. You will search the bookstore shelves. The only thing that will come close is Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, but that's more recent a novel. The Catcher in the Rye is a classic that has not only withstood the test of time, but will still be standing long after most of the books you see around now are long gone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This, as many people know, is one extremely controversial book. Many people dislike simply for that, but I, on the other hand, have reason for it. Sure, I was required to read this for my freshman language arts class, so, like most books one is forced to read, it's expected that the student will dislike it. Once again, not my reason. Unlike so many people around my age, I happen to like reading, and over this past year, this is the first book I have hated out of the sixty or so I read. I'm sure the die-hard fans of this book are going to go completely insane after just simply reading the title of my review, but this is just one person's opinion. I suggest that you read plenty more, because if you don't hate this book, you'll love it.Perhaps the worst part of the book would be the main character Holden. Holden is a very angry, bitter, and mentally unstable sixteen-year-old who can find something annoying or depressing in the most simple of things. It seemed to go on forever, his constant whining about the \\"phonies,\\" or more elaborately put, show-offs and exhibitionists who act like completely different people than they really are. He labels pretty much everyone phony for some reason, and he makes it clear from the first page of his hate of them. The story is told from first person view, hence the complaining. Holden seemed to have an image set in his mind of how other people should be, and should act. In this I'm sure many people can identify with him in some way or another, as so many people have a disrespect for certain types of people. I consider that perfectly acceptable, but the way that Holden constantly went on and on about the phonies and fools who he just couldn't stand just inevitably got on my nerves by the middle of the book.As I said, The Catcher in the Rye is told in first person view. To make the complaining worse, you add on Holden talking all the time. He seems to like to explain things a bit too thoroughly, and, while he gets the point across, he also manages to get off subject so much it's just unbelievable. I read one paragraph which was, I think, over three pages long, and I know that Holden must have changed subject at least five times over the course of it. This is no exaggeration. I know that the most constant complaint in my class was his rambling. It's as if Holden couldn't keep his mind on one thing for more than a few seconds. That certainly wasn't helped when Holden would start talking about phonies. I'm sure that certainly hurt the book quite a bit.Really, I can't think of anything about the book which I enjoyed, other than the first few chapters when I was not yet annoyed be Holden's view of almost all other people. In my opinion, Holden ruined the book completely. I'm not saying that this is not well written literature, but it's just a book I hate. It certainly is realistically written, and the characters are well thought out and realistic, but as I said, you either love it or hate it. I happen to hate it. Many happen to like it. Read some other reviews, otherwise you will just hear the view of one person, when perhaps The Catcher in the Rye may deserve more praise.A bit of feedback please! Helpful or not?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What a useless piece of trash this book is. It's repetitive, annoying, and grating. It really is.

Nope. Identify with all the other 1-Star reviewers? Hell yes!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The character Salinger creates in \\"Catcher,\\" the jaded, world-weary Holden Caulfield, is simplistic and reductionist. There isn't much we can relate to from Holden, and his delineation is weak and sparse: is he the hero, or the anti-hero? I suppose the confusion is purposeful, but that's all I feel when I read this book...and this is considered one of the greatest books written by an American?!? All I can say to that is thank God there are other countries and other types of authors out there, or I would never have been able to pursue Literature in school. Try something with a little more subtlety to it, like Isherwood or Byatt; of course those are English authors, and perhaps that's why they're better writers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While relevant for it's time, I find it to be one of the most over-hyped books ever. To be fair, I think this about all of his writing. So it goes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read the Glass family saga by Salinger and, while I don't LIKE them, I find them infinitely more mature, more satisfying, and less juvenile.I don't find that Holden ever LEARNS anything in this book. In a novel about the coming of age of the narrator, something should happen that makes him or her learn that their former point of view was wrong and immature. Nothing happens in this book that does that.Instead, we are \\"treated\\" to a young man who is tall and has gray hair. Indeed, he considers himself wise beyond his years. But he isn't. Really, he is an angry young man. Perhaps he is surrounded by phonies. Perhaps he justifiably loathes those around him, and perhaps he is vindicated in his displeasure for nearly everything except for his sainted young brother.I don't particularly care if thousands of people can relate to Holden Caulfield, frankly. I can't. This is true both for stylistic reasons (which I will get to in a moment) and for characterization reasons. Holden is, honestly, an obnoxious little jerk. He hates nearly everything around him, and he makes no apologies for it (which is refreshing, or would be, if he didn't hate nearly everything). The problem is that he shows no sign of intelligence, in the ENTIRE novel, but he perceives himself as suave, charming, and worldly. He is not. He is small-minded and has no greater perception of the world than a child born in Kansas in the same time would have. There is no reason to consider young Holden anything other than a stuck-up, pretentious brat.Stylistically, the novel is like a trip to a sadistic dentist who forgets your anesthesia. The language is, typically, annoying. J.D. Salinger seems incapable of properly using emphatic italics, and this is never brought into greater light than in this novel where they are used both properly (to highlight the vapidity of one of his older brother's former girlfriends, to correct the spelling and pronunciation of particular words) and improperly (to emphasize useless portions of words, much as appears in later Glass family stories). Further yet, he uses the same language over and over throughout the novel. Our obnoxious protagonist will say something that kills him or knocks him out or annoys him, and will follow it, nearly 100% of the time with, \\"I'm not kidding,\\" and then an exact repetition of the same phrase. This is particularly grating when they are, by a trick of the typeset, EXACTLY above and below each other on the page. I'm not kidding, it is really annoying. Really.All that said, I understand why so many people adore this novel. If you read this when your mind is small and you are frustrated with those around you, it could feel like a life line. The problem is that it is such a nihilistic life line, because Holden never finds out just how stupid and vapid he is. This perhaps leads to my greatest frustration with this novel. It is not a coming of age story. It is merely the story of one young man's few days in New York City after being expelled from his school.Holden is what makes so many adults think that teenagers are simply small-minded. Teenagers will read this book and they will think that they are like Holden. They will reach the end, where Holden learns nothing, and they will feel vindicated in their point of view. And their point of view is WRONG. This is the problem. Because they feel vindicated, they will not seek to expand, to grow, and adults will assume that all teenagers are as foolish and small-minded as Holden Caulfield. Which is a disservice, because I have known so many teenagers so much more worldly and so much smarter, and so many adults who weren't.How much damage has Mr. Salinger done with this novel? No one can tell. The only good thing about it is that it, sadly, gives a voice to so much teenage angst and loneliness that may have no other destination for camaraderie. This validates its existence, but doesn't make it a classic.If you are seventeen and angsty (or fourteen and angsty, or forty and angsty, or...) read it and see if it fits. If you enjoy it, well, more power to you. Try to grow past it though. It is so small, and there are so many wonderful things in the world...DHarkius"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is one of those few books that almost everybody loves after they read it. Ask anyone who has read it and you will be hard-pressed to find someone that hated it. I've read it a few times and I realised why. This book makes people feel good. It isn't remarkably well-written, I mean it isn't bad by any means, but it isn't amazing. It's just Holden that everyone can relate with and people love his outlooks and how he makes you feel. I have to admit I was sucked into that too, from the very beginning, but this book only deserves four stars because the ending is terrible. It feels like Salinger was just trying to meet a deadline and the end is rushed, leaving a lot of things unresolved. I suppose someone could argue that it was purposeful and that the ending matches Holden's personality and just ends the book. I suppose it's really up to you to decide. If you haven't read the book, go ahead and read it. It isn't very long, so you haven't much to lose. You'll probably fall in love with it. Just like everybody else. Whatever."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger made me feel like I was Holden, and I am in fact very similar to him. I'm tired of hearing the bad reviews on this. If you didn't like it, you probably didn't get it, don't want to get it, or are to focused on straight-laced English Grammar. You might be unwilling to accept that some of your ideals are wrong. Catcher is my favorite book and really brought about a change in my attitude and life outlook. I'm 16 now, and I got it. It made more sense to me than anything that I've ever read. If you read it later in life, you might just miss out on the message."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The greatest portrayal of teenage angst ever written! Plain and Simple. Read this if you have ever been a teenager. In other words, just read the god damned book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A classic of 20th century American literature, J. D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye (1951) is the timeless, hugely popular blueprint for all coming - of - age novels that followed. The book's 16 - year old protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, is not a rebel as many believe, but a petulant, emotionally - injured, and insecure teenager who is fluent in outrage and at odds with almost every conceivable aspect of being alive. Unlike Fitzgerald's eager, amoral, and dashing Amory Blaine (This Side of Paradise, 1920), who delights in embracing and manipulating the shiny new worlds that open upon adulthood, Holden, who is grieving the recent death of a beloved younger brother, is a prematurely gray, lanky, and disgruntled loner belatedly stuck in the awkward years of adolescence. The privileged, somewhat spoiled son of a wealthy Manhattan family, the self - loathing Holden finds himself continuously surrounded by a web of other people who are obstructing embodiments of his own worst and most reviled qualities.Informatively, the Catcher In The Rye opens and closes with hazy manifestations of homosexuality. The first goes unrealized by Holden, but the second is conspicuously realized and causes a full - blown panic attack. In the first, Holden nudgingly provokes virile prep school roommate Stradlater into a symbolical rape, a rape that leaves the ostensibly defenseless Holden bloodied but unsatisfied.The charismatic, footloose Stradlater, who is nonchalantly used to getting his way with others, is, in Holden's eyes, \\"pretty handsome\\" and \\"very sexy,\\" has \\"very broad shoulders,\\" and is the type of young man Holden believes his own parents would find admirable; Holden comments repeatedly on the beauty of his roommate's golden hair. Unable to resist Stradlater's orbit, even while Stradlater is using the bathroom, Holden, a man obsessed, grabs his roommate in a headlock while he is shaving and bare - chested, and goes so far as to perform a spontaneous, effete mock tap dance for him. Crying out \\"It's the opening night of Ziegfeld Follies,\\" Holden makes it clear that the role he is enacting in this courting ritual is one of a respectable citizen falling from grace by exhibiting his true, no - longer deniable inner nature. When the ignored Holden, who is a virgin, briefly backs away, Stradlater, \\"in just his damn shorts and all,\\" gets \\"very damn playful\\" in return, and the two fall into a briefly blissful wrestling match on Holden's bed. Since during this episode Holden's irrepressible behavior -- and anger -- is ostensibly the result of Stradlater's \\"giving the time\\" to a young lady Holden covets, the narrative makes it clear that the atmosphere in their room is sexually - charged and haunted by displacement. A careful reading of this scene reveals that Holden, who reasonably lacks full self - awareness, is angry not because his roommate has had sexual intercourse with the young lady in question, but because Stradlater hasn't \\"given the time\\" to him. Afterward, Holden describes their violent fight -- which ends with Stradlater kneeling on Holden's chest, their drooling faces inches apart -- as a \\"tiff.\\"Holden's combustible encounter with Stradlater is also partially a self - inflicted if failed initiation into manhood: \\"You never saw so much gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It partly scared me and partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough.\\" Is the bloodied Holden symbolically no longer a virgin? Does Stradlater's beating represent a provoked if less than fulfilling violation? Has Holden now become more of a man, or less of one?After the series of disastrous episodes that compose the balance of the story, some of which involve transvestites and \\"flits,\\" as Holden calls homosexually - inclined men, the exhausted young man briefly finds false hope in the company of former teacher Mr. Antolini, one of the few adults for whom he has any respect. Comforted for the first time in the book by his teacher's wisdom and concern, Holden (\\"a very, very strange boy,\\" Antolini calls him), \\"shaking like a madman,\\" bolts from his mentor's apartment in well - realized homosexual panic when he awakens to find the married Mr. Antolini patting his head in the darkness. Is the wise, sympathetic Mr. Antolini molesting Holden or genuinely expressing anxious regard and tenderness?\\"I know more damn perverts, at school and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when I'm around,\\" Holden now reveals. He has already conveyed that \\"Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away...sex is something I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.\\" What rules has Holden set for himself and then broken? Holden has been told that \\"half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know it,\\" and is subsequently \\"waiting to turn into a flit or something.\\" It may be that Holden, who despises \\"phonies\\" above all others, suffers profoundly from being an unconscious or semi - conscious phoney himself. Throughout the narrative, Holden's wishful associations with women prove to be more like sibling relationships than romantic or erotic attachments.Controversial in its day, The Catcher In The Rye shocked the American reading public with its coarse but realistic language and its sympathetic depiction of the morose, angry, often hilarious Holden, who was an explicit example of every \\"good\\" family's worse nightmare. Today's readers will relate to Holden as all honest readers did then and have since, since Holden is only a vulnerable, frightened, perceptive everyman searching for a single validating role in life, and one who is temporarily a little more lost in the world--and within himself--than most find desirable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being an amature writer i have always heard nothing but praise for this supposed classic.

The list is quite amazing, especially when you consider the enigmatic Salinger started writing this thing in the late 1940s. Young Holden Caufield, who has since been rendered one of the great fictitious characters of the 20th century, speaks to us of his experiences through teenaged sex, disechantment with society, and [...], all while eyeing a world full of \\"phonies\\", cross-dressers, tramps, potential pedophiles, and various egocentrics around him with a skeptical, witty eye.The book reads well, and soon you'll find yourself attempting to keep from carrying the narrator's voice around with you. Holden takes us on a journey through New York City and the journey it worth traveling, even for a book entering its 57th birthday. One of the great literary works that can honestly be deemed as being ahead of its time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Its a must read for those who are trying to find themselves, find out what they want to do in life, and where they want to go (like what college). It summed up what I've been feeling so perfectly. I'm 17 and I'm at that pivotal age right before I have to finalize my list of colleges and submit applications. That's how Holden Caulfield felt in this amazing novel. He felt lost and didn't know where he belonged or what he wanted to do with his life. That over quoted quote, which explains the meaning of the title of the book will always stay with me. I will forever and always think of a merry-go-round as more than just a merry-go-round : ]thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never read this book in school. This is my first chance to have enjoyed this novel. In fact, I'm glad I didn't read this at a younger age. I doubt I would have appreciated it as much.Some of the reviews here seem to concentrate on Holden's age, as though these are typical teenager feelings that Holden expresses. I think it's a bit more than that. In my late twenties, I can wholly relate to Holden's story. It's less, in my opinion, about a teenager coming of age and struggling with issues, thoughts, and feelings typical and common in that age group, and more about struggling with change. It's simply that at Holden's age is when we typically start this life long struggle. It's something that we all can relate to, it's entirely ageless. I'd wager that typically, the older we get, the more we can relate to Holden's internal struggles. The older we are, the more we've struggled with the same and find more and more to connect with in Holden's story.Take a look at the way Holden views his younger brother. In his mind, he was near perfect. He didn't change; he was exactly as he always had been in his memory, suspended in time. But everything else in Holden's life was in a whirlwind, even his sister. At one point, Holden even felt he hated her.Holden's vision of himself, the catcher in the rye, seemed a fitting expression of wanting to keep things as they are, safe and stable. He felt as though he was standing on the precipice of that cliff and was powerless to keep himself and everything around him from falling away. At Holden's age, everything around you starts to change dramatically. From your understanding of the world, your outlook, people's expectations of you, even your body, the list goes on. The world seems different because it is different through the eyes of an adult, and from there on out, it just keeps evolving. You just keep falling over the edge."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger captures teenage alienation, loneliness, and fear of coming adulthood in this superb novel of adolescence. Narrator Holden Caulfield is 16, and he's just flunked out of another prep school. Returning to his sure-to-be-disappointed parents in New York City, Holden spends the weekend in hotels and drinking in nightclubs. Holden is immature, he often lies, and he's psychologically troubled over his brother's death. But he's also cool - a likeable, kind-hearted dude who's always honest with the reader. And it's to the reader that Holden describes his fears of sex, intimacy, and belonging, not to mention his skepticism towards the status-mad adult world. Such feelings resonate with today's teens (and non-teens) as well as they did back in 1951. Just ask my niece, who recently said about Holden, \\"He was awesome!\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of Pency school, he's not sure where to turn. For the next few days he meets with some past school friends and teachers, has some very interesting conversations, and gets himself out of some pretty bad situations. Somehow he goes through all this while still managing to have a 'Caulfield' sense of humor. The thing I liked most about the book is that Holden thinks life is phony, lousy, and deppressing. Then sometimes he changes his mind and realizes that mabey the simple things in life are the best, like watching Pheobe ride around and around on the carosel while it's raining. What I didn't like was how his teacher Mr. Antolini turns out to be a very 'special' person. I wonder what Luce would say? My favorite charater was, of course, Holden. It's funny, he thinks everything in life is always phony, and when I think about, it certain things are but sometimes it's just different. My favorite line Holden says is: \\"It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do you'll start missing everybody. If I was telling someone about this book I would explain how it might be crude but it's so real, and you can relate to it so well, that you feel as if you need to know about his life, but you really don't because you can just tell from his attitude. I still wonder what happens with Jane and the rest of Holden's life. All I really know is that if you relate well to a book, it's not phony, and it actually makes you cry when you finish, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J. D. Salinger first published this novel amidst much controversy in 1951. Deemed as one of the first books written both for and about teenagers, which ultimately resulted in the \\"young adult\\" genre, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was banned in most schools and still is in many cases. The protagonist is the sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who narrates his own life experience of New York in the two days after he is expelled from his school. Filled with swearing, slang, teen angst and an awkward sexual encounter, the character of Holden similarly comes across as angry, embittered and frustrated, who despises \\"phonies\\" and hypocrites, cannot help exaggerating and lying, and has very low tolerance levels toward those who annoy him - basically he hates everything. The darkly funny irony is of course the plight of all teenagers - they are constantly infuriated with other people's behaviour whilst completely oblivious to their own immature attitudes.Yet despite Holden's angst and frustration, he still comes across as an intelligent, introspective and ultimately understandable character. Whether or not you'd like him in real life is up for debate, but for the length of the novel he serves as an interesting narrator, a voice for the teenage state of mind and a mirror to our own selves: contradictive, confused and more than a little lost.So what is at the core of Holden Caulfield's confusion and anger? In a pivotal moment Holden's sister Phoebe asks him what it is that he *likes*. Though he momentarily struck dumb (teenagers like him don't like *anything*!) he eventually comes to a conclusion. He misquotes a poem by Robert Burn, \\"If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\" and shares his fantasy of being this \`catcher in the rye' (thus the book's title) - the individual responsible for catching children who stray too close to a dangerous cliff. It is this crucial passage that reveal the inner mind of Holden - as a teenager who longs to stay in childhood and furthermore to keep others there in a state of innocence.Such is Salinger's theory as to the nature of youth. Is this longing to stay young and resentment of the requirement to grow up the reason behind most teenagers' attitude problems? It's true that childhood is considered the \\"golden age\\" of life - no responsibilities, no money-concerns, no career; whereas adult life is plagued with all these things and more. It seems reasonable that the adolescent years - the transformation from child to adult - are filled with uncertainty and anger.Of course there's more to it than this; as Holden is removed from the state of being an 'ordinary' teenager due to the death of his younger brother Allie who he reminiscences about constantly. Holden's obsession with death is also dealt with throughout the course of the novel, from his pathetic essay on Egyptian mummies to his grotesque fascination with aged people.Salinger constantly plays with words and meaning; which should be explored fully by the individual reader, but I can't help but share my favourite. Because Holden is preoccupied with the onset of adulthood he is likewise drawn to the ideas of sex and the inevitable passage of time that goes with it. Therefore it is fascinating to see Salinger link Holden's awkwardness with the prostitute who keeps asking Holden what the time is with Holden's earlier chauvinist comments to his friend on whether he gave his date \\"the time (of her life)\\". Miniscule connections and links like this are littered throughout Salinger's text like gems and are immensely satisfying to find, deepening Holden's psyche and his views of the world.There is some recent discussion on whether or not \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is still relevant to today's readers - especially teenagers themselves. For me personally, I found no such problems. With the exception of some descriptions of clothing and music, I would not have been aware that it was set in the 1950's if I had not been told. Don't let rumours of it being outdated stop you from discovering Salinger's work, but if you really must have a more \`updated' version, then I'd also recommend DBC Pierre's \\"Vernon God Little\\", which is being lauded at the 21st century's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". I'm not decided on this claim yet, but try both novels and make up your own mind. Also of note is Mark Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", the predecessor to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" - read it and you'll be amazed at the similarities between the two novels that seem so different at the outset.Ultimately it's grim, it's dingy and has most of the critism posed toward it is not for its content or language but because it does not end on a particularly upbeat or hopeful note - but then, is it Salinger's responsiblity to present a \\"phoney\\" view on life to a young audience? Or can readers (especially young ones) handle the portrayal of reality that Salinger presents? Your call."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This review is for the first Back Bay paperback edition (a Little, Brown and Company imprint) published in January 2001.

On August 11, 2005, after 389 weeks, it was still on the list in position 71. It peaked at 19.THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is the first person narrative of Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old boy going on 13. It is December 1949, a few weeks before Christmas, and the Pencey prep school has just expelled Holden. He is accustomed to that; two other prep schools have thrown him out. He's not a bad boy, though.Holden tells us the story of what he did during his last day at Pencey and the few days afterwards. He gives us glimpses into his past. He tells us a little about his oldest brother D. B., about his younger brother Allie who died when Holden was thirteen, and his kid sister Phoebe. But we don't learn much about his parents, which is perhaps what we need to know.THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a masterpiece of first person narrative. The author is never present; there is not one \\"telling\\" word. Mr. Salinger lets the functionally illiterate Holden show us memorable places and vivid characters that we will long remember.The best part of this story is what happens after you finish reading it.

Holden Caulfield just makes sense in an odd way.People who don't like this book seem either to not understand cynicism or have read it after they've grown up and already 30-something with kids ie: completely unable to relate to a teenage mindset.

It's about reaching out, and being a good listener, and about clearing up the swirling mass of contradictions in our heads to ultimately lead to maturity. Sure, I like epic books about heros, and the ideal man too, but the Catcher in the Rye isn't one. If I had actually read this book in high school, it probably would have benefited me. It's funny though, because, not surprisingly, I rebelled against my English teacher and didn't want to read anything. I'm sure she'd be happy now that I read books on purpose. Anyway, I wrote this to let all people who might be in my situation (not an especially insightful or critical intellectual), that they might enjoy a book that hits close to home. And for those who aren't, it is nice to know that more people out there will indeed have a better understanding of people like me..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i have to say, the harsh language, and somewhat controvercial topics scared me off a little. after having read the book though, they only added to the meaning of the book. Its not just about an angry kid in a messed up world, its about a teenager's struggles with moral issues, social issues, and most of all, the troubles within himself, within his family and friends. He feels that every adult is fake, phony, and ruining the world for him, but what he doesnt realize, is that he is just as phony, faking his age, identity, and other things. In the end, its all beck to equilibrium, back to where he started from, but wow what a journey.

Salinger has created a wonderful character out of Holden, a critical yet kind person towards others. Salinger has also created a whole mastermind of ideas that link back to the main theme/s of the book, the catcher in the rye, being a metaphor as the passive of rights.

Everyone needs to experience this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...A shocking portrayal of a dimented child's thought processand views of society...The book may seem a trifle monotonous and evenoffending to the everyday moralist. However, the true reader can look beyond the estranged character of Holden Caufield and grasp a more meaningful theme. Being able to understand the thought procedure and opinions of others is a powerful ability to possess (i.e. Prince Hal in Shakespeare's 1 King Henry IV). We do not need to agree with the anti-social, &quot;phony-hating&quot; character of Holden, we only need to understand his reasoning for such a display of social anxiety. In doing this, you have captured the pathos of the work. If we let our moral values and beliefs stand in the way of appreciating art, we are not capturing the full value of literature. This is a great piece and we must appreciate it for what the author intended the novel to be: A portrayal of an anti-social child."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought this book was entertaining but I didn't get the sense it should have gained all the notoriety that it has. My thoughts when I finished it and put it down was that it must have been written during a period when few other great writes were being written and thus found it's way to the fore front.Writes on similar subjects as far as finding one's way that I think far surpass this are Keep The Aspidistra Flying by George Orwell, Border Music by Robert James Waller and Damages by Bazhe...It's entertaining and definitely a worthy read but I think the cult status it has achieved is based largely on it's name.Which I agree is a fantastic title for a book...I wouldn't give it less than a four but if you read the above books I mentioned and compare them in literary quality I think you will understand why...The other books aren't so much about coming of age mind you as a teenager but they are about finding out who you are and this one in my opinion ranks behind all three that I mentioned although again, it is a good read...Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is often held up as a descriptive model for the pain of adolescence, but Salinger did more with Catcher in the Rye than create a stock character for the angsty teenager. The complaint that many people have with Catcher is that Holden is too \\"angsty\\" and they can't relate to or become interested in him (or, understandably, they don't want to); but if you read with an open mind, then Holden Caulfield is very understandable as a human being, not just despite the fact that he has \\"problems\\" and sees things through a lens of personal pain and disconnect, but because of it. Understanding and sympathizing with Salinger's characters can teach one to understand an sympathize with both those we are closest to and those we feel most distant from in life. At least, that's been my experience with his books (I've read Catcher in the Rye and Franny and Zooey, and maybe I was a little biased in this direction because of Franny and Zooey). The way Salinger builds a character from the inside out is admirable to say the least, and if you've got a few free hours then I say go for it....in trying to understand someone, what have you got to lose?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An easy read. From the first page I was interested in the young man's life and curious about his odd behavior. It's a relevant story, even today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you're looking for a neat, tidy book where the hero beats the bad guy and gets the girl in the end--look somewhere else. Life isn't like that, and you know it. Holden Caulfield knows the world is full of phonies, and even if he lies a little himself, that's part of life too.On the surface, this is a story about nothing. Holden gets kicked out of boarding school and goes home to New York City. He doesn't want to tell his parents, so he gets a cheap room and spends a few days drinking, smoking, and catching up with old friends.What that doesn't tell you is that Holden is on the verge of a moral and emotional collapse. It's been coming ever since his kid brother died. Sure, lots of people can handle death gracefully, but a lot of us can't. For Holden, the death of sweet little kid challenges his belief in a just God, and without a moral foundation, he's left wondering how he can possibly live the rest of his life. It's a question any serious thinker poses eventually, and the way Holden seeks an answer is what this book is really about.Yes, there's language, but it's true to the character. What's more, while it may have been shocking 50 years ago, by today's standards it's very mild. Any reader with cable TV in the house has heard much worse. I recommend this book for any bright reader 12 years and up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A new generation of angry young men were inspired by J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; a dark-edged little novel about teen disaffection. Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind.Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn't care less -- after all, it's full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide.Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably.Remember the disaffected anti-hero of &quot;Igby Goes Down,&quot; who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic.Most classics don't include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger's style for &quot;Catcher&quot; is an unusual one. Through Holden's eyes, it's a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden's own &quot;phoniness,&quot; since it's obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It's subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite.Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don't really need to. This is Holden's story.&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's definitely worth it. Disaffected, yearning and wry, this is a modern classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if there running and they don't look where they're going\\" [224]. That is the fantasy of Holden Caulfield as he describes it to his younger sister. It is the desperation to achieve this goal of the preservation of innocence that leads to Holden's mental destruction.Holden Caulfield has been the only character in a novel that I have been able to relate to as closely as I have. I go to a prepschool in New England and the relation to what goes on at Pencey Prep [the prep-school of Holden] is very similiar to what goes on now at the prep-school I attend. It is the way this book can be relevant and current so many years after that makes it a classic.I would recommend this book to everyone of all ages and I think it would be hard not to enjoy this novel by J.D. Salinger. Masterpieces and classics will last forever."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The idea of a book's plot being centered around just three days of the main character's life has always been something that intrigues audiences. Catcher In The Rye is no different, and upon starting this book, I was unable to keep my nose out of it for days. It's hard to say why, but I think it's the combination of the book's content being timeless, relatable, and original.Holden, a typical teenage boy living in the Northeast, finds himself being kicked out of Pencey (his boarding school) on account of his less-than-impressive grades. He leaves prior to that, however, presumably to escape the dreary school life that seems to have been bothering for quite some time. He decides to go home, but not without encountering two days in the Big Apple. The actual text, however, is much like a live diary of Holden's thoughts as he encounters various people and flashbacks of his foggy past. Of course, the theme sounds a little drab on paper, but Salinger's way of conveying this young character with an impressive wit and intelligence makes the reader addicted to the story. It's so real and timeless that you can often find yourself forgetting that you're reading a book that was written 50-plus years ago. Many of the characters don't stick around longer than a few chapters in the book, but each and every one of them reveals so much of their personality despite the fact that Holden is the only character that sticks around until the end of the book. It's Salinger's way of making things seem so authentic that makes this book so brilliant.It's easy why to see this book is such a staple in American literature; it's trendy, it's classic, and it doesn't waste time giving the reader too much to analyze. It's moving literature without the dreary focus on making EVERYTHING have an underlying meaning (which is the reason why so many teenagers don't enjoy reading today). It goes back to what books are meant to do; enlighten, inspire, and entertain."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suppose before writing this review I have to remind myself not to use the word grand...Anyway, Catcher in the Rye is an excellent book. Period. That is, if you simply look at Salinger's skillful treatment of pacing, dialogue, and characterization. Teenagers though, will see much more. Salinger writes an incredibly believable Holden Caulfield, who has since become the posterboy for adolescent angst. Either Catcher is Salinger's quasi-autobiography or he's \\"the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.\\" The book is not astonishing for its moral, but for its lack of one (too phony for Holden, and would've undermined the reader's genuine connection to him). Its just this young guy looking for innocence, for honest emotion. Catcher in the Rye isn't a collection of empty platitudes and universal philosophy. Its a breath of fresh air that will leave you more in touch with yourself and a little better for having read it. All in all, it was a phenomenal book and one I hope you will add to your personal library."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.\\" This is a quote from Holden Caulfield, the narrator of the book, The Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger. The book is told entirely from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, the seventeen-year-old narrator. The quote reflects Holden's general attitude throughout the book-he only articulates to the reader those details in which he feels are significant.The book starts off with Holden telling the reader his recollection of events from the past December, as he is currently instated a metal hospital. Holden used to attend Pency Prep, a private high school, but was kicked out for \\"flunking four subjects and not applying [himself]...\\" The time period Holden shares with the reader is the few days after he was kicked out from school but before he was to return home for Christmas break. During this time, Holden traveled to New York for a few days before returning home in California.Throughout the book, Salinger allows the reader to connect with Holden on a deeper level through Holden's reflective thinking. Often, after Holden has described an event, he will reflect on how it has impacted his life on a more abstract level. He reflects on things such as his school, his family, the people he knows, and society in general. This reflective thinking allows the reader to gain more insight into Holden's character and his values. For example, on many occasions Holden seeks advice from his deceased brother, Allie, and throughout the book Holden continually refers to his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, as he sees her as a symbol of youth and innocence. The reflective thinking is among other literary techniques that Salinger effectively uses to further the various themes of the book-preserving innocence and death, or the stoppage of time. Another technique is the use of italicized words. These words let the reader to know what parts of the story Holden is emphasizing the most. By isolating certain words, Salinger makes it more clear to the reader the point in which Holden is trying to articulate.The Catcher in the Rye is well written and developed thematically. J.D. Salinger's choice to tell the story from the point of view of a typical teenager allows various readers to connect on a personal level to the narrator and his experiences, making his story far more memorable. It especially appeals to young people and others committed to preserving innocence. However, Salinger himself is not entirely enthused about his published work, stating, \\"I like to write. I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure.\\" Nevertheless, The Catcher in the Rye is a true classic and a must read for all those young at heart."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has become one of my favorite novels. I feel as if I relate to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the novel. As a seventeen year old I am tryingto find my place in the world, similar to what Holden is going through, in the novel. He is struggling with conformity and the phony adults around him.The novel takes you into the life of Holden a troubled boy, growing up in the 1950s, who continuously gets kicked out of schools he does not like. Holden is fighting the world of phonies, that he tries to avoid as he rows up. Holden expresses himself with profanity, even though it is not that bad, by today?s standards. The book also address issues of sexuality, insecurities, loneliness, and deception that comes with growing up. This novel discusses the moral, psychological, and intellectual development the main character.Holden also has relationship problems. As the novel progresses Holden begins to alienate himself from others, as a way of protecting himself. He wears a red hunting hat as a way to alienate himself from others and to show that he is better than everyone else. This causes him to push people who care most about him further out of his life. Holden needs to interact with, but people usually confuse and disappoint him. He uses superiority as a type of self-protection, even though it is the cause of most of his pain. Holden never addresses his own emotions, nor does he attempt to interact with people. He tried to conceal his feelings from others, to prevent himself from being hurt, even though it caused him more pain, in the end.Holden also begins to close off his family and friends when he continuously fails out of school. Holden?s family is from a higher class, and sends him to private schools. Holden fails out of every school that he attends. His family becomes disappointed, and cuts him off emotionally. Holden looses all of his girlfriends, because they see him as afailure.Overall the novel summarizes a troubled young man?s journey into the world of adulthood. Along the way the reader learns of Holden?s troubled relationships, lack of trust, and just plain awkwardness. This book is a must, especially if you are currently a young adult."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read The Catcher in the Rye at the start of my sophomore year of high school.

It is one of those rare books that are virtually in orbit around a character instead of around a plot. I was half-way through the book and about three people asked me, &quot;Is it good? What is it about?&quot;. To all three I had to reply, &quot;I really don't know.&quot; Of course they all argued that I had to know what it was about, I was nearly done. I could have told him what the character THOUGHT about, what type of a person the character was, but I would never really be able to get around to answering their QUEstion. J.D.

The narrator, Holden Caulfield, has a style of thought and language which sticks quickly - the writing sits with you or doesnt as a personality may. Caulfield is now the archetype of the cynical adolescent, and J. D. Salinger manages to illustrate him with great depth and sensitity. The large majority of people who read Catcher in the Rye will find an affinity and connection with Holden Caulfield - if not this, then they will recognize aspects Caulfield in themselves or others. He is irrationaly critical and cynical in his judgements of people he does not know, however he is an extremely sympathetic and generous person.I highly recommend this book to anyone. Catcher in the Rye is very readable and certainly has a huge impact on its readers. Whether it is a condemnation of immaturity, an account of a few days in the life of an adolescent, a critique of society (in general or in the books context) or an example of the misinterpretations of good and admirable people - It nevertheless remains an essential text, guaranteed to resonate with something in your bones."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I feel lucky not to have read this literary masterpiece in school when I was younger, because I think my lack of understanding of the book may have lead me to never read it again. Entering a few short days of a 16 year-old young man, I was reminded of my own teenage life and the feelings it stirred in me. The level at which Salinger portrays the thoughts, the feelings, and the level of understanding of a 16 year old's mind is wonderfully fascinating. Having finished the book, I can see why it's on so many banned book lists, and it's not because of the crude language that comes out of Caulfield's mouth. It's because the book is real, the characters are so real, and that level of realness can be scarry. Read it. Get scared."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher in the Rye as a re-introduction to classic American literature outside of high school reading requirements.

I was excited at first to finally read J.D. Salinger's &quot;masterpiece&quot; of teenage angst and disconnection. I myself, felt out of touch with the world. I didn't want to grow up, but stay a kid as long as I possibly could. At first, I was able to relate to young Holden and his lack of maturation. Then, after about fifty or so pages, I realized that Holden is too childish. Salinger does not succesfuly create a simpathetic character. In fact, Holden's repetitive ranting and raving over male-female sexual relations led me to lunacy. I was in tears, pulling out my hair. If I was reading this book for pleasure, and not for a class assignment, I would have thrown it out the window. I felt no connection with Holden, nor did any of my classmates the following day at school. Salinger's work may have been more powerful back in the fifties, but no longer holds up to today's standards. I only recommend this book to nostalgia buffs."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Perhaps I am too old for it (I am 26) but I found the book extremely boring.

This Holden guy was behaving like a 30 year old, not a young teenager like myself and I found the book quite insulting to teenagers. I can't even describe how disapointed I was. Even Sweet Valley High is more realistic than this piece of nonsense."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, you better not laugh at my english if I make any mistakes: I lived in Paris for 10 years and have been living in Montreal for 8, which makes french my main language. I think Holden's views and opinions are a little more mature than the average. To those 17 year olds who say Holden is immature, I'd like to hear your opinion on different things. Probably more than half of you would say things like: &quot;I hate this book cause it's boring!&quot; or &quot;I hate this cause it sucks&quot;. You can't even find decent arguments and reasons to explain your opinion. And you think Holden is immature??? Maybe there should be a required age of at least 18 to send your comments here, or someone who reads comments and doesn't keep those who are not based on good arguments. Most of the bad reviews I read here came from 16 year olds who can't even defend their opinion. Some of those I read look like they come from someone with the intelligence and maturity of a ten year old. Now to those who say the book is bad, especially since killers have read it. I have NEVER read anything as IGNORANT as that! SO MANY people read this book and I don't believe they turned into criminals because of the book. They were morons way before reading this. Saying that is just a lame excuse. Someone (sills@pipeline.com) wrote a comment about the quality of the writing being at a low level. You moron: the guy is 16 YEARS OLD and is talking to his shrink!!! You think he's gonna talk like Shakespeare? I can't believe someone actually wrote that! I totally agree with those who say Holden was a real idiot for throwing away every chance he got at having an education. Fine! Hate him all you want! But why do you have to hate Salinger for it OR his book? I don't understand why so many people hate books because they don't like the character's opinion. Just because YOU can't relate to a character doesn't mean no one else can or should . What do you think, that the whole world's opinion revolves around your own? If this book was such a bad one, then why was it called a masterpiece of the 20th century? they didn't call it that for nothing. It's not because YOU don't like something that no one else should. I'm saying this to those who say: &quot;I don't understand why people like it&quot; Well we didn't understand why you DIDN'T like it. If you could use good arguments to tell us WHY you didn't like it and not things like : &quot;it sucks&quot;, maybe we would understand you point of view. In all the comments I read, only few of them actually had a good reason why they hated the book. I'm not asking you to love the book, I'm just asking you to understand and accept the fact that some people do. You don't have to agree with us, just accept the fact that IT IS possible to like it. You say Holden can't find anything positive about life, well neither can some of you about the book. And to those who say there's no plot: the guy is talking to his shrink. You don't tell them stories, you just rant about things you're pissed about. And to those who say: &quot;No wonder killers liked the book, Holden is depressed, he hates life...&quot; Give the guy a break! For God's sake! He's just a 16 year old going through a phase. He's not gonna kill himself or other people! Anyways, don't keep your opinions to yourself, have the guts to e-mail me. But you better have damn good arguments, cause I'm gonna crush you with mine (just kidding, I'm not a bitch. I just can't stand people hating someone's different opinion). Of course, nice comments are welcome too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is just such a boring book. who cares about this guy who hates society or whatever. boring. like i need a book to tell me what's wrong with society. maybe this book is good for disillusioned teens who can't think for themselves.and most of all, i hate the fact that people say things like, &quot;This book should be read by everyone!&quot; i'm a teenager, but i think it stinks. when i'm 40 years old, i'll still think that it stinks.RAGE AGAINST THE LITERARY MACHINE!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Perhaps JD Salinger should have gone into hiding before he wrote this book, because I found it to be overrated and one of the worst books I have ever read. I can appreciate the coming of age novel, and even a novel where not much happens, but this book is just plain God awful.I did not care a lick for Holden and his journey. He keeps going on about how he hates phonies, but did it ever occur to him that HE IS A PHONY? His whining and rants against everyone in society got old fast.Many people I know who have also read this book say that it changed their lives, but I honestly don't see how. I recommend avoiding this book altogether, if possible. Nothing happens. It did not change my philosophy on life. I did not have a huge catharsis at the end. This book is total crap."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about a 17-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield growing up in the 1940s. He has just been kicked out of Pency Prep School, and leaves shortly before Christmas break is scheduled to begin. He doesn't want his parents to know that he was kicked out, so he gets a brilliant plan to spend a couple days in New York City before heading home. In this short period of time, Holden has many adventures. One that sticks out the most to me is his night at the Lavender Room. He meets three girls visiting town from Washington. One in particular really enjoys dancing, and Holden dances with her for several songs. Another memorable moment is when Holden goes home in the middle of the night to see his sister Phoebe. She is one of the few people he truly loves. One major theme in this book is death. There is some reference to it in every chapter. Several times Holden mentions suicide. This leads you to believe he isn't exactly normal and that he will end up in the position that he explains at the end of the book. Many people ask him if he is going to apply himself when he goes back to school. He tells them he doesn't know and there is no way he would know until he actually goes back. He has a very good philosophy when he tries to explain it. This is a very good book for teenagers to read if they are trying to discover their true selves in the real world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"been reading books for around 35 years and have always heard about this book,so i finally got around to reading it.This book sucked worse than anything i can recall ever having read before.No plot ,no real story,just a bunch of rambling on about some of the most boring stuff imaginable.Dont waste your time on this crap,time would be better spent watching some grass grow.That is how boring this book is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One the most boring books I have ever read. No plot to speak of and an incredible amount of meaningless jiberish. What made this horrible book so famous?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it was going to be a very boring book. It seemed like it was very pointless but when I started reading I thought it wasn't that bad I actually somewhat got in to the book and thought it wasn't that bad. I thought that it was wicked cool that Holden wasn't afraid when he got fed up with everything that he just got up and left on his own to New York. I would love sometimes to just leave and go to dance clubs in New York City. I recommend this to most people except for people who will get obsessed with this book and try to shoot someone the day the patriots are playing Miami in a playoff game. But then again you can't shoot John Lennon again. Other than that I think most people will enjoy this book. Also I liked the random characters that if they didn't come it wouldn't have been an interesting story. Like his best friend wasn't in the book much but he was in it enough to make the book about forty pages longer because of the stress and conflict that Holden went through. Then there was also that prostitute and her pimp that added like twenty more pages and Holden wanted to commit suicide, which is never a healthy thing. Holden was a cool kid since it seemed that he never had anyone not to cool he always had someone to call. It's wicked cool."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is the most ordinary person you will ever meet, but he is also the most genuine and endearing. At the crossroads of his adolescent life, he finds himself kicked out of yet another private school. On a cold winter night, before winter break is to let out we follow Holden on a journey of self discovery and acceptance as he makes his way home for Christmas. Holden is an intelligent guy who simply cannot find any meaningful relationships with the people he meets because he is depressed and bored with life. As we follow Holden, he narrates his past through his thoughts and reflections on his life up until this point. There is tragedy in the loss of his brother, but more love than he even realizes when speaking of his family and past friendships. Holden meets many interesting people on his way home, and you live through these experiences with him by Salinger's brilliant narration. Holden is a character that we will all relate to because he sees life through the eyes of the confused and jaded teenager that we all were at some point. He believes that he is grown up and ready to move on from all the B.S that high school has to offer but you still see him clinging onto childhood and the little boy he once was. This is a compelling novel about growing up, letting go of the past and getting on with life even after it cheats you a dozen times. It's about not knowing what to do with the rest of your life when you're too young to realize that you don't need to know all the answers right now. You have only to gain by reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is a popular classic literature novel, it is still enjoyed today by people of all ages. Holden Caulfield demonstrates perfect adolescent behavior through his angry tones, bitter actions, and negative attitudes.The story begins when Holden is &#65533;given the axe&#65533; at his prep school in New York, which leads him to a few days of freedom out on the streets in NYC. Personally, the idea is genius. A sixteen-year old boy struggling with adulthood and responsibilities needs nothing more that time alone to clear his head. This is where J.D. Salinger throws much adventure and excitement into his novel. I wouldn&#65533;t exactly call it suspense, but I always had to keep reading on into the next chapter because I just had to know what Holden would do next.Possibly another reason I think so highly of Salinger&#65533;s novel is because I closely relate myself to Holden. I am a sixteen-year-old kid who is facing adolescence, and I share some of the same characteristics as Holden. When I decided to read a classic, I thought it would bore me to death, but I realized that fifty years ago teens talked and acted much like they do today.Through Salinger&#65533;s brilliant ideas, relating characterization, and humor, I was drawn into the fact that Catcher in the Rye is one of the best novels I have read. Even though it was written fifty years ago and is considered a classic, I don&#65533;t think its popularity will ever fade."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A book I should have read 40 years ago. A brilliant portrayal of cynical adolescence and the transition to adulthood. Brought to life in the journey made by Holden Caulfield through New York City in a weekend. Holden seeks to find his way out of confusing darkness following his expulsion from school. Captures the growing pains out of childhood and the doubts and fears of moving forward into adulthood in a most stunning way. The image of the catcher in the rye saving children from falling into the abyss of adulthood, as seen by Holden, is memorable. Rightly acclaimed as one of the great literary works of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm glad I didn't find and read this book before I did. I was 21 when I first read it and I could REALLY identify with Holdens pov. Holden is a dreamer and he pursues pleasure - he loves people and he hates them, what makes him different from most is his sophistication, the depth of his insight and his analysis of other people and their motives. I have the same sort of wavelength but not his sort of insight. If I had've read this book at 16 I would have been really disturbed and changed by it. I've tried to get my friends to read it but they didn't \\"get it\\" - this book does not appeal to everyone. I think you have to be an emotional and deep sort of person to understand his pov. I have always been irked because he never does end up talking to Jane."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is a book I have read, and reread over the years with deep satisfaction. As an adolescent, this book was sometimes like a best friend, a comfort and reassurance that I was not alone in my &quot;outsider&quot; view of the world. The narrator - Holden Caulfield - is a classic &quot;outsider&quot; in the Colin Wilson sense of the word - an individual who is on the fringes of society, unsure of his place and unable to tolerate what most people regard as regular social discourse. Everything reeks of phoniness to Holden, and most of the characters he encounters in his New York sojourn do have pretensions that would make those of us who are more cynical cringe. Yet he remains a uniquely likeable character, as we can see that he has the capacity to love, and he sees a special innocence in children which is best portrayed through his relationship with his little sister Phoebe. There is no real plot to this book, it is strictly the observations of society through the eyes of one everyman who may or may not resonate with the reader. What astonishes me is how this book can make people feel connected to something rather than more disconnected. Perhaps that is it's greatest achievement - it leaves the reader with a sense that they are not alone in their feeling of disenfranchisement with contemporary society. It is also screamingly funny at times, and occasionally quite sad. It certainly isn't for everyone, but those who love this book will probably always have a special place for it in their hearts."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was my first Salinger work. Having been one of the few people amongst my friends to not have read 'The Catcher in the Rye', I decided to finally pick it up and give it a try. I knew nothing about the book's premise or character(s). Having gone into the experience blind, I feel that I came away with more than I may have otherwise.On the outside, Salinger provides a story way ahead of its time. He achieves this by using amazingly modern prose in a book half a century old. What I thought were late-20th, early-21st century concepts are mentioned in varying degrees of detail, while others are merely implied. Nevertheless, I was taken aback by the coarseness and realness of Salinger's words. They made the Holden Caufield character that much more tangibly real and relatable.It also seems that Salinger was intent on making a social statement with this book. My interpretation of it is quite different than other readers, but that is this book's greatest quality--it's packed with symbolism in so many places and in so many ways that every reader can guarantee herself a unique, one-of-a-kind experience. While the story seemed a bit too unimportant at times, by the end, Salinger leaves you with a growing sense of reflection and intrigue as to what Holden is really about, and what the author was really trying to say through his famous disgruntled teenager.I would definitely recommend this book to just about anyone; should you choose to make its story a personal mantra or write a dissertation on its implied social views, you'll enjoy the book all the same. 'The Catcher in the Rye' provides a large gift in a little package."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was a wonderful experience. It's not that I find myself in his situation at the moment, but I once was in his shoes. Well, sort of. I was once as cynical as he is; intolerable. I hated people and judged them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live and suffer Holden's life. I recommend it to the person who being open minded is ready to enter a world full of conflict. This book really deserves all the praise, it is a must read for any person, not just teenagers. As I said before, in one way or another you can easily feel in his shoes. And if not, still you&#65533;ll have a good time following Holden&#65533;s chaotic life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first time in my life I have read this book. It is pretty amazing and interesting. It is a book in which I can relate to it, as well as thousands of other people in one way or the other if you read the book. It is about Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old, who feels insecure and is different from others through his character and personality, so he has a difficult time fitting with others. Readers can watch and feel how he thinks mentally, and shows how difficult Holden's character can be. If you think this was the worst book you have ever read, you did not get the real meaning of the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book several times in my life. It's a book that I can relate to in one way or the other each time I read it. It's about a boy who doesn't feel like he fits in with the rest of society.

This is the least Phony book I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a classic and probably one of the best books ever written.

I indeed enjoy this book and recommend this to any teenager who doesn't like read, you sure enjoy it after reading this novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's lively narrative makes &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; irresistably funny and fascinating, as well as troubling. Salinger shows a terrific ear for dialogue -- not just spoken conversation, but also the fast-spinning thoughts of Holden Caulfield, the book's 16-year-old protagonist.Caulfied is a teenager overflowing with negativity, sarcasm and cynicism. He seems to hate almost everything, including movies, actors, cheap luggage, guys who shake hands too hard, friends who yawn when asking for a favor, and people who say &quot;good luck.&quot;It might seem that such relentless negativity would drag a book down, but Salinger offers just enough glimpses beneath Holden's bitter exterior for the reader to discover an endearing, but troubled, boy underneath. For example, he takes a curious interest in what happens to Central Park's ducks when winter comes. Though this book was written in the 1940s, you can't help thinking -- in light of the Columbine shootings and other teen violence -- about how it can help us understand today's troubled youths.There are two things that keep me from giving this five stars. First, despite all he experiences in the course of the story I'm not sure Holden changes much. Sure, his sister and a teacher both challenge his attitudes in the latter part of the book, but he still hates the &quot;stupid questions&quot; everyone asks. Second, while Holden's comments and observations are so often funny and insightful, he sometimes seems far too wise for his years. I know I wasn't this introspective and people-smart at age 16, nor do I know anyone who was."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is about a male protagonast that is struggling through life. He is an average teenage boy (16-17 yrs old) that lacks school and is failing every subject accept english. He honestly is a really good writer. He is very close with peole in his family like his sister and will take out his time just to spend time with her. He also has a brother but he died. He has a family, but he doenst spend much time with them and how it seems in the book that he doenst really like spending time with them. There are some charaters in the book that help Holden throughout the story to help him with school and his problems."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is excellent, I truly recommend it. I think that seeing Holden experiment all this situations that he causes to himself, make us think about our life. It is very easy to relate to a lot of stuff that he suffers true life, more over if you are an adolescent. Just be careful a bit, because he is constantly repeating himself, and a lot of the true things that happen to him are just cause by his own contradictions, and his negatives to everything, because he is the one that doesn't accepts other points of view. One more thing to say, is that New York is the perfect scenario for this story, because being such a big city, Holden can obtain whatever he wants, so this makes it even more interesting. Well to conclude, this is a very good book, that is worth to be read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book reads itself. It's funny, touching, realistic and well-written. Coming from France, I only read it recently but I really liked it. A American classic!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is by far one of my very favorite books. Even though it was written over fifty years ago, the story of depression, drinking, relationships, annoying friends, &quot;phonies,&quot; and general teenage angst should be familiar to all of us. Sixteen year-old Holden Caulfield is kicked out of boarding school and angry at the world and everyone in it. The novel follows him through his reccollection of a few rather significant days in his life. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking to read a classic, wonderful book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remember reading this book in about three days when I was in high school. I think the reason most people like this book is that they can imagine themselves writing it. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is very straight-forward and there is lots of subtext that can be deciphered in a million ways.We can certainly all see ourselves as Holden Caufield. He does a lot of the things we wish we could do. He's like the narrator in &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Sounds like a great idea until you have to live there. You can't imagine Holden as a grown-up, and you certainly can't see yourself taking this book seriously if you're over the age of 30, unless your a Lit professor.The best thing about this book is Will Smith's speech about it in &quot;Six Degrees of Seperation&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book was one of the best books we ever read. The book was really good, but the main character, Holden Caulfield, was a pessimist and he over used a lot of catch phrases. With some examples being; That really killed me, it made me more depressed, and he called everyone old. The book was creativly written because the story only took place over a couple days. The surprising part is how just a few days can change you life and your attitude towards it. I can see where people want to ban the book, but you don't revolve over the parts they refer to. And to ban a good book is like preventing a teacher to teach, and that would be a bad idea."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was about Holden Caufield, as everyone else has stated, an adolescence, but he is scared of life, because it doesn't make any sense.

We just got to see how he handled it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the reviews of this book read what it was about and I thought this looks like a good book so I decided to buy it and see for myself!Boy was that a good,but depressing book!Holdens adventures throughout the unforgiving cities were very sad and kept you reading!(I got so mad when that prostite got Maurice to beat Holden up!!)Anyway this was the classic I thought it would turn out to be!This is totally one of my favorite books!At parts I could relate to Holdens sometimes complicated feelings and other times I failed to,and yet other times I felt sorry for him.He thought mostly everything was depressing!He frequently used the phrase \\"that kills me\\".And he said GD at least a million times but despite that it did not ruin this great book at the look into a complicted distrubed juvenile!So if you are a teen and would like a great book to read this is it!(I'm really 14!)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In The Catcher in the Rye, J.D. Salinger employs repetition and irony to portray the picture of an adolescent boy attempting to find himself in an adult world and grow into a man. Salinger continuously inserts the same small phrases throughout his novel in order to illustrate the uphill battle Holden Caulfield faces in order to prove and understand himself. After every statement, thought, or personal anecdote, Holden always declares to the reader, or to the character he is speaking with, that he is telling the truth. Over and over again, Holden exerts the phrases \\"I really am\\" (98), \\"They really are\\" (118), \\"I really do\\" (9), \\"We really did\\" (8), and \\"I really didn't\\" (10). With the recurrence of these simple, three word phrases, which begin by stating who is doing it, followed by the word \\"really\\", and closing with an affirming verb, Salinger paints the portrait of a boy struggling to convince himself that he can actually be correct and gain confidence in himself. Another key phrase Salinger employs through Holden is \\"That killed me\\" (160). Whenever something \\"kills\\" Holden he finds the event amusing and comical. When Holden is looking through his kid sister's diary, he discovers the name she had printed in it was different from her real name. Holden loves children's jokes and expresses his attitude toward her private joke by saying that it \\"killed him\\" (160). By stating that \\"it killed\\" him repeatedly, Salinger eclipses Holden's peculiar, adolescent sense of humor with the fact that he has such a huge sense of humor. In this way, Salinger covers the evidence of Holden's unsophisticated mind. As well as repetition, Salinger utilizes irony to display to the reader that Holden seeks manhood and himself. On his way to Ernie's, Holden strikes up a conversation with the cab driver named Horwitz. After conversing for a couple of minutes with him, Holden concludes that Horwitz is \\"a touchy guy, it wasn't any pleasure discussing anything with him\\" (83). Ironically, the very next sentence Holden extends an invitation to Horwitz to join him for a drink. In this instance, Holden shows he wishes to spend time with anyone willing to listen to his ideas, even if they disagree wholeheartedly with them. This characteristic of Holden strengthens the fact that he is morphing from an adolescent to an adult. Adolescents close their minds to outside ideas and opinions, while adults share their ideas with everyone. As we all know, realizing your problem is a big step to solving your problem. Phoebe, Holden's little sister, correctly points out Holden's problem to him that \\"you don't like anything that's happening\\" (169). Instead of taking her advice Holden breaks out into an all out defense declaring \\"that's where you're wrong - that's exactly where you're wrong!\\" (169). Immediately following his defensive, Holden thinks to himself that she \\"was...depressing me\\" (169), thus fortifying Phoebe's position. Instead of taking the mature route and listening to others opinions, Holden shuts his sisters beliefs out as \\"wrong\\" and continues to believe that he does not have a problem. The Catcher in the Rye delivers the inspiring story of a boy struggling to break the bonds of adolescence and bloom into adulthood. With the use of his skillful repetitions and ironies, J.D. Salinger \\"really did\\" masterfully create this American classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I haven't read Dreamland, however I think that it shuld be taught with The Catcher and The Rye. The reason is because I think it has some of the same issues that teenagers deal with in every day life. Dreamland deals with abusiveness and I think young couples can learn from this book. Catcher in The Rye deals with teenagers finding their way through life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm 23, read this 3 or 4 years ago, and still haven't figured it out. Now, I'm no scholar, far from it...but most of the reviewers here get a big fat &quot;F&quot; with respect to contributing literary criticism of any value. Reminds me more of the following dialogue from the movie &quot;Throw Mamma From the Train&quot;:&quot;It's whacking material.&quot; &quot;Well I think it's very brave.&quot; &quot;I think it's vulgar.&quot; &quot;That's what they said about Twain.&quot; &quot;That's what I'm saying about him.&quot;&quot;I think you're vulgar&quot; &quot;I think you're a no-talent little s**t.&quot;I did however, find one reviewer's criticism to be very insightful, which I am quoting from:&quot;The world is full of bitterly unhappy people who confuse cynicism and hostility toward the world with artistic sensitivity. Many of them write reviews of books and movies, as they have done here. But avoid such people. They live lives of misery, and spread the misery around so they don't have to be alone in their hatred of the world. And &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is their favorite book.&quot;IMHO, this guy's review is intriguing. Perhaps Holden's entire narrative could be equated with a 16-year old boy who has a fight with his parents, screams, &quot;YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!!!&quot; and then storms out of the house in tears. Is that what happened in this case?If anyone wants to talk about Catcher please e-mail me at tarlejh@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am not sure what I think of this book yet. I read it, like other reviewers, because it is a classic. I can identify with Holden Caulfield on some levels because of the isolation I feel at school. However, I have trouble feeling sorry for him because he does have several people around him who care for him, and his family is very wealthy. I know what he means by people being phony. I can also appreciate his desire to be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; I can definitely see why it is banned in schools. I think the book would have been just as effective, if not more so, if he had not taken God's name in vain every other word. Overall, his musings on love and society are very insightful and trite at the same time. I know this sounds impossible, but he puts a spin on common ideas. I think people should read this book for entertainment, but they should avoid it if they are looking for a bible for living."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you really want to hear my review, I'll tell you.

Salinger. This novel puts a bold new perspective on issues concerning society. Salinger writes about a rebellious teenager who is diving head first into the adult world. His views on the situations and people that surround him have the ability to change our own thought processes and become more like the author himself.Salinger uses a teenager named Holden with a short temper and a bad mouth to convey his thoughts on society. Holden is developed with amazing detail. The story is told through his eyes, which allows the reader to feel what he feels and analyze Holden's every thought. Holden has a very negative view of the people around him and society itself. He thinks that everyone is playing a role in order to use people and get what they want. To make his thoughts even more confusing, Holden has very fond memories of his childhood. Holden longs for things to be like they used to be, when he was innocent and carefree.Salinger uses the character of Holden, someone people understand and relate to, in order to present his views on society. Salinger has the ability to back away from society and look at it from the outside. When he is apart from the deception and lies which represents society, Salinger has the ability point out it's mistakes and illustrate it to the rest of the world. Most people can't see through the wrapping paper that covers our lives and prevents us from seeing what actually in the box. Salinger has the ability to see reality, and through Holden he has revealed it to us. If Salinger had given us these life-changing views straight up without the connection of Holden, then people wouldn't have been able to comprehend their true meanings.This book has changed my life and my outlook on the surrounding environment. I can now see the true motive behind people's actions and I know that not everything is what is appears to be. As you read this book, look past the foul language and the bizarre actions of Holden. Then you will see the true meaning that Salinger intended for this influential piece of literature. You can thoroughly enjoy this book, just remember to keep an open mind. Disregard everything that you believe is real, and allow J.D. Salinger to create a new reality for your mind."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield, a name associated with American literature is studied around the world, and for very good reasons.

Holden represents the problems and troubles faced by adolescents, although he is an extreme example. Holden sees everyone as phony, pretending and acting away their entire lives except for his little sister and young children. Holden seems to have a sense of urgency to save them from their loss of innocence and in their journey into what he called phoniness, hence the title &quot;Cather in the Rye&quot; , as though he must catch them in case they fall of a cliff, and into the world of being phony. In truth, however, Holden himself is phony yet does not realise it. The book is written from the central character's view and the writing style is perfectly fitting to the register of a teenager. One asks oneself throughout the novel is Holden is actually insane, and does he realise it-which means he is not insane as he recognises it. A book with a genuine understanding of growing up, and what is like to develop into adulthood. A must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is the most loving, caring, beautiful person I have ever come across. He criticizes the bad, hypocritic, inhuman (&quot;phony&quot;) aspects of human nature, but is constantly falling in love with the truth and beauty that people exhibit. He's in so much pain and is so depressed, and yet he still has an overwhelming desire to save others. He is a saint. I think that anyone who has read this book and did not like it (like me, the first time I read it) must either be too immature to understand it or must be looking in all the wrong places for something that doesn't exist in Catcher in the Rye. To anyone reading it for the first time, forget everything you've ever heard about it. Just sit back, read, and analyze for yourself everything that Holden says and feels. I've found that people who are like the &quot;phonies&quot; that Holden criticizes are too caught up in hating Holden for his depression and confusion that they don't listen to the real messages in the novel. It is important to see Holden's profound love for humanity, as well as his pain, underneath his professed hatred. Anyway, do what you want. But I'll say that, if you're not interested in what it means to be human, you might want to consider reading something else."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading very serious novels in 8th grade such as The Crucible, We the Living, Anthem, and others, I decided to take a break and read something that I had preconceived to be easy reading. I immediately delved into The Catcher in the Rye the day summer vacation started and read all through the night without even noticing the time pass by. It was the most accurate observation on teenage behavior I've ever known. Despite the fact that Holden Caulfield is a symbol for many teenagers, he has his own unique sense of authenticity and shattered perspective of his surroundings. In the course of merely a few days, the transitory moods and emotions that shape adolescence are ever present in the universal protagonist who is the hero of many young adults.I enjoyed this book so much because it stimulated so much controversy that it was banned in the 1960s. Teenagers such as myself are very curious and want to know and understand why and how a book can be so controversial. I wanted to know what was in &quot;Pandora's box,&quot; so I read it and I encourage any teenager who seeks understanding from others to read this. The power and depth of this novel is truly amazing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This classic novel is about a young lad growing up in the fifties struggling through the process of life. Rejected from society and fighting to be himself he cannot seem to do anything right. Basically, Holden Caulfield complains for 214 pages of agony. There are some good symbolic parts to it containing homosexuality, zen buddhism, and alienation. Yet, the novel lags in creativity and difference in sections. Salinger did a wonderful job of whining about nearly the same subjects throughout the whole book. Although the book is not very good it is not terrible. I found the symbolism interesting but the main text repetitive which, quite frankly, bored me. Every other word out of Holden Caulfield's mouth is a complaint, which is not too bad for a few chapters, but the whole novel seems to be based on his lack of interest for life and depression which he cannot deal with or vent. Overall, the book did not interest me much because of the excessive whining and the fact that the book did not flow."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't think a book like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; will ever be written again. Ever since it's publication in 1951, people have been trying to write a novel that would outshine J.D's Salinger's classic, but no one has succeeded. To this day, it is still the most significant and popular book on American youth. The whole story is seen through the perspective of Holden Caulfield; a cynical, lost 16 year old who is struggling to find some virtue in the world around him (1950's, New York City). J.D Salinger's writing is evocative and fascinating, but it is the way he creates the character of Holden with such great complexity that makes this book so extraordinary. Everyone, especially teenagers, will be able to identify with him on some sort of level. The book is almost like an emotional oddysey, everything that Holden encounters provokes some sort of thought, in him and also in us. We may not completely understand his pessimism towards life, but we do feel his intense emotions of sadness, fear and hopelessness. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; does however end in a genuinely optimistic note, and it will leave you seriously thinking about your own life, and that there may just be true hope for everybody, even for people like Holden Caulfield. A truly remarkable novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Still CURRENT! After you read this you'll wonder what in the life of a teenager has really changed from the 50's to the 90's. It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant &quot;I know everything&quot; attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and &quot;don't give a damn&quot; attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic. Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, &quot;what the hell is this kid thinking?&quot; Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers! Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, Alien Rapture. I highly endorse buying this book. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like another reviewer said, I finally read this book because it's referred to often in other literature and movies. It really started to get on my nerves around chapter 3. I only kept reading because I wanted to give the book a chance and kept waiting for the part that (supposedly) makes this book so great. I was disappointed. This kid is so annoying! I did wonder if some of the people he was describing were simply parts of himself, such as the \\"digression\\" kid, and the \\"flits\\" he hated so much. Then I wondered if it would turn out to be a \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" type of story and he might actually be the kid that jumped out the window.There were a couple of \\"aha\\" moments that helped me understand poor old Holden Caulfield a little better and where he was coming from, but nothing earth shattering. I just felt like shaking him and yelling, \\"Welcome to the real world!\\" At least at the end he ends up where he really needs to be. His sequel could be \\"One flew over the cuckoos nest\\".At least I'm glad to finally check it off my \\"classics to read\\" list. Also, I'm glad I picked this book up at the library's basement sale for only 50cents. However, I still wonder what makes this a \\"classic\\". I can only attribute it to the timing of when the book was first published; teenage angst was not a popular subject in the 1940-50's. It was probably quite a novel point of view at the time.Now I'm going to rent \\"Six degrees of separation\\" again and try to remember why it made me so curious about this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was in the eleventh grade when I also read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" in high school, even though it has been a school assignment it was one of the best book that was \\"Required\\" of me to read.The phrase \\"Classic Novel\\" sounds a bit scary to a kid who's had classic literature spooned into him like Caster Oil. But J.D. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is certainly not the usual \\"Stuffy\\" classic that has a big happy moral at the end.The books main character, Holden, is not a hero and he is not a super model, in fact if he weren't the main character he would probably be most useful as the antagonist. He's just a confused kid who's constantly misunderstood by the people he is surrounded by. His biting insights are short, to the point, and unlike most of the society surrounding him, he's not \\"Phony\\". After sharing a small breakfast with some ladies of the church, he comments: \\"That's what I liked about the nuns. You could always tell, for example, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch.\\"A novel like this can be enjoyed by young and old a like...an assignment that students will actually _enjoy_ reading....a book that will remain true and relate to members of multiple generations. Somehow, J.D. Salinger has created this masterpiece which has - and forever will - withstand the test of time.Far too many times have readers been heard muttering \\" Hey that's me - I'm Holden Caufield!\\". Holden represents the restless angst that all of us have experienced at one time or another throughout our lives.High school students may enjoy the book because they think that Holden is \\"Cool\\" or \\"Rebellious.\\" The more mature reader may pick up on some of the deeper meanings throughout the story - far too many that he can relate to. A warning to the reader who looks deep into the words of Salinger: this story will provoke some sort of self-exploration and/or reminiscence about ones past.This is the book of the 20th century. This will continue to be the book of the new millennium."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I tried to read Catcher in the Rye a few years ago on my own and couldn't stand to finish it because I couldn't stand Holden Caulfield. I hate cynical people. But now I have to read it for my class on 20th Century Literature. From Holden's POV, ...everyone is \\"phony\\". Of course, it's okay if HE lies and deceives people and puts on an act. Holden Caulfiend, you're a g.d. phony! So there!Okay, so the book itself is a well-told story that gets into the feverish, dissatisfied mind of its 16-year-old protagonist. As a native New Yorker, I can identify with the feeling of familiar sites like Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and Central Park. I couldn't stand Holden's constant cynicism, and at Chapter 17, I myself wanted to punch his lights out. But in Chapter 22 I think I finally realized what he was looking for deep down inside--a reason to live, and the courage to live it. He expresses a desire to rescue people, but he's projecting--he's the one that needs rescue. I was actually starting to like the poor jerk. If a book can make you want to punch someone's lights out and then you feel sorry for him...hey, do I right now remind you of someone?I'm supposed to write a one-page response for class: is Catcher in the Rye a true bildungsroman--a \\"novel of education\\" or \\"coming-of-age\\" story--or an anti-bildungsroman? Does Holden learn anything or not? I don't think he consciously learns much, but a seed is planted deep inside, in the soul, beyond intellectual understanding."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a freshman in high-school and I just finished reading this book after it was recomended to me. I looked it up on Amazon to see what other people thought of it and I have read 5-star reviews for it as well as 1-star reviews for it. First of all I thought that this was a very good read, it was interesting and well written so I can see why it is considered \\"a classic.\\" I also found that I disagree with many of the things the people who gave this book low-star reviews said. Yes, this book does take some understanding to read because no, it does not have the normal intense plot build up with the obvious rising actions leading up to the climax. There are, however, significant occurences throughout the story and they do eventually get to the climax of this book which despite what other people may think, does have a point. Yes, Holden's character does have some flaws and yes, he can get a little annoying sometimes. He is repetitive and he does complain a lot and mention quite frequently how depressed he feels. But what the reader should realize is that this personality is not coming from a normal teenager who just wants to be a whiny pessimist. These traits are coming from a sixteen year old who had a rotten childhood, who is getting over his brother's death, who isn't a very good student and who obviously has some mental problems because he is so depressed and even suicidal sometimes and he is telling his story in flashback form while he is in a mental health facility. Which is also another reason why you can't compare Holden to all the other teenagers you know. Holden is a different teenager with different problems and he is not in a normal healthy mental state as many other teenagers are. No matter how much whinier and more annoying he is than other people you know. As for the concern that this book is not appropriate for freshman/sophmore students most kids in middle and high-school have already been introduced and/or exposed to all of these issues that come up in the book in someway or another. It is practically impossible not to have some knowledge of what Holden talks about in the book through television, music, books, or interactions with peers who are familiar with these issues even if you are not yet. There is language and there are mature situations and yes, it could be beneficial to talk to your child about what happens in the book but most of the kids my age that I know are mature enough to be able to deal with it without parental guidance. I do however think that kids should try and read this book before it is assigned to them in school so that it doesn't seem like forced reading in which case often hampers a students ability to enjoy what they are reading and instead they become solely concerned on getting the reading finished for a book report or test. For those who cannot reconize the themes or meanings of this book you should read the review titled \\"A Brilliantly Unique Look at a Universal Problem.\\" The author of that review clearly understands Holden's point of veiw and the story/meaning of this book. He/she picks out many hidden symbols and themes and has a clear understanding of the literary material. This is not just a pointless rambling of some stupid rich kid's day in New York while he tries to hide from his parents until they know he has been kicked out of prep school. There is a very good point as well as a meaning to what Holden is saying which is why you should read that particular review. I just wanted to give my point of view so that people don't think that this book is inapproprate for all 13-15-year-olds. As you can see if you read other people's reviews it is possible for an 11-year-old to read, comprehend, and enjoy this book. Just because other people had trouble enjoying this book or finding it's point doesn't mean it doesn't have one and. It was an excellent read and I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In the controversial novel written by J.D. Salinger, the main character 17 year old Holden Caulfield is exposed to the realities of life that face him. Throughout this novel, the reader is exposed to harsh language that some may not tolerate; however, this language is vital to the understanding of the character. Holden feels lost in the world, yet he questions and realizes the faults in our society. The Catcher in the Rye is a book everyone should read at some point in his or her life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Using the stream of consciousness writing style, J.D. Salinger tells the story of a 16-year-old boy who's just been booted out of his school in upstate New York, and who is attempting to get back home to New York City. The entire book takes place over a matter of a few days, describing Holden Caulfield's journey down to the city, and his observations of its' seedy underside.While the story is depressing at times, this should be no suprise given that it describes the life of an adolescent. It also shows the naivite and hopefullness of youth; for example, Holden continually takes issue with those who might do harm to children. As you will see if you've not yet read it, this is where the title of the book comes from.The book is probably most known, however, for the cynical side that Holden shows. In his travels, he is not slow to point out \\"phonies\\" and other people who he deems to be superficial. It is the perfect combination of cynicism, hope, and despair that make Holden seem like the quintessential teenager. This is perhaps why The Catcher in the Rye is a favorite of high school aged kids, and why many adults read the story with a fond rememberance of when they were that age.If you're wondering why the book has a history of being banned, you will probably be suprised to see how tame the story is. There are a few uses of the f-word, and other slight references which people didn't take too kindly in 1951 (such as a brief mention of a cross-dressing man). Through today's eyes, one would be hard-pressed to find something that would merit the censorship of the Catcher in the Rye.It is a brilliant, extremely accurate tale of a typical teenager trying to find his place in the world. It is a model, both for the stream of consciousness style, and for the many copy-cats that have attempted to figure out how J.D. Salinger made the story so darned convincing. It is quite possibly the best coming of age story ever created."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this is the best book i have ever read. i have read it five times and everytime i read it i pick up on some new insight to what this book is really about. most people say it is a coming of age story but really it is more like a failed coming of age. i think a lot of teenagers can relate to this because after the teen years it's almost like where do you go from here? holden deperately wants to hold on to his innocence for as long as he can which is why he doesn't like phonies. some people say it is not a classic because the language is elementary but it is a classic story to which a lot of people can relate to which is why i think it is a classic piece of literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"We hate yuppy scum, we hate phonies and fakers, we hate school, infact we don't really care too much for anything if we're at all synonymous with the wonderful, original teenage slacker that is Holden Caulfield. In one of the shortest novels I have ever read, JD Salinger manages to grip me in a constant state of shared anguish, shared adolescent humour, and the kind of hobo longing suggestive of the Kerouac style. To say this is one of the greatest books ever is simply not good enough. There aren't enough stars in the universe to give Salinger for this work. Such honesty, such gallant disenchantment, such ponderous misanthropy, such a tongue in his cheek and such a wonderful story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is a timeless American classic because it exemplifies the effect of corruption in the world on youthful innocence. Through the eyes and mind of a teenager in the late 1940s Salinger offers insights as to why adolescents rebel, but offers no solution to stop it. The hypocritical and dubious values set by the adult world cause Salinger's main character, Holden Caulfield, to have a nervous breakdown. During rehabilitation in a Western infirmary Caulfield has time to reflect on many experiences and people from his past. This results in a wise-beyond-his-years understanding of the human condition. The teenager had a moral disgust towards everything cruel, hypocritical, and evil (what Holden called \\"phony\\") in the world. Holden's reaction however, was not one of anger or bitterness, but instead sadness at the current society. Random, all-consuming waves of depression were the result of his self-chosen isolation and uncertainty of where to go in life.Salinger used a stream of consciousness style when writing, weaving slang and adolescent satire, with incomplete thought processes to show Holden's inability to smoothly transition from boy to adulthood, and frustrating immaturity. Caulfield exemplifies the thought processes of many youths when he understandably avoids his parents when expelled from his third pricey boarding school he attended, attempted to use his height to allow him to buy alcohol and drink with adult men, and naively thinks that he has an understanding of love and sex as a 16 year old virgin. However, his ability to see the shallowness of media, and the often insincere actions of men, shows his deeper, more profound side. Holden is in limbo, no longer a child, but no yet a man. A lost soul- wishing to delay the inevitable repulsive \\"real world\\" and responsibilities of adulthood, but intellectually craving more than adolescence can provide."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is extremely overrated. While I appreciate Salinger's writing style, the story itself is pointless. Holden Caufield whines for 200-odd pages. This is somehow supposed to be relevant or edgy, but really it is just boring. The reader is given no reason to like or care about Caufield or his story. Why people gush over this book is beyond me. All Salinger has done is to paint a stereotype of a weak, callous, angry young man. I feel sorry for anyone who says they &quot;relate&quot; to this book, because it is clearly a condemnation on Salinger's part of youth in general, which I believe is unfair."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those novels you keep for years because you know you will re-read it eventually. My dusty, yellowed copy was first read over 30 years ago when I was in high school, and has been passed along to both of my daughters who also had to read it in high school. Since my 15 year old is reading it now, I decided to re-read it and remind myself why I kept it around all these years. Obviously, my perspective has changed, but the most remarkable feature of the book is its sheer timelessness. Holden didn&#65533;t have to deal with the temptations of illegal drugs, or AIDS, or the frantic pace of the internet age, but all of his feelings of depression, loneliness, and teenage cynicism are still a part of the coming of age of our youth today.The antics of Holden after he is expelled from prep school are hilarious, frightening and heart-warming. He goes to New York City, gets drunk, smokes pack after pack of cigarettes, has a near-close encounter with a prostitute, gives away some of his dwindling hoard of cash to two nuns, calls up old girl friends, and generally fumbles and stumbles his way back to the safety of his home where all is forgiven. He&#65533;s basically a good person at heart, but can&#65533;t stand the phoniness and emptiness of the lives of many of the people around him.The stream of consciousness thinking and dialogue make you feel like you&#65533;re in Holden&#65533;s head. With just a few changes of scenery and dialogue, the book could easily be applied to living through the teen years in 2001. &#65533;Catcher in the Rye&#65533; is a powerful, significant portrayal of a troubled young person, and it will surely remain on the required reading list for many years to come."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is undoubtedly one of the best books that I have ever read, and just in case if you are wondering, yes I am a teenager. It seems to me that the only audience that truly appreciates this magnificent piece is the high school kid. My reasoning behind this is because the story is basically an account of a teenage guy's eventful and emotional life - rather four days of it. The content of these four days in New York more than makes up for rather short time span of the novel. Holden Vitamin Caulfield, as he likes to call himself, is constantly being bombarded with psycological pressures. His overwhelming concern revolves around the existence of &quot;phonies&quot; as he so calls them, who limit the ideas of the adolescent and try to get in the way of Holden's voyage to another realm, free of corruption and media. Holden searches for a world devoid of the limits of his adolescent years. Holden never really does encounter any physical dangers in his journey to find himself, instead he feels threatened by the majority and contemporary mass cluture, which promote the loss of individuality, ancient accepted values, and intellectual awareness. A plot summary of The Catcher is a very tedious task indeed. The strucure of it could be associated with a patient's recollection of past events to psychiatrist. Even so, the actual plot is not the most important thing about this book. What is important are the characters and their philosophies. Many adults may criticize Holden and his rough language, but us teenagers wolud just flock to Holden if he were an actual person. Holden also carries with him his trusty red hunting hat, a symbol of his protection and sense of self. Holden also makes several remarks about the ducks on the lagoon of Central Park South. He wonders where they go when winter comes along. One can think of this as a VERY extended metaphor comparing Holden himself looking for a new place to settle to the ducks of Central Park. My recommendation is that if you are a teenager who has a touch on reality and would just love to hear other accounts and insights on life from a similar perspective, then this book is a MUST for you! If you are a little older perhaps and you think that all this is nonsense, then this novel is even more of a MUST for you. It is a must for anybody! Still, I honestlythink that my fellow teenagers will get more of a kick out of this book. Even my very own English teacher remarked that Catcher made more of an impact the first time she read it, of course when she was a female Holden, herself, a normal teenager just looking for complete ecstacy, including love, friends, and true family. Salinger also presents Holden's tale through very delicate symbols, including his hat, the rain, and even suitcases. Its better and more fulfilling for you to see these for yourself. Also, be prepared for constant exaggeration, complete oxymorons, and swearing because after all, this is a true representation of the maturing youth. If one is so superficial to simply not read this because of the choice of words, then i pity him, for he has completely missed the point that Salinger was trying to make, and he has missed out on truly one of the best books ever to be written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"'Catcher in the rhy', was written by J.D Salinger, published in 1951.It explores into an insecurities and vunerablity of a seventeen year old, 'Holden Caulfield'.

The book is a paperback with a very poor hard cover. Paper is rough and poorer quality of paperbacks in general and the printing is small. If you want this book to remain on your book shelf after reading then steer clear of this one. Great classic and is readable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just don't get it. This was one of the most boring reads ever. I had to force myself to finish the book, short as it is. When I was 16 or 17, I knew who I was and what I wanted from life. I can find no basis for identifying with any of Holden's psychotic mental rantings. If you find yourself groundless and life to be a bewildering chaos, then maybe you can find some connection with this character, but I, for one, find Holden to be a narcissistic whiner, and I find this \\"classic\\" to be a complete disappointment. Oh, and for the reviewers who carry on about the symbolism: ok, it's there, but I think the \\"deep\\" symbolism that you gush over is trivial. But then, I'm a little jaded because one of my best friends wrote a novel that made the NYT Best Seller list; he says he did not purposely put ANY symbolism whatsoever into his story, but found that he later had to invent some in order to massage the egos of reviewers and readers who just KNEW that it was rife with multiple layers of symbolism. Wait a minute...maybe Sallinger did have a valid point, after all, with his treatment of society's phoniness. The bottom line for me: this book receives a ton of positive press, and I would love to have liked it, but the honest truth is I hated it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't see how so many people rated this book so highly. I spent precious time reading this, that I'll never get back. If you want to waste your time reading about some stupid, snotty kid's boring experience in New York, then go ahead, read it.

Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life. This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life. The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield. He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home. In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life. One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps. As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him. Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness. But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad. Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends. When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything. Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all. As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I usually force myself to get through the first 30 pages of any classic before making a negative judgement, because the awkwardness of the story's introduction usually goes away. Not in this case. I understand that the point of view is a teenager in the 20's, but reading this book is like reading child's scribble scrabble. It's extremely difficult to put up with the tedious bumbling language that Salinger uses to portray his adolescent character. I would not recommend this book to the faint of heart - you should be a literature fanatic to be able to get through this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"the catcher in the rye is a amazing book it tells about a boy who kindof hates his life. instead of picking out the good things in his life he lokks at all the bad things that have happened to him. i like it because its a good book it tells you like it is and it's writen differently then most books i've read and thats what i like about it it unquie and different it's a wonderfully written book even if it's from the 1960s."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye follows a teenage boy who is searching for understanding. Holden wants to find someone, anyone who will relate to him only to find himself annoyed by the phoniness of the world. The adolescence that was stolen from him by the death of the brother he idolized, forces Holden to realize he only wishes to be able to preserve the innocence of the world. Wishing he could become the \\"catcher in the rye\\" and save children from growing up. Although I cannot really relate to the character, I can relate to being frustrated with the trivialness of the world. I would recommend this book to any high school students that have yet to find themselves. It is a quick read and gives insight to growing up and finding your true self."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I began this book expecting it to be supremely deep and completely understandable. What I found was that Holden was a pain in the rear teenage boy whose mission in life was to complain about everything except his stupid red hat. I was sorely disappointed.As I got deeper into the book, the more I wanted to just beat some sense into the boy for being such a complainer. He thinks that the world should bow down to him and it just doesn't work that way.I also don't understand why this book was banned. Holden has feelings that every teenager has and complains about everything. How is that different or bothering in any way? We have to go through it everyday, why not be allowed to read about it? Read it if you want, but please tell me if you find the point that makes this book so important."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, we'll do the good stuff first. &quot;Catcher&quot; has an easy to read style that is quite unique. The reader really gets into Holden's head. And Holden is a truly believable person. However, he is not at all a typical teenager. He's a teenager on the brink of an emotional breakdown. And Salinger really convinces you of that.What's annoying about this book is the complete lack of a plot. Modern readers expect a book to have a beginning, a middle and an end. I understand that not every great book has to have a well-defined plot, but this one doesn't even have a loosely defined plot. Holden leaves school and wanders around New York for a few days, slowly getting crazier and crazier. The style of the book is wonderful, but it would have made a much better short story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In J.D. Salinger's brilliant coming-of-age novel, Holden Caulfield, a seventeen year old prep school adolescent relates his lonely, life-changing twenty-four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger brother, an overwhelming compulsion to lie and troubling sexual experiences.Salinger, whose characters are among the best and most developed in all of literature has captured the eternal angst of growing into adulthood in the person of Holden Caulfield. Anyone who has reached the age of sixteen will be able to identify with this unique and yet universal character, for Holden contains bits and pieces of all of us. It is for this very reason that The Catcher in the Rye has become one of the most beloved and enduring works in world literature.As always, Salinger's writing is so brilliant, his characters so real, that he need not employ artifice of any kind. This is a study of the complex problems haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Salinger wisely chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple.This is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and simple book. It is anything but. In it we are privy to Salinger's genius and originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner. The Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and understood on many different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live.A work of true genius, images of a catcher in the rye are abundantly apparent throughout this book.While analyzing the city raging about him, Holden's attention is captured by a child walking in the street &quot;singing and humming.&quot; Realizing that the child is singing the familiar refrain, &quot;If a body meet a body, comin' through the rye,&quot; Holden, himself, says that he feels &quot;not so depressed.&quot;The title's words, however, are more than just a pretty ditty that Holden happens to like. In the stroke of pure genius that is Salinger, himself, he wisely sums up the book's theme in its title.When Holden, whose past has been traumatic, to say the least, is questioned by his younger sister, Phoebe, regarding what he would like to do when he gets older, Holden replies, &quot;Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.&quot;In this short bit of dialogue Salinger brilliantly exposes Holden's deepest desire and expounds the book's theme. Holden wishes to preserve something of childhood innocence that gets hopelessly lost as we grow into the crazy and phony world of adulthood.The theme of lost innocence is deftly explored by Salinger throughout the book. Holden is appalled when he encounters profanity scrawled on the walls of Phoebe's school, a school that he envisions protecting and shielding children from the evils of society.When Holden gives his red hunting cap to Phoebe to wear, he gives it to her as a shield, an emblem of the eternal love and protectiveness he feels for her.Near the beginning of the book, Holden remembers a girl he once knew, Jane Gallagher, with whom he played checkers. Jane, he remembers, &quot;wouldn't move any of her kings,&quot; and action Holden realizes to be a metaphor of her naivete. When Holden hears that his sexually experienced prep school roommate had a date with Jane, he immediately starts a fight with him, symbolically protecting Jane's innocence.More sophisticated readers might question the reasons behind Holden's plight. While Holden's feelings are universal, this character does seem to be a rather extreme example. The catalyst for Holden's desires is no doubt the death of his younger brother, Allie, a bright and loving boy who died of leukemia at the age of thirteen. Holden still feels the sting of Allie's death acutely, as well as his own, albeit undeserved, guilt, in being able to do nothing to prevent Allie's suffering.The only reminder Holden has of Allie's shining but all-too-short life, is Allie's baseball mitt which is covered with poems Allie read while standing in the outfield. In a particularly poignant moment, Holden tells us that this is the glove he would want to use to catch children when they fall from the cliff of innocence.In an interesting, but trademark, Salinger twist, Holden distorts the Robert Burns poem that provides the book's title. Originally, it read, &quot;If a body meet a body, comin' through the rye.&quot; Holden distorts the word &quot;meet&quot; into &quot;catch.&quot; This is certainly not the first time Holden is guilty of distortion; indeed he is a master at it.This distortion, however, shows us how much Allie's death has affected Holden and also how much he fears his own fall from innocence, the theme that threads its way throughout the whole of the book.By this amazing book's end, we must reach the conclusion that there are times when we all need a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; We are, indeed, blessed if we have one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is difficult to remember what it was like to read this book for the first time. It is also difficult to imagine a book where each new reading provides so much more illumination into the main character and his personality. I can remember finding Catcher to be funny the first time I read it. I now alternately find Holden to be walking a fine line between witty sarcasm and dangerous cynicism. He is funny, there is no way around that, but his belittling nature also causes him to dismiss much from his life that may not be perfect, but should be included. There is nothing that he, in the end, does not dismiss as being phony, whether it is the nuns with whom he shares a cup of coffee, the teacher at the end who most likely was just trying to help, the Egyptian wing of the museum, Pheobe's school...everything. As soon as one little detail slips in which is not completely on track with what he is thinking whatever it is he is contemplating becomes useless, phony, not worth dealing with. His humor is sharp and witty and I often laugh out loud while reading, but it is also an easy way for him to detach himself from a world which he no longer feels he belongs in, or wants to belong in. I can remember finding the ending ambiguous the first time I read it. I now see it as the only way it could end, with Holden finding happiness watching his sister Pheobe going forever in circles, and being able to pretend that that is never going to change. She is the one thing in his life which he still deems worthy of existence, and placing her on a merry-go-round is his best attempt to keep her there. Things change and grow and move on, but Holden refuses to accept this and is yearning to stop things forever where they are, to go back to when D.B. was a writer full of dreams and Allie was still alive. He mentions once how he used to take field trips to the museum, but how it was never the same and that takes something away from it. Even if the exhibit was the same, YOU would be different, simply by having traveled a bit farther in life, and this is what Holden is incapable of dealing with. The ending is Holden trying to keep the one thing in his life he still truly loves exactly the way she is. I can remember finding Holden's journey to be a bit all over the place. I now can see that there is not a single detail which Salinger does not use to illuminate Holden. On Holden's last night at school everything is covered with snow. He stands there holding a snowball looking for something to throw it at, but he can not bring himself to throw his snowball and disturb a fire hydrant or a park bench. Everything is peaceful under the snow and Holden can not bring himself to alter this just as he can not handle a world that keeps changing. Or there is Holden's history class, which he is failing. The only topic he is remotely interested in is the Egyptians and their process of mummification. The only thing he cares about is how to preserve things just as they are. I can remember enjoying this book the first time I read it. But I had no idea that with each subsequent reading I would find more and more to enjoy, and more and more evidence of Salinger's genius."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Have you ever gotten fed up with the world? Have you ever just had enough of everybody's stupid, phony attitudes and this tainted game that we call life? You feel like you're all alone, there's no one that will listen to you, and the ones that do turn out to be perverts and phonies. Are they all crazy, or is it me?This is the attitude that Holden Caulfield, a disgruntled 16 year-old, takes toward life. He's just flunked out of another school, his younger brother Allie is dead, he's a virgin, and to top it all off, everyone around him is a phony. Holden is alone in this superficial, corrupt world he lives in.What amazes me most about A Catcher in the Rye is it's incredibly controversial beginnings when it was first published. The book took place and was published in the 1940's, and society was based on being right and proper. Things like hollow conversation just for the sake of conversing defined what Holden held as \\"phony\\". Holden hated phonies with a passion, and throughout the book made brutal, dead-on observations about the world which were stated in crude dialect. This caused much uprising in society, and was stereotyped as \\"evil\\" and \\"insignificant\\" by the common \\"phony\\" book reviewer of the time. Even serial killers were found with the book on them. Mark Chapman, the man who murdered John Lennon, was found with the book in his pocket after the crime. As you can imagine this didn't help the situation at all.In the real world, evil was personified as Holden Caulfield. People reacted to the book just as people reacted to Holden in the novel. Holden was considered a rebellious, ungrateful, disrespectful teenager that, although rare, is a worldwide epidemic. But if you see past the narrow-minded view that people tend to look through, the book is a testament that this rebellious teenager is a person. The book shows that Holden, although a sarcastic, nasty, unlikable guy, is a person inside who is just trying to save the virtue of innocence.Holden sees the world as perverted and narrow, and has a nervous breakdown when he sees innocent children about to fall of the cliff. This cliff is a thought of Holden's of which he states when asked what he wants to be when he grows up. Holden says that he wants to be a catcher in the rye. He envisions children playing on a field of rye, and next to this field there's a cliff. Holden would catch the children if they didn't look where they were going and accidentally ran off the cliff. There is incredible symbolism in this statement. The children represent childhood innocence and purity. The cliff, or what lies below it, represents the tainted, impure \\"game\\" of life, in which so many people have fallen. These people, the phonies, are what Holden despises most. Holden demonstrates his desire to save innocence when he finds that someone's written \\"f*** you\\" on a schoolhouse wall. \\"I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids would see it, and how they'd wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them- all cockeyed, naturally- what it meant, and how they'd all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days.\\" Holden rubbed the mark off, and felt extreme hatred toward the person who wrote it.Holden hated everything. Everything he held sacred turned out to be a disappointment. A girl in which he thought was innocent and pure turned out to be \\"given the time\\" by a suave roommate of his. Another girl whom he dated was such a phony it almost made him vomit. He gets roughed up when a disgruntled pimp comes around to collect more than Holden owed for a prostitute whom he didn't even have sex with. An old teacher that finally understood where Holden was coming from turns out to be a pervert when he's found patting Holden's head in the middle of the night. Nothing sacred and nothing pure, and the worse part was that Holden was, self-admittedly, too \\"yellow-belly\\" to do anything about these things. A boy lost in a sick world, helpless to its evil, and yet Holden's the crazy one? Holden speaks the brutal truth, and admires others who do. For example, Holden said that he really admired this kid, James, that Holden knew, who said that another kid, Phil, was a conceited jerk. Phil was much bigger, and he and six other jerks went into scrawny James' room and beat him up, wanting him to take back his comments. James never took it back, but instead, decided to jump out a window to his death.A key factor that made this book enjoyable was the style in which its monologue was written. This book is definitely not an English teacher's dream when it comes to grammar, sentence structure, etc. But the dialect, risqu&eacute; even by today's standards, conveys a feeling of reality that is not obtainable by any other literary device I know of. Holden's sarcasm, humorous attitude, and flat out bluntness had me laughing page after page. This line, chosen at random, demonstrates Holden's attitude and dialect, \\"You should've seen the way they said hello. You'd have thought they hadn't seen each other in twenty years. You'd have thought they'd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced me.\\"So why is A Catcher in the Rye a great book? I think what makes a great book great is its ability to communicate with the reader. Every teenager I know can easily relate to Holden Caulfield's situation. The book is a comfort if you're a teen feeling the same things as Holden, criticizing the world and its occupants. Holden Caulfield is a hero that wasn't afraid to speak his mind. He taught me that your criticisms of the world are not invalid, and that there is nothing that you can say that is so bad that you have to repress it. Holden made me feel a little less alone. He made me feel like there were others in this predicament that we call adolescence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher in the Rye while on break from school. I'd heard many allusions to the book, and many people said they liked it, yet I didn't really know what it was about. It is fascinating, a true inspiration. Holden is so complex that you can't stop thinking about him when you're not reading. Salinger's amazing insights into human nature and his clever style of cynicism is unique to much of literature and better than all contemporary literature. As Holden starts to spiral down, you can't help but feel incredibly sad thinking about his situation. A boy, on the brink of breakdown, speaking of things that make so much sense. It makes you wonder if he's the one going crazy or if it's the way society is that is truly crazy. I will always love this book and I plan on going over it again to underline all the lines that I adored. For the people giving bad reviews, and as I've analyzed their comments, I must say that you missed the boat. I'm sure that you are the people that Holden is making his social critiques on. No symbolism, a boring character that is whining? Come again? Salinger's phrasing of his words is simplistic, but his message is not. Read it again, try and be more perceptive, and think harder about what is really being said. There is enlightenment waiting for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Time has not damaged this tome; it remains a sometimes harrowing, sometimes absorbing, sometimes frustrating, sometimes moving look into a mind in a state of disarray.Others have written more \\"shocking\\" books or have been more overtly anti-social, but with The Catcher In The Rye, J.D. Salinger captures the bitterly confused mind of a youth who hates the whole world not because the world is worth hating, but because he's frustrated at his own inability to get along in that world, with such crisp reality that it shocks far more than any fantastical American Psycho.Reading over the negative reviews on Amazon, I can't help but wonder how and why so many people are so unable to get it. The Catcher In The Rye is among the, if not the, most tangibly realistic looks into the mind of a disaffected, disillusioned youth suffering from depression (and a touch of the bipolar). The way Holden Caulfield's mind works is incredibly true to form - the contradictions, the hypocrisy, the confusion, the brief moments of sheer clarity followed by stretches of irrational thought. He thinks he's better than the world, and he thinks he's the lousiest person in the world at the same time. He wants everyone to go away and leave him alone, and he can't bear anyone, not even some schmuck he really dislikes (with good reason), to leave him. He's nothing but hypocrisy and contradictions and confusion. Salinger captures this in an amazing way.People criticize the book because Caulfield is totally unlikable, a guy who rails against phonies when he himself is something of a phony ... but that's part of the point. Holden throws off all the signals someone in his situation actually throws off in real life, and just like real life, they're almost always ignored. Clearly this was a very, very autobiographical work for Salinger.There are several moments when Caulfield, narrating in the first person, mentions offhandedly that he began to cry, he didn't know why, he felt like dying, and suddenly it went away and he felt invigorated with energy. It rings remarkably true. Who wrote this stuff with such honesty in 1951? Who tackled these issues, and in such a manner, in the 1950s?The reason this has impact, though, is not simply because of the subject matter, not because of what Holden Caulfield is going through, and not because of the context of its time, but because Salinger never plays it for melodrama. He doesn't talk it up with purple prose or romanticize Caulfield's mentality or beat you over the head with ham-handed messages and platitudes. He neither makes Holden's mentality seem \\"cool\\" nor does he preach against Holden's attitude; he just says, \\"This is what it is.\\" By presenting it in such a matter-of-fact manner, all in the first person, as if the narrator is simply telling you a story while having a few drinks, the whole thing is rooted in a very tangible, and therefore very disturbing, reality.You and I KNOW Holden Caulfield. We've known that guy. And in The Catcher In The Rye, you get to peer inside his mind.Even with dated references and slang and phrasings, I don't know that J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye will ever cease to be relevant and important."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read The Catcher in the Rye many times--when I was 11, 13, 15, and 17 years old. Seriously. I loved it from the first time I read it, but it didn't hit home until I was a junior and senior in high school.I AM HOLDEN CAULFIELD. Well, not literally and exactly. But almost. Holden is an extraordinary character. His absolute terror of leaving the wonderful, innocent, carefree world of youth is something everyone can relate to. I'm about to graduate from high school, and even though I'm excited to be a free, independent adult, I can't help but be terrified of the corruption and hard reality that lays ahead, which I have been blind to, as a young person. I mean--who wouldn't miss being a kid?--living at home for free, not having to do anything or be responsible for yourself or anyone. Holden embodies this. To me, that's what I related to most from the book.Most kids I know don't like the book cuz they're forced to read it for class, which is understandable. I wish they could see the beauty, and heartbreaking universality of Holden's story, though. It is something J.D. Salinger had the talent to grasp, and share it with the rest of the world.And it's so freakin' inspirational I have to go on Amazon.com and tell some people!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield, a teenager growing up in New York during the 1950s, has been expelled from yet another school. (This time, it's Pencey Prep.) His teachers had found him to be incompetent and an underachiever. After coming to the conclusion the so-called \\"friends\\" he had made were phonies, Holden decides he has no reason to stay. He packs his bags and leaves, deciding to \\"take a vacation\\" in New York before returning to his parents' inevitable wrath. Told as a monologue, The Catcher in the Rye not only describes Holden's thoughts and activities throughout these few days, but it also goes back to his past. He describes some of his true friends, how his parents and childhood were,and gives reasons for his actions. (Like deciding not to have sex with a prostitute.) These few days can probably be best described as a developing nervous breakdown, a result of his unexplained depression, impulsive spending and generally odd, erratic behavior. However, life continues on around Holden as it always has, with the majority of people ignoring the changes that occur in him- until it begins to get them seriously ticked off. Progressively through the novel we are challenged to think about society's attitude to the human condition - does society have an 'ostrich in the sand' mentality, a deliberate ignorance of the emptiness that can characterize human existence? And if so, when Caulfield begins to probe and investigate his own sense of emptiness and isolation, before finally declaring that the world is full of 'phonies' with each one out for their own phony gain, is Holden actually the one who is going insane, or is it society which has lost it's mind for failing to see the hopelessness of its own existence? This is a timeless classic, not to be missed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As one of those \`classics of literature', it almost seems sacrilegious to criticize a critical success like \`The Catcher in the Rye'. Well, I can't help but feel as though the novel's garnered respect and praise is a little much when you actually consider how little the novel really says about adolescence. Sure, it tries (and at times succeeds) to convey a feeling of apathetic innocence, but its construction is rather off-putting and it's overall anticlimactic result is less ambiguously rewarding and more strangely hollow.\`The Catcher in the Rye' is an ambitious story that attempts to say a lot but fails to really live up to its potential.The novel tells of two mere days in the life of the recently expelled sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield. Not wanting to face the wrath of his parents, Holden decides to avoid home for a few days (until he's expected back), living on his own in the city. The premise is merely a foundation for Holden's simplistic views and reasoning's concerning life and his future. He considers everyone around him to be fake and undeserving of his time, yet it is obvious that Holden is just as \`phony' as the rest of them. He goes on dates, gets trashed at bars, sneaks off to visit his sister, imposes (or does he) on a former teacher and even has a run in with a pimp.Sadly, all of this is conveyed in Holden's uninteresting and at times aggravating delivery.I'm not trying to lighten the point which J.D. Salinger was trying to make, for it is a very poignant (maybe even more so today then when the novel was actually written) point. Our young ones are just as misplaced and confused as Holden, and so his tale of apathy masked desperation is one that we could all learn from; but Salinger loses my patience with his redundancy. Some have complained of the same thing, which I was pleased to see (it proves that some people are willing to think outside of the preordained box). Holden says the same thing on just about every page, so much so that the surprise is stripped from us and we are left with a predictable tale of teenage angst. Maybe that was the point, to expose the lack of genuine life that resides inside someone of Holden's nature. He thinks that he is the only \`real' person around yet it is obvious to all onlookers that he is basically walking death. He is offering nothing, yet he \`has' potential; or so we are told.The story is crucial yet the delivery makes this a difficult read, one that you almost don't want to bother with. I've read novels that are hard to read due to their construction, yet they possess a certain otherworldliness that make then necessary (look at \`A Clockwork Orange' for just that), but \`The Catcher in the Rye' lacks the emotional connection needed to make it worth suffering through. In the end the novels brilliant moments (like Holden's confession as to what it is he really wants to be) are masked by all of the mediocre (or just plain uninspiring) ones, leaving us with a novel that feels incomplete and a concept that deserved so much more than it got.And the ending, I just have this to say. I am all for the anticlimactic; believe me. I relish in the idea of a simple \`stop' put to a novel, for it allows the reader to move on with a sense of personalized closure. I often think of Bret Easton Ellis, in particular \`Less Than Zero' when I think of that sort of ending; an open ended closing that leaves you deciding the fates of the characters yourself. If often works beautifully, but here it seems rather empty as apposed to rich with meaning.I just kind of shrugged it off because I didn't really care what happened next.One might protest that that is the point, that we aren't supposed to care about Holden, thus furthering the poignancy of Salinger's point; but to them I have only this to say: \\"YOU HAVE TO CARE FOR IT TO MATTER.\\" You cannot reach an audience if they are not moved. If we adopt the same apathetic attitude of the main character then we simply have not achieved the desired response. If this novel is to mean anything then we have to be stunned, mortified and moved to action because of it; and for that to happen it has to be delivered in a way that actually EFFECTS us. For me, and apparently a few others, Salinger didn't do that.I know that I am in the minority here, but I have to speak my truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The catcher in the rye is a rather short yet excellent book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book while reading it. The story basically tells of a rebellious high school student named Holden Caulfield. He gets kicked out of school because of his horrible grades, but he hangs around New York instead of going home so that his mother can get the letter first and calm down before he gets home. He does a few crazy things while staying in New York, but he gets bored and finally decides to go home. The story itself is just talking about a high schoolers time in New York City, but the excellent part about the book is the way it is told.Holden Caulfield is not your typical rebellious teenage high schooler; he is much more than that. The crazy things that he does are so weird that even rebellious teenagers nowadays don't even do them. The funny thing is that whatever crazy thing he does, it sounds normal to the reader. He tells it in a way that makes you agree with what he did. Everybody around him he considers a phony and then he describes why they are stupid. People don't understand him even though he actually is a very bright person, he just doesn't show it. Many things he says are actually worth considering in our world today.The book is very funny and I finished it in just a couple of sittings, but if you are looking for an action packed book, this isn't one for you. Humor is a big key in this book and if you get the humor, you'll enjoy the book. This book is for people who think nobody understands them and that they are all alone in this world, because actually, as Holden learned, there are many people in this world that will actually listen to you if you give them the chance."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A catcher. It's actually a misquote explained in the book. Now if you've read some of these bad reveiws you're probably all set move on to another book, but there's hope. First you have to understand Salinger writes most of his stories like a puzzle and its up to the reader to figure it out. If you take the book at face value all you get is a confusing mess about a teen age boy. If you dig a little beneath the surface you find the story of a boy coming to terms with adulthood and growing up. His little sister Phoebe is the childhood essence, his dead brother Allie symbolizes never growing old, and Being a catcher in the rye is his desire to save children from the pains of adulthood. It does a good job of explaining a teenagers view of the adult life and childhood and the pain of being stuck in between. as for the story being depressing, if you realise that Holden, the main character, is happy in the end, willing to grow up, youd see its not depressive. As for those who says he just needs help and they couldnt relate, perhaps they should have read it when they were 16 or perhaps they should read it again. Look for the clues and youll realise the story is being told in some sort of institution were Holden is resting. The character isnt perfect, isnt overly likeably but that's what makes the story so great. It's a look at one mans real life, not a happily-ever-after story.

Throughout his stay in NY underground, Holden finds peace only when talking to his dead brother, Allie and his sister, Phoebe. And when Holden returns home secretly the first time, the all important question comes from Phoebe, demanding to know what was important to Holden and what he wanted to be, Holden really begins to wonder. I really enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye, (though I wonder at the total number of cuss words used...)Although it offers a lot of criticism about people in the world we are living in today, there are many intriguing ideas that make this book one of the best books I've ever read. Salinger is indeed a great writer and it makes me wonder how he could have written a book that later became one of the most banned book in the country.....and yet a classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really liked this book because it just hit home with me. Most people can relate with Holden and what he is going through. I really like it when you can relate with the characters in books, that alone makes it worth reading. Overall, it is a great story and i really enjoyed it. Remember, don't tell anyone anything, or else you will just start to miss everything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many reviewers praise this novel based on its theme of lost innonece or the lack of ingeniousness in adult society as revealed through the eyes of a teenage boy that is defined as psychotic by the author (possibly due to the untimely death of a brother). I felt a bit cheated by the author's choice to give Holden an excuse for his perception of society. I believe the beauty and brilliance of this novel is not the portrayal of the challenging journey from adolescence to adulthood or the depiction of a society as seen by certain madmen, but instead by the portrayal of society as seen by many of us that are easily confused and disgusted by the norms of human behavior. Holden's minute by minute interpretation of social encounters is so well documented (the writing style used in this novel is unmatched) that the reader will frequently relate with his sentiments. Salinger's ability to capture these sentiments so precisely over and over again was enough to make Catcher in the Rye one of the best reads ever. Go ahead and try to find value embedded deeply in the story, but as far as I am concerned, the payoff is all on the surface - whether Salinger wanted it that way or not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I finished the book yesterday, and today I decided that I liked A Catcher in the Rye. Holden wants to catch children who are playing in rye fields before they fall off of a nearby cliff. Now what does all that mean? Why such a quirky title? Perhaps it is because the story is about a character/narrator who is himself in need of a catcher. His pessimistic views on life/people/society are often viewed as true - especially to teenagers - and quite often spark a connection between the storyteller and the reader. As a matter of fact, that's what it did for me. As I read this kid's gripes about life, I thought to myself - &quot;Often, I feel the same way.&quot; That's why this book is so enormously popular. It connects with the American who feels as though most of society is fake, that people are for the most part stupid, and that intelligent conversation is sparse in our culture of $200 sunglasses and iced cappucinos. So for those who prefer coffee over cappucino, you'll find solace in this book. You are not alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not going to get into any detailed analysis of the great aspects of the book because that job has already been successfully done by the other reviewers. What I am going to say is that I highly recommend this book for teenagers, solely on the basis that I am one and I think this book has totally changed my viewpoints. Teens can really relate to Holden because of his sarcastic and cynical views on life. For me, it was amazing because I would read something from the book and then I would think, 'I can totally relate to how he's feeling or what he's thinking'. It was almost a revelation for me. No book has ever been able to capture my attention as much as this one has. So, to everyone, ESPECIALLY TEENAGERS, I highly recommend this book - Salinger's a literary genius."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book, but since over a thousand people have listed why this book is so good, I won't go into it. This book has obviously influenced a lot of the current writers out there (I almost felt like I was reading Nick Hornby or Brett Easton Ellis), but the thing that gave me the biggest kick was when I finally made the connection between the characters named 'Holden' and 'Banky' in Kevin Smith's movie Chasing Amy. Obviously taken from this book. (Remember Ed Banky, with the car?) I love little bits of trivia like that. Read this book, and re-read it if you hated it, because it is truly hilarious. I read it at thirteen, at seventeen, and now at twenty five, and it is still awesome."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"People like to sit and extol the virtues of The Catcher in the Rye. They like to discuss the underlying meaning of family and adolescence and life. People like to debate the true placement of the climax and the real significance of the duck pond. I just like to read this book. Actually, I love to read it. I love to just sit down and let this book take me on an adventure through the mind of one young man, Holden V. Caulfield, as he manages to reveal tremendous truths about, well, about just about everything. Congress should pass a law requiring everyone to read this book at least once and maybe twice. No joke."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is so wonderful. I was required to read it for English class, and I read it all within a week. I thought the writing style was superb, I really felt as if I was Holden's shadow through his ordeal, I could practically feel his physical and emotional pain. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to ANYONE who enjoys good literature. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I did, and also I suggest reading/buying Nine Short Stories by J.D. Salinger, they are quite good also."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book of great stature. Anyone who has read this novel I'm sure would agree. The adventures, sometimes referred to as struggles, of Holden Caulfield are extremely intriguing. J. D. Salinger did a wonderful job of entering the teen mind, perhaps his own, and capturing the thoughts of Holden and his occasionally immature actions.A morally educating novel with incredible preciseness. Intelligently written with high esteem, an important part of anyone's home library."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I decided to try this book because many famous celebrities such as Johnny depp and Winona Ryder happened to mention it was one of their favourites. I have now come to understand why it happens to be so. JD salinger is an eye opener, for anyone who wants to see reality. Everything in the book is basically truth. Reality really does bite. The language and contents are all things that we experience in everyday life. However, warning to those who are going to buy it: I had to stop half way through the book because I was so depressed and I couldn't go on. Of course I did end up finishing the book, but it really can make you feel down. There's heaps of 'phonies' in the book and it makes you feel like dirt. Don't read it if you're on the verge of suicide."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was an enjoyable read. The underlying differences in moral principles, the reason for its ban in the late 20th century, make the main character, Holden Caulfield, stand out from most typical literature. He introduces you to the part of yourself you didn't know--the irrational, illogical part that wants to act simply because you feel like it. It's relieving to see this in writing, and the impracticality of finding someone like this ironically helps Holden come to life. You see him not as a character in a book, but as part of you that you can both connect with and repel. He helps you consider the virtue of morality and goals, and makes you challenge the dictatorial, esteemed \\"morals\\" we are all too familiar with.The book is very thought stimulating; J.D. Salinger makes you consider what truly matters, and introduces you to a side of yourself, and society, that almost seems invisible. The Catcher in the Rye is truly a unique and excellent novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye ReviewThe Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. Salinger, was a book unlike any other book that I have read before. This book has gained the attention and respect of many readers during the last few decades and there is no doubt that the book is famous. Many people have claimed that this book has changed their lives and that it is a \\"must read\\" for every teenager. I, however, would like to disagree and I don't understand what the big deal is about this book.The book follows Holden Caulfield's life for a couple of days. The story takes place in the short time period of less than a week and it starts off with Holden getting kicked out of another school. Holden's brother had recently died and his life was changed forever. After the death if his brother, Holden becomes more careless and adopts an \\"I couldn't care less\\" attitude. Holden pretends to talk to his dead brother and he must work out his very emotional problems and find his true identity through his careless, teenage life. Holden doesn't care about his future or his life. \\"Oh sure I feel some concern for my future, but not too much I guess,\\" he said. He spends his time drinking, swooning women and calling up prostitutes. Not to mention his crude language.The other characters in the book where almost nonexistent. Two main characters would be a stretch and every time a new character emerges, he is quickly tossed and forgot about by the next chapter. Holden also has a habit of calling people phonies. He really doesn't like the phonies in the book and sees them as degraded. However, it never even occurs to him that he, himself, is a huge phony.Holden's true character emerges throughout the book. \\"I'm quite illiterate, but I like to read a lot,\\" he said. Holden, at the end of the book, is quite a different Holden then at the beginning. I guess I am not one of the people whose life has changed after reading this book. It had bad language, but it was written in first person by a teenager, so it was easy to read. However, by the end of the book, there were many questions that needed to be answered. A main character, Jane, whom Holden is in love with, is well known throughout the first couple of chapters, but the book ends with no mention of Jane's whereabouts. It was almost as if J.D. Salinger got tired of writing the book, so he decided to end it abruptly. Holden's character totally transforms in the last couple of pages and it ends with Holden saying \\"That's all I'm going to tell about.\\" The ending got me angry and the book had no plot. This book was a waste of time and I don't know why it is such a landmark book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Don't let the title fool you into thinking that this slim novel is about baseball or even agriculture. Set against the nostalgic backdrop of World War II as it was winding down, CATCHER presents a series of flash backs from the 17-year-old protagonist, who is housed in a mental facility in California. Holden Caulfield at 16 is hardly a heroic type; rather he's a poor little rich kid who's just been expelled from his 4th boarding school. The entire 213 pages consist of Holden's non-stop personal revelations about himself, his family and his fellow students. Rarely requiring sleep or even sustenance, this whacked-out kid rambles during 100 pages to recount just one 24-hour period, leaving readers somewhat bewildered and breathless.For various reasons Holden decides to leave Pencey Prep several days before their official Christmas break starts-thanks to cash from a generous grandmother. Taking a train to NY City-where he was raised-he tries to make it on his own for four days, before shamefully returning home to admit yet another academic debacle. During this time, when he drops below the parental radar screen, he experiences a series of social and physical adventures-most of which prove unsatisfactory or unsavory. His fertile brain spews out unceasing commentary on Life, plus those kids and adults who crossed his path; he dips ever deeper into flash backs about his previous schools.Salinger's style of verbal gushing is easy to read-chatty and conversational, in fact--but the frantic pace can exhaust his readers. The way Holden abuses his body results in several bouts of illness for him, but his deepest wound may prove the death of his brother during the war. Were it not for the loyal devotion of his little sister, Phoebe, Holden might not be able to hang on his sanity as well as he almost has. He wonders if he needs faddish Psychoanalysis. Shrinkage is what he eventually gets, but is that the only path to the full recovery of his delicate psyche?In the mid 80's one Ferris Bueller took a Day Off-- perhaps inspired by Holden's mid-Forties private break with reality. Contemporary teenagers may not sympathize with his anguished pilgrimage to escape the phonies of this world. CATCHER proves a grim roller coaster ride through the thought processes of a disturbed youth, who makes a point of honor to be NOT HOME-alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I chose this book as one of my contemporary literature books for my AP English class. Of the 6 books we pick we have to write \\"logs\\" on them every thirty pages or so. A portion of this log requires an insight in the section and let me tell you, even though this book was awarded as Book of the Century, it is extremely hard to find anything insightful in it.The basic premise is this:\\"I hate everything. I'm depressed. I want to kill myself by jumping out of a window or being strapped to an atomic bomb. I'm just too much of a wuss to go through with it.\\"I'm sure if I had more time to read it over I could find more things in it, but if you're trying to stick to a schedule for a class, this is not the book to choose. There is very little material to work with if you have to write a good deal about the book and I honestly think Salinger was just making up this story as he went along."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Even thought this book is considered a \\"classic\\", it's not one of the best books I've ever read. I guess I'm not that interested in it because it doesn't have much of a plot so far. Basically all Holden does is wander from bar to club hitting on everyone he sees. If I was in this novel I think I'd be kind of scared of Holden, the main character. Holden seems kind of crazy sometimes, and he just blurts out stupid things, such as his plans for moving to a cabin in the woods and getting married. This book would probably be easier to read if Holden didn't swear every two words. I know that it helps define his character, but after awhile you get tired of reading the same thing over and over. So even though \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is a classic, I don't think it's a book that everyone needs to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I understand that The Catcher in the Rye is a classic novel. I am, of course, loathe to criticize a classic, but frankly I don't see what all the fuss about, for a number of reasons.Holden Caufield is an immature teenager who runs away from school and curses. A lot. The Catcher in the Rye follows Holden's journey around New York after he spontaneously decided to leave his prep school early after being kicked out for bad grades. Holden spends his time wasting his money and having run-ins at several seedy establishments. The book isn't, however, so much about things happening as what Holden thinks of them. Holden constantly bemoans the phoniness of almost eveything and everyone. He seems to dislike everyone except his younger sister, Phoebe, and he sings the praises of his dead younger brother, Allie.The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel. By the end of the novel, Holden begins to show some semblance of maturity, and talks about going back to school rather than running away as he had intended. Throughout the novel, Holden's complaints about 'phoniness' of almost everything are key to understanding the themes of the novel, as is his conversation with Phoebe about being 'the catcher in the rye'. Holden mistrusts the adult world, and though he doesn't ever admit it, we can deduce that he wishes to stay in the carefree world of the young where nothing ever changes.Whether a person enjoys The Catcher in the Rye depends largely on whether they appreciate the character of Holden Caufield, as he is the narrator. Holden drove me nuts. Halfway through the book I wanted to strangle the kid for being so irresponsible. I found Holden hard to believe. In my personal experience, I have never met someone, even at Holden's age, who displayed the utter lack of common sense that Holden does.Read The Catcher in the Rye for an interesting perspective. I can see why it is a classic, but didn't particularly enjoy it myself, although others may."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Vaccum cleaners tell you a lot about life.I like corn chips with salsa.Audio Image.Darts are not good for clothing labels.CD's are grandpa.I like it a lot even blue underline."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After sifting through the mountains of good reviews this book has recieved (and the intriguing title) I decided to check it out. Bad move. (Most of) The characters, particularly Holden Caulfield, are flat, boring and Holden is not, as some reviews gush, &quot;identifiable with myself&quot; at all. Rather, he's made out to be a lost, confused (read-annoying) teenager with no direction of where he's going, leaving a large, empty hole in the plot. Phoebe, Holden's sister, is an (rather, the only) exception.Maybe I just don't get the book. Whatever. Just let me say that this was a serious letdown."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is possibly the weakest novel I have ever suffered through. It is a constant whine session in which only the background changes. It is even a poor example of angst literature. If you want a real classic in the field try Jack Kerouac's Maggie Cassidy. Otherwise, avoid purchasing this book. If you already wasted the money, you may join me in throwing it into the trash."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was full of profanity and pointless dialogue.

I strongly suggest looking for a different book that doesn't constantly refer to Prostitution and loneliness."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved the narrator's &quot;talking style&quot; as someone else here referred to it. I was amazed that a book written in that common language style of the 40s would fit in very well with the language many teens use today. Almost undated at all. Only in his outward respect to elders which today's cynical kids don't display.My problem with the novel is the humor and freshness wears thin after about 80-90 pages. I think this novel could have been half the length and would have been much more effective."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; in school with my English classc. It is not so hard to read, not even for young people, since Holden uses a very slangy type of language and you get through it fast. I think it is fairly interesting to read, because you learn a lot about how adolescents think, although it is not possible to say that all adolescents think like Holden, because he shows some qualities which are not usual for every teenager.I think J. D. Salinger tried to write a book which is easy and well for young people to read, that is the reason for him to write about teenager problems,but Holden is a very depressed person. There are a lot of aspects about life which he just takes too serious. Some of the things he thinks about are actually significant for all teenagers, but a lot of them are a little bit exaggerated.Further I think the book does not have a real plot. It is just the story of a teenager, who has to cope with problems, which he produces himself. There are just a few aspects, with which I can identify. Maybe J.D. Salinger just wanted to show, what may happen if adolescents feel alone.If you are interested in what a depressed adolescent's life looks like, I can recommend the book, but if you do not want to get closer to teenager problems, this is not the right book for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is possibly the best book that I have ever read. What Holden tells the readers is not to be fooled by phonies. There is so much going on in this book, it's hard to believe. You think while reading it, it's just a cynical 16-year-old telling us about whats going on in his life, but there is a lot of symbolism. This is the classic &quot;teenager coming of age&quot; story, and every book like it should be judged by this."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. salinger, is my one of my all time favorite books. I first read it in 8th grade, and i read it all in one day. i really couldnt put it down. some people say it drags on, but i think it builds up more and more.With each page Salinger takes you more and more into the world of Holden Caulfield. and In almost every way you can relate to this young man, or feel a sense or empathy because we have all been in similar situations to him. In no other time as anyone in literature fully described what its like to be filled with teenage angst. so check out this book if youve ever been a teenager."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this in one day, and I'm not a speed reader.

Swear to God."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For all the high schoolers out there who dread reading those boring novels assigned by your English teacher and read cliffs or sparknotes instead, do not pass this book up. I read Catcher in the Rye my junior year in high school and to this day it is still one of my all time favorite books.I'm not an avid reader. In fact, I hate reading. I can't even stand reading those Hallmark cards that have too many words on them (ha ha). But when I picked this book up I could not put it down. I'm in college now, and I still have yet to find a book that I like better than this one. I was able to relate to the main character, and I enjoyed the bitter sarcism and dark humor. I never got bored reading his thoughts.However, I do caution people who get easily offended to read with an open mind. Many of my more conservative friends found the novel distastefull.So for all you teenagers who prefer to party instead of do homework and get an oral summary from the smart kid next you in math class, the period before Englsih, at least give this book a chance. BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL LIKE IT."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first book assigned to me for school that I actually liked. After being forced to read dreadfully boring books like Jane Eyre, The Once and Future King, the Odyessy, and then some, I went in to this book with the mind set that it was going to just be another boring classic. It wasn't though. It was great. I laughed out loud at some of the things Holden said; I'm sure if it was supposed to be funny though. He was just so random. It was great. It was so cute how he was always putting on his red hunting hat and asking everyone where the all ducks went when the lake froze. Aside from the comic aspects of the book, Holden was clearly a depressed invidual. Even though he flunked out of Pency, the school he was going to, it was obvious that he was really smart; otherwise he wouldn't have noticed all the little things that bother him so much causing him to be depressed. I recommend this book to everyone. It's easy to read and very interesting. I loved it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What would you do before you had to confront your parents after just getting expelled from yet another school? The Catcher in the Rye, by Jerome David Salinger, is a book about a teenage 16-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield who has a problem staying in this all-boys prep school called Pency but then gets exempted from the school. Now he must confront his parents. Instead of deciding to face them with his failure, he decides to: take an early vacation, wander around the streets of New York City, and come into contact with some interesting characters.The majority of the novel takes place in New York City during post-war America which is in the early 1950's. The start of the novel takes place at Pency prep school. When Caulfield leaves Pency, he goes to various places in New York City, some of which are pretty popular. Areas of New York are very much like ghettos. An example description from the book would be, \\"The whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really did.\\" The journey begins just a week before Holden's Christmas break. But the real setting doesn't come till you read to the end. This is where the book's popularity comes from.The narrator here is Holden Caulfield, the main character, who is an egomaniac because he thinks too highly of himself as not being \\"phony\\" and the only genuine person in mankind. As the story goes on he meets these strange, yet interesting characters he barely knows and criticizes them. He criticizes everyone! Not himself, just everyone else. He's a pretty smart guy, I'll give him that, but he's not so buff and tuff. Actually... he's very much a pacifist. His reputation is a bad one. He has flunked almost all his classes and has gotten the boot from three different boarding schools. The only class he's good at is English, and this is because he thinks all his other classes are \\"tedious\\" and \\"phony\\". Throughout the story Holden is pretty much the same because he can't let go the thought of his phony society around him. I like how he critiques all the common things done by the common people, it really makes me think.The strange thing about this book is it doesn't have a real sticky plot. What I mean is... there is no plot! Hah! What kept me reading was the no plot idea and the unpredictability of where the book was headed. Holden is supposed to leave Pency and immediately tell his parents at home of his expulsion. He doesn't do it; instead, he wanders around in NYC. Then his favorite teacher betrays him. Mr. Spencer, one of the few teachers Caulfield liked, broke the news to his parents. This makes him even more terrified to go home so he travels incognito. Holden also gets into bizarre situations in the slums and hotels of New York. He feels like he can't speak to anyone except to his 10 year old sister named Phoebe, and he frequently recalls memories of his deceased little brother. At times, he even thinks about suicide or running away because of the \\"corrupt society around him\\".Salinger has an interesting way of writing, and brings out the reputation of his characters at the start. As far as difficulty is concerned, all you need to know are words like: conceited, phony, inferior, and complex, and you're set. He repeats statements and opinions over and over again to show Holden's strong opposition or power of his thoughts. The moral here is that everyone must grow up, it is inevitable, and that you can't change the opinions of others as easily as you think you can. Don't expect that criticizing people will help you change the world to the way you want it to be, the world is set and no man can alter it. I'm a person who doesn't find most fiction books interesting enough to finish, but when I got a hold of this book, I had to keep reading to finish it. After you read this book you really have to think about it for a while and find a revelation on your own. This is the major part of the book, and you'll appreciate this book for it. The only word that can describe this book is... \\"interesting\\" and it really makes you think to make you say out loud, \\"Wow!\\" Although there are some vulgar word usages here and there, I'd recommend this book to anyone, especially teenagers who can really relate."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye tells about a boy who flunks high school and roams around New York City.

Salinger's most famous novel. It is a mildly entertaining novel about an emo boy who is a hater. His name is Holden Caulfield. The story follows his journey through out New York City. He got kicked out of school a couple days before Christmas break, and decided not to go home for a couple days. So he was alone in the city. He encounters lots of people and gets involved in some weird situations. This book was banned at one time because they thought it has a bad influence on people.This book had no influence on me because I thought that it was boring, and I had a hard time getting in to it. The author describes a lot of really boring details. Also Holden says \\"corny\\" and phony almost every other line, it is really annoying. There is no main issue that the author addresses. The story is told through Holden's eyes, and since he is a hater, he swears a lot. There is never a real good mood through out the story. It has a depressed mood most of the time. The purpose of the book is to just tell you the story of a sixteen year-old boy who is very troubled about almost everything, through his eyes.The story mentions a few other characters. In the beginning he is with his roommates, Stradlater, and Ackley. He talks about a girl named Jane Gallagher a lot, but never gets together with her. Also he goes on a long date with a girl named Sally Hayes. But the second most important character in the book is his sister Phoebe. She is younger that him but really smart. He talks with her a lot, and spends most of the last part of the book with her. He also mentions his brothers Allie, who died and D.B. who is out in California. Holden briefly runs into other people, like a pimp, a couple of nuns, and an old English teacher.The strength of the book in my opinion is Holden's personality, because it makes the story some -what interesting. The weakness I think is the plot. Nothing really happens, it is kind of boring when you think about. He just stays at a hotel for a couple of nights, gets a lot of cabs, calls some people, gets drunk, and talks to his sister. Also the word choice gets annoying because he says the same stuff over and over again. I would give it two and a half stars out of five, because it is some-what entertaining. I would recommend reading it if you needed a book to read for an assignment, but I wouldn't read it for pleasure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a classic baby.Tells a story of a kid(blah blah blah) I think you might know but if you haven't buy it and read.But I must say I wasn't hooked to the book and even though I enjoyed the book, the beginning was kinda boring but I KNOW that that was just me.Verdict: 4.8 out of 5.0"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can't believe so many people like this novel. It reads like Salinger sat down and wrote it in one night, making it up as he went along. It's repetitive and pointless. The language is so trite and corny, Holden comes off as unrealistically dorky. There's really nothing approaching a plot; he just wanders around ranting about nothing. I guess maybe a lot of people like it because they relate to Holden, but I don't. It has nothing to do with cynisism; it has to do with being a whiny, obnoxious ADHD head case. I give it two stars for being fairly original and innovative (for better or worse) in its day."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is considered to be a modern classic, a piece of literature that's value won't fade with time. It is set in the late forties or early fifties and is about a seventeen-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield and the 48 or so hours of his life after he is kicked out of yet another high school for flunking most of his classes. The theme of the book is seeing the world through a very original, angsty character's eyes and understanding what the world means to someone whose life is slowly falling apart.The sad reality is that The Catcher in the Rye is probably one of the most overrated books of all time. The story aside, the style and form of the writing itself is so simplistic and vulgar that it is downright offensive to read. The narrative is the first-person journal of the main character who happens to be a pretty bad writer, which makes the reading of the book far from enjoyable. The vast majority of the sentences are short and choppy; the sentence structure never varies, creating a horribly boring read. If one pulled out the unnecessary cuss words from the narrative, the book could quite possibly be 20 pages shorter. The protagonist tends to repeat himself several times and continually tries to convince the reader that what he's saying is true. Salinger would probably defend his work by saying that the narrative was keeping Holden in character. I retort that if keeping the narrator in character means insulting the readers' intelligence, then perhaps making the character a better writer is in order. (On a side note, Holden's best subject in school is English. Go figure.)The description in the story is also very lacking. Description in the first-person is a harder task than in third-person writing, but it's not impossible. Salinger has our character walking through high schools and 50's New York streets, in apartments and bars galore, but the reader is never immersed into the environment. Instead of facing the challenge of description in the first person, it's as though Salinger chooses to ignore it entirely. And when there is description, it is blunt and to the point; there is no embellishment that might bring the world to life.Aside from the writing itself, the plot is the worst aspect of this book. The problem is that there is none. We are thrown into an arbitrary spot in this boy's life and we follow him aimlessly around New York for two days. Nothing actually happens. There is no flow of events, there is no building climax, and there is no resolution. We simply follow Holden Caulfield around for a while and then we stop. If readers of this book are expecting a story, they will be sorely disappointed.The only good aspect of this story is the characterization. Holden Caulfield is the original angsty teenager. That is nothing original in this day and age, but Catcher has been credited as the first story to really bring that aspect of adolescence to light. And, despite his now stereotypical personality, he still manages to be a very original character. Many teens may be angry at the world, but Holden manages to be a very sympathetic person at the same time. Sadly, that is as deep as the character gets. He either hates, pities, or both pities and hates everyone he encounters, excepting his little sister alone. What's worse is that there is little to no character development. The Holden Caulfield of the first chapter is the exact same Holden Caulfield of the last chapter except that he has decided to write the journal that comprises the book. Holden's little sister, Phoebe, is just about the one and only delight of this story. Her character is the deepest of the secondary characters, and she's one of those personalities that makes simply reading about her a joy. Without her, there would be no redeeming factor to this book at all.So, if Catcher is such a bad read, what made it a modern classic? The answer can be found on page 189 of the Little, Brown Books paperback edition. The speaker is one of Holden's old teachers from an earlier school who is trying to help him decide to straighten his life up.\\"Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them--if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangment. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.\\"The trouble with this book is that far too many people seem to think that this book, by its own confession, is history and poetry. They're reading far more into a very shallow story than was ever put into it. The Catcher in the Rye is still being hailed as a classic of modern literature, but a classic is a story that endures and has meaning long after the time it was written has passed. I'm hoping that in a hundred years gone by, this book will be dubbed what it was from the start: garbage."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for a school assignment, and was not able to put it down...this book is by far one of the most remarkable books i have ever read. Reading this book was not like reading a book, because it goes by so fast, and sadly enough the books ends before you know it. Throughout the book you will laugh, cry, and not be able to put it down. i could read this book over and over day and night, and still be fascinated by it. If you have not read this book i recomend that you do as soon as possible, because it is not worth passing up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Never mind these fools who say they can't relate to the Holden Caulfield. They're probably the phonies this book was written to criticize. If they had any soul they'd realize Holden is a much deeper charector than they realize. This book is outright one of the better books I've read. If you've ever found yourself say &quot;Jeez, people are such a$$holes!&quot; you will love this book. Also, read Charles Bukowski's Ham on Rye.

No one had written a book like this before. No one had bothered with the confused, imperfect, wise-beyond-his-years, yet painfully inexperienced teenage point-of-view. Since then, we've been inundated with Salinger imitators in all areas of entertainment--books, tv and film. All of these archetypal copies have, unfortuntely, undermined just how unique this story, and this character really are. This is not just the first modern coming-of-age novel, but the finest."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Read this again and again: It keeps you sane in an insane world. -D"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What would you do before you had to confront your parents after just getting expelled from yet another school? The Catcher in the Rye, by Jerome David Salinger, is a book about a teenage 16-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield who has a problem staying in this all-boys prep school called Pency but then gets exempted from the school. Now he must confront his parents. Instead of deciding to face them with his failure, he decides to: take an early vacation, wander around the streets of New York City, and come into contact with some interesting characters.The majority of the novel takes place in New York City during post-war America which is in the early 1950's. The start of the novel takes place at Pency prep school. When Caulfield leaves Pency, he goes to various places in New York City, some of which are pretty popular. Areas of New York are very much like ghettos. An example description from the book would be, \\"The whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really did.\\" The journey begins just a week before Holden's Christmas break. But the real setting doesn't come till you read to the end. This is where the book's popularity comes from.The narrator here is Holden Caulfield, the main character, who is an egomaniac because he thinks too highly of himself as not being \\"phony\\" and the only genuine person in mankind. As the story goes on he meets these strange, yet interesting characters he barely knows and criticizes them. He criticizes everyone! Not himself, just everyone else. He's a pretty smart guy, I'll give him that, but he's not so buff and tuff. Actually... he's very much a pacifist. His reputation is a bad one. He has flunked almost all his classes and has gotten the boot from three different boarding schools. The only class he's good at is English, and this is because he thinks all his other classes are \\"tedious\\" and \\"phony\\". Throughout the story Holden is pretty much the same because he can't let go the thought of his phony society around him. I like how he critiques all the common things done by the common people, it really makes me think.The strange thing about this book is it doesn't have a real sticky plot. What I mean is... there is no plot! Hah! What kept me reading was the no plot idea and the unpredictability of where the book was headed. Holden is supposed to leave Pency and immediately tell his parents at home of his expulsion. He doesn't do it; instead, he wanders around in NYC. Then his favorite teacher betrays him. Mr. Spencer, one of the few teachers Caulfield liked, broke the news to his parents. This makes him even more terrified to go home so he travels incognito. Holden also gets into bizarre situations in the slums and hotels of New York. He feels like he can't speak to anyone except to his 10 year old sister named Phoebe, and he frequently recalls memories of his deceased little brother. At times, he even thinks about suicide or running away because of the \\"corrupt society around him\\".Salinger has an interesting way of writing, and brings out the reputation of his characters at the start. As far as difficulty is concerned, all you need to know are words like: conceited, phony, inferior, and complex, and you're set. He repeats statements and opinions over and over again to show Holden's strong opposition or power of his thoughts. The moral here is that everyone must grow up, it is inevitable, and that you can't change the opinions of others as easily as you think you can. Don't expect that criticizing people will help you change the world to the way you want it to be, the world is set and no man can alter it. I'm a person who doesn't find most fiction books interesting enough to finish, but when I got a hold of this book, I had to keep reading to finish it. After you read this book you really have to think about it for a while and find a revelation on your own. This is the major part of the book, and you'll appreciate this book for it. The only word that can describe this book is... \\"interesting\\" and it really makes you think to make you say out loud, \\"Wow!\\" Although there are some vulgar word usages here and there, I'd recommend this book to anyone, especially teenagers who can really relate."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is about a teenager who goes through depreesion and other problems most teens face while growing up. I can also relate to this book because it reminds me that sometimes i feel the same way. I recommend this book to everyone who doesn't mind faul language and the themes such as depression, lonelyness, and phonines. I really liked this book because of the things that occur. But the ending is very bad because it leaves you with unanswered questions such as what happened to Holden (the narrator) at the end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book many many times and it is fascinating to read the reviews of the fortunate who are reading it for the first time.The first time I read The Catcher in the Rye was 40 years ago (I was 14 at the time). I was home pretending I was sick so I could have a day off school, and read it on the recommendation of my English teacher (... one of those rare teachers we somehow connect with). I remember the day vividly. I read it in one sitting. I read it transfixed. I could see myself (or wanted to see myself) in the words and experiences of Holden Caulfield. I remember feeling changed after finishing the book. Holden had parents but they were wonderfully unimportant. Holden talked of phonies and hunting caps in ways that strangely made sense of the people and the things of my teenage years.I revisit Holden periodically and the magic is still there (though I will never capture the original magic ... thankfully)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book, to me, is a classic. I know that fact in itself is debatable and contraversial, but it is something I definitely believe. Before this book, I hadn't read anything that was written in the same style. I thought the way Salinger wrote was refreshing and perceptive. Perhaps not all teenagers think like this, but I don't think the book was meant to be a typical portrayl of a teenager. The one thing I liked most of all about the book was probably that he did seem to me like a real character. The way Salinger wrote the book almost seemed like her was telling a true story. The thing that affected me the most in this bok was the way it practically seemed to be screaming &quot;ADD&quot; rather than &quot;spoilt rich kid&quot;.

If you ask me to describe this book. The first word to come in mind is, &quot;hilarious&quot;. Holden Caufield has remarks that are extremely funny but yet quite true. He's a person that you'd want to meet and have a cup of tea with. This story is about a young man named Holden Caufield, who doesn't know which trail to take in life. He's very undecided in life which leads him throughout many timeless adventures. A compulsive liar he is, which makes the story even more interesting. There were moments in the story which were extremely heart warming, especially his relationship with his younger sister. It's hard to put into words about this wonderful book. You just have to read it for yourself to see!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's controversial The Catcher in the Rye, told from the perspective of 17 year-old Holden Caulfield, explores the clouded worlds that many \\"lost\\" young men face bitterly every day. Caulfield's journey is not merely physical but also emotional, as it touches ideas burnt into the minds of many but expressed only by those few brave enough to confess them. Salinger's stream of consciousness take the reader directly into the mind of Caulfield, making him see the world through his eyes, strained with emotional tension.Caulfield's train of thought serves as a link to his character. Salinger's diction is that of a teenager in the 1950's, complete with broken grammar and frequent slang with swearing. Caulfield's narration does more than show what happens in the novel, it shows the action through his eyes-the eyes of a self-justified teenager, trying to do the right thing in a crazy world. Almost everything Caulfield says is backed up with a short comment on what he thinks about it, from kids to life in general, giving a bit more depth into what kind of person he is each time he says something, no matter how insignificant it may look at times. This constant manner of speech reminds the reader that the Caulfield is not a learned scholar nor an accomplished grown man, but an everyday teenager trying to get by.The stream of consciousness in The Catcher in the Rye illustrates Caulfield's awakened, yet somewhat tainted view of the world. Caulfield represents the many young men that few dared to write about at a time where many themes common today were considered inappropriate."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J. D. Salinger shows us a young man pushed over the edge by the shallow emptiness of social behaviour and by lingering grief for his dead younger brother which he has felt forced to bury. Holden Caulfield is perhaps not an immediately attractive character - he is hypercritical, edgy, self-absorbed and self-deceiving - which is understandable since the book chronicles his gradual emotional disintegration, ending with him 'getting pretty sick' and having to &quot;rest up a bit&quot; in an unidentified institution. Holden's desperate attempts to prevent his collapse start when he flees school and the book follows him round his hometown where his grip on reality begins to slip and he becomes increasingly emotional. I found it interesting that one of those giving this book a bad review seemed to think that Holden was a real person - Salinger's portrayal is certatinly realistic enough to make this understandable. Many of the reviewers have concentrated on the fact that its main character is a teenager - however I believe that people of all ages will identify with Holden's distress and the anger and despair he feels about society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I, unlike a whole shlew of people, never had to read this as a class assignment. I don't know whether it would have changed my life back then, the way it has today. That I can never be certain of, but what I can be certain of, is that this book is glorious.J.D Salinger has written an account of every human beings fears, desires and needs. He not only exemplifies the true meaning of what being seventeen years old is about, but relishes in it.I know that I am not the first person to say this book has changed them in a great way, but I will never forget this book for taking me through one of the most turbulant times in my life. It's funny really, because I never pictured a book 'saving me' from of all things myself.There are too many layers to talk about in this book. Too many stories, too many fears and sub-plots.But what I can tell you is that 'The Catcher In The Rye' is a marvelous book that will, if not change your life, at least enrichen it more...Five Out Of Five....Timeless"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since I have read Catcher in the Rye, I believe that the book should be read by all young readers. This book deals with every day problems that young men go through in their everyday lives. Finally there is a book with a fictional character that young men can relate to; I understood most of Holden's problem through out the book. I haven't read Counterfeit son, however I think all young adults should also read this book today, This book deals with kid napping. There is a lot of kid napping cases now more than ever. Kid napping has risen tremendously around the world. Many young adults do not know how serious this issue is. After reading the reviews for Counterfeit son, I finally understand that issue is more serious than I thought. Mature young adults should read both books because both of them relate to the problems we face in society today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I haven't read The Body of Christopher Creed, however I think that it should be used in conunction with The Catcher In The Rye in the education of young adults. &quot;Catcher&quot; will remain a timless classic for quite some time, but it has moments where it tends to loose a readers interests. Holden's use of langauge in the story might be slightly offensive to some while to others it may be nothing out of the ordinary. Some of the terms he uses are quite out dated and often hard for a modern young adult to comprhend in nature. &quot;Catcher&quot; poses thoughts and ideas that many young adults can often relate to and comprehend on a deeper level than some of the modern novels that deal with issues not all of us have faced. This, in turn, gives us a strong reason to continue moving forward in our reading selections while still holding on strong to the timeless classics such as The Cathcer In The Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When my teacher first mentioned that we were going to be reading 'Catcher in the Rye', I thought it was going to be an extremely boring book that would take hours to read because it was so boring. Boy, was I wrong. I had to read this book for sophomore english class and I think it is a good book. It is about a teenager who is struggling to enter adulthood. He constantly wants to save the innocent children from entering the exprienced world of adulthood. Although, in order to enjoy the book you have to look for the hidden messages of this 'child-adult' theme, which J.D. Salinger did a great job using different items as symbols. Yet, although it is a great book, there is some foul language (but not extremely offensive words). Yet, Holden Caulfield (the main character) has to use them to build up his character and portray part of the theme. I did not really like how the book ended, but once you understand the world of innocence/experience, it makes a lot more sense. It is a great read, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book in 2 hours. I could barely put it down because it was so easy to get hooked on."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you would read a book about the life of a sixteen year old, you will think you'll be able to relate to the main character(if you're a teenager too). well, in &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; I didn't. I hope Holden wasn't such a miserable boy. He's just pathetic. Actually all the characters are very strange and I'm glad that I wasn't in Holden's place(if he really told the truth about those desperate characters).I also find his style annoying. All that repeating of:&quot;...and all, goddam, sonuvabitch,...&quot; it drove me crazy. It seemed to be taking a lifetime to finish the whole story. I found it very boring.The only good thing about the book was the happy end, otherwise I would have been just as depressed, after reading this book,as Holden was during the whole story.I know there are much better novels about the experiences of teenagers. I think the main character of this book had a terrible, desperate and boring life. I don't look up to him. I don't get why he wrote his boring experiences on paper."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because I had to. But I heard from it before. Last year, at an other school, we read the beginning of the book and we watched a video in which several women told about J.D.Salinger's life. That was pretty interesting. But it was this year the same as last year, I didn't really like the book that much. I found the language difficult to read, it is probably spoken language, because he says all the time &quot;...and all&quot;. The story however is good. It's about a 16-year old boy, Holden Cauldfield, who gets kicked out of school. He wants to leave school but doesn't want to go directly to his parents. He's afraid os their reaction, especially his mother's, who would probably freak out. All the things that happen between him leaving school and returning home are also likely to happen in real life. But I kind of hated the main character. I don't like the jargon he uses and he's always saying the same kind of things, like &quot;really I'm not kidding&quot;, I can't stand that. However, it is possible that people recognise themselves in Holden, he is looking for himself, he's not sure who he is, and he may have things in common with some teenagers, but not with me. He is always depressed and I really don't like to read depressing books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It wasn't the best book I ever read but, it was readable and though after a while when I decided to read in the book for a whole day it wasn't even boring anymore. It's lot easier to read the book in 2 days, otherwise it's hard to remember what the first capital is about ( if you read the book in 10 days or something). If you asked what the story was about, you can simply answer:&quot;A guy leaves school and don't want to go home. He hang around and met new people and old friends. So the plot wasn't that good. It was a little bit simple. It were just the adventures of Holden spread over only 4 days. The language was a little bit strange for me. If you read such a strange word like 'sonuvabitch' and 'willya' you know what he means but you sometimes struggle with it.It didn't bothered me. You got used to it. There are a lot of persons in the book who hat only a small role. Sometimes Holden ( the main character ) mentioned them and then you have to think who was that girl, boy? But some persons were repeated by Holden, so that it became easier to understand, of who he was talking about. I liked the main character. I don't actually know why. Probably I liked just his attitude to the society.I must confess that it wasn't a boring book, though I had to read it for school so it was obligated litterature.

The reason I dislike it, is because I can't compare myself with the 16-year old boy, who is feeling depressed all the time. I feel sorry for him that he has such a lousy life. But it's basically his own fault: he makes a mess of his life the whole time and he doesn't take anything serious. He just spends his parents' money. And I find it really pathetic that his only real friend is his sister! The use of language is always the same:he uses a lot of negative words. And the whole book is about 4days, it is way to detailed. And that gets boring after a while. The only positive thing I can say about it, is that I admire the fact that it was written in 1950 and still a lot of young people can compare themselves with it. So it's not the fact that I hate reading novels, but this one was just a disappointment for me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE(J.D. Salinger)~ Opinion by Annemie Thijs ~At the beginning, this book only made little impression to me.The way it is written was quite nice, I won't deny it: the American youngsters' tongue seemed very sincere to me, although it started to be boring \\"as hell\\" after a few days of reading.An other thing I would like to treat is the account of what happened the story itself. The events in this book really don't keep you reading it. Holden is getting more and more depressed, page by page, because of what he does and sees, and what happens around him, which is getting boring after a while. But I do understand that this book isn't about what Holden does or what happens to him, but about what goes trough his mind during this crazy period in his life. These thoughts are really interesting, in a way. By following his thoughts, we can learn what is important and precious to him, and what is not.Little by little, we learn Holden has a certain attitude to life, which clashes with the attitudes to life of others, or even with our society: for example, Holden dreams about being mute-deaf, becouse he wouldn't have to have stupid conversations.There are two thing I truly like in this book: first, there are the ducks in the lagoon, and second, there is the way Holden gets over his depression: Phoebe on the carousel.Maybe I can conclude that, after a while, when you start understanding Holden better, and when you start sympathisizing with him, and maybe even finding him likable, you also start understanding -and liking- the book itself. It is special, in a certain way.__________________________________________________________________________________________"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Jonas' opinion of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", by Jerome David Salinger.I find it a very good novel because it learns the reader about American schools and the reader is exposed to the American tradition. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but this you will hear in class.My greetings to you, Mr. Geerinckx,Your pupil of 6MWb,J.Duyck"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am quite surprised by some of the more negative reviews I have seen of this book. How can anyone dismiss Holden Caulfield as a mere &quot;whiner?&quot; Yes, I do agree that (on occasions) Caulfield's cynicism seems somewhat inordinate (he scrutinizes virtually everything and everyone). However, this does not negate the fact that the novel is a true-to-life and touching embodiment of the existential confusion and angst most of us have surely experienced at some stage in our lives. There were so many instances in the book where I was stunned by the sheer &quot;trueness&quot; and realism of Caulfield's observations of human behaviour. Virtually every remark he makes about people and life, every thought, every criticism, makes absolute sense and rings a bell. And what strikes me the most is that his commentaries on life are not limited by time or place. I have never been to America nor am I a westerner, yet a great deal of what Caulfield says is very familiar. Every time I turned a page, there was a statement somewhere that made me think &quot;yes, yes, I know exactly what you mean.&quot; And contrary to many people's views, I think the slow pace of the plot is all the more effective because it is real. Most people's lives are not riddled with unceasing adventures; most of us move at the same pace as Caulfield. Besides, the candor and irreverence of the novel (which are surprising even by today's standards) balance the slowness of the plot. Finally, I must say I am impressed by the simplicity of Salinger's diction, the language is so informal and so unpretentious and this is what makes The Catcher in the Rye such a unique book. I will read it again and again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book touched me in many personal ways.

By far, one of my top books of all time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really recommend this book, this book is like no other. It basically about a troubled teenager who is in search for his role in life. I think a lot of people would like it because you are really able to relate to the character because many of us have gone trough some of the situations Holden goes through in the book. I will bet that even if you do not like it, you will find it quite different from other books.

The author gives us an excellent view of how was the way of living of a teenager in the 1950's and that is very similar to the way the teens live on these days. The author puts the reader in Holden shoes, and makes him feel like if he were living all what Holden lived. I recomend this book, especially to teennagers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading and analyzing this book i was so impressed because this book was published in the 1950's and it is still a favorite for a lot of teenagers and a classic for American Literature.

It was a great read this time as well.In fact, I probably enjoyed more as an adult...perhaps a case of arrested development. In any event, I had many laughs, a few revelations and joy.Strong narration and oh so true to any of us who attended boarding school in the 1950's.From now on Catcher In The Rye will be visited yearly. I should never have stayed away so long. I deprived myself of much reading fun.Holden Caufield is still my role model."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are a number of books out there in the vast sea of literary experience and imagination. However, when it all comes down to it, a book of gritty realism is what really gets us going. Something we can and have related to personally. There is no doubt &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is the classic book for young and old. The old can reflect and the young can think &quot;how the hell does this old crote know that!?&quot;Truly the most wonderfully written, marvellous pieces of literature ever, up with Jane Eyre, The Oddyssey and The Great Gatsby! As a seventeen year old, I can relate with millions of others."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recommend this book. It captured my interest till the end. We all, as people, face hardships and sometimes feel like giving up, but we eventually pull through. Without those hardships we wouldn't be the people we are now. Everyone will take something different from this book. For me, I learned that life isn't half as bad as we think it may be. Everyone has his or her own problems to deal with. You're not alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book deals a lot with the feelings and emotions of a maturing teen. Holden (the main character) finds himself exploring life by traveling the wrong way. He finds himself getting kicked out of school and visiting New York, where he hides from his relatives, but what he can't avoid is his past and his problems. J.D. Salinger pulled out all the stops when he wrote this book with a mix of adventure, suspense, historical fiction, and realistic fiction. It's a must read and there's no doubt that I give this novel five stars. Catcher in the Rye is truly the perfect book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...that I can see a little of myself in this book. The fact that Hinckley, Chapman and other had this book in their possession does not bode well with my outlook for myself! :-)Actually, I have never been a big fan of &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; writing until Holden Caulfield. (Is that what it is?) Here is a guy who probably thinks the way a lot of us do. He hates the world and would like to crush every single phony out there. He really would.The difference between Holden and you or I? We would NEVER admit it.There is a reason the book is a classic. Hey. It's less than.... What's to lose."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book about a boy, and his life. He is suffering from depression. I suggest that you read this book. Believe me, I don't like very many books, but I can tell you this one I LOVE!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you're looking for a grand book in which the characters act as they do because they're secretly queer or because they're tired of oppressing women and Indians, then this is not the &quot;text&quot;--as the English majors like to refer to books--for you. Yes, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is incredibly &quot;obvious&quot;--hence its perennial presence on so many tenth grade reading lists. But where others see cliched angst and and a lack of subtlety, I see authenticity. No other voice in literature captures the ineffable confusion of adolescence as well as Holden Caulfield's.Reading this book makes me feel young again, and that's worth at least the twenty dollars it costs for the vintage Little, Brown hardcover. If you were, or are, self-aware enough to regret the passing of your innocence, I think you'll enjoy this sad and wonderful book. Let the literary types malign it as they may--after all, it's only phonies who use words like &quot;post-modern&quot; and &quot;deconstructionism.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found this book to be a good read for teens. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is an unpopular, confused teen, to whom almost everyone can relate. He uses profanity, talks of &quot;phony&quot; people, and is trying to grow up. Later on, Holden is shown as a character who becomes depressed and sees nothing to enjoy in life. Everything is everyone else's fault. As the book continues, Holden's impending downfall is evident, and he will only get worse before he gets better. I feel that teens can relate to Holden, but yet see his problems and why not to be like him in every way. However, just because he is not popular is not why he is a &quot;loser&quot;...it has to do, moreso, with his individual personality and personal problems. I enjoyed this book, and Salinger's use of language to make Holden a more real character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There's enough reviews out there so you can get the details of the book, I'm just going to give my opinion of it. The books well written, well characterized and worthy of it's praise. Salinger has teenage angst and apathy nailed, though these days Holden would prob. be younger, maybe 12-14. I liked it and I didn't, the writing great, but I'm not moved by the character. He keeps bemoaning his life and saying how phony people are. Typical youth of showing how cool and knowledgable of the world they are. It gets irritating after awhile. I'm on the fence with this one, the main character is annoying, but he's annoying because he's so greatly written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book when I was a freshman in h.s....I was like 14 and the last thing I wanted to do was read.....but almost 8 years later I still totally love this book....I read it in less than 2 days so it's an easy read....I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, I'm an avid reader, an adult, a mother, and have a college education, but I never read this book. In an effort to improve myself, I often pick up a classic and dive in. It was a little difficult to &quot;dive in&quot; to this one, however. I can understand the literary value of this stream of consciousness-style writing, but I didn't like Holden, the main character. I found myself wondering if I didn't like him because of his actions and thoughts, or if I struggled with him because his thoughts were so random and realistic. Haven't we all had a few drinks and thought the rest of the world was a bunch of phonies? I guess I'm a better person for having read another classic, but if you're looking for a life-changing classic, read To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is an excellent fast reading book based mainly on thought.

Salinger's most renowned literary work is about a sixteen year old Holden Caulfield and takes place over one weekend's time. Interestingly enough, the beginning of the book is the end-as he recalls the story as it completely unfolds under your eyes and eventually the reader begins to see how everything fell into place. The book displays a total mental digression of Holden and leads you to show how he eventually breaks down through his own words. The story is written in first person (entirely in Holden's perspective with no outside influences) and uses very common diction with heavy subtext, creating a good story to read whether you're a college professor or a grade school student. The book displays a touch of cynicism and realism displayed humorously and people of almost every age could establish a common bond to it. The most common feelings associated with this book are along the lines of finding a lot of things that coincide with day to day life. He thinks along the lines of at least one person you know, if not yourself, and commonly recognizes real problems with people while putting off his own with isolation. The book is mainly characterized for being a Bildungsroman novel but the theme to some is way surpassed the usual tale of a boy's coming of age. Reading how Holden regards his pending adulthood could teach most people a lesson and give you a few laughs while being read. I really enjoyed this book because it is timeless be it in the 1950's or today and is read on so many different levels be it an adult or a teenager, everyone can walk away with something from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a very good book to read as a teenager. Holden is going through alot of stuff that some teens have to go through. He was being kicked out of almost every school that he went to and was just sent along to anouther one. He left his last school after being notified that he was being kicked out and started roming the streets. Now Holden did have money that he had saved up so he went to hotels and bars and aventually turned to getting girls weather they were ones he met at clubs, bars or even a prostitute once. He didnt want his family to know that he had gotten kicked out yet again, like any normal teenager, so he decided to only go home to see his sister late at night. He loved his sister, basically because he could talk to her, even if she was really upset that he got kicked out. This book shows holdens life and all of his struggles, many teens are either kicked out of school or they drop out not really knowing how the real world is. Holden went through many money issues and even being manipulated by people of the outside world that he didnt even know. He lived by the day at either hotels or at old teachers houses. Something I really like about the book is the ending the last chapter when he says &quot; I could probably tell you what I did after I went home, and how I got sick and all and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall, after I get out of here but I dont feel like it&quot;. He dosent really tell you what is going to happen in his future maybe because he dosent know. you can tell by the end of the book that he is tired of people asking him questions about applying himself and wanting to go to school and all of that but he dosent know nor it seems like he dosent care what really happens, and teens act the same way, that is why I think that this book is a fantastic book to read if you are a teen."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's a story about a young man who feels out of place in the world. I believe it is the book Salinger wished he could have read when he was Holden's age.It's a story of an angry young man, so young he doesn't know how angry he is. He burns bridge after bridge in his search for meaning. It's the bender I always meant to go on, but now don't need to. Salinger imparts to the reader the wisdom Holden miraculously finds. If you seek this wisdom, this book is for you. If you ever had a doubt about the world and its limitless hypocrisy, this book is for you. Otherwise try &quot;Jurrasic Park.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is not about the plot, it's about the character Holden. Okay, the plot affects his actions and state of mind, but if you're expecting an ending that wraps everything up in a nice neat bow then you may as well read some trashy murder mystery.I think this books main problem is the hype that surrounds it. Salinger's fame as a recluse (how can you be a famous recluse?) has certainly led to a cult status for 'Catcher in the Rye' that definitely helps book sales, but I think it may hinder enjoyment.I liked this book a lot. It's not the best book I've ever read, but it is a good book. I can understand people who had a problem with the language use, some of the slang expressions are long since forgotten and have to be deciphered through the context, it is also written how Holden would say it rather than in a more literary way. This just makes him more appealing as a character.Holden is not the nicest of characters, you're not supposed to love everything he does or says (or at least I didn't). He is a flawed person, he has serious mental issues. He has built up a wall in his mind against these 'phonies' and continues to repeat his hatred for these people when he is secretly one of them. If you can tell what he's going to say next, Great! that just proves what a phony HE really is. That's good character writing.This book isn't life changing or genius or anything like that, but it is entertaining and that's all a book needs to be.It's short, I doubt if there is a chapter more than 10 pages long, and I thought it was really easy to read.If you just want something good, not too challenging but interesting, to read on a rainy day I'd recommend this book.If your looking for a book with a hero that, in the end, gets the girl, you should probably do a search for Mills and Boon."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book always puts a smile on my face. I read it several times and it still works. Holden thinks he has a sad life. He keeps putting everything down. He is full of jealousy and that teenage angst we can all relate to. He makes a little trip for himself and the ride is full of ups and downs. Enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not accomplish anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him. Overall though I thought this book to be a disappointment"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was surprised to see the last review. The reader did not like the writing because she was not young enough to appreciate it. If someone needs to relate to this story in order to appreciate it, they are missing the best thing about this book.This book lets you look at the world through the eyes of a lunatic. To see his warped views and the reactions of people around him from HIS standpoint. The goal of the read does not seem to earn sympathy for the guy or understand teenagers; its purpose seems to be pure entertainment.... or maybe some understanding when you meet a crazy person.If you have a good sense of humor, you can pick up this book and start reading from any paragraph and start laughing in seconds. Unless of course if simple-minded cynicism offends you... in which case you would fail to meet the former requirement anyway."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a masterpiece that never grows old. J.D. Salinger brilliantly allows the reader to experience a lost weekend in New York through the eyes of a troubled, cynical teen-ager. On the surface, the book is entertaining--particularly the first-person slang in which the story is told. But beyond the surface, the story hits on numerous issues pertaining to adolescent development, and I sense that different readers will see different elements coming to the surface, depending on their own circumstances and experiences. It only takes a few hours to read, but is very rich and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is considered by some people to be very controversial, and it was even banned in America after it was first released. It's about a boy named Holden who has a nervous breakdown and all of his experiences while this is going on. This book is great, despite the negative feelings that have been formed about it. Let's dive in and see what this book is all about.This novel is set in New York City during the 1950's. This New York setting adds lots of excitement and unexpected sights, considering the city holds more than the human eye can see. By doing this, J.D. Salinger allows Holden, the main character to be set in a \\"world\\" within a world. By this, I mean that the excitement and unexpected sights of the city really adds a fantastic effect and opportunity for the character. This allows Holden to get a sense of an \\"unsafe\\" place, and an opportunity to meet astonishing characters and be exposed to new situations.The book is narrated by sixteen year old Holden Caufield whose experiences form the action of the novel. His history of getting kicked out of schools, the death of his brother and his academic failure have caused him to hate the \\"system,\\" and the world. These events all lead to his noteworthy emotional breakdown.Something that I really enjoyed about this book is Holden's language. Salinger writes from Holden's point of view, using colloquial speech, and a few key terms. By doing this you're able to see what comes out of Holden's mind which gives you his perspective on things. It's a good way of connecting the reader to the character. An example of his key terms are the words \\"phony\\" and \\"naturally\\". He uses the word \\"phonies\\" to show his negative tone towards people and things he doesn't like; whereas he uses the word \\"naturally\\" as filler in his speaking.Unlike many other books, this one has many little climaxes. The first two are when Holden gets in a fight with his roommate and later, when he fights a pimp. He winds up losing both of these and deals with the defeat by running away. The other three climaxes all have to do with rejection. The first of these three is when he calls this girl Sally and sets a date with her, but in the middle of the date she laughs at him and leaves. The second is when his little sister Phoebe doesn't want to listen to him and is disappointed because he was expelled again and the third is when his teacher Mr. Antolini gives him a talk about his school work, and then touches his forehead later that night, which Holden takes as a sexual gesture, and becomes disgusted with him. These climaxes all stress how Holden is constantly faced with defeat and have no one to turn to. The part of the book that really shows this is when he goes to central park to watch the ducks, but one day finds that they're not there anymore. He can't figure out where they went, but this makes him realize that he needs to figure out his purpose and direction.The conclusion of this book is when Holden realizes that he doesn't fit in with the world and that he feels defeated. He winds up going to a mental hospital, which you learn that he has been narrating the whole book while he was sitting there telling his story to a psychiatrist. Although this book is thought to be very controversial, it is a great example of a real life situation and was very well written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I did not read it in college and have felt as if I were missing something.At first I had a difficult time relating to Holden, since I am now 36 years old. I felt he was childish and immature but something hit a nerve as I continued reading on. He is severly depressed over the lose of his brother and I feel he either wishes it were himself who should've died and/or feels completely out of control because he could not stop his brothers death. He tries to be removed from himself and others and views everyone as phony or a bore, not allowing himself to care or be affected by anyone other than his kid sister. His sister is his saving grace!!I completely related to the character once I removed my adultness and recalled what pain it is to loose a sibling as I lost my brother when I was only 10 years old. I had depression, malnutrition and vision lose due to stress and depression. Of course my parents did not realize what was happening to me at the time. Times were not very &quot;open&quot;.The sadness in this book; no one recognized his real issue. During the era this book was written, parents did not understand the long term affects death of a sibling has on their children.All teenagers should read this in high school not college, it would be a great tool for teenagers not feel alone with their pain. Also, any parents with teenagers should read this as well...with a non judgemental mindset."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"English is not my mother tongue, but I experienced no problems in reading this novel. The story seems very simple and nothing big happens. Nevertheless it's surprsing that it is NOT boring! You always wonder what's happening next even if you know that not much will happen. There is some magic in this book and that's probably why it's so famous."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger, through Holden Caufield's use of extremes with death and temperature, displays his distaste of reality. Death is an extreme that is used quite often throughout the novel. The book begins with Holden talking about why he is not at the big football game, and how the students were &quot;supposed to commit suicide &quot;if they lost (2). This clearly shows the distinction between Holden and everyone else in reality. He takes the normalcy of attending the football game and places himself at the other end of the spectrum, and then aggrandizes it by saying how the mere loss of a football game could supposedly result in a mass forfeiture of life. Suicide arises as an extreme measure that occurs in reality over sometimes-small things like a loss in a football game. Holden mocks this occurrence within reality. When Holden meets the three girls in the bar, his attitude labels them as the norm of girls in New York. Holden relates how the girls did not speak and then he talks about how they &quot;nearly committed suicide,&quot; when they saw an actor (74). From the beginning Holden displays how he abhors the movies. This shows the reality of how the three girls are affected by society to the point that they would go to the extreme of committing suicide to see a mere person, an actor. Holden ends up hating the girls and this parallels with his distaste towards reality. Holden also belittles a couple who were &quot;feeling each other&quot; as the male spoke about a kid committing suicide. This clearly shows how disturbed people in reality become and how Holden hates the phoniness of them. To all these stories and observations, Holden replies with &quot;It killed me (119).&quot; This remark soars in every other page at least a couple of times. In a way, it does kill Holden, for his view of the good in reality deteriorates with each of his revelations. This leads to Holden's obsession for an Odyssey-like voyage away from reality. Temperature also plays an important role in overwhelming the reader with the depressing mood of reality. Holden uses temperature quite often to make the reader feel uneasy and uncomfortable as he reads. This lets one feel Holden's misery and allows one to incorporate the hatred of the reality through Holden's eyes. Holden characterizes the temperature in the beginning as &quot;cold as a witch's teat (2).&quot; Holden then describes why he feels that way, which includes that someone stole his jacket and gloves, while he was at his Pencey Academy. This leads to the emphasis on the appearance vs. reality of Pencey. Pencey mounts supposedly to an ambiance of well-educated and morally right men, while Holden instead shows how thieves roam the halls and rooms. The reality of Pencey scars him mentally, and impels his apathy towards his eternal suspension. The reader finds out that, &quot;At Pencey, you either froze to death or died of the heat (23).&quot; This foreshadows the extremist view of Holden. Here, he displays the lack of finding a middle area, and both ends suffering the same consequence. This also is analogous with his view of reality, that either way you are cooked. Holden relates himself to the ducks and wonders where they go when the lake freezes over. In a sense, he feels his life has frozen over and he needs to escape reality like the ducks. The most extreme form of cold temperature is ice, and that is where Holden feels surrounds him. The temperature outside never raised, it was only frigid. This shows how the reality of the world could be escaped when he departed to a house, but he always ends up cold again. He talks about how hot he felt when Mr. Antolini pats him on his head inside Mr. Antolini's house, then the next thing &quot;I [Holden Caufield] was getting sorta cold (95).&quot; The temperature relates to how people can evade reality, but they always have to come back in the end. Holden parallels the two extremes of death and temperature when he says, &quot; I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die.&quot; This correlation portrays Holden's reality and its virulent extremes. Holden expresses how the extremes of death and temperature exist in every day life, and portrays them as flaws in order to incorporate his purpose of displaying his aversion towards the reality of the world. I enjoyed the novel and Holden's depiction of the real world, and the way the book did not hide the truth. The world is full of corrupt and phony people. Holden views this phoniness and through his book attempts to educe it to his readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have just read several reviews posted regarding &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; I am amazed that none have even the slightest comprehension of the plight of the main character, Holden Caufield, or the timeless truth and lessons in this book. In 2001, can we, as a culture, only appreciate the &quot;challenge&quot; of coming of age if it's on a screen, has full female frontal, and moves along as quickly as its Number 1 soundtrack? Is it possible that so many Americans, supposedly appreciative of literature, are so uncultured and inept? (or never discussed this book's meaning in a high school English class?) I will always go back to this story of Holden, in rememberance of the sadness and fondness of youth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book and I love it. A lot of people had told me about it and how good it was. The story is about Holden Caulfield, a troubled teenager who just got thrown out of high school. The story is about his experiences and thoughts. I think a lot of teens, even now, can relate. It's about feeling alienated and having every one against you. Holden keeps talking about all the phonies and there's a good point in what he's saying. The book is inspirational and eye opening. You should read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Quite simply put, one of the greatest works of literature ever created."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"a fascinating insight into the mind of a curious teenage boy, as he searches for his true identity and place in life"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in The Rye is a well written book. It is appealing to all kinds of readers. If you can sit down and read at anytime, this is definitely a book for you. Or if your the kind of reader that doesn't always have lots of time to read, this is for you too. I always hate it if I have to stop in the middle of a chapter. Well, in this book, you don't have to. The chapters are nice and short. You won't always feel like you are missing out. But in this book, it is not likely to happen. Once you start reading, you will be hooked. Probably to the character Holden Caulfield. He is a the main character of the book. You will be attracted to his spontaneous attitude and his free-speaking mind. But you wouldn't like his negativity about life. The thing is, he is not afraid to do or say anything. If he feels like doing something, he will. But there are sometimes when he won't do anything at all. His excuse is that he wasn't in the mood to do it. I know people hate to do things, but they end up doing it because they have to. For example, school work. Kids hate it, but they end up doing it. Not him. He doesn't care what happens, he doesn't care about anything that happens to him. He doesn't even care about what goes around in the world. For example, when he gets kicked out of school. He doesn't care about his parents or his future. If I got kicked out, I would freak out. Or the time when he lost all of the school's equipment. Or when he was in the park. He was soaked and out in the freezing weather. All he did was lie down on the park bench. He kept talking about how he was going to catch pneumonia and die. He didn't care if he did, all he thought about was the future. How his parents and loved ones would react. He didn't try to warm himself up or anything. But if there is something you got to love is his attitude and mind. How he is such a free-speaker and a great liar. He was such a free-thinker. He would always say what was on his mind. He would never hesitate, but he would regret a lot of things. Also, he didn't try to act in a way he wasn't. That's what he hated most, phonies. He wasn't a hypocrite either. Some people hate the way people act, but then they act just like them, not Holden. Also, I liked it when he would meet phonies, he would get so pissed at them. It killed him. One thing I admired about him was his ability to lie so well. Throughout the book Holden tells multiples lies to everybody. But he is able to say them without hesitation and he isn't concerned about what might happen next. He just goes with the flow, he is the slickest and smoothest talker I have ever seen. The thing that bothers me about him is his lack of motivation and his money management problem. He barely tries at anything. I think he is one of those people that have the skills, they just don't use them. Also, he has to learn how to manage his money. If I knew someone who blew money like that, I would be so aggravated. In all, I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to other readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"No wonder this book is a classic.

I laughed so hard all the way through this!Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of Prep school. He decides to embark on his own journey home and he takes us through a comical adventure through New York City. It is a masterfully crafted manuscript directed to the reader in such a way, that one can see the nostalgic, yet rebellious attitude of teenagers in the 1950's. I felt that not much has changed in the last 60 years!The reader can sense that Holden is a troubled youth, and the root of his 'I don't care' attitude stems from the death of his brother.(Though, he'll never admit it.)I hardly found a sentence in this entire book where I didn't laugh at his humorous negativity. Author JD Salinger took ten years to write this book, and I wonder how in the world he was able to capture so much humor in American youth. I think he was a genious.Holden is my hero 'and all'. This book is definitely a masterpiece and I urge anyone who has a good sense of humor to buy this book. You will want to read this book over and over. My advice? Buy it in hardback!The language is a bit on the rough side, but it makes the character more believable. Holden is the original rebel with a cause!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently read this book and Jack Kerouac's On the Road. Both of these books were published in the early 1950s, and, although contemporaries and sharing similar themes, have gone in opposite directions, imo, in the past fifty years. Although both are still heralded as prime examples of 20th century literature, there is no question in my mind that Salinger's book is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s, although not nearly as shocking, whereas the shock value of Kerouac's book has completely worn off as the childish antics involving drugs, alcohol, and sex have been eclipsed by current generations of young people whose excesses go far beyond anything described in On the Road. Without the shock value, Kerouac's book has no meaning for me, just a 300-page drunken binge. The Catcher in the Rye, on the other hand, remains true to its original theme of teenage distrust, rebellion, and the search for one's own identity and meaning in life. IMO, of these two books, Catcher is the only one worth reading today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a college student, Catcher in the Rye was required reading. As a Baby Boomer, I had to read it again to see if the old magic was there. I think it is one of the icons of the baby boomer age. The coming of age of Holden Caulfield was as important to us as the growth of Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate. We were all about the angst of modern society and the phoniness of people around us. As the enlightened generation, we could see similarities and comparisons to ourselves to Holden. What was amazing is that he was the more paranoid, the more disturbed, but yet the universal hero among young people. Now, having read it 40 years later, I was able to notice the depths of his plunge in the anti-society group of one he had developed. I could more easily visualize the rapid decline of his sanity. I still love this book. It is a great character study in first person. Also an interesting piece to observe the vocabulary and vernacular of the time. Reading this book makes me want to do more research on J.D. Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have heard about this book for years but avoided reading it. Now I have finally broken down and read it. I found it an engaging read, I think Salinger is a great writer based on this book alone, but it has one grave fault, it is n0t a novel. It reads more like a memoir, I found no conflict in it, Holden Caulfield is still the same horribly spoiled brat he was at the beginning, there are no changed circumstances, a few days have passed in the protagonists life but at the end he is still dismissed from school, he still does not know what he is going to do with himself, he still carries the same judgments about others that he started with. And we readers have a magnificent view of a fictional character's personality. If I had anything to say about the book, I would recommend it to any creative writing class as an example of how to develop a character, make him come alive, be some one you know. While I was reading the book, that is the way I felt, like I knew Holden Caulfield. I also must confess I hated him, still hate him, and every time he said, \\"I really meant it.\\" I wanted Stradlater to be there and give him another crack on the jaw. I realized Salinger had given him these specific peculiarities to define him but he had done too good a job for me, I thought Caulfield was real.There are several minor characters in the book, Salinger has done a fine job in defining them, giving them just enough definition to support their role in the book. None of them take the emphasis from Holden, not even the prostitute and the elevator man. Others are just like them, even Hunt and Fontayne are as seen through Caulfield's eyes and no attempt is made to upgrade them. Since Holden Caulfield thinks every one else, with only a couple of exceptions, are phonies or morons, his opinions must be right and that is carried on throughout the book. Salinger does a good job of it, it never seems to be his opinion, always Caulfield. That gets to be boring. And i found no conclusion to the book. It stops, but it could have kept on going much longer with no change and still nothing would happen except daily life. Call that a novel?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I missed this piece of literature in High School.

I expected a boring book with a man droning on about his intellectual and boring life that no one would ever care about.

I've seen it praised so many times in writing help guides that it eventually sparked my interest to go out and buy the book.Holden Caulfield feels like an authentic teenager, despite his constant angst. I can relate to having poor grades like him and his whining, to a certain point, feels justifible. To me, he felt 3D and was very funny. I could completely relate to Holden in that he did not want to give up the innocence of childhood. His emotions are not, if at all, played up as melodrama.Since reading the book the first time, I've read it three times. Every time I've read it, I'm moved by the strong characterization and the complexity of the theme. Just when I think I've grasped the theme, I discover something else about the book that I've missed the first few times.I'll admit that the laungage, the slang, of the book had me in some places until I looked it up or figured it out by context clues. Despite that, I feel as if everyone should at least read this book once, even if it's not for class."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Don't ever tell anybody anything.

I see the value in Holden's journey of self discovery, but do not think it was as good as billed. Salinger repeats himself and seems to ramble throughout the book. He often digresses from his original thought. Despite this fairly annoying habit, Salinger does provide a unique glimpse into the life of a private school dropout in the forties as he tries to find himself. I have read worse, but have also read much better."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read The Catcher In the Rye from cover to cover, and I have yet to find one thing that I can disagree with. In my opinion this book is the definition of a real page-turner. The pages are splashed with the author's realistic and comically written words. His sense of humor makes you laugh out loud on several occasions, and when the story becomes climatic you feel a sense of worry along with the characters.This book was written in the 1950s, but I did not have the faintest idea of that. There were only minute details that hinted to the time period. J.D. Salinger's writing has a modernized feel about it. Any person can relate to this book no matter what decade they live in.The main character's name is Holden. This is a story through many important events in his life. He is somewhat of a rebel, and I believe that is why people can relate to him so well. This is probably why the book is so popular. This book deals with different issues concerning many different things. The end is a shock, and I believe it ties the whole story together.This is not one of those books that do not seem to get interesting until the middle or the end of the book. This book is captivating from the very first word.The Catcher In The Rye is 214 pages of good reading that will leave you dying to read more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, I really enjoyed reading The Catcher in the Rye. It grasped my attention from the first few pages instantly. The beginning was very good. I wanted to read on, rather than peruse the first page and put it back on the shelf because of lack of interest. As I read on I discovered the large use of profanity, which wasn't a problem at all. Actually, the bad language made the whole situation seem even more real in my head. I could see it happening. Great imagery there!Since the main character, Holden Caulfield, was a teenager and about the same age as me, I could relate to it a lot. Everything that was happening with him are situations that do happen in everyday life to young people like myself. That kept most of my attention and kept me from putting this book down for too long.The word choice was well put too. I actually learned some new words and their definitions. The whole plot and idea was very creative to me. I can really say that I have never read anything like this book before. Catcher in the Rye made me think a lot as to what was happening, and although it was published in the 40's, it still relates to life here in the 2000's. That's very nice.When I was close to finishing, my teacher asked me if the ending confused me, and really, it didn't at all. I understood it pretty easily and I hope others that get to read it do too. I like the writing layout of it a lot. It feels like he's an actual person telling me his true story, his real problems, which adds on to the realness of it all.Basically, this is a great book and I do recommend it for young people like myself. We can relate to it, think more into depth from it, and I believe anyone can learn something from it. I hope you enjoy it like I did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"No matter how many years pass, this book, Catcher in the Rye is a classic. It has gotten a lot of bad publicity due to some nuts out there, which is unfortunate. The book really captures the inner thinking of kids, which is not an easy thing to express. It's one of those books that make you laugh because you can remember feeling a lot of the things that any kid goes through. The writing is smart and quick. It's such a great book to read, so interesting and funny. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that illustrates the experiences of a teenage boy from the main characters eyes. The main character of this book is named Holden. The setting of this book is at Pencey, a boarding school that Holden attends. He describes the place to be very much like a modern day college. The school has dorms just like a college would. Pencey seems to be a very laid back place because the kids are allowed to go basically where ever they want, all they have to do is sign out.The Author of this book either new what people wanted to read about, or was very troubled. The characters in the book are very realistic. The author chose that the story would all be told through the eyes of the main character. Holden seems very normal at the beginning of this book. He thought much like any other teenager would think. As the book goes on Holden gets harder and harder to relate with Holden. He also gets very annoying in the book. He likes to describe things that don't normally get described down to the very last detail. Then things that you would like to read more detail about are slightly mention. This can make the reader very frustrated at times with the main character. Holden is also a very negative person and likes to talk behind everyone's back. Nobody really likes Holden, and everyone seems to be annoyed by him. Its easy to be annoyed by Holden, but he is a great character for this book.This was great and easy read. The book is all about Holden, a teenager who has flunked out of so many schools, and is now flunking out of his current school. He is very worried about telling his parents just like any other teenager would be. He dislikes his roommate and eventually has enough a runs away for a few days until his parents come to the boarding school where he can tell them about him flunking out. He runs away to New York which is not to far away from his boarding school and has some strange experiences. This book is a very good book from cover to cover. Its easy to keep reading and it shows what a teenager is capable of doing. Plus it has many twists throughout the book including the ending. If I had the chance this would be something I would like to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In my opinion, Salinger's way of writing was very different than other books of his time, using short sentences that got right to the point. One main disappointment I had, though, was that the ending was not really an ending. I was expecting to read about how his parents and everybody reacted when he returned home on that Wednesday. I did not like some of the controversial issues in the book just because they surprised me. They were all really random, but you have to expect that because it's written in a journal form. Holden's character did surprise me, too. He was this boy that came from a wealthy family that basically hated everything in the world, except for his family and his deceased brother, Allie. The novel, in all, was just a depressing novel that made you think about all the things in the world that depressed you. I did enjoy reading this book, though, just because it was an easy read that got me interested half the time. The other half of the time, I was really bored with all the long descriptions of random things that didn't really add anything to the story but another page number. Although I had many disagreements with the content of the book, I did enjoy reading the book because it had me interested most of the time. In all, I believe that everyone should read this book, just because it is a major literary novel that is very controversial for it's age."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is amazing. It is a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's been a year since I last read this book, so don't be so harsh with this review.The book is about a boy named Holden and he has been removed from school, so naturally his life isn't exactly a happy one. We see later on Holden has a deceased brother as well. So all that's left is his little sister Phoebe, and his parents. Whom he doesn't want knowing about him getting removed from school.He travels to New York for a time and spends nights wandering around, calling people from his past, spending depressing nights in wonderful hotels (I'm being sarcastic) and sitting in bars trying to get a drink.It's a great book, and the fact that it's a good portion about finding one's self only adds to it. If you have the time and the 5 bucks for it. Give it a shot. I'm not much of a reader and seeing as I recieved the book as an assignment and wasn't all that disapponted, you know it's good.(The book is also explored greatly, and many ideas rise up from the book in Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In Catcher in the Rye, J.D. Salinger creates a masterpiece about a 17 year old boy, Holden Caulfield, who has just been kicked out of a prep school and spends 24 hours in New York City. J.D. Salinger's characters are well thought out and are probably some of the most complex and intriguing characters that I have ever come upon in my 12 year stint as a young man capable of reading. Most everyone can relate to many of the feelings that Holden experiences during his stay in New York.Holden, a troubled young man who has an extreme compulsion to lie, has become my favorite character that I have ever read about. As a seventeen year old myself, I can relate to many of his thoughts and actions. As he takes his stroll around New York, he runs into many different people, most of which he does not seem to care for. Many times he can be seen criticizing the people he runs into. Salinger must have put much thought into Holden, in order to create such a picture perfect image of a teenager who is unhappy with the world around him. Holden is compassionate and caring, yet he has many exterior resistances. He does not want to become part of the crowd.Holden is on the verge of adulthood, as am I, yet does not wish to become an adult. He sees the corruption that has become New York and does not approve of it. The world is full of liars, cheaters, and phonies; and he wants none of it. I, myself, see much of the world like this and do not want to become a cog of the machine that is the corrupt world.Salinger's sense of symbolism is exceptional. The main title of the book is a metaphor. Holden is the catcher in the rye, and he wants to save innocent children from falling over the cliff at the end of the rye field into a world of hatred. The title expresses the theme of the book, innocence must be saved. Salinger makes you see the world as it really is, although his viewpoint is very cynical, I agree with it for the most part. Salinger vividly expresses this theme throughout his book through symbolism, imagery, and other literary devices.Another symbol in the book is Holden's goofy hunting cap. He uses it as a shield to protect his innocence. He puts it on when he gets uncomfortable with the world around him. There are many symbols in the novel that intrigue me.I would recommend this book to anyone, especially teenagers, as they will understand the reasoning of Holden more than any others. Salinger creates a great piece of literature in the Catcher in the Rye, through his nearly perfect characterization and outstanding symbolism. Holden has become my all-time favorite character. I see him as almost a mirror image of me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is a great protagonist, but not for heroics or jeela. It's his naivet&eacute; and innocence that will draw you in. Unlike a lot of characters you fall in love with, you'll feel for Holden and wish you could write yourself into the novel to help him. Sadly, you won't be able to. He's well written and might help you look at the 'phonies' in the world a little differently."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher In the Rye\\" is one of the greatest books I have ever read. This is the classic book about teen angst. It's never dull, I read it in about three sittings. It's just so interesting! And the language and content must've been considered awful back when it first came out, though it's not as surprising now. This is a book everyone must read, though I don't think it's appropriate for anyone under High School age. You have to read it sometime, I promise you will love it! I read it in September '05 and already consider it one of my favorite books of all time! I feel like there is a little Holden Caulfield in all of us! I also noticed that many books I have read are very much like this, but none were nearly as good. Don't think, \\"Oh, it's a classic, they're boring\\" just read it and I promise you will love it and want to read it again! I don't care if you're a teenager, middle-aged, or older, you will relate very much to Holden and you will love the book! I will definitely be reading it again soon! I hardly ever get this excited over a book unless it's just this amazing, so you know it's a good book! Please rate my review, thanks!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although I've never been there I know that New York City has long been called the city that never sleeps. Native New Yorker Holden Caulfield didn't do much sleeping when he was there unannounced to his parents in December 1949 after getting thrown out of his preparatory school, in Pennsylvania. J.D. Salinger brings Holden's many personalities to life, as Holden slips slowly out of sanity in a matter of days which seems like an eternity to the reader.Holden Caulfield is without a doubt the life of The Catcher in The Rye. So much so, it seems that his psyche is almost projecting the story onto a giant screen for all to see. Throughout the novel Holden always remains a constant. Other characters come and go and maybe be mentioned before and later, but it's Holden's account. This is what makes the book so great. It's written so that you can imagine what it's like to be Holden. Your perspective is enhanced because you're watching him as described by him, rather than from another person's point of scrutiny.The novel starts out with Holden recounting everything while at the same time giving the reader important background info. Holden Caulfield is one of four children in the Caulfield family. Besides him there's his older brother D.B. Caulfield who he now regards as a \\"phony\\" because of D.B's career choice in Hollywood. His younger brother Allie is one of the sources of his mental anguish. Allie died several years before the start of the novel and Holden often misses him. Last but not least is the youngest Caulfield Phoebe. Phoebe's the only sibling still at the family house in New York. Holden trusts Phoebe and is one of the few people he doesn't regard as a \\"Phony.\\" Holden's interaction or non interaction with his family is something that you'll have to read about, and I can assure you it won't be boring or trivial.I think the best way I can describe this book's pace and level of excitement is by saying that Holden's adventure is always moving and never really seems to take a boring turn. Life as described by Holden's former teacher at Pency Prep. \\"Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\\" Holden, as you'll see, lives up to that quote and plays his game to the fullest but struggles at the same time to control it.Like most other great novels. The Catcher in The Rye has its themes, symbols and consequences for actions taken by the characters. This book happens to have a lot of symbols such as Holden's red hunting hat which plays a major part in the story and helps define the book. In my opinion the true theme of this book is debatable and can be decided upon the individual reader's discretion. I thought an important theme is Holden's psyche and how through his trials and tribulations, he often is confused and angry but can't control everything that he wants to. That is probably what frustrates him the most and drives him to do all the things that he does throughout the whole book, good intention or no.This book is without a doubt a classic piece of American literature. As classic as it may be, this book never ceases to ever lose any of its fire. Through reading The Catcher and the Rye I got a clear picture of what Holden was going through and the scenery and environment in which the setting takes place. DO NOT BE A \\"PHONY\\" DON'T EVEN TRY.\\" GO FORTH AND READ THE CATCHER IN THE RYE!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I finished this book yesterday and I absolutely love it. Reading it,I understood why this book is considered one of the greatest pieces of literature written.J.D. Salinger takes us into the world of sixteen year old,Holden Caulfield. A boy that compulsively lies and seems to have an obsession with the phoniness of the world.I loved this story because,as I read this,it felt like I'd met him before. Not Holden Caulfield as an actual person,but I felt like I'd met him in every teenager,male teenager especially,in almost every person that I've come across in my life. He wants all the things anyone wants. A sense of normalcy,to fit into a world that's forever changing. I felt that Salinger really captured the mind set of teenagers everywhere with this beautifully written piece of fiction. I'd always pictured this as a book you only read for school,to analyze,annotate,and discuss it into oblivion...apparently I was wrong. This book is one that I could relate to and I feel that,everyone can relate to on some level. Whether you know somebody like \\"that bastard Stradlater\\" or someone like Sally Hayes or just trying to deal with the loss of someone you love. It's a book worthy of all the praise it's given."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A classic of 20th century American literature, J. D. Salinger's 'The Catcher In The Rye' (1951) is the timeless, hugely popular blueprint for all coming-of-age novels that followed. The book's 16 year-old protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, is not a rebel as many believe, but a petulant, emotionally injured, and insecure teenager who is fluent in outrage and at odds with almost every conceivable aspect of being alive.Unlike Fitzgerald's eager, amoral, and dashing Amory Blaine (This Side of Paradise, 1920), who delights in embracing and manipulating the shiny new worlds that open upon adulthood, Holden, who is grieving the recent death of a beloved younger brother, is a prematurely gray, lanky, and disgruntled loner belatedly stuck in the awkward years of adolescence. The privileged, somewhat spoiled son of a wealthy Manhattan family, the self-loathing Holden finds himself continuously surrounded by a web of other people who are obstructing embodiments of his own worst and most reviled qualities.Informatively, 'The Catcher In The Rye' opens and closes with hazy manifestations of homosexuality. The first goes unrealized by Holden, but the second is conspicuously realized and causes a full blown panic attack. In the first, Holden nudgingly provokes virile prep school roommate Stradlater into a symbolical rape, a rape that leaves the ostensibly defenseless Holden bloodied but unsatisfied.The charismatic, footloose Stradlater, who is nonchalantly used to getting his way with others, is, in Holden's eyes, \\"pretty handsome\\" and \\"very sexy,\\" has \\"very broad shoulders,\\" and is the type of young man Holden believes his own parents would find admirable; Holden comments repeatedly on the beauty of his roommate's golden hair.Unable to resist Stradlater's orbit, even while Stradlater is using the bathroom, Holden, a man obsessed, grabs his roommate in a headlock while he is shaving and bare-chested, and goes so far as to perform a spontaneous, effete mock tap dance for him. Crying out \\"It's the opening night of Ziegfeld Follies,\\" Holden makes it clear that the role he is enacting in this courting ritual is one of a respectable citizen falling from grace by exhibiting his true, no longer deniable inner nature.When the ignored Holden, who is a virgin, briefly backs away, Stradlater, \\"in just his damn shorts and all,\\" gets \\"very damn playful\\" in return, and the two fall into a briefly blissful wrestling match on Holden's bed. Since during this episode Holden's irrepressible behavior--and anger--is ostensibly the result of Stradlater's \\"giving the time\\" to a young lady Holden covets, the narrative makes it clear that the atmosphere in their room is sexually-charged and haunted by displacement.A careful reading of this scene reveals that Holden, who reasonably lacks full self-awareness, is angry not because his roommate has had sexual intercourse with the young lady in question, but because Stradlater hasn't \\"given the time\\" to him. Afterward, Holden describes their violent fight--which ends with Stradlater kneeling on Holden's chest, their drooling faces inches apart--as a \\"tiff.\\"Holden's combustible encounter with Stradlater is also partially a self-inflicted if failed initiation into manhood: \\"You never saw so much gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It partly scared me and partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough.\\" Is the bloodied Holden symbolically no longer a virgin? Does Stradlater's beating represent a provoked if less than fulfilling violation? Has Holden now become more of a man, or less of one?After the series of disastrous episodes that compose the balance of the story, some of which involve transvestites and \\"flits,\\" as Holden calls homosexually-inclined men, the exhausted young man briefly finds false hope in the company of former teacher Mr. Antolini, one of the few adults for whom he has any respect.Comforted for the first time in the book by his teacher's wisdom and concern, Holden (\\"a very, very strange boy,\\" Antolini calls him), \\"shaking like a madman,\\" bolts from his mentor's apartment in well-realized homosexual panic when he awakens to find the married Mr. Antolini patting his head in the darkness. Is the wise, sympathetic Mr. Antolini molesting Holden or genuinely expressing anxious regard and tenderness?\\"I know more damn perverts, at school and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when I'm around,\\" Holden now reveals. He has already conveyed that \\"Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away...sex is something I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.\\"What rules has Holden set for himself and then broken? Holden has been told that \\"half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know it,\\" and is subsequently \\"waiting to turn into a flit or something.\\" It may be that Holden, who despises \\"phonies\\" above all others, suffers profoundly from being an unconscious or semi-conscious phoney himself. Throughout the narrative, Holden's wishful associations with women prove to be more like sibling relationships than romantic or erotic attachments.Controversial in its day, 'The Catcher In The Rye' shocked the American reading public with its coarse but realistic language and its sympathetic depiction of the morose, angry, often hilarious Holden, who was an explicit example of every \\"good\\" family's worse nightmare. Today's readers will relate to Holden as all honest readers did then and have since, since Holden is only a vulnerable, frightened, perceptive everyman searching for a single validating role in life, and one who is temporarily a little more lost in the world--and within himself--than most find desirable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a story about the trials and tribulations of a disturbed adolescent, Holden Caulfield.

I just read this is school, I loved very moment of it. Because what Holden Caulfield says is true to some sense. The world is full of phonies and lousy people. The story Holden Caulfield is an oddsey of characters, observations, and things we never think about. Holden deals with Pencey Private School, were he encounters, Stradlator, a ladies man that is totally full of himself, Ackely, a pimplefaced loser. And many other people that he would just consider phonies. The story is more tied together when dealing with title, Catcher In The Rye. The actual poem, about a child near the edge of a cliff. And later in the book, we learn that Holden believes he is a catcher in the rye, to save that child from falling from the cliff. The cliff described in the poem to Holden is the evils of society. Thats why Holden always acts cynicilly toward society. He sees nothing bad in everything, except his little sister Phoebe whom he loves all lot. She herself is a representation of the child in the poem. Holden believes his purpose in life is to a sort of savior to children from society. He wants to keep there innocence. In one sequence in the novel, he is outside Phoebe's school and he sees the phrase F*** Off! penned on the building. He tries to clean it off. Holden is a very deep and trobled but also quite interesting. This book is a true American classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I consider myself fortunate to get through high school without reading about the cynical and misanthropic Holden. No doubt, many of today's angst filled teenagers will relate, as he reminds me of a few immature fellows that I knew. The only reason to read novel this is to obtain a perspective on teenage pessimism. Unfortunately, not much about the main character is really ever revealed, except for why he seems so detached. Salinger has timelessly captured behavior of the modern disenfranchised youth. Listen to an angry teenager for about a week, and you'll get the idea. In the end, Holden Caulfield made me want to puke."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Be warned, this slim book is controvertial because it contains foul language. I am not particularly sensitive to such language, having grown up around some wonderful, earthy characters, however even I found this excessive -- puerile even.

I did not see enough of the expected \\"artistic merit\\" to spur me on further. By all means give this book a try -- you now know what to expect, perhaps you'll have better luck.

His school is about to expel him because of his bad grades. He wanted to stay out away from home and school so during his vacation he lived out and didn't go home. During that time he lived in hotels in New York City. He got the money from his grandmother who never remembers his birth-date and gives him money. One day he bought a gift for his sister whom he loves respectively, Phoebe, at home. Because they are close, Holden told him about how he is flunking school. Next day he went to find his sister at her school and was going to say good bye because he is deciding to leave and run away from home, but because she cried, the then doesn't have the heart to leave anymore.J. D. Salinger wrote this book in a teenager point of view, which was very smart. The words and the language she used to write this book are commonly heard from a lot of teenagers.

At 43, I must be too old for &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Either that or this book did not survive the 90's. It was 214 pages tedious, annoying drivel about pretty much nothing. Considering the real world concerns of Americans in the 1940's, it's not a wonder the author advanced the time frame to well after World War II. How could anyone at that time, even the young emphathize with this character's petty pet peeves. About half way through, I was struck by it's similarity to a bad episode of Seinfeld - tedious, annoying, not funny. At times it was depressing, so I'd call it &quot;Clinical-Seinfeld&quot;.

In my opinion Holden Caufield represents the stereotypical teen-age preppie that has no idea what he wants out of life. Many argue that he is the epitome of teen age angst but I wonder how many teenagers actually wander aimlessly around NY for 3 days because they're fed up with the world. I'm 15 years old and I found Holden to be nothing more than a spoiled brat who thinks of nothing but himself and how the world has dissapointed him. It seems that Pheobe had more sense and direction than her older brother who was supposed to be her role model. I don't understand why everyone calls this book a &quot;modern classic&quot;. Throughout the book I hoped that there would be some unifying concept at the end that would at least give some illusion of a plot or purpose. I was completely disapointed when the novel ended without any conclusion or resolution. If anyone thinks that I am completely misguided in my opinion, please email me and explain to me why this is such a wonderful book. I'd really like to understand why everyone loves this novel so much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye, was to put it simply, horrible. I am a 17 year old high school student, and luckily I was not forced to endure reading this book as many of my classmates were this year. I did however read it several years ago and did not like it one bit. It was so bad I couldn't even finish the book. I skimmed through the last few pages, hoping to find a ray of light, a glimmer of wisdom or some gem of knowledge that I had missed but found none what so ever.Recently I re-read parts of the book to see if I was missing something, but it was to no avail. To put it simply, Holden is a punk. People tell me that maybe I don't identify with the character, can't recognize his struggles or what he is going through. I think part of the reason I didn't like this book is because I can identify with all of those things and can see Holdens' point of view better than he can. All of these adults who say that this is such a great book probably do so because they have forgotten what teen-angst feels like, or never even felt it in the first place and want to pretend they have. I have never met a teenager that has liked this book, and our English Honors class is very well read. The teachers, adults, and librarians will rave on and on about it, but only because they have forgotten a part of themselves in adulthood. That feeling of imortality and hatred towards our parents which they say we all have (but none of us seem to notice). This book didn't teach me anything. For all of its angst, dischours, and depression, it dosen't have a focus, a purpose, or anything to direct it all at. It just blindly throws rage at the world like it's free and will never run out. By the time your at the end you feel like saying &quot;So What?&quot; Maybe that's what they want, but it's not anygood when that's already how you feel. Perhaps because I identify with Holdens' feelings so much I don't identify with him at all and despise him. In the end, Holden leaves so much anger and rage that it all becomes inadequate.! By the way if you liked this book, or didn't, but took the time to read it, something tells me that you will love Joseph Heller's, CATCH-22."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I managed to reach well into middle age before I finally picked up this book that I've heard so much about since my teen years. I disliked reading books back then. In my 30's, when my passion for reading ignited, \\"Catcher\\" just was not on my personal list. I finally picked up a copy and plowed through it. What's the point? It was a nice coming of age story, but nothing special. The main character was someone whom I would like to avoid had he been a real, live presence in the world. In short, \\"Catcher\\" wasn't worth my time. I can see why J.D. Salinger is one of the most noted recluses. I'd be embarrassed, too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, I'm 26 years old and am a voracious reader (and always have been). For some reason, I never had to read this book for school. I'm now thankful that I did not read it in the school setting and was not exposed to \\"the deep meaning of the book\\" or how it's a \\"timeless reflection of angst-ridden teenagers\\" (or other such nonsense that random people assign to random books without ever speaking with the author and than preach about in classrooms all over the country).I was not impressed with this book at all and, for the life of me, cannot figure out why it is a classic. I'm sure the swearing and the sex in a book aimed at teenagers was somewhat scandalous when this was published but is that enough of a reason for it to be considered one of the greatest books of modern times?? Or for it to be assigned to mulitudes of high-school English students? I'm curious as to what the assignments and discussions are about this book because there didn't seem to be a whole lot of depth in it.So Holden wants to protect the innocence and purity of childhood? Based on what? His relationship with his sister? What he wants to be in life? His brother's death? All this while getting kicked out of school, calling random girls and wandering around NYC?

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't written poorly (which is why I gave it two stars instead of one); it was, however, a very weakly veiled author avatar novel. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is nothing but a spoiled brat, who has everything handed to him in life, and who complains about everything about life because he's had everything handed to him. I hated him as a character, which, along with a weak plot of him wandering around New York for a day, made the book the disappointment that it was.However, some people love this book. I personally was about to toss my copy in the garbage when a friend asked me if he could read it first. I gave it to him, and to my shock he loved it, and declared that it was the best novel he'd ever read (and he reads a lot). He, however, like Holden Caulfield, is a spoiled brat who has had everything in life handed to him, so he really related to the character. It seems that after talking to different people who have read the Catcher in the Rye that that tends to be the trend: spoiled people love it; people who have had to fight to achieve anything in life hate it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You can't really say it's a good or bad novel. It is what it is and stands out like a sore thumb in the history of literature. If nothing else, it is unique that's for sure.It is most certainly a classic, but whether that's due to quality of story or other more unusual reasons is open to debate...The novel is definitely not an easy read. It's character-driven, rather than plot focused. Not a great deal happens in terms of events, it's more about what happens within Holden's mind. Therefore, it's veering strongly toward a literary style...Problem is, the writing style is not really strong enough to be an all-out literary classic in my opinion. Then again, it is held up as a literary classic by many (perhaps most?) critics. So often readers come to this novel expecting so much, then soon end up being seriously disappointed - as is evidenced by the large amount of 1-star reviews here on Amazon. Many have commented they couldn't even finish it - few if any other literary classics receive this level of criticism. But this is of course offset by the amount of readers who view it as the greatest novel ever written.So basically it divides readers. People either love or hate it. Personally, I love the first-person intimacy of it, but also hate the repetitiveness of the story. Reading Catcher is like being in a like a loop you can't get out of, but strangely there is a side of yourself that enjoys it! Weird. The book defies normal story logic in a way. It could be a 5-star or could just as easily be a 1-star book, I can't say for sure...therefore, out of confusion, I give it 3 stars.It is strange in a way that this book is part of the curriculum and compulsory reading for high school students in most Western Hemisphere countries. That doesn't seem to add up given the highly rebellious and anti-social nature of the book, plus its dubious literary quality.What adds complexity to the whole Catcher legend is that numerous serial killers, assassins have had a copy (or in some cases numerous copies) of this book on them when killing...while other murderers have been found to have multiple copies in their homes, many with notes scribbled on every single page...the most famous examples: Copies of Catcher were found on the men behind the assassination and attempted assassination of John Lennon and Ronald Reagan respectively..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i received my book just as advertised.it was a great price, and i am very happy with my purchase. thanks! i will definately be doing buisness here again!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read it out of pure curiosity.

Yikes, what a book! Holden Caulfield is an indelible character, so too is the actual writing, the by turns snarky and yearning tone of voice Salinger flawlessly conjures on the page, words after all, only words. Along the same lines as the genie and the bottle, you can never unwrite a good novel and this is a great novel.

I think this book is overrated and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What an awful book. Written in 1951, this book originally sparked great controversy with its mature themes focusing on the teenage angst, loneliness and rebellion of the protagonist Holden Caulfield. I guess its like a really bad version of James Dean's classic Rebel Without a Cause. Caulfield is the archetype of an underachiever. Today kids are reading about the latest sluggard - Greg Heffley from The Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The characters Greg and Holden have a lot in common.Catcher in the Rye follows the life of Holden Caulfield for a few days after being expelled from Pencey prep school as he returns home to New York City and contemplates life. Although, Caulfield does little contemplation and spends most of his time whining and complaining about everyone and everything. He sees the negative in everything (except his little sister) and makes one bad and offensive decision after another for almost 300 pages of misery. The only value I can find in reading this book today is to use Holden Caulfield as an example of what NOT to be - lazy, negative, and uninspired. Unfortunately the latest version of Holden Caulfield appears to be as popular with readers today as Catcher in the Rye was fifty years ago. When are we going to wake up and stop celebrating negative characters like Holden and Greg?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye and I did not care for it at all. Wanted to read it because of the publicity, but maybe because I am a grandmother, I just didn't like it. I just finished Dream Catcher by J. D. Salinger's daughter, a book I greatly enjoyed and think his daughter is a remarkable individual. However, the book seemed extremely juvenile to me. Most of the content was given to sex and I can see where young boys and perhaps girls would enjoy it. Not something I would have ever cared for but it had a lot of unnecessary profanity. It speaks to me of a young man who was mentally ill, I am sure that a label could be put on it today. I am not so sure it was not actually describing Salinger himself. After reading his daughter's book, I think Salinger definitely had mental illness, what I would call crazy. His family had to endure awful things because of him. He chose to be a recluse, and did not live in the real world, wanted to live in isolation."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The problem with this book is that J.D. Salinger gets really repetitious about his character 'Holden'. Look, I don't care if Holden is selfish and opinionated and thinks like an immature brat. It actually made him a compelling character to read and is artfully done sometimes. What I do care about is how his thoughts are reflected by the author. He utilizes Holden's thoughts in the same variation or thought process on EVERY PAGE. Perhaps I need to be more detailed in my description about this.Seems like every other paragraph Salinger runs through this same process:1) An event happens, and is described by Holden/Salinger2) Holden talks about the event particularly3) Holden generalizes this event to include most of the worldOR:6) First person's viewpoint7) Second person's viewpoint (the same as the first)8) Holden/Salinger's viewpoint (often the same as both)The problem is, there's nothing brilliant about this. Whether Salinger is thought brilliant by expressing a cynical view of the world in 1950s through the eyes of a 16-year old boy, he gets to be repetitious. Within nearly every page you will find this guideline to his literary writing once, if not twice per page. Example:Page 85:1) \\"I was surrounded by jerks\\"2) \\"On my right there was this very Joe Yale looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests\\"3) \\"All those Ivy League bastards look alike\\"Page 87:6) \\"You could tell the waiter didn't like her much\\"7) \\"You could tell the Navy guy didn't like her much\\"8) \\"I didn't like her very much\\"The brilliance dissipates, leaving you with a character going about, commenting about his experiences utilizing the same handful of explicits. You know what \\"kills me\\" all the time Holden/Salinger? The way every page is also riddled with these EXACT words, along with: \\"I hate that stuff\\", \\"He was one of those guys\\", \\"She was one of those types\\" or some equally clich&eacute; pronouncement.Pronouncements. That's all this book seems to be. A collection of complaints about the world, seemingly through the eyes of a 16-year old boy, when in actuality it's the complaints of the world from an author that's as mentally mature as a 16-year old boy. This hardly qualifies as prose. It's such a shallow storyline, devoid of any distinguishable hooks or climaxes. The character goes from one location to the next, complaining every step of the way.Had Holden been a better constructed character, who wasn't spotting out the same smug lines, I'd be alright with him being THE ONLY protagonist in this book. However, he's fails to do so. His character cannot withstand the burden of holding up this entire book.I will give you this. There is wit. Some things Holden says is so incredibly witty, and the amazing part is how well it still translates even after fifty years.But that's its only strongest point. And it doesn't offset the amount of failures of design in nearly any other area. This is not literature. It's teenage smut from the 40s."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i must have forgotten to read some part of this book -- what makes it a classic? it's a first hand account of a high school drop out who has too much money in his pocket and too much time on his hands. with all its sex and foul language, teenage boys will certainly find this book fascinating. but if you want a \\"coming of age\\" book, read anne frank's diary (or mad magazine) instead."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since its original publication in 1951, and its selection, I think, as a Book of the Month offering, I have read this novel at least five times in various decades. At each reading the book falls lower in my estimation, and I wonder more about the big stir it has made in schools. It's told by self-indulgent, rebellious, whiny, privileged, spoiled brat who may very well be a certifiable nut case. He says, \\"I swear to God I'm a madman.\\"Holden has very little in common with the average middle class American high school student, and even less today because the book has become dated. (Who today drives La Salle cars or calls gays flits?) As a former English teacher, I cannot understand how and why it became a must-read for most high school students. The irony is that for teachers and the adult world the book is subversive and anarchistic.The book's message is certainly not life-affirming, nor is it a representative portrait of an American teenager. The novel's thematic structure is poor; it is very repetitive, and Holden begins to grate on me.It is very prep school, very Manhattan-oriented, although I dearly love Manhattan. What happens to Holden in this picaresque novel is not pleasant reading nor pertinent to people in general. He undergoes a lot of disagreeable experiences; some turn nasty because of his own tendency to bug other people He detests phonies; they make him puke, and yet he is a phony of the first order. He dislikes everyone except his brother and his little sister Phoebe. Sister Phoebe, age ten says, \\"You don't like anything that's happening.\\" Salvation by the child is clich&eacute; Salinger resorts to with Phoebe and elsewhere in his work.There's too much about his private school classmates and their oddities--why he dislikes them so. The book is a downer; it makes the reader depressed because he's always depressed. People he doesn't like: \\"They don't just stay a rat while they're a kid. They stay a rat their whole life.\\"If you know something of Salinger's reclusive life and reaction to the public over all these years, you can't help thinking he hasn't rid himself of Holden's adolescence angst. His naivet&eacute; regarding the intuitive wisdom of the precocious child shows up often in his tiny lifetime output of work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story of Holden Caulfield is one of a the modern mans heroes journey. Holden is everyman as he is within in us and around us. Everyone should truly take the time to read this life changing book. I cannot give it enough credit for what it has taught me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Even though Holden C. repeats everything twice, the second being \\"I mean...\\" or \\"...you have to be in the mood for...\\", this is his personality that J.D. Salinger created for him. Since he is always depressed, his downfall becomes reflected on me, as a reader, but makes me feel thankful for my possessions."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is an emotional book that truly protrays teenage conflicts. All though some of the situations are exaggerated, teenagers will have an easy time connecting with Holden. Holden invites the reader into his journey home where he goes through periods of insecurity, loneliness, and remorse. The book is touching and will make any reader think and and any teenager think about the coming adulthood. I was captured by the reality of the book and the truth behind it. It is a depressing, humorous, and inspirational."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that I am still pondering after reading it. The main character is the narrorator and his name is Holden Caulfield. I would say that this story is very much a character study in that the whole book we're figuring out what Holden wants, what's going through his mind, and the reasons for the stories of all the people he encounters. He has very much growing up to do and I'm coming to the conclusion that he doesnt want to think that there is bad in anyone. That there is this continued innocence that he doesn't want to let go of. I enjoyed the style that the book was written in. It gave a sort of originality, being that it was Holdens exact thoughts and written in such a colloquial way that you felt he was just speaking to you. I would definately reccomend this book to anyone. I think that teenagers would enjoy it most though."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you want to know what it feels like to be a young man, going through those difficult maturing times right before adulthood, then read this excellent story and re-live those anxious teenage days with protagonist Holden Caulfield. I laughed throughout the neurotic but hip narrative and was surprised at how current this (early-fifties) character is to todays youth.Holden's kid sister Phoebe gave the story so much heart and love, she was a wonderful foil to Holden's angst and she gave the story a life-affirming spin that has made this book a true classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an amazing book. I have to admit that when I read it for the first time as a 15 year old high school student I absolutly loathed everything about it. I turned each page and found that it was more boring than the last. I did not appreciate what the main character, Holden, was going through. I thought it was a pointless account of a troubled boy's less than enviable life.I read it again at the end of my senior year in high school. It was timed perfectly as I felt Holden's struggle against his changing surroundings somewhat reflected my own life. As I read about his desires to remain protected by the safety and comforts of childhood I thought about my own bittersweet feelings toward leaving home for college for the first time. Salinger truly captures what it is to be a confused child not yet ready to be thrown into the adult world.If read at the right time, which, unfortunately, is not always when your sophomore English teacher assigns it, this book and its meaning can have a great impact on the reader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All the hype that has surrounded this book for many years was sufficient enough to encourage me to read it, and it did not let me down. The way Salinger is able to relate teenagers of that era to Holden Caufield is just incredible. There is never really a dull moment in this read, Salinger has Holden on the run for the whole book with never ending excitement at every turn. His perception of reality through Holden's eyes is unreal; most people that have already experience they're teenage years will be able to relate to a lot of the adventures and mischief that Holden finds himself in. This was one of the only books that I enjoyed reading from cover to cover and no matter who you are this book would be the one that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody'd move...Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.\\"This quote can sum up a lot about the book. Holden Caulfield wishes he could live a life as simple and idealistic as those of the museum's displays. However, he realizes that even though they haven't changed, he has. He likes the fact that he can judge one of the displays, an Eskimo, and it will never judge him back. He only really likes the museum because it is completely opposite from what real life is like.Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old who has a long record of getting expelled from schools, so when he is kicked out of Pencey Prep, it comes as no surprise. The only subject he ever did well in was English, but he always seemed to flunk out of every other class. Even though he had a few days until he had to return home, he decided that he'd had enough of Pencey and left for Manhattan. Instead of going home right then though, he stayed at a hotel and decided not to tell his parents that he was back.During the three days he had until he was supposed to be home, he paraded around New York City going to the park and bars. He was constantly trying to act older than his real age. He used his height and the select spots of \\"gray hair\\" that he had to pull it off. Too many times do teenagers try to do the same thing today. Especially when trying to act tough or that they know it all, when really, they don't anything. They haven't lived long enough to understand that they are trying to grow up too fast. Holden obviously tries to act much older, but most of the time, fails. However in the some parts of the book, his youth sometimes shows.It is said that some of the events are somewhat autobiographical. The author, J.D. Salinger, was born in New York City and went to school in Pennsylvania, just like Holden. When The Catcher in the Rye started gaining notoriety, Salinger retreated to Cornish, New Hampshire. He continued writing novels there, but he did not publish them.This book is considered a great depiction of teen angst, and with good reason. Every teenager who reads it can relate in some way to how Holden feels about certain things. It is simply put down into words from his thoughts in a way that almost everyone wishes they had the ability to do, minus a few cuss words, of course. I would recommend this book to anyone being that everyone is a 16-year-old at one point in their lives. And even though it is rather short, it is a very straightforward account of one teenager on a quest to find his place in life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was 15 and it changed my life. I reread it recently and it was a completely different (still wonderful) experience. The bottom line is, you only live once, so you only get one shot at reading it while you're a peer of Holden Caulfield, a protagonist unlike anyone else you'll ever meet. If you're between the ages of 14 and 17, read it now before it's too late."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this book is classic. no doubt about it. but for the life of me, i can't understand why. it has a strange plot, where as a coming to age man just basically walks around. the characters are well-developed, and this book does have it's moments, but characters just walk-in, walk-out, and are not thought of ever again. the story starts to grow and grow and when i thought that it was just about to resolve, it ended. that's it, you dont find out whether or not he does anything about his problems. this wouldnt have bothered me if i had read it without expectations, but i knew it was supposed to be exeplanary. it just wasnt what i expected, and in the end, i think that's what let me downthe thing that this story did have that i liked was that the charater were very easy to relate to (or at least the ones who stayed long enough) the title character was a melodramatic teenager, and i dont mean that in a bad way. everybody is/was/will be. his sister was smart and somewhat clingy, which is what little sisters tend to be. yet she seems to have some problems no older brother could help with, making her seem so much more human. and the list goes on with characters.so bottom line is, you either relate to the story, or you dont. but in the end, you're gonna read it, wheather you like it or not!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger has done something that most authors constantly strive to do: Write a poignant, creative novel that's easy to read and yet deeply moving at the same time. It doesn't matter if you're reading it in 1955 or 2005 as a teenager experiencing (or an adult reminiscing) this book will remind you of your own young adult experience.Starting with the brash, defiant opening statement \\"If you really want to hear about it the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and how my parents were all occupied before they had me and all that David Copperfield crap.\\" Which carries the general voice of the restless, disturbed, and incredibly sensitive Holden Caulfield. Told in bits and pieces of memories the book tells about his misadventures after getting kicked out of school and the underlying theme of his distate for the \\"phony-ness\\" of the adult world. A fantastic read for adults and teenagers alike I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a book you can read over and over.

I was exceptionally curious about the book, as I'd heard so much about it for some time. Expecting nothing more than a good story, I began to read. However, I got much more than just another good story, more than an exquisite writing style, more than a book of exemplary yet classic adolescent indignation and mercurialness. As Holden's story unfolded, I began to think, and I began to put some things, insignificant as they seemed, into perspective. If this doesn't seen quite comprehendable now, perhaps you will understand after reading the book, which I very highly recommend to anyone searching for a little more. As I mentioned, I felt the writing style to be exceptional. It is said from the mouth of Holden Caulfield, an adolescent boy who has been expelled from school. Rather than go home, he spends three days wandering the streets of New York City. Holden willingly excludes himself from anything phony, and tells us of his experiences while doing so. I'm sure that just about any teenager can relate to him in one way or another. I know I certainly can."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a true classic. I enjoyed every nuance and detail of this book. Some people may not be on the edge of their seat reading about Jane Gallagher putting her kings in the back row, but the specifics of Catcher in the Rye are what make it a teriffic read. People claim that there is no plot, but just even though there is not a uniform storyline (beginning, climax, etc.), this is real life. Real life does not function on set boundaries or limits. Holden's struggle as he comes to a crossroads in life is told from his point of view, a 16 year old's point of view. Although the drama is altogether lost in the cynicism, who says that's a bad thing?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life!It may take a little time but at the end, we get very attached to the main character, Holden, and we just want to read it once over again!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many should read this story to better understand the importance of examining ones place in the world. Also, as with the protagonist in this story, the significance of perhaps never understanding ones place in the world.

Very few books require hitting the timing perfectly. At some point you will like it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book not out of interest from others but from its scandalousness. People who killed celebrities (or attempted to) were found with it in their possessions. It's also a &quot;book-burner's and book-banner's favorite&quot;. I read it to look for anything that resembled &quot;bad messages&quot;. I found nothing but the mindless bitter ramblings of a depressed and confused brat. It had no basic plot, no real storyline, nothing of the sort. To say the least, by the time I was finished I was quite angry at the book's fame (or should I say notoriety?). My first idea, apparently, was it was an utter piece of trash. BUT, when I spoke to others about it, I noticed the way I spoke of it sounded just like what I had read. That's when I found the secret: The Bitterness is the REAL MAIN CHARACTER, just like the Chaos of the movie &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; was its main character and the Nadsat Dialect of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; was as important a character as &quot;Your Humble Narrator, Alex&quot; was. It was a primary example of the line about when we don't like other people or other things because we see something we don't like about ourselves in them. That's how I understand it anyway. So, next time you see or hear someone who seemingly can't stop whining and complaining for two seconds, hand 'em a copy of this book and tell them to go FIND themself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book as a senior in high school, and though I enjoyed it and found some of Holden's observations on life amusing, particularly those pertaining to the commercialization of Christmas and the lack of decent cabs in New york, I did not identify with him as a character and found his outlook to be &quot;whiny&quot;, not cynical. He is a boring, up-scale version of the traditional juevenile delingquent who blames the rest of the world for his situation, rather than make any attempt to change it. The problem is, Salinger does not give Holden the charisma or the inherent prudence necessary to be a genuine and successful smart ass. Holden's priviledged lifestyle and prep-school mentality also make it hard to believe that this kid has any idea of what he's talking about when he makes his vapid little comments on the human race. Salinger makes the mistake of funneling very adult themes and attitudes through a 17-year-old spokesperson, and it is not a good fit. Coming from the mouth of an adult, some of them could be insightful and appropriate, expressed as experience. Coming from a teenager, they just comes off as&quot;I-don't-know-what-I'm-talking-about-angst.&quot; Grow up Holden. Experience life a little, and then you'll have the right to be taken seriously as a cynic.As for its status as a &quot;calssic&quot;, this story is an amusing diversion that moves along at a fairly quick pace and provides better-than-average distraction. This is not a masterpiece of American litterature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was the book that got me started on my Salinger feeding frenzy. Once I read this, I couldn't read anything by another author for about three months. Luckily, all Salinger's are so good that I was never disappointed in my literary idol. I don't believe that there is anyone out there who cannot identify with Holden Caulfield and the &quot;trauma&quot; he is going through. The book is soooooooo absorbing that I finished it in about three hours, from cover to cover, and then read it again. I identify with Holden, and the fact that he is attempting to find his place out there somewhere amongst all the &quot;phonies&quot;. Reading this has helped me find the path to who I am, along with a loooottt of the other Salinger stories. And no, it's not because I don't believe in God that I identify with Holden. I may be having a teensy religious rebellion, but that has nothing to do with it. Catcher in the Rye is one of THE BEST books you could read as a teenager, along with the other JDS's of course."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My english teacher didn't recommend this book to me in the 9th grade because she thought it would be 'over my head'. That is not so! I completely identified with Holden Caulfield; the depressed teenager, disappointed with mostly everyone around him. Beneath the humor, there are important messages about society and people in general. This is my favorite book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants someone to identify with, and to anyone who just wants to step into a teenager's mind for a while. I see why it is still a classic, after all of these years!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"On one hand, this book was written fantastically, and really showed a lot about a teenage boy's life in a duration of just a few days. On the other hand, I was a bit dissapointed with the book. I hear everyone rave on and on about the book, like teachers, librarians, even my parents. The Catcher in the Rye just wasn't holding me down to my seat, or glueing my eyes to the book like other novels due. All in all, good book, overrated."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Overrated. Should not enjoy the status it has. Sends the wrong message to young people. Lacks depth.

I found the book very enjoyable! It is interesting how the book was written several years ago, but it does not seem to be from the past. The style of writing is thrilling yet descriptive at the same time. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book that seems very life-like and true."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Unlike most people (people I know of) who are my age (13) who read or started reading Cathcer in the Rye , I loved it from the begining. Catcher in the Rye is the story of Holden Caulfield, a New York teenager who was just booted out of his prepatory school. Holden leaves his school and spends several days wandering around New York. As the days go by Holden becomes more obviously agitated with the obvious phoniness he is enveloped in and unable to break out of.Caulfield is the type of character that most people either love or hate with a passion. Salinger is an excellent writer and even if you made an effort to read Catcher in the Ride and didn't like it his other books ( Franny and Zooey, Nine Stories, and Raise High the Roof Beams; and Seymor: an Introduction) are worth a look."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Though many of you think this is dribble-or smut-or un-couth- or what ever, you all have different words. i found that this book is very real-even now. There are very few teenager's and young adults who cannot relate to this novel. Perhaps, you could call them, oh, &quot;uptight stiffs with no sense of humour.&quot; Now perhaps I am wrong. However-most people who &quot;wonder&quot; why libraries keep these books, and why kids read them (as one critic put it) those are normally the people who 'ban and burn'. Now, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I think it is a must read and that it touches into the 'human teenager' as I prefer to put it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read the Catcher, I hated it. I realize why, now. The reason is this: I consider it a cardinal sin to not finish a book the same day I started it. So I tried to read the Catcher all at once and, really, I like Holden and all, but how much of his rambling can you take? I sat there for hours listening to him going ON and ON and ON and ON. I pity the poor psychiatrist who had to sit across from him and listen to all that. But, to make a long story short, I rediscovered my copy of the Catcher under my bed one morning and reread it. This time I stretched the reading over a week and discovered that I enjoyed the book MUCH more! To those who complain that the book is plotless, I agree with you completely. But that doesn't mean it isn't good! For those who say it's 'vulgar' and 'inappropriate', well, let me tell ya, the language Holden uses is very mild compared to what I hear every day at school (I am a thirteen-year-old attending middle school). You know, there must be certain advantages to being crazy -- J.D. Salinger is obviously a raving lunatic and yet he created this masterpiece. I wonder what really happens to the ducks in the winter? I wonder what happened to Holden? I can still see him, looking the same as the day I discovered him, walking the streets of some big city and waging a private war against all the phonies in the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I just opened to the first page of this modern classic, I knew this was my type of read. It stirred me from the start! I mean, think about this kid who talks so informally to you and tells you of all this &quot;David Copperfield crap&quot; and how much you know about him from the first few lines. Another highlight of the book is when Holden tells us he gets expelled from what is his fourth school and throughout the passage of time, has no one to turn to and is a child in a world alone. He runs away from his Pencey School and spends three days in New York. Holden just wants to find his place under the sun and escape all the &quot;phonies&quot; and &quot;crap&quot; of his environment. The boy runs away from Robert Ackley, a classmate of his at Pencey, and his annoying roommate named Stradlater, who asks him to write a composition for his English class on anything specific. Holden chooses to write about his younger brother Allie's baseball mitt; he died on July 18, 1946. This glove was filled with poems on it and it stood out. This was lying in Holden's suitcase where he lived (An important highlight of the tale that CANNOT afford to be missed). Stradlater goes on a date that night with Jane Gallagher, who turns out to be Holden's longtime girlfriend whom he hadn't seen for five years. For further information on this gem of a novel, get your copy of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; ASAP.

The whole theme of this book is growing up. At seventeen, there are a lot of things that Holden is going through that I can relate to. He is very indecisive and has no idea what he wants from his life yet. The diction that Salinger uses to tell the story in Holden's words really exemplifies his youth. \`Lousy' and \`phony' are childlike words, while the overuse of profanities shows the main character becoming a bit more adult. Holden feels the need to be independent and not have to rely on the adults in his life, especially those who have let him down, like his parents and teachers. He sees most adults as \`phony' and doesn't really trust the world of growing up. I find this a little ironic because, in his search for independence, Holden is growing up, and becoming even more like the people he despises. Holden has amazing perception, and he sees the world for what it is, full of people who act fake and are very corrupted. He tells his sister Phoebe about wanting to be the \`catcher in the rye' instead of any normal career because he wants to save innocent children like the boy singing in the street and his sister, his only real source of happiness, from the terrible adult world by catching them before they fall off the cliff that surrounds the field of rye that represents childlike innocence. Holden's view of the world and bitter tone gives the readers a very different perspective than what is normal, and probably a more accurate view on the turmoil many teenagers feel growing up. However, despite how much Holden takes in, he is very blind to the problems he has. He is very quick to criticize everyone around him, and mark people as fake or perverted. Holden is incredibly judgmental, and is probably the most \`phony' character in the whole book. For example, at the beginning of the novel when Holden is still at Pencey, he goes, uninvited, into the boy named Ackley's room to get away from his own roommate, Stradlater. Holden despises being around Ackley and can never seem to get away from him, but yet uses Ackley when he needs him, not because he is a friend. Holden's two-faced quality can be seen throughout the novel. He continually uses the people he doesn't like for his enjoyment, like the older women in the bar, Sally, the taxi drivers, and Luce. This is a testament to how little Holden sees about himself. He is more lonely than anything, but doesn't realize it because he is too busy examining the faults of others. Holden's whole existence in the novel is hypocritical and contradictory. He constantly pretends to be an adult, yet he doesn't trust adults and thinks they are fake. He tries to be the ladies' man like Stradlater, but he did nothing but complain about his roommate. His whole story about why he was in New York early and his expulsion form Pencey was a complete lie, but he points out how everyone else lies. I think that Holden really does have the potential to be a good person as seen with his interactions with the nuns at the station and with his little sister; however, throughout the novel, Holden is egotistical, phony, and incredibly selfish.I didn't like this book for two reasons: it had a very unlikable protagonist, and it had no story. I believe a book should have the readers rooting for the protagonist through his struggles, and I'm sorry, but I find it difficult to be on Holden's side because of the fact that he won't solve his own problems before he criticizes others. A book also needs to actually have an interesting plot, and I feel this story didn't even have a plot. I spent the whole novel wondering what the point of the book was. I couldn't identify any rising action or climax and I feel like the story had no structure. The reader follows Holden through New York with the intention of doing...what? The story was aimless and uninteresting. If a book leaves the reader not even caring what happens next, it doesn't really serve the purpose of a story. I think it is a great analysis of growing up, but poorly written as a story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of my absolute favourite books.

Mr. Salinger, through his young protagonist Holden Caulfield, keeps you on your toes....happy, sad, anxious, and wondering what's true and what's acting. (Holden Caufield loved pretending he was acting the part of some obscure character in a movie staring his favourite actors).Of great import to young Holden is his deep love for his little sister, Phoebe; his dislike for anything or anyone pretentious or phony; his respect for his brother, D.B.; and an ever gnawing undercurrent and profound sadness at the loss of his brother Allie, who died of lukemia a few years earlier. He misses his brother desperately, and continues to talk to him as though he is walking next to him. He disliked school...(all of them from which he had been expelled) though some of his favourite friendships had been developed there. Sometimes young Holden's thoughts are jumbled....sometimes they are clear and profound. He finds his questions....i.e., \\"where do the birds go when the lagoon is frozen\\", annoying to others, and this is confusing to him as he thinks all kinds of questions should be important to everyone and thus deserve an answer.Sadness for me as a reader comes when young Holden is disillusioned by those who had been his mentors. I felt particularly protective of the protagonist when he was in the company of Mr. Antolini. Young Holden Caufield seemed to attract more than his share of \\"perverts\\".No matter how many times you have read this book, you will continue to enjoy it. There's a reason that it is called a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this is a great book, such a great book in fact, that after reading it, i find it hard to find books i like, its hard to find books that are even close to as good as Catcher. so, all i wanna read is books from JD Salinger, then i find that there arent that many in publication. and i just wanna go and track down all of the &quot;bootlegs&quot;. there are so many reactions to this book that are posted, and im not sure if this will be read, but if it is, and if anybody has any ideas on where i can get any of his unpublished works, then please email me. thanks"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that Catcher In the Rye is the best book that I have read. My favorite part is the message of what the catcher in the rye really means."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about a young man named Holden Caulfield's experience in New York. Holden is telling about his life about getting kicked out of school and going to New York. This book showed the people he encountered throughout his three days there. I could relate to some of the htings he did throughout the story. J.D. Salinger is a remarkable writer. This book made me want to know what was going to happen next. Since I don't read books that much, I would recommend this book to anyone who has not read it yet."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved the book.Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.I think it is a great book for teenagers to read because some can relate to Holden. I would reccomend the book to any one who is interseted in reading a great book.I think it's stupid for the book to be banned in some places."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a terrific book. Its full of sarcastic humor and honest likes, dislikes, and ideas of holden. i can't see that there is any way that everybody wont relate to this book. the author gets into the mind of holden caulfield so well, that you cant help saying &quot;wow, thats exactly how i feel&quot;, or &quot;thats exactly what happened to me&quot;. i could go on forever about how great this book is, but ill just end with saying that this is a great book that everyone should read at least once, if not more times in their life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a great book. I am very glad I read it. At first I thought it sounded pretty stupid becuase I thought it was going to be about a bread factory of something like that. But it turned out to be a great book about a kid growing up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"after reading all these reviews, i couldn't help but notice how VEHEMENTLY people reacted to Catcher. whether the book is good or not remains a matter of opinion, but if the test of a good book is to get a strong reaction from its readers, then i'd say this book has passed the test. what do YOU think?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is a character many people can relate to. I've read this book dozens of times and every time I laugh and inevitably find myself enjoying it more than the last time I read it. This is my all-time favorite book next to J.D. Salinger's Nine Stories. The man is a genius."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To be brief...this book was excellent, magical, and very moving. Although I grew up in a different country, it was easy for me to relate with Holden Caulfield because I used to live in NY and I think any 18-year-old teenager could easily relate to his character. When I first started reading this book, I was amused by the main character. As I continued to read, I began to despise Holden because it seemed that he would never be satisfied with anything. By the end of the book, I could understand why he refused to compromise. He WAS phony like the rest of them, which was why he couldn't even stand himself much less the rest of the world. Allie and Pheobe were the only two people he found honesty and purity in. He felt lost and desperate to escape the phoniness of the world, yet he couldn't escape because there was no place to go...and i don't think he really wanted to go...he wanted to be free...but what did that mean? Anyhow, this book was not a melodramatic, teary, overdone book. This story was very realistic although the use of slang seemed a bit redundant. The reason why this book has offended so many people and has caused so much controversy, is because it is a great book that can not be interpreted so simply. A book that causes debate must be a great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot; The Catcher in the Rye' wasn't a book that I had the chance to read in high school. Recently, my wife recommened the book to me. She said it would be something I would really enjoy. She was right. I couldn't put the book down. It is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. Salinger's masterpiece follows the misadventures of 16 year old Holden Caulfield. The book follows Holden on a three day journey through New York. He shares his cynical and often negitive views on life,family and &quot;so-called&quot; friends. He finds faults in almost everyone he talks about.If they aren't Phony they are boring. At one point, you realize that he's just as phony as everyone else.There are points where you feel for Holden and other times you hate him. The brilliance of the book is not the plot. obviously there hardly is one. But it doesn't matter. What makes this book work is it's study of the human condition. Salinger has really hit the nail on the head with this timeless classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having read the other attempts at reviewing this book, I have come to the conclusion that if a book is thought to have no plot then it is not worth reading. Unfortunately, I read books for pleasure, to fill those small amounts of space inbetween busy schedules and to escape from the harsh reality of the present day and plot or no plot, I enjoy the damn things! If you, like I did when I first read Catcher, are in the mood for an escape into the mind of Holden Caulfield, and adolecent hero who you'll never forget or fancy a trip around New York just for the shear hell of it, then buy this book. In my opinion, this book bleeds nothing but the pure genius of Salinger and defines the escapist's handbook. Go for it, this book is fantastic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book could not have had a more boring plot. What is so important about everyday life, hey it happens to every one. So why fill 200 pages on it. It is though okayly written and has some meaning . But it is going to happen to everyone. -Coleman Potter-"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had heard many things about this book growing up but I never read it until at the University Of Tennessee. My english professor told how at the age of 18, he married, dropped out of school and had a miserable life. He hated English and had never read a book in his life. One day while house sitting for a friend, he saw &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; sitting on the coffee table. He read it from cover to cover and it changed his life. He went back to high school, finished college and received a PHd. When I heard this story I decided I finally had to read this book. What an awesome book it was! It relates to kids in 1952 or 2002. What a story! I have read it 3 or 4 times since then... The last time I called UT to check on the prof, I was told he died of a massive heart attack. Dr. Sekula, wherever you are, thanks for the book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was advised to read Catcher in the Rye after I got hooked on the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. Its a brilliant book, and it gets better each time you read it. Ok, so it babbles sometimes, but that just lets you into Holdens character even better. I think its a fantasic book. Pros' its a great book and theres maybe some Holden in all of us. Cons' Where do the ducks go in the winter? Hmmmmmm?Anyone who could only give this book 2 stars is obviously not mature enough to appreicate such classic writing... go on, read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was great! I hardly ever read and i was glued to the book!! It really related to teenagers and he wrote the i think!!!Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Oh my god, this book is soo great!! I'm 15 and I can really relate to Holden, the way he uses cynicism to shield away phonies, and lies to make more realistic people come closer. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that I need more!! More Holden, more little stories about how he almost necked with Jane, more views on life from a maturing boy wearing his &quot;people killing hat&quot;. I just love this story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am aware that there are a lot of readers out there that believe this to be a classic book. You would think after reading such a 'classic book', I would be forced to give a perfect review, but instead, I am going to be honest in my review, just as I always am. For starters, let me say that this book has a storyline, but no actual plot. The title of the book, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, would make one think that this is the story about some off-the-wall kid and his baseball story, but instead, it was about an off-the-wall kid and his depressed outlook on life. I will admit that there were parts of this book that caught my interest, but there were not many. By the time I got near the end of the book, I was glad it was so short, because I could hardly tolerate reading it anymore. The main character and narrator, Holden Caulfield, kept speaking in such simple-minded terms that got frustrating very quickly. I hate when people repeat themselves twice in one sentence, that's what I hate, when people repeat themselves twice in one sentence. I also dislike it when a narrator uses the same word over and over again in the same paragraph that you get annoyed when you see the word. In this case, that particular word was a cuss word. I am not saying cuss words in books bother me, it is just irritating to see it used so often that you actually find yourself being insulted by it. Out of this entire book, the only part of it that I think I really enjoyed was Holden's little sister, Phoebe. Perhaps if the book were about her, it would have been better (in my opinion). Overall, I almost gave this book 3 stars for being a 'classic', but then I came to my senses and decided to be fair. This book deserves 2 stars. J.D. Salinger is a nice author, but this was a boring title."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is about a boy who flunks out of school and doesn't know what to do. I personally enjoyed this book. This book gives power to the reader to imagine a life of a 17 year old boy. The boy drops out of school and goes on from there. If you would want to know what the rest of the book is about, either buy the book from amazon.com or borrow it from your school or public library. But I must warn you that this book uses false language."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a teenager the same age as Holden is, Salinger truely knows what teens face, no matter what century we are in or how much people think being a teenager has changed. he really knows how to grab the audience and hold on to them with a tight grip until the very end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i am ugly and stupi"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remembered how much I enjoyed this book when I read it 60 years ago. At this reading, though, I found that I grew tired of Caulfield's spoiled immaturity. I am less able to put up with his antics. Salinger's writing is still terrific, however."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading this book I understand that it has been consdidered as one of the greatest books of all time.The story is bascially about a young troubled boy named Holden Caufield. He is angry at the world while he is trying to deal with the death of his brother.When he begins the story he had just gotten kicked out of the school for the third time. He gets so angry with his roomates or as he calls them phonies.I believe that the theme of the story is to not runaway from your problems but face them.The best thing about this book is how the author wrote it. Instead of writing the normal way, he writes what he thinks.I totally recommened this book. I love this book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked this book as a kid. When I read some libraries wouldnt carry it, I bought some and sent them to youth centers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought this copy as a gift. Both the recipient and I have already read and loved this book, but this new format makes a wonderful \\"keeper\\" copy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like millions of other people, this book was required reading in one of my high school language arts classes. As well it should be and as well it should remain. Holden Caulfield is a teenage boy from a family of privilege that is convinced that everyone in the world is phony. In a cynical and at times bitter story, Salinger manages to capture the essence of teen angst long before it was part of the mainstream culture. There are triumphs and tragedies, but Caulfield manages to maintain his even keel of having a sour opinion of the world.The high part for me is when Caulfield has his encounter with a prostitute named Sunny. He tries to play the sophisticate and yet fails miserably; he gets no action, is robbed and then roughed up. If there is a better literary description of the sexual difficulties encountered by teenage boys, I have yet to have read it.Although the Caulfield character appeared earlier, this complete story was first published in 1951. Yet, despite all of the changes in our society in the half-century since that time, this book still is the best description of teen angst in combination with the feeling of not belonging in society. It should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book. I read it at 16, and have read it again at 52 remembering very little, but did remember it was a great book. Well at my later aged reading it wasn't as shocking as when I was young. I forgot that the story was told in a much different time (like when they had elevator operators) and I had also forgot how localized it was (New York City). What I find remarkable is that the character Holden Caulfield still remains vibrant and meaningful. Why is this? I'm not sure. Maybe that is what makes this such a well read classic. I recognize in both readings the strong realistic style of writing the author uses. As a teenager I struggled with reading, always wanting to read but not being able to concentrate. Well this was one of only three books I read as a teenager (the other two were sports related). At 49 years I had a reading epiphany. Now when reading it I do remember the struggle I had concentrating the first time I read it. Apparently this story appealed so strongly to me as a teen that I was able to finish it. To me that is evidence of a great book. What I appreciate is that without knowledge of all the sophisticated review that this book could be given, that it could still be appealing to what I consider average readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Book reads as a teenager talks. I think I would have loved it when I was in high school but find it rather tedious at age 64."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are disgusted with human behavior, well then so is Holden Caulfield. I read this book after it was recommended to me by a friend in college. I had just finished telling him that THE BELL JAR is my favorite book of all time, and he instantly replied by telling me that if I had enjoyed THE BELL JAR then I would definitley love THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, and love it I did! Although Holden is extremely biased when it comes to judging his environment yet not applying the same standards to himself, his ability to judge people is piercingly insightful and intriguingly accurate. I fell in love with this book and read it in a lil' over 3 hours. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are the type that thinks that this world is a little bit too superficial and \\"phony!!!\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because it is considered a \\"classic\\", but I seriously do not get it. I am giving it 3 stars because it was a quick read, but I do not understand the point. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that it went no where, no real theme. I did not like Holden because of his bad attitude and pessimistic outlook, guess that's why he ends up in a psychiatric institution. Only when I read some online reviews and explanations of the book could I see where there was some symbolism Salinger was possibly using."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't like the standard description of this novel as a \\"coming of age\\" story because overall the main character never grew. Because it is written from the perspective of the main character whose thoughts are scattered, it takes most of the book before the reader can really figure him out. Everyone will have an ah-ha moment when you realize it, which makes it feel like the character has changed, even though he hasn't.Holden, the main character, views himself in one light. He aspires to be a savior or at least lead a life that preserves some kind of innocence or humanity in the world. However he's reached a point in his life where he realizes no one around him has these qualities. Every adult or peer is a \\"phony\\" in one way or another, and only children still have that innocence.The other characters in the book view him in a different light. Since it is told from Holden's point of view you immediately take his side in the matter, and believe that the world is exactly how he percieves it. It takes a while for this to click, but you eventually start to piece together the clues the author gives that Holden is very emotional and doesn't interact well in society.I think what made this book a unique and classic was the taboo subject matter of the time; depression, sex, swearing. That it was written from the point of view of the \\"crazy one\\", and as the reader you are sympathetic and understand him. Something I'm sure teachers and parents of the 50's really didn't want. For these reasons it reminds me a lot of the book \\"Girl Interrupted\\" by Susanna Kayson which shares a lot of the same themes.I'd recommend this book, but it takes some patience. The point is not the story he tells and you may find yourself waiting for something to happen. But the real point is figuring out his character and how you relate to him. Is he really crazy? Or does he just have real hope that is constantly devastated by the world around him?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Pretty good book-and very easy to read. This is not your typical &quot;classic&quot; book. It's funny and very real-life. It's life from a teen's perspective and it has spunk."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"read it yourself, i had to read it but i'm glad i did. i'm currently reading the rest of his books for my own pleasure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am currently in 9th grade, and I was required to read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for my English class. At first, the book didn't strike me as a classic the way the reviews suggested, but to prepare for an in-class discussion, I went back and plowed through it again, this time finding my alterego in Holden.&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; presents a realistic view of our world, plain and simple. It speaks the mind of someone who can think and do for himself rather than simply conforming to the senseless do's and don'ts of society. Holden may appear as a spoiled brat, but that is the art of Salinger's writing. He puts bigger issues into the content of everyday situations, and in order to appreciate it, one has to approach this with an open mind and the ability to look beyond details for the bigger picture.There are some people who think that the language is too vulgar, and that this book should be banned from children's bookshelves. All I have to say is, Holden's language is all sugar compared to what kids learn from watching MTV, and if you can't handle a few &quot;goddamn&quot;s then don't read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is the character in literature who helps others understand the process of bidungsroman. Some may argue that Holden is infantile and even vulgar, however I argue that he matured into a young man who wanted to protect children and preserve innocence. His constant scratching off obscenties is evident of this. I am in college now and majoring to be a secondary English educator, I indeed plan on teaching &quot;Catcher&quot;. It is a must read about the adversaries we all face in growing up_alienation, conformity, struggle for individualism, and adaptation of change."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Every teenager should read this book.

It is only banned because of the uttter truth it tells of the life of an adolescant. It carries you through love and laughter with Holden as well as all of his sadness, and the problems he must face.

I LOVED it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved reading &quot;The Catcher in The Rye&quot;. This held my attention from start to finish. You learn to love Holden, and identify with him. I'm a teenager and I can relate to his feelings, because most teenagers feel the same way. The thing that really perplexes me, is the people who have no use for this book, and want to ban it. WHY? You don't ban the truth! I would love to know of any books that are similar to this.

It seemed like it was written for shock value more than telling a story. The story goes all over the place and it isn't until the end that the author states a good story can be one in which the storyteller digresses. So in that respect, I thought about it for a while then decided to go for a middle-of-the-road rating. Otherwise, as I was reading through this book I thought it was pretty worthless.

I had one of those beatnik teachers who wanted to find the hidden meanings in this worthless waste of time. We were searching in a dark room for a black cat that wasn't there. There are no hidden meanings in this book, nor are there any sort of points or end destination.

Overall, this was a great read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After hearing about it for so long, on vacation, I finally got around to tackling J.D Salinger's classic. And just like the protagonist himself - I dont even know what the hell to think about the goddamn book. I really don't.As Holden begins his tale, apparently from a hospital of some sort, he takes us back to the recent past where he is struggling in every possible way as a high school student at Percy Prep ( A high - end sleep away school in Agerstown PA.) From there, the book is just one long Goddamn story Holden conveys to us, which includes encounters with teachers, peers, and other random people as he gets kicked out of Percy and returs to his home town: New Yory City.As I am reading about Holdens escapades, I start to feel as if I know him... well. Holden's story is shared with us - the readers - in a very conversationsl style; as If Holden and I were sitting in a coffee shop somewhere and he was simply filling me in on the last 12 months of his life. And I find myself relating to his story in two distinct ways:First, it is obvious that he is in that akward stage that occurs somewhere between childhood and adulthood - terribly frusturated with everyone and everything, struggling to make sense of all that is happening around him. I too suffered through that stage and probobly would have connected with the charachter on an even deeper level had I read the classic back then.Second, I am appreciating the descriptive and revealing sights and sounds of New York City, having been raised in Queens, spending much time in NYC growing up.As this fairly ammusing story prgresses, I find myself \\" rooting for Holden\\" - hoping that at the end he will become \\"enlightened\\", turn a corner, get his act together.Ultiamtely, I find myself wanting more - wanting to know how my friend Holden turns out. But for better or worse, as this ammusing tale winds down, the future and fate of Holden Caulfield is left to the imagination of the reader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in my freshman year because I heard it was good...\\"Good\\" is a BIG understatement!!!!! this book is the absolute BEST book that has ever been written (save the Bible haha)!

The protagonist is a misfit, is at the brink of his adulthood, senses he is about to lose something unique as he leaves his childhood world for good but is not sure what and flails wildly in his attempt to grasp what life is about. I started off disliking the book: the language, the events happening to him, his reactions to those events. But before I reached half-way through the book, I felt sorry for the boy, who came across as sensitive and scared. Three-quarter of the book, I worried for him and wondered if there's light at the end of his tunnel. By the time I finished reading the book, I thought it a tale told by an idiot, full of sound of fury. Of course it does not compare with Macbeth or Hamlet, but it is none the less a tragically realistic story, touchingly told by an honest and eloquent idiot. (It does remind me of Mark Haddon's THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME, except the ailment here is depression and not autism. So if you like THE CURIOUS INCIDENT, you will probably like THE CATCHER.)I think it is a good story told by a good story-teller. It is both a period piece and timeless: Deciphering the American slangs in vogue during that time period has slowed down my reading quite a bit, yet the story is one that can, and probably does, happen in any country through out history. It is an interesting read only if the reader will not be depressed by narratives from a troubled mind."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The novel The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger is a powerful novel chronicling the life of an upper class teenage boy, Holden Caulfield during the early 1950's. Around this time, more and more people were conforming to society, dressing the same, acting the same, and through Holden, Salinger challenges those ideals. The book opens when Holden is expelled from yet another boarding school, because of his awful grades. He finds the world around him to be fake, and those people who demand him to conform to be phonies, not true to themselves. He sets off for New York City on his own, in a journey of self-exploration where he learns about love, life, and sex. As a troubled youth, he is a constant pessimist about the world around him, seeing it to be a mass conformist nation, without any true individuals, except for himself of course. His early life is troubled, and his younger brother's death shook him badly, and effected him deeply. Some of the pessimism comes from his older brother, a writer who in Holden's opinion became a prostitute for Hollywood, abandoning his own writing to work for the movies, selling out in the worst way.His parents seem vastly absent in the novel, perhaps suggesting that his parents are not role models for him, and while they may love him, they do not truly understand him. Without this adult guidance he mistrusts the adult world, a cynical view which pervades the whole book. This kind of teenage rebellion is something that the youth of today can easily relate to. Holden himself is an easily relatable character, and modern teens will find something of his character similar in themselves, whether that's his cynicism, or his constant thoughts about sex. He is confused by sex, but still finds it intriguing, and of course wants very badly to experience it. He goes on a date, with an old friend, and while he tries very badly to be charming, he cannot stand how absolutely fake he feels she is, and this leaves him disappointed with the world in general. In the end, he finds that while the world disappoints him, there is still good in it, and while he wanted very much to be away from people when he was with them he wanted them back once he had to live without them. This poignant tale of an adolescent growing up on his own in a world he despises is a must-read, one that can change one's views on the world, and on life. It teaches the importance of individuality, a love of beauty in all it's forms, and of one youth's perception of the world around us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this book was good. i liked the plot and the main characters.

Yes, many of Holden's observations are specific to adolescence -- but many of his problems dealing with society are universal. I often find myself stuck between doing what &quot;polite society&quot; requires, and what I'd just rather do myself. Also, anyone who thinks Holden is a &quot;bad person&quot; is way off base.

He's frustrated that he can't fix the problems in the world. These are what all who've read this book should've seen. Salinger deals with a lot of symbols in his books.

Salinger. Like everyone else, I had heard immense praise for the book, and was expecting an American classic such as To Kill a Mockingbird. I was extremely disappointed. I would venture as far to say that it is one of the worst books I've ever read. For starters, there is no plot. The book is just a haphazard collection of stories that are mostly insignificant and confusing. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Holden just kept wandering and doing the same thing over and over. Another point, the book is ridiculously and unnecessarily repetitive to the point that I wanted to rip the book to shreds. Every time I read the word \\"phony\\", \\"madman\\", \\"crazy\\", or the like made me angrier and kept me wanting to get the book over with. Also, the way Holden talks about \\"giving old Jane Gallagher a buzz\\" (and then never doing it) about 100 times adds to the frustration (he calls almost everyone \\"old\\"...). I do see the meaning behind this book, and the symbols, but that does not make up for a poorly written, boring book. The use of language, the endless repetition, and the lack of plot truly disappointed me. In my opinion, this book is not worth a read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was Caulfield's age when I read this (about a year and a half ago), and teachers and peers have classified me as a bitter, negative, cynical adolescent since the age of fourteen. For these reasons, I thought that a more recent perspective on this book might be worthwhile, that is, if anyone even notices this review amongst the eight hundred starry-eyed gushes that have already been posted on this page. I don't doubt for an instant that I would have been thrilled by this book in 1951, but in more modern times, I feel that the non-conformity issues are too simple for anyone who has done any more than dabbling in independent thinking. My intense negative reaction to the Catcher in the Rye was formed more by my observation of the degree to which the book is worshipped and revered, rather than the unremarkable content of the book itself. People who wish to be classified as &quot;free thinkers&quot; for the sake of social status swoon over this book in an embarrassing, lemming-like manner. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is intensely irritating, and his constant use of stupid phrases and interjections made me want to crack his head open like a ripe melon. Since the book is written from his perspective, all hopes for a satisfying narrative are in vain. On the positive side, this book is very simple and short, and one can get through it quickly and painlessly in a few hours. The same cannot be said for much of the insufferable trash which oozes its way onto the required reading lists of high schools across the nation. My condolences to those of you who consider this book your life's inspiration."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I cannot fathom why anyone became famous, or wealthy, for writing this material... \\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" is one long, rambling, goofy, repetitive in the *extreme* diatribe...presented as an ode to Borderline Personality Disorder. It's like page after page after page...of absolutely nothing. And at the end of it all, there is no pay off. There is no conclusion to the story. Don't hope for one; it is not there.Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of school (again), but he doesn't do anything amazing with his time, except wander around for a weekend. He gets drunk, but he never really has much fun doing it. He picks up with a prostitute, but he gets no action. His creepy room mate dates his childhood friend, but nothing whatsoever comes of that either. His teacher cops a feel on him in the middle of the night, but the one he gets is really pretty silly to read about. He gets slapped around some, but never gets the stuffing knocked out of him, nor any sense knocked in. He gets sick toward the end, but he's not suffering from anything major. And after 200 pages of terror over what his parents will think, you never actually hear what they have to say. All the reader knows is, Holden's intelligence is upstaged by a 10 year old. Worst of all, after all of this whining & carrying on... Holden doesn't come to any important new realizations about life, himself, or anyone else.The realization I came to on the final page, is that just because a piece of writing is referred to as \\"a classic\\", that does not mean it is particularly well written, or profoundly meaningful. J.D. Salinger wrote a relatively small collection of fiction, \\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" was his most \\"outstanding\\" writing, it was the hallmark of his life's work, it became famous for some vague reason, & yet... It says nothing. I don't know how it inspired 3 infamous stalker-killers to carry it around with them, when they went off to do their deeds... Personally, I would be embarrassed to have this book found on me at the scene of a crime. I'd probably lie, & say it was the victim's...So I researched this book & its author online, hoping to find some redeeming quality, some critically important point, or theme I must have missed. My first realization was the possibility that perhaps Holden Caulfield didn't accrue any hard won life wisdom on his 3 day lost weekend, because the author himself didn't live his life any wiser, in regards to the people around him. I also discovered that the book's primary cultural value is \\"a liturgy to teenage angst\\". But there are far better ones out there... If you're looking for this in literature, \\"Ask Alice\\" is much more significant work, & it gets far more accomplished as a piece of writing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for required reading sophmore year. (In Salinger's defense, one thing which affected my enjoyment was a terrible English teacher...) but still, while I found its voice was excellent and its assessment of teenage life interesting, I really wonder how many of us have thoughts and experiences like Holden's. Most of us are functioning teenagers, not psychiatric cases like Holden- indeed, the book seems to drift from scene to scene of abandonment and depression. I feel sorry for Caulfield, but I have enough problems in my life to deal with, let alone those from a neurotic fictional character. It's more than a body can take!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a masterful insight on Salinger's part into the peculiarities of the human mind.

I am going to be a freshman in college, and so for me, this book really dealt with a lot of issues I am pondering.

Also, I really liked reading about Holden's thoughts of not knowing what he wanted to do and not understanding the point of silly classes in school. The book really related to me, and while I do know a few people that didn't enjoy it, I think that in most cases, this is a book that will be cherished and remembered."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story and characters are real to life with the problems of teenagers, but Holden (the main character) seems to complain a little too much.

The book is not about phony hero types (go to Danielle Steele for those). Hero books are a dime a dozen. Its about feeling alienated, alone, confused and many other adolescent experiences. Most of all, its about a boy's search for meaning in his life. The reason this book sells so well is that it represents more realistic experiences of an adolescent boy's life rather than idealistic ones."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Even though this book isn't exactly recent, it still is a valid written expression of many teenagers' mood. I read the book last winter and, when I read it, I could feel like Holden. I realised that my thoughts and my way of thinking was pretty similar to Holden's. I could understand his rebellion and almost agree with it. I felt like him very much.I think &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is an aethernal book. Every teenager, no matter if it'll be in 200 years time, will identify himself with Holden Caulfield. If you're an adolescent and you read that book, as I did, it's like you are reading your diary.That's the way it is. Every one of us, at some point in life, will find himself thinking like Holden.

It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant &quot;I know everything&quot; attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and &quot;don't give a damn&quot; attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic. Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, &quot;what the hell is this kid thinking?&quot; Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers! Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, Alien Rapture. I highly endorse buying this book. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's no use people reading this book to try and get an insight into why Chapman killed John Lennon.This was just the book Chapman was reading at the time despite the conspiracy theory. The day before he had finished Alice in Wonderland.

But from reading the reviews below, I think people are missing something. Holden is a very troubled boy. I think it is rather obvious that he has some psychological disorders (depression for one, maybe a few others). And as someone who has experienced a few of those breakdowns, I can tell you that a lot of what Holden feels is a lot of what I felt. Sure there is teen angst involved in this story, and I'm sure it is an excellent social commentary, but what strikes me most about Salinger's story is how accurately it portrays the thoughts of a person with depression. If you really want to understand how a person with depression or anti-socail tendencies feels, read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having just read this book within the last month or so, I am still asking myself if I really understand the content of it. I do realize, however, that I can relate to the 16-year-old Holden Caulfield. Being only a year younger than H.C. we have many similarities. The most imortant one that continues to remind myself of Holden's emotional problems, is that I also lost a sister to cancer. Although, the one major difference between us, is that I was treated for my depression soon before Holden's was. Of course technology of such situations have improved, therefore, allowing myself to not make many of the mistakes H.C. made. Including those relating to school, friendships, family,etc. Many do not understand the emotional effect a death can have on a person, which can very often turn to depression and nervous collapses. Until one can, shall I ask, WILL you really understand The Catcher in the Rye?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really recommend this book to everyone. After you ready it you won't see things in the same way"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a junior in high school, and I have just finished reading this book on which I have to write a paper. I decided to see what other people thought to get a jump start on my thoughts. And what I found was that from all the people that posted I tended to agree in some way with most of them. I agree that it is a book of teen angst and grief, but one important part is that Holden's own phoniness. Another reviewer gave this book a 1 because he believed that Holden's phoniness was bad. But I believe that it is true to many aspects of the teenage spirit. Holden hated &quot;phonies&quot; but more than once was a &quot;phony&quot; himself. And I often see this own fact in myself and others. Even before I read this book I hated people who protect others from the truth and were phony, yet I protected people from the truth and was a phony as well. &quot;Catcher&quot; also reinforced my idea that private schools are bad. Where everyone is &quot;phony&quot; in private schools to the same degree, it is different in public schools. Each person has their own degrees of phoniness; some people are &quot;super-phonies,&quot; while others could be called &quot;phony minimalists.&quot; Wiht all these levels of &quot;phoniness&quot; Holden possibly could have found his niche.

I'm not sure I enjoyed it, but certain pieces of it stuck with me throughout the years. I reread it yesterday, and wondered (until looking at some of the online reviews by teenagers)why they assign this book to youngsters. While certain elements make an impact, the essence of the book is almost wasted on the young, and, if they don't like it, they won't return to it. In any case, I was amazed by this book. The consistency of Holden's voice, the contemporariness of it (except for the $4000 jaguar and a few other things, it could have been written now), the angst of a depressed adolescent. Holden's language shows his depression and, because of it, his skewed thinking. It is clear that the loss of his younger brother years before had a tremendous impact on him, and continues to affect his relationships. He is not the most likeable of characters, and I don't think he would be even if he were no longer depressed, but he captures the confusion and feelings of an adolescent beautifully. I found myself thinking about many aspects of this book upon awakening this morning, among them, is this autobiographical?Melissa Lenihan"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read &quot;Catcher&quot; in 1984 since it was required reading for my high school English Comp class. The day we submitted our essays on this book, our teacher asked if we enjoyed the book. Oddly enough, I was the only one to raise my hand. Out of a class of 35 students, I was alone in my appreciation of this book! How could this be? I was still in shock when my teacher, Mr. Ellis, asked why I liked the book. I shyly responded, &quot;I don't know, just did.&quot; One thing I would change, if given the opportunity to go back in time, would be to properly respond to his inquiry. I regret not having the nerve to share my appreciation and rail against them for missing the point of the story: a teenager's menatal emotional collapse as he trys to come to grips with his purpose in life. Unfortunately, I come from a generation that grew up with John Hughes movies...Over the years I have read &quot;Catcher&quot; many more times and still enjoy it as much as I did back then. Thank you Mr. Ellis."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old teenager in New York City, talks about his 1-day stay in the Big Apple. Being as young as he was, most of us that read the book in our high school would relate it to ourselves. Out of all the shenanigans he gets into, he decides to question his life goals, and is very nervous, upset, and disappointed that he does not enjoy having a free life, mostly because he isn't preparing for it. The author uses text-life connections in this novel, hoping that the actions, decisions, and how things lay out will relate to a younger audience. It did too. Most of the teens here, including me, were interested in reading this because it was a mirror of our lives, through a book, and through someone else's tale."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye ReviewThe Title of the book is \\" The Catcher in the Rye\\". The author that wrote the book is J.D. Salinger. The story is taken place in New York City.I don't think that this book had an intended purpose. Unless the purpose was to make you feel sad. Nothing stood out to me. I thought that this book was pointless. It was about a kid that went around doing stuff. Usually bad stuff. This kid was emo. He hated everything in the world.The characters in the book are Holden, Phoebe, Stradlater, Ackley and Holden's parents. There is some other little characters like the nuns, the pimp, and the prostitute.Holden, the main character, swears in almost every sentence. Here is a quote from the book when Holden and Stradlater are fighting. \\"You don't even know if her name is Jane or Jean, ya goddame moron\\"(Page 44). Holden is very upset through the whole book. Holden likes to pick fights with people. In that part of the book Stradlater told Holden to be shut up, but Holden wouldn't do it. When his sister phoebe asks him what he likes, Holden couldn't think of anything that he liked.In the book, Holden uses very cheese sayings. For example, \\"That kills me.\\" In the book, the characters swear too much. It is a very depressing book.I think that J.D. Salinger was very troubled when he wrote this book. Maybe depressed, or something else, I don't know.My teacher told me that this book is famous. She also told me that the book was banned for some reason, and nobody knows why. You couldn't get it in stores or in the library. But when you could get it people wanted to read it. I think the only reason that people wanted to read this book was because it was banned and you couldn't get it.I really don't know what people would want to read this book. Maybe it's your characteristics that want to read this book. Or you might have some problems, I don't know. The only reason I read this book is because I had to, and I didn't find this book interesting at all. Other people might think differently, don't let this review stop you from not reading this book. I probably don't even know what I'm talking about. I just didn't like the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those great books that can be read again and again. Salinger brilliantly captures the thoughts and feelings of an alienated teenager in a way that is fresh and moving to a modern audience.Like the Lord of the Flies, this book can be appreciated by teenagers and adults alike, which is no doubt why it has been a popular book to study in schools.This book (and author) have taken on a legendary status. In this instance the status is well deserved."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In discussing this book with a group that read it recently, I thought it was interesting to hear the different responses people had to the main character, Holden Caulfield. Roughly, the people I've encountered seem to put him into three categories: (1) the 'rebel with a lot of teen angst' category; (2) the 'annoying complainer' category; or (3) the 'funny and honest and extremely likable' category. Personally, I put him in primarily in the third category. To me, Holden Caulfield is a sensitive kid who's struggling to deal with the death of his brother while at the same time undergoing the confusing transition between childhood and adulthood. And all the while he's making honest observations that are often hilarious, depressing, or both. Granted, he probably fits into all three categories in one way or another, and on the exterior he definitely has a \\"who cares?\\" attitude. But underneath it all I think he's motivated more by grief than by angst: he literally aches to connect with others, and he treasures the few moments when real connection becomes possible. Just look at the way he ends his story: \\"About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradleter and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss Maurice. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.\\" It's little glimpses like these that make Holden Caulfield one of my all-time favorite fictional characters. Great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is a story of an underachieving young man's coming of age after he is kicked out of a private school in Pennsylvania. The story's setting changes from Pennsylvania to New York in the mid 1940's, although Salinger doesn't focus on the setting as much as the main character, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a peculiar young man trying to find his place in life. He is extremely judgmental and over-analytical to almost everyone, and everything that he runs into. As soon as he meets someone, he automatically passes judgment on them. Although all of us do this to a certain extent, Salinger has him ramble on for pages and pages about seemingly pointless subjects. He does this to such an extreme it almost becomes funny. Holden often refers to people as \\"phony\\". Usually these people are conventional, average people, who conform to the boundaries of society, something that escapes him. Holden is not at all an average boy, and he seems to be disturbed in his mind, and has serious trouble following any rules, or being like anyone he thinks to be phony. He is afraid of growing up, and just being another boring adult. Holden seems to be hyper-sensitive to the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him, and within himself, making him an extremely disturbed and depressed person. I kind of feel sorry for the kid, he just cant seem to find his place in the world, even though he has failed out of four different high schools, he hasn't really found a place where he feels like he belongs.Salinger uses a very realistic writing style in Catcher in the Rye. Most of the vocabulary he uses is very typical of a 16 year old boy, using a lot of profanity and making you really feel like you are in the midst of young people having very genuine discussions. This drew me into the story, really painting a picture in my mind, and helped me relate to the characters. Reading Salinger's writing can get a bit aggravating though. Reading Holden ramble on a baseball mitt for three pages can get irritating, but when you finish the book, you realize those long lectures really meant something.Overall, I think that Catcher is a great read, and in the end, you really start to feel sorry for Holden. Catcher isn't your average novel, because it really has no ending. But it really makes you think about this young man's method of thinking and if he is crazy or just opens his eyes wider than the rest of us. I can see why this book is a great American novel, soI recommend it for anyone looking for a good laugh and a different perspective on the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a non-conformist kid growing-up hating everything and everyone that is \\"phony\\" in his life except for childhood memories and things representing that age of innocence such as his younger sister Phoebe. . He is very insecure with his emotions and with others getting close to him emotionally. His typical boyhood sex-drive is displayed while talking about the other boys at Pency and their sexual exploits but uneasiness with taking the step into sexual activity is displayed by his insecurity with girls such as the prostitute sonny when he travels to New York. When he is expelled from Pency Prep school for boys for not applying himself in school he starts a journey to New York City that tests his psyche of not wanting to grow up and become an adult. Holden makes attempts at going into the adult world but doesn't give into his sexual urges based on his insecurities with entering the adult world and uncertainty with leaving childhood his innocence. This novel is a basic coming of age story and should be read by anyone looking for a light reading novel with a deeper meaning."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I cant believe this book has so many low reviews in here.

When i started Catcher And The Rye, i was immediatly captivated by Holden and his cynical view of the world and its inhabitents. Holden, a boy fighting to hold on to his innocence, is the perfect anti-hero. You don't want to like this 17 year old punk who runs away from his bording school, is afraid to call the girl he loves, and is quick to pass unfair judgements, but you will.The greatest metaphore in the entire book is of corse Holden's misenterpretation of a line from a poem, \\"when a body meet a body fallen throught the rye,\\" which Holden takes to say, \\"when a body catch a body fallen through the rye.\\" For Holden, his greatest asperation would be to be able to catch these bodies, these children, as they fall over the edge of the rye before they land smackdab in the middle of adult hood. Holden dream of protecting the innocence that, at one point in our lives, leaves us all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My school is very much like Pency Prep. For 8th grade we were to read The Catcher in the Rye. It was one of the few books I've ever read that I could just think \\"Yeah, that's IT!\\" every time I turned a page. Holden Caulfield is the youth that society doesn't want to show: A cynical, depressed, and observant young man who holds a different opinion on what humanity really is. Though I could easily agree with him on his views (\\"Certain things should stay the way they are.\\"), he contradicts himself throughout the book. He's confused and imperfect. Most of us have a Holden Caulfield experience at least once in our lives, when we question morals and decency, and no one else but Salinger could capture our uncertainty this well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The best novels are those that wound us deeply, which causes us to think afresh about ourselves and the lives we lead.Catcher in the Rye is one of these books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is great...

Salinger has written the personality and language of an animal few humans try to know, the seventeen year old human male. This was reality in its greatest show, a masterpiece by all means. I hated it. I was supposed to hate it because I'm a female, middle aged woman with high propriety. Sure, the language in the book bothered me; it was supposed to. But I saw that its intent was to explain a boy with a tough facade. Later in the book, on page 157, the facade melts when the boy recalls the happy days of childhood and going to the Museum of Natural History with Phoebe. The &quot;damns&quot; almost disappear. As far as censorship, it would be a terrible shame if this book were to be censored. No other book that I know has ever captured the tone, vernacular, and character of the most vulnerable person of our modern society, the 17 year old boy.

You are not supposed to enjoy reading the catcher in the rye - it is a depressing book. It deals with those truths about life that in adulthood we are forced to sideline as we to are drawn into the comercialized, dishonest &quot;real&quot; world. Why else did Salinger become a recluse?! Of course the most important part of the book is when Holdens teacher tells him that he is not alone and that others have been through the same as him (shame I haven't met them yet); this demonstrates perfectly the part of the book I find is most misunderstood. It is not a &quot;coming of age&quot; story at all, the teacher is saying hold on to your beliefs - &quot;you are right&quot;. All these other people who &quot;wrote down&quot; there Holden like experiences could not have been children now could they. Salinger is saying he is on of them too and he is not a teenager.

However realistic Holden Caulfield might be, he is a thoroughly unpleasant spoiled brat who I was very tired of by the time the book petered out.Sure, some people (especially teens) might be able to identify with some of the confusion, awkwardness, fear of the future, longing for the past, and hatred of \\"phonies\\" expressed by Holden, but he is so lacking in any positive traits (other than a fondness for his siblings) that I had absolutely no sympathy for him. His way of speaking reminds me of Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" but unlike \\"Catcher\\" that book has some interesting moral/ethical dilemmas. I think this book is just a pointless whine-fest of self-destruction no matter how well-written it is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This lousy book written by some hot shot J.D.

I have read some of the reviews and I think they are giving Salenger way to much credit. This is a book where the adults are dumb and the only smart one is the kid sister. My guess is Salinger had a issue with authority figures all his life and let it all out in this book. I can say that I have read it so I can at least discuss it with others but I got no insite into my life from it and neither did Holden by the way. There is lots of cussing for no really good reason in the book. If you took all that out, the story would be the same but it would be much more readable to a larger audiance.Holden has some real mental issues going but I don't think society is the cause as my guess Salinger would like us to think. I do think society will be shown as the cause if they ever make a movie or Holden will be shown as some misguided saint.

The setting of the book is that it takes place in Pa at the school that he is at, and he is flunking out of it too. But after he gets kick out he goes back to New York to go back to his parents. But he does not go back just yet because his parents do not know that he was kicked out. On his way back he stop in on some of his friends to see and talk to. After that he goes and visits his little sister and takes her out to eat. A couple of day later he sneaks into his sisters room in the middle of the night to talk to her. They have a big long talk about how he flunked out of school and when he is coming home. Then he finally comes home and his parents are not really mad at his.Holden is a different kind of character that does not make much sense at first, but later in the book you find out the truth about him, and why he is so messed up. I think that he is like a guy that does not get a lot of attention or just does not want to be around a lot of people, but later in the book you find out that he loves to be around young kids. He likes to drink a lot but most of the time he can't because he is only 16 and people won't give him his drink.

Reading this book now in the wake of John Hinkley, Mark Chapman, and the Columbine teens, I searched for insight on why this book appeals to asocial young men. Now I know why.I really enjoyed this novel and I feel it is an important book to read and discuss. This novel is more than just a glimpse of teen angst. It's a look into the alienation, depression, and delusions of an outsider. The funny thing is that Holden has the potential and opportunity to be accepted but his choices and actions keep him back.

It is one of the greatest books I have ever read, if not the greatest. Anyone who enjoys reading, should read this book. Anyone who has ever argued with their parents, should read this book. Anyone who can read, should read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's _The Catcher in the Rye_ is a story about a disillusioned teenager named Holden Caulfield and his subsequent two-day visit to New York and the things he encounters there after being expelled from his prep school.Holden Caulfield is a perceptive, sarcastic, intelligent personality who has resonated with readers everywhere. He makes critical, and often times humorous, observations of the adult world. He is able to see through all the &quot;phoniness&quot; and &quot;crap&quot; he encounters in New York's underbelly of bars and night clubs. But, at the same time, he struggles with his own burgeoning sexuality and loss of innocence as he makes his way closer to adulthood.Holden tells his younger sister Phoebe that he wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; Holden wants to be the one who stands at the edge of the cliff and save children from falling off. Holden's standing at the edge of the cliff represents his adolescent stage in life and his nearness to becoming an adult himself. He is in that angst-filled in-between stage in which he is still searching for an identity. The bottom of the cliff represents adulthood and the &quot;phoniness,&quot; insincerity, moral corruption, and ridiculousness that is synonmous with it. Holden wants to save children from plunging into that adultworld where a child can inevitably lose his innocence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Ever since I was really young, I have been hearing about the &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;, and what an amazing piece of work it was, how it was going to live forever,how it deserved every prize possible, ect. And when I saw in on my eighth grade reading list, I thought, well, why not? I should read it. Fall in love, as everyone told me I would. Well. So I read it. And while &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is a good book, and a really good book, I must say, I have read better. It really isn't the one of the worlds Wonders, believe it or not.Holden is a cynecal guy, charming, nice, open, honest, sweet and funny, a rebal at time, way critcal, and pretty much a liar. And in the book he mentions what phonies everyone are. Yet, he, at times, was phony too. Since I read the book a long while ago it's pretty hard to remember, but let's try. Holden lies at every chance he gets, calls up girls he says he hates, becuase he used to make out with them and that's whathe fells like doing at the time,judges people by how their suitcases look and cost,wants to marry a girl cause she's pretty. But Holden? Phony? Never!Still, you can relate to him. Holden doesn't feel like he belongs, and everyone feels like that sometimes. He feels everyone is phony, and a lot of people think that, too. He feels the stress of trying to fit in, of homones, school, parents... anyone who ever dreamed of being free, going wherever you want, whever you want, being totaly anoyynimas, (sorry, can't spell that!), can relate to this book. So my point? Read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a journey through the mind of a teenage boy written by J.D. Salinger, one of the most interesting American writers of today. Salinger has shocked readers by exposing the naked emotions of a young man. Salinger's story brings us to the city of New York where the main character, Holden Caulfield, searches him to find truth in life. Salinger attempts to expose the &quot;phonies&quot; of the world and touch confused adolescents. This novel should be regarded as a handbook for all young people who feel they are all alone in their confusion in the world. Readers will either love &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or hate it completely. The young man, Holden, attends prep school to prep school in search of something. He is forever getting kicked out for poor grades that he is all too smart for but, Holden seems to be side tracked with the &quot;phonies&quot; all around him. Holden even tries to help the &quot;phonies,&quot; tries to save them from their fake world. When he gets kicked out of his most recent school he begins to miss the familiar &quot;phonies&quot; in the big city of New York. In New York, Holden discovers himself through the people he meets during his short visit. The author wants his readers to sense Holden's fear and anger. In one of the few interviews he has granted he said &quot;His own childhood was much like that of the boy, Holden Caulfield, in this novel.&quot; Holden's adventure in New York in a symbol of independence. The boy chooses to face the real world, instead of trying to escape it. At one point, Holden says to his sister, &quot; I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all...and I'm standing by on the edge of some crazing cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff.&quot; This passage reveals what the title means. The main character is insightful, full of raw emotions, and truth. Teachers across the country have called this novel filth and unfit for school literature. Jack Gordon, Miami school board member, said of the novel &quot; anyone that calls it 'obscene' has misread it. The book takes you from bars to prostitutes to Holden's dear little sister. Although there is alcohol and other illegal things, the message is not vulgar. It teaches us to fight against the stream of conformity. Holden dreams of escaping the city as he says to himself, &quot; a little cabin somewhere...and live there for the rest of my life...near the woods, but not right in them because I'd want it as sunny as hell all the time.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Rare is the chance to hear someone really speak whatever comes to mind. The blatent honesty of Holden Caufield is what makes this book so interesting. Some people find it offensive, but really, that's what the book is all about. Holden would never not say something just because he's afraid that they would be offended. Just as when Holden says that people who get off topic are more interesting, this is the case. Holden never really has an obvious direction, but it doesn't hurt him because he is being true to who he is. Holden is the ideal person because he is completely honest. This book is for every person in the world because you will question yourself, your morals and your actions. That is so important and for most people it never happens. I recommend reading this as an adult as well as a teenager because if you can relate to it as a kid, you should also relate to it as an adult. Kids are so much more honest with everyone than adults. (that is why Holden can talk to Phoebe so easily). You should still be able to relate to this as an adult. If you can't, look deep inside yourself, because there are tons of ways to relate to this book. I don't want to give away too much of this book, but I have to tell you that you must read it. If you don't start questioning who you are as a person by the end of the book, read it again because there are so many questions that Holden asks himself that apply to all humans. This is definetly something to take seriously. It will really change your outlook."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a 17 year old girl and I thought this book was great. It's written in a way that keeps you interested. I found it to be funny and a bit sarcastic. At first the book doesn't really seem to have a story line but soon you realize that there is more to the character and story than you might have first thought. some people might not see the messages behind the book but even still, its an interesting book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"We all hate having teachers force us to read books in school. This time I am glad they did. Cather In The Rye has to be the single most expressive book I have ever read. The book is put into words that a teen can understand perfectly. Although there are some underlying webs of connections in the book, most everything is simply put into teenage thoughts and language. It deals with every problem and every situation. The book is simply a marvel to be read and enjoyed. You'll either hate it, or love it. As for it trying to be banned, like you don't hear that language anyway. It is a way of expression and without it, the teenage angst character would not have been expressed properly. Read it, you may love it or dispise it, but read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I have recently begun limiting my reading to pretty much only &quot;classic&quot; literature, on any given day I may end up re-reading a selection because I think I'd have a better appreciation for it now than when I had read it last. This was the case with Catcher in the Rye. In fact, despite knowing that I had read this before, I honestly could not remember anything substantial about it. Naturally, I assumed that with all the acclaim that this title carries, the only possible explanation for my not being able to recall any details about it was that it may have been &quot;required reading&quot; at some point in my life and it was understandable that i didn't remember THAT. So, I decided to order it for my collection... Now I know why i couldnt recall its story - it has none! I checked and double checked to be sure i had not accidentally gotten some sort of abridged version. There is no substance here whatsoever. I'd compare it to reading an unedited diary. It took only a few hours to finish and I was shocked when I had reached the end. There wasn't a single event to inspire any emotion at all. If you could have recorded my thoughts (word for word, you wouldn't have had to edit them in the least) for three days of my adolescent life, even somewhat uneventful days, you'd have this book. There is nothing clever here. To sum it up into one adjective: &quot;everyday&quot;. These thoughts are not worth collecting into a novel. I can't believe these other reviews are for the same text. More substance can be absorbed reading a magazine."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What's the big fuss over this book? I was looking for &quot;classics&quot; and I kept hearing people rant and rave over this book, so I figured I should read it and maybe be enlightened or something. No such luck. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait to get to the point of the book, which never seemed to come. It was so incredibly boring that I didn't even finish the book. I was bound and determined to do so, but I was losing my mind, reading this book. I had about enough of hearing Holden repeat himself on each and every topic, and hearing about &quot;phonies&quot;. I could definitely have been better off reading something else. So, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because it is considered a classic. That was the only reason I finished it. I absolutely hated this book. To me it was the whining of an adolescent crybaby, nothing more. I really can't understand how this came to be a \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not sure what I expected with The Catcher in the Rye, but it was a lot more than what I received.Going into the book, I knew little to nothing about the book except that it was a classic and Holden was supposed to be an icon. Maybe it is the fact that I'm 20 years past being a teenager, maybe it is that I got lost in the lingo of the 50s and maybe I just believed the hype too much, but I was severely disappointed. I did not like Holden in any way shape or form. I thought he was a whiner and the biggest phony of the bunch. I had no trouble with the drinking, or smoking or cussing, I just did not like him and can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I disliked this text while I was reading, but I grew to appreciate aspects of it while talking about it with other people once I had completed it. My first thought after finishing this novel was that I did not understand how is has such an iconic status. I think I might have liked the book better if I had not picked it up having heard for years how life changing it was.\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is redundant, irritating, and so introspective at times as to be an unlikable reading experience, but I think that was Salinger's point. The novel's protagonist (Holden Caulfield) is a typical teenage navel gazer who derides everyone else for being part of the problem, while never taking the time to look in the mirror. He is unlikable and selfish although in his heart he does not want to be either of those things. And I guess that is why in the end I like this novel. Holden is a person who wears many masks, but he does not want to. He yearns for real human connection, but he does not know how to create it. That is a problem that most people can relate to. Throw into the mix Holden's questionable sexuality, the death of a younger brother, his painful feelings of isolation and loneliness, and you have one very sad character, and one very human story.This book is not a novel that has an especially interesting plot, or any sort of convenient conclusion. However it is an interesting study in character, and in that most basic of human desires, the ability to connect with others, and the pain that often follows when you allow yourself to love and be loved.I am almost positive I would not have appreciated this book as a teenager, and I am glad that I waited many years before reading it. I would recommend reading it with others so that you can discuss it, and get past its unlikable characters. In a group dynamic more of the novel's humanity will come out and your appreciation of it will be better.On a side note, the way that Mr. Salinger incorporates the novel's title is very touching, and I think a very important theme of the text. Read it and see what you come up with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book used to be required reading, and then the world was a better place. These days kids think they have it so hard and life is so tough. The main reason is they never read about Holden. Anyone that reads about this kid will know that their life isn't that hard. I believe this book should be read by every kid that turns 13."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A good read but a little dated, so not for everyone.The John Lennon murder sadly gives it an unfortunate dark connection."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suspect that I am going to be real unpopular with my review but here goes. I ordered this book just because it is on the list of American Classic Literature. I am 55 and had never read it. The book I received was copywrite 1951 and in great condition. I was anxious to read it and started immediately. I got through about a third of it and then put it down. I had a hard time picking it up again and acutually skipped a few pages toward the end just to get through it. I thought it was extremely boring. I suppose that at the time that it was written perhaps it was a very revealing book aout the life of a young man but I just couldn't get excited about it at all.Sorry to all of you that I have insulted."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I tried to trudge through this novel in the 1980s when I was twenty. People had told me it was a book any young person could relate to, so I gave it a shot. At the time, I found nothing remotely relatable or interesting about it.I picked it up again in my 40s and again found nothing engaging or redeeming in the plot, characters or writing. It's like slow torture, watching this self-pitying, self-destructive, self-involved jerk spiral out of control. Are we supposed to pity him? Are we supposed to see ourselves in him? It's hard to care what happens to Holden, other than maybe feeling a deep-seated hope that he'll shut up already.It's clear what the appeal must have been 60 years ago: The narrator's then-naturalistic language broke taboos and the book spoke frankly about things traditionally unmentionable in fiction about teenagers. A sullen teen antihero was a radical change. But on its merits as literature away from that context, it's pretty awful."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I always heard that this book was a classic and must be read, blah, blah, blah. Well, I finally did and its all that and more. I'm actually upset that I didn't read this in high school because Holden Caufield reminds me of myself at that age. Salinger's voice of a the teenage main charcater is so on point its really amazing. Every college freshmen, especially males, should be made to read this. Classic!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Genius. This novel has everything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Matthew CunhaJanuary 21, 2005Book ReviewThe Catcher in the RyeBy: J.D. SalingerThe Catcher in the Rye is a about a teenage boy from New York who expresses his feelings and thoughts as he struggles with problems in his life. Holden Caulfield lives at school in a dorm but he had been in and out of four different schools. He had a brother who died of leukemia. He has parents and a younger sister, Phoebe. He looked up to his brother, D.J, who was a writer.In the Book The Catcher in the Rye I could relate to some of Holden's typical days. For example, Holden spent a lot of time in his dorm room at Pencey. He was not into sports and liked to be alone. When he was in his dorm an older classmate would come in, not invited, and get on his nerves by picking up his personal stuff. Holden did not do well in school. He did not have ambition or think about his future. I could relate with him about this because when teachers and parents lecture me about grades and my future, it is hard to always do my best. Sometimes my mind is thinking about other things. Like Holden, I am not into sports, and it does not bother me to be alone. I like to listen to music, play drums, and spend time with my girlfriend. Holden knew girls but did not have one particular girlfriend. It was sad to read about his trouble with girls.This book helped me realize that many teenagers go through hard times. Holden did not like phony people. For example, when one of Holden's headmasters met parents, he would pick and choose which ones he would talk to. The others he would just shake their hand and give them a phoney smile. This made me think about phony people. For example, if one of my \\"friends\\" greets me in a friendly manner then asks for a favor this upset me. Another example is when people say they will hang out with me and they decide not to show up. Another reason how I relate to Holden is when he would get upset when guys would always lock their dorm doors and not let certain people in. He thought the guys were mean but kept it to himself.Also The Catcher in the Rye helped me realize that you can still make it through hard times because there is always someone else to talk to and that there is always someone else who has or had a harder life then you. When I read about Holden's thought about what he wanted to do with his life as a catcher in the rye. It did not make much sense until I gave it more thought. My thought was he only wanted to have a simple job. A job with only one responsibility where he would catch the falling children if they went over a cliff. I think what Holden was going through as a teenager was too much for him to handle so when his sister asked him what he would like to be he choose one simple thing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't think there's young adult out there who didn't have to read this as part of their highschool english curriculum (unless perhaps you are from a very conservative area). It's not a bad book but I would certainly rank it as one of the most overrated books of all time. Salinger's plot techniques always struck me as pretentious and melodramatic, but considering I am one of the only people who did not &quot;absolutely looove&quot; this book when forced to read it in 9th grade, he obviously knows what the teenage reader wants."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am an english learner and my teacher told me to read this book for summer.many of you would think that this is a very good book but i don't think so. the book is about a boring story, the only thing that makes it good is the writing. the author has used a very informal language which makes the book natural and more real.if the plot would be more exciting this writer would rule!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...One of the cover notes caught my attention.

WILL lives right now, with malls and cell phones and laptop computers and Prozac.But WILL's still looking for meaning, like Holden did. Only the references in WILL are more contemporary. And it's funnier than Catcher! Check the online reviews.WILL cracks up just as badly as Holden does. I won't tell you why. And he's failing everything, too. Plus, the \\"meds\\" they prescribe for him don't make the world seem any less meaningless.But the book is so funny that you just kind of forget how bad things are... for awhile.Like another reader of Catcher says, it's \\"additive.\\" You can read WILL two or three times. it sticks with you.

Both are worthy of your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of the best book's I've ever read. The story tell the life of Holden Caulfeild when he is 16. Droping out of college, going to NYC, that is some poeple's dream! When you are 16 you want independance and freedom to choose what you do and when you do it. Thats why Holden is like every person.Though you may have issues about Holden's language (he swears a lot) I think the language adds a bit of color to the book. What 16 year old doesn't swear when he gets stolen from.For the first part of the book Holden is in NYC drinking, and playing with girls. Then he gets 'tired' of NYC (he also runs out of money) so he goes home. That is most peoples defeating point. They need help. Not Holden. Yet again he suprises you in what he can and wants to do. There he vists he 'kid-sister' Phoebe. She is the portral of innocence. Then Holden comes and turns her into a school cutting kid. Not that this is bad, but for the few days that Holden is there Phoebe is different than what Holden portrays her as.Freedom over dependence. Living life to the fullest to living life like a mummy. Be independant. You are who ever you want to be. Those are some of the messages that the book trys to tell you. Always remember that no matter how independant you are, being dependant of someone else can be nice.The Catcher in the Rye is a great, funny, coming of age novel for poeple young and old."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Boy, this is about the best book I ever read - I mean this is about the best book I ever read. It really is. I admit it. Sure, Holden has a pretty lousy attitude and all, about school and movies and his parents and the phonies and all, but who doesn't hate that stuff once in a while? Nobody. He's even a little phony himself sometimes. He really is. But that's why you like him. Because he's so complex and all, and you have to read in between the lines and all. Some of the scenes killed me too. They really did. Especially some of the things he says when he knows no one's paying attention to him. Like when he orders a drink and the waiter asks how old he is and all, and he says eighty-six. That killed me. It really did. And most of the time he just gives up and all. He can't finish ANYthing! He's grand and all, all the same, though. Who wouldn't like this book? - I mean, who wouldn't like this book? Nobody."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Written in a wonderfully casual style. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Jonas' opinion of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", by Jerome David Salinger.I find it a very good novel because it learns the reader about American schools and the reader is exposed to the American tradition. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but this you will hear in class.My greetings to you, Mr. Geerinckx,Your pupil of 6MWb,J.Duyck"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as a teenager and now again at 60+.

Holden Caulfield, the main character, has trouble staying in school without being expelled. He went from school to school, unsuccessful at each one. At his latest prep school, Pencey Prep, he has an annoying, self-centered roommate who prioritizes his social life above all else. With no roommate to support him, Holden felt he had nobody to talk to that understood him. He finally got kicked out, due to his lack of motivation which led him to receive bad grades. He decided to leave Pencey Prep earlier than they expected him to and to stay in his home city of New York for awhile. It is in New York that Holden experiences situations that change his life. Despite his high level of independence, Holden's desperation for companionship is taking over him. He shows this by calling a stranger at midnight with the hopes of interacting with someone. He is also trying to flirt with older ladies at a bar. You have to read the book to find out exactly what he goes through.I would definitely recommend The Catcher in the Rye to anyone who likes reading. I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it gripped me in the beginning and never lost my attention. Despite the story lasting around 2 days, J.D Salinger was able to keep it moving constantly. It really allows you to understand Holden and his unique perspective of the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I enjoyed the novel.I remember feeling something similar to Holden's \\"phony-ness\\" when I was a teenager.

The Catcher in the Rye is a novel narrated from the point of view of an angst-ridden 16-year-old that doesn't have that great a vocabulary, is almost always depressed, whines about seemingly trivial things, and hates nearly everybody he meets (Except nuns and children). And it's not as annoying as it sounds. Salinger was an immensely talented writer, and it's a shame that he didn't publish more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a hard to put down book. I loved the conversational style of writing, \\"and all\\" (a phrase often used by Salinger). I had to close my mind to some of the language.

Now he's leaving Pencey, and is set to return home on Wednesday. But spurred on by his general dislike of the \\"phonies\\" around him, Holden decides to spend a few days in New York City until Wednesday comes.Using his height and unusual strands of gray hair as a disguise, Holden checks into a hotel room. However, he does not anticipate how quickly he will become bored and lonely. As he wanders around the city and calls up old friends, Holden reveals to the reader his alternating acceptance and contempt of human beings.As the novel continues, we learn many of the reasons behind Holden's actions and thought processes. His funny and touching story keeps the reader hooked until the last page.My thoughts: The Catcher in the Rye does not have a standard plot line in that it doesn't contain a single conflict and finally a resolution. The main focus of critics has been Holden's voice, and that indeed is what keeps the book moving.I would recommend this novel to all teenagers and interested adults. Although there has been questioning as to whether modern teens can relate with Holden, there is no doubt that we can all learn from and laugh with him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is not just a story about your frustrated teenager who doesn't like anything, as his little sister Phoebe points out in the book. It's a story about the person that reflects the emotions given to us by the world. Here's a 17 year old who just got kicked out of high school straight into the streets of New York City. He doesn't seem mad about being kicked out of school, not at all. He enjoys his time as only Holden Caulfield knows how: Calls up old friends, goes to bars, pays for a prostitute (only to not have sex with her), dances with girls in clubs where the best Jazz players play, and eventually manages to get drunk out of his mind. Inside Holden, is a person who is fed up with the world though, the way things are, the way things aren't. Holden is no role model; he's a sex crazed, lying, cigarette smoker, but he's himself. He never pretends to be anything he isn't and stays true to that ever so famous title, The Catcher In The Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who has been kicked out of numerous schools, tells of the days leading up to his confinement in a mental hospital.

The only person he is able to connect with is his younger sister Phoebe though he spends one night with a hooker and one with a past professor who he admired (until the professor made a sexual pass).It is no wonder that Catcher in the Rye is one of the most popular books of all time. Written in streaming consciousness it is nearly impossible to not understand Holden and teenage angst. Every young man I have ever met fits into Caulfield's persona for at least some point in their life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I paraphrase Nabokov:To write a book whose purpose is for the reader to identify with the main character is nonartistic candy.J.D. Salinger (the J.D. stands for &quot;Faust&quot;) has written a book from the perspective of a 16-year-old, who is the throes of adolescence. He is self-centred and pessimistic. In my adolescence, I did identify with Holden, but each time I read the book I could never make it past page fifty. Not only is Holden's narrative redundant and clich&eacute;, but, as I soon discovered, IT WAS SOLELY MEANT TO APPEAL TO TEENAGERS. I was repulsed by this book - not because I am the child of some over-protective gay couple that loves me dearly, but because it was a waste of my time. It told me nothing about myself (the role of art, as Wilde put it, is to reflect the spectator). Reading this book was painful and boring. I gave it two chances and gave up on both. I confess with immense shame that I feigned appreciation of this book -- &quot;so good! so good!.. the BEST book&quot; -- in social situations. But I stopped fooling myself. The people who read this book over and over, aside from the scholars, are people who are addicted to things and have attempted suicide.In my review for &quot;Ulysses&quot; on this website, I stated that that book (&quot;Ulysses&quot;) marked the end of literature for the next few hundred years (until a new reincarnation of Joyce/Shakespeare shows up....man, metempsychosis of the geniuses takes a while) and Salinger's book helps me in proving my point:It is a theme that has been done to death. It was controversial at the time (or was it) but, as far as I'm concerned, it was in no way transcendental, groundbreaking, or any of those nonsequitors that are thrown around too much. It was, quite simply, something that this bulimic, urine-drinking recluse wrote to strike it rich, as with everyone else in our society (just because I can't sympathize with Holden, it doesn't mean that we aren't similar - I am the king of nihilists and pessimists). People like the book because it is them that they are hearing. It mirrors our society, but not in the constructive, critical way, but in a way that turns us all in little heroes, little Holden Caulfields.In short:Do yourself a favour. Don't define your philological merit by how many books you have read. If literature is where you want to be, spend the rest of your life reading &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Surprisingly, I never was forced to read this drivel in school. Being a voracious reader though, I checked out a copy during my junior year of HS. I was expecting a classic; what I got was crap. How is this supposed to be a literary masterpiece?! I couldn't make it more than 50 pages into the book because I became so enraged at the lazy, whiny, rich-brat protaganist that my hands were shaking. No joke, I literally wished Holden was a real kid just so I could beat him to a pulp with a 2x4.Don't get me wrong here, I was a sixteen year old at the time, I hated the world, and I'm sure I was a pain in my parents' butts. But at least I had the insight to realize that, like many teenagers, most of my problems were caused by me and not 'the phonies' or the man. I simply cannot understand how anyone can sympathize with a character so self-centered and unlikeable. A terrible book then, and upon introspection, a terrible book now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because I heard that it was a classic. After reading it I can tell you that I thought it was a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for anyone who can &quot;relate&quot; to Holden Caulfield. I found him to be a pathetic, imature malcontent who has squandered his opportunities and advantages. I kept reading and hoping that he was going to change his attitude but it never really happened.I consider this &quot;classic&quot; to be highly over-rated."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Spoilers below.Catcher in the Rye is a book about a mentally insane kid who can't stop complaining.The two things that support this statement are:1) He literally complains every page about something extremely trivial and then proceeds to drag it out.\\"Don't you hate guys who have crooked ties? I do. I've always noticed crooked ties and wondered why they never bother to fix it. They should care more about their appearance. I know I do.\\"What an interesting observation. Crooked ties. Wow. Breakthrough material right there.\\"The ducks are leaving. I am sad. Why must the ducks leave when it's cold? I'm all alone now.\\"Well kid. If you weren't wandering around NY at 4 A.M. in the morning you probably wouldn't be alone. If you weren't such an OCD freak, then you'd probably have friends.But nope. You're crazy and a freak. There's nothing that modern science can to do save you. You are a complete whack job.\\"I find it ironic that he always looks so neat but everything he has is so dirty.\\"Okay. His looks are contradicting his material objects. No one cares about your roommate that provides absolutely benefit to the story. Wait-a-minute! Gotta complain about him for at least five detailed pages each time you run into him!2) At the end of the story it is revealed that he's in the looney bin. No surprise there. You can't really argue he's not crazy because he's sitting in the looney bin telling us this \\"wonderful\\" story.Catcher in the Rye has themes such as growing up, losing a loved one, and loss of innocence. I'm sure there are more themes but to be honest, this book can be abridged into 50 pages and you wouldn't miss a dang thing.Sun Tzu defined war in ~50~ pages. I don't see why this book needs more than... oh wait. I do know. Holden's gotta get some whining in."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salingers catcher in the sty was shoved down so many of our throats as an adolescent, like so many others in that genre of so called 'classics' like Kill a Mockingbird and Lord of the Flies, The Great Gatsby, etc. It took me many re-readings of these so called greats after being able to read them on my own free will, and understand them in my own time, in my own environment, when I was motivated to read that particular subject in a situation that needed it in my life. However I will never fully understand or grasp the grand significance of such a work of fiction, used still in many frosh classes even in the most prestigious of schools, where in today's market, Rowling's epic worlds are filled with enough word salad for literature professor's to salivate over. I found the writing trite, unmotivating, and save the lack of a better word, pretty boring. I remember reading the inserts on 'A Separate Peace' and one of the reviewers called the book one of the most disturbing endings in literature. I still laugh today about that, as I thought A Separate Peace was excrement, and compare them both to the overhauling of American so-called classics.Salinger's book is never a recommendation to any youth that crosses my path. I'd much rather place in their grasp 'On the Road,' 'Farewell To Arms' or Henry Miller, or a more modern touch of 'A Perks of Being a Wallflower' or 'Everything is Illuminated', rather than the disgustingly and unnecessarily warranted kudos this book continues to achieve."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Our librarian has informed us that Salinger did not allow any audio versions of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and there is no ISBN number so I do not know what this is?

Maybe I'm missing something and I need to read some cliff notes(why are they called cliff notes?). I think the reason I like it is that I like Holden. I'm his age, and I keep forgetting how long ago the book was written. Sometimes he'll mention how much something costs or some music, and I'll realize how little difference there really is between then and now. Some of the phrases are interesting, like i wasn't feeling very sexy right then. Who says that? Then there were the damn ducks. They fly south, okay? Holden is supposed to be smart, and he doesn't know where the ducks fly. That really irritated me. Some of the stuff was really good though, and now I really want a red hat. I guess the book is deep in a way. I am still thinking about it. And I have this need to read something else by salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Perhaps I'm missing the point of this book. I picked it up a few years ago and tried to read it and couldn't get into it. So, this year, I decided to try again in an attempt to plow through some of the \\"classics\\" of literature.I do like how Salinger really gets into the mind of a troubled teenager who is searching for meaning out of life and never really finds it. I like the personal writing style...informal and not stuffy and distant.However, I was disturbed by the book. In delving further into Holden's mind shows a person who isn't satisfied with anything, is deceptive, sneaky, phony himself, and depressed. I seriously kept waiting for a suicide attempt to happen in the book, or something equally horrid.This book is worth the read if you really want to ponder the human mind for a while. I can only give it 2 stars because I was left bereft from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for my high school english class. I had moderate optomism about the book. The Catcher in the Rye is about the misadventures of a young teen named Holden, who just go kicked out of his forth private school. He goes from one location to another, from school to NYC, to a mental hospital where he tells this story. Many people respect and appreciate this book and the work of the skilled author, J.D. Salinger, but they also say that you either love the book or hate the book. As much as I can respect this book, I have to say I can't stand the story.Salinger does write the book in a style that I like. The scenes and descriptions described in the book are so vivid and realistic that I can easily picture everything in my head, detail to detail. The characters that Holden encounters have the same detail put into them as the settings and situations, from their looks, to attitude and demeanor, to even their bad habits.However, as good as the detail is in the books, the story itself is the root of any good novel. This is where this book's quality plummets badly. First off, this novel is lacking a large element that puts a good book together: plot. I read the book, beginning to end, and there is none. There is not a single thing that would show that the story has a plot or a task at hand. Most would say that the task for Holden is to get home after being kicked out of school, but a large chunk of this book is all side treks, diverting away from the main situation at hand, resulting in a novel about nothing. This really makes the book very boring and pointless.The second element to a good book is a good protagonist, or main character. The main character in this book, Holden, is a kind of protagonist that many just don't like. He is your stereotypical rich snob, coming from a wealthy family who can afford to send him from one school to another. He also has a snotty, pessimistic attitude about life, other people, and himself. To all the people around him, they're all \\"phony\\" and he's better than them, but when he thinks about himself, he degrades himself also. Very hypocritical if you ask me, but he admits that in the book. He also gets very depressed easily, so you don't really see a happy side to this person, or any side that would say he's motivated to do something, or anything for that matter. He just brags about his sister, drinks, treats women poorly, and spends a ton of money, all while under heavy depression. Holden is the kind of person you either feel sorry for, or just want to smack in the face. Both feelings are not feelings a reader should have about the protagonist.The overall mood of this book is the final element that makes me want to put the book down after a few pages. Holden's attitude gets him into lots of trouble and lots of bad situations. From one encounter to another, it all ends in sadness and depression. Imagine having to read one depressing story to another, in perfect detail. The only good thing I can say about the mood is that the author writes it very well. However, when I read this book, I always had to stop myself from getting myself depressed after reading all of Holden's misadventures.To summarize, imagine sitting in front of a rich pessimist and hearing him ramble on and on and on about everything. There would be no point, no happiness, and no end. Imagine having to hear the rambler for a grade. Can't stand it? Neither could I. Sorry Mr. Salinger, but please put your writing skill to better use. As much as I respect the quality work of this author, I couldn't stand reading this book...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because I had heard good things about it.However, it turned out to be one of the rare books that I just can't find anything good to say about it. In most books there is always something I take away from it, a characte, the plot, the style, something. In this book I hated the main character and his constant statements of: &quot;really I'm not kidding&quot; or something to that effect. There was seemingly no plot and i wasn't impressed with salinger's style. It is honestly the only book i have ever hated and would never want to read again and ive read a lot of books, i'm not easy to dissapoint. However, i believe this is one of the most highly overrated works in American literature, especially if you find the characters as obnoxious as I did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first book where I've laughed out loud for chapter after chapter. I highly recommend it. That being said, Salinger is no literary genius. What is it about controversy that really drives people to use phrases like that? I think most could have written this book when they were 16 in fact. Haven't many of us had these thoughts when we were that age? Also, the ending was a little anticlimactic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a good book for younger (teen) readers. Salinger does a good job keeping the attention of the reader which I believe to be an essential quality of a book suited for young readers. However, I only give this book three stars due to it's anticlimactic nature and extremely weak ending."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's story about teen angst and rebellion is still surprisingly relevant today over fifty years after it was first written, simply change Holden Caulfield into an emo or a goth and you have a modern rebellious teenager. When I first read this book at 15 I realized that the things that I was feeling were pretty normal and that there's nothing new or original about teen rebellion and I wasn't the first person who ever felt like an outcast. Any teenager today should be able to identify with Holden and his feelings towards his parents, teachers and authority figures in general and any parent will recognize his behavior and it may help them to understand their own rebellious teenager."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"descriptive, thought provocing writing.

For 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, it means catching kids who are running through a rye field before they fall over a cliff at the end of the field. But Holden himself needs to be caught. He swears a lot and smokes too much, while falling more deeply into isolation and depression after his brother's death. Unable to stand the \\"phonies\\" in his prep school, he flunks out and leaves in the middle of the night. After two cold and lonely days in New York City, Holden allows himself to be caught by an unlikely person whose childish innocence gives him hope.[...]"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Book arrived in good shape, but took a while to receive. I had ordered another book at least a week after this one and received it well before this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've been mixing in some classics lately, pretty much blind to what they are about or who wrote them, just picking some famous titles that are easy to pick up for under a buck at a used book store. If Catcher was written today, it probably wouldn't have the acclaim it does. When it came out in the Puritanical 1950s, it had to be a departure from much of the stodgy, PC stuff being written at the time. I enjoyed reading it but I can't say it would make it in my top ten favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can see how many young people today don't really understand or connect with this book. For one, the setting and language of the book is outdated, creating a small barrier. But above all is the fact that this book is not an action thriller, which is what more people are more drawn to present day. There are not very many huge plot twists and mysteries to be unveiled in this book. Instead, this book is about an in-depth look inside the mind of the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, as he is a troubled teen looking to find himself. The book has created a lot of controversy as required readings in schools because it is loaded with harsh language, and the main character isn't exactly the best role model as he flunks out of school, smokes, lies, drinks alcohol, etc. On top of this, Holden seems to have a very pessimistic outlook on life. He views everyone around him as \\"phonies\\" that he would rather not associate himself with. In fact, Holden even goes on to say that he would be more content if he led the rest of his life pretending he was deaf and mute, that way he wouldn't have to talk to all of the \\"phonies\\".This book is a must read just from considering the role it has played in history. After all, this book is said to have been associated with the shootings of John Lennon and Ronald Reagan. The man who assassinated Lennon, Mark David Chapman (who is considered delusional and psychotic), became obsessed with this book, and actually handed a copy of it over to the police when they arrested him, saying that the book was his statement. Its said that Chapman, who identified with Holden from the book, viewed Lennon as a \\"phony\\", and he was trying to protect the rest of the world from his work.I strongly recommend anyone to read this book, as it has played a lasting role in society since it has been published. Even if you don't find the story exceptionally entertaining, there are enough references to this book that it is at least worth it to see what the fuss is all about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Whoa, I can't believe I'm reading this for the first time. This book is probably the biggest most popular classic among the \\"young generation\\" ever since it was published several decades ago. Probably every student has read it. Most love it. I liked it a lot too. It's like an endless diary entry in the day of the life of a 16 year old boy named Holden who's flunking out of school and doing the kinds of things that most teenagers do for fun. Many incidents that happen to him in this story will remind you of stuff that happened to you at that age or slightly older. The times may change, the way kids like Holden talk and dress and even dance changes, but this book proves that deep down kids are always basically the same."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Is The Catcher in the Rye as captivating as its title? J.D. Salinger's impressive novel deals with Holden Caulfied, a sixteen year old boy, who is expelled from Pencey for his poor grades, and consequently decides to explore New York City before confronting his parents with the unfortunate news. In New York City Caulfield reveals his view of the world through the characters.Caulfield considers people like Ackley, Stradlater, and Lillian Simmons as \\"phonies\\" and \\"morons\\", in which he repeatedly criticizes their fakeness and unintelligence. He has an obvious dislike for adults and sees them as a corruption to society, and his encounters lead to separation. Caulfield's description of adults limits the perception of the readers and emphasizes the havoc in adulthood.This negative aspect of people is not true for every character introduced to readers. Caulfield exposes his peaceful side when he speaks of his sister Phoebe, his brother Allie, Jane Gallagher, and the singing boy. Caulfield's memories of his family regard his childhood and their innocence. The thought of Jane, an old friend, brings a sense of joy in Caulfield's eyes because he contemplates on their angelic friendship. The boy walking down the side walk sings \\"If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\". Caulfield states that this relieves his depression, and confesses to Phoebe he wants to be the person guarding kids from carelessly running over a cliff on the rye.This is an exceptional novel written by Salinger, and I especially recommend this to young and old readers because it concerns both age groups. This book discusses the big gap between the new and the old age, and Caulfield struggles to accept his time for maturity. There is a point in a person's life in which one has to acknowledge their transition to adulthood."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in one day, just couldn't leave it.

I was hesitant to read the book since back than it was &quot;just another book&quot; I would have to read. I decided to read this book since I had no choice - it was the best decision I ever made.

Salinger's A CATCHER IN THE RYE is a remarkable yet painful tale of the angst of a disillusioned young man named Holden Caulfield. Salinger's use of imagery and few words adds to the confusion and passionate yearning of Holden. In the end Holden has earned our compassion, yet the reader has no problem identifying with him. The reader unwillingly leaves A CATCHER IN THE RYE breathless and forever changed, having been inside Holden's head far too long, yet not long enough."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book is about this boy, Holden. He goes to highschool in New York, but he is doing very bad. It is Christmas time and he just got kicked out of school, because he failed to many classes. His parents are going to get to know it in a few days and he doesn't want to go home before they know. But he doesn't want to stay at the school either, so he takes the train to New York City. He sleeps at a cheep hotel and he does a lot of bad things. He just hangs around and gets drunk. His family lives in New York City and he wants to see his younger sister, so he goes home to see her. He doesn't meet his parents though. His sister seems to be the most important person in his life, and you can tell he really loves her. The book is written in first person and he tells the story like he would tell a friend. There are a lot of swearing in the book and that probably makes a lot of the book's attitude. I don't enjoy reading it though. It is to much. The book is not a gramatically good book, it has a lot of made-up words. The story the narrator tells is enjoying and it probably tells how some people have it. It is worth reading I think even if it was not the best book I have read. J.D. Salingers book was interesting and I will probably read more books he has written, to be able to compare and get to know his style of writing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book. It really relates to real life. I can't see why anyone would want to ban this really cool book, but that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first bought this book when i was fifteen because i had heard it was meant to be shocking. I flicked through it looking for sex or violence, found none and so discarded it. However when at eighteen, feeling directionless, disillusioned and sick of human nature and the fakeness of it all, i picked this book up and read it properly i was blown away. Holden Caulfield is an incredible character that seems to summarize all aspects of the hardship of going into adulthood. Fiery and outspoken yet tired of falseness and often depressed Holden Caulfield is a brilliantly drawn character. And the book is shocking but not on a cheap, shallow level. This is reccomended reading for all young adults, infact anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While reading all of these reviews, I began to wonder if anyone who reviewed this book had actually read it. The people who gave the book one star I can understand: they haven't &quot;gotten it&quot; yet and will probably need to reread it five to ten fifteen years down the road. Those who criticized the swearing, to you I say get a life. Criticizing The Catcher in the Rye for its use of profanity is like saying the Godfather should not be shown because of the violence: the profanity used is part of Holden's diction; it reveals more about him as a character than merely what he thinks about something. If you have a problem reading books with profanity, then many 20th century classics must bother you. For those out there who gave TCITR five stars but went off on its perfect portrayal of teenage angst, I question whether the book itself or the reputation preceding the book influenced your review. I am a 16 year old female who just finished the book for an advanced english 11 class. I do not consider myself cynical, have never drank, smoked, run away, or considered hiring a prostitute, yet I find this book THE most influential book I have ever read. Holden's perception of the world as a bunch of phonies is more dead-on than most people would care to believe. I don't see angst the driving force as much as growing up (or lack thereof). Whether you can relate to this book or not, it is an important read if only to see the world perspective from someone other than yourself. Although I am not an adult yet, it's been my observation that as adults get older, they dislodge more and more from the person they were as a teenager; a reasonable and natural progression. However, when these same adults have children, they are so out of touch with being a teenager that they cannot relate, and therefore write off teenagers as troublemakers. Teenagers haven't changed as much as adults have. While this diatribe will undoubtably offend many people, and I will probably be written off as a teenager who does not understand the world as a whole, I would like to say that I stand by my opinions and wrote this review because I saw a void in the other reviews. Instead of attacking me, I suggest you reread the book or at least think about your motives for disliking it.

I am sure that many previous reviewers would find it convenient to attribute this to my age (17) and the fact that this book was required reading. However, I have to wonder something. Is it possible that people are reading WAY too much into this story? I find it more than likely. It's been my experience that if you put something in front of someone and say that it's a classic and has a very deep, significant meaning, they will find one no matter what. In short, I think the novel is dull and poorly written. Those of you who found some grand significance, I applaud you but feel perhaps rather than of finding a revelation in the book, you've found one in yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i purchased this book from a yard sale and havent quite finished it yet , i'm only on page 90 or so and really dont understand what its about maybe i'm crazy or something , but i'll keep going and will come back later for a better review for you and possibly a better opinion of it, however i am glad that i only paid 50 cents for the book as it does not hold my attention for longer than about 1 or 2 chapters at a time thank you"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is not just an icon, he is a hero, a revolutionary.

What makes it asuperb novel is the voice of the narrator, Holden Caulfield. He isunreliable -- we know he must have a tenderness deeper than what he tellsus. It's difficult to create an unreliable narrator, because the reader isasked both to like and dislike the main character. But when it is done wellit is wonderfully engaging.In the years since I first read it I've looked often for a good narratorthat was as likably unlikable. I finally found one in a new novel --- LOVESONGS OF THE TONE-DEAF, by Asher Brauner -- which I recommend to anyone wholiked CATCHER IN THE RYE. Both novels are about alienation -- the ways inwhich young people feel no one understands them -- and the ways in whichthat assumption is probably true.Read both these books -- you'll love them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never read this wonderful book until I got to college. Not because I was forced to for a class but because I wanted to see what all the hub-hub was all about. I did not see what the mentally impaired saw and I was not insulted by the language either, what I saw was lonely and scared , which is why he was so sarcastic, boy who was not what the WORLD saw him as! He was intelligent and caring but put up a front to protect himself from his cold enviorment. I could identify with this character and the places he was in even though I've never even been to New York or lived in the 50's. I think the Boomers and Generation X have a common bond more than they would like to think. I know my dad and I have one with this book. Both of are generations grew up in such a society that looked good on the outside but rotted on the inside and we were and are mad about it. I think high schoolers and college students should read it but I didn't give it five stars because I does get boring in the middle with him just repeating his ideas over and over. I liked his school life descriptions at the beginnings and his relationship with his sister at the end. Overall one of the best pieces of American Literature. P.S. I recommend Robert Burns the Scottish poet for anyone who liked this book. This book and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; Stienbeck, two of the greatest American authors both named their books after two of his poems."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"At the age of 28 I'm still interested in other people's views (esp. teens) of Salinger's work.

A few months later a pessimistic, sarcastic, and underachieving teen got around to reading the book and my life changed completely. Anyone reading this knows what the book is about. Very few people think the book is &quot;just OK&quot; They either love it or hate it. Like many other addicts of the book I have several wore out copies, including one from the 50's that I prize as one of my most prizes possessions. I was happy to see the book make the top ten.

I'll go to my grave forever wondering what Salinger thought and wrote about in his spare time all those years after the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;If you find this letter, you have found your rose in a vase-which looks more like a milk bottle than a vase. On the coffee table, you will also find a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. Read the first chapter, if you can. It's short. Entertaining. I saw no style in this book, once...but now that I'm wiser, I feel comfortable with it, as if I'm reading a casual letter or wearing that old, familiar, weather-beaten jacket; it becomes the comfort of skin. The kind of book with unimaginable wealth, for it stays with you, creeps underneath your skin and into that simple heart which just wants to relive undying memories-when life was simple again.&quot; A simple life. There's your plot, lady!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can't believe how much this book makes you think. My teacher made ME-and only ME-read this book for my English class. Being 16 years old and so familiar with the title but never have read it, I was apprehensive. After the first 20 pages of this book, I was absolutely blown away by the simpleness, yet mental complexity of this novel. I went back to school the very next day and thanked my English teacher over and over again for making me read this. He told me he knew I would like it and that I would find many similarities between Holden and myself, as every teenager will. I am no longer afraid to read some of the contemporary authors and I now indulge myself in good literature. Thanks to this book I have found a new part of me. I found the part who loves to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I noticed, that in general, this book mostly got five stars from reviewers, and the second most occurence was 1 star. I have to say that all the people(or should I say kids) who gave the book one star, were obviously not old enough, or wise enough, to have any perspective on this book. The common complaints were:1. I did not relate to the book, and do not understand why people think teemagers are like Holden. Therefor, because I did not relate to the book, I think that you should not waste your time reading it, because obviously, if I didn't relate to it, you won't either.2. It had no plot/character develpoment/conlict, and was boring therefor3. I didn't understand itMy response:1.You don't have to be exactly like Holden to understand where he's coming form. The book was written showing the glimpses of most adolescents minds, the tumult, that doesn't come as fully as it did in Holden, but is there none the less. The author projected teens(and all peoples) little struggles onto a whole life. That is why it is so satisfying for us to read, it gives our feelings validation. Also an outlet reading this book, for our &quot;Holden-like emotions&quot; to flow through us, and not remain squished up in our heads.Everyone has dysfunctional emotions, and you are keeping them all squished up, and therefore rendering yourself spurious, if you do not ever feel them. I do not imply, that everyone is dysfuntional(quite the opposite), but only that we all at one time or another, and especially in our teen years, struggle with life, and our attitude towards society.2.Although the book had little plot, that is not the point of all books. If the book had been more story like, it would not have rung as true, as nobody's life, especially just 3 or 4 days of it, has a definite plot. And, yes, the book DID have character development, not in the traditional sense, but the author highlighted a short period of Holden's life, in which he went through a transformation.3. Please read it again in ten years or so, when you have had more experience of life, you will then understand it.I won't tell everyone to read it because I loved it, but I will say, that you should read it, because it will describe your attitude towards life, based on your reaction to it. If you are a teenager, read it now, but read it again when you are older, whether you liked it or not when you first read it, you will understand much more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't even know how to begin. It's hard to put my feelings into words. But this hyped book has really affected me, and I recognised myself a lot. I think it has affected many people. For example the person who assassinated John Lennon. He had read it several times before the assassination. I definitely can't see any reason for killing someone after reading this book!I think many teenagers recognise themselves in the book, because this is a story about a young man who feels like he doesn't belong anywhere. He just feels like a lost soul. That's the way you sometimes feel when you are in your teens. You try a lot of different trails before you find the right track. Many youngsters are most likely identifying themselves with Holden Caulfield -the main character in the novel. He is a normal teenager who has been kicked out of his school, Pencey Prep, because he flunked all his subjects except English. With fear of going home he spends some days in New York among bars, parks, cinemas and phoneys which he calls almost everyone. We follow him during his adventures in N. Y. It's a very tragic book, but at the same time it is very funny. Holden describes and remarks on everything in a way that makes you smile. But in a way it isn't right to smile at him, because he is a very depressed boy, who doesn't seem to like anybody or anything. It seems to me that the only things he really cares about is his little sister and being the catcher in the rye. He wants to save kids from falling from the edge of a cliff. That's what he wants to do all day.It is his sister who convinces him to return home after the few days in N.Y., and that's also what he does. Well at home he is taken to a hospital and it's from a bed in the hospital he tells us the whole story.The story contains loads of flashbacks which can make it a bit tricky to read. The language is also filled with lots of swearing and slang. It was written 40 years ago, (published 1959) but I'm impressed by how modern his language is. In the beginning it was a bit annoying with Holdens &quot;americanisms\\", but after a while you get used to it. Then you don't bother about the \\"phoneys\\", the madmen or the other \\"helluva \\"stuff that just kills him.The writer manages extremely well with making us sympathise with the honest Holden. You really can feel what he feels and sometimes you just want to crawl into the book and take him home with you, and show him how wonderful life actually is. But the outcast Holden can't see things like that. He's caught up in his cage and thinks everything is terrible. But I think that deep inside of him there's a great loving side. He just doesn't know where to search for it and how to express himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some people just aren't meant to be nice...Like Holden, he's not about to kiss anyones behind, and neither am I. Don't expect me to give you a giftwrapped, ideal review of this book. There's a lot about the book that isn't perfect, like the exclamations Holden keeps repeating time upon time. But hey, all of us use the same words and sentences all the time. And none of us is perfect.Which makes me conclude that this book couldn't be more human. Some people like it, some don't. Like real life, where some people like you and some people don't, no matter how much you try to get into their favor.So look upon this book like you would upon a fellow man. And don't bother me ,or anyone else for that matter, with your fierce judgements and absolute truths. Not just because of hypocrisy and prejudgement. Because I don't care. Nor does Salinger, being the rebel he based his own book on. Call it selfcentered, if you really think you must. I call it brilliant, because it's real. The atmosphere, an anxious runaway punk, the curses, the way everything presses down on you,... It's all in the down to earth, real-life concept of the book. But that's just my point of view.A masterpiece from the depths of a genius' mind."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story of a young boy who goes through adolescent and experiences the &quot;usual&quot; and &quot;unusual&quot; experiences of life.

A great book for teenagers, and also a great book for adults who are trying to understand teenagers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love this book. It is, by far, one of the most incredible books ever written. Incredible for several reasons: 1. Symbolism (this book should be read multiple times, once to analyze symbolism, the next read for what it is) 2. Honesty 3. Humanity 4. Heart 5. Emotion 6.

Everyone should read this novel, it will change your life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story, taken at face value is definately worth 4 stars. Funny at some points and touching at others, those who enjoy reading will enjoy this book. The story takes place over a few days in the life of a cynical 16 year-old. We see the world through his eyes, his observations of the people around him and their behavior.There is more there than just a story: &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is taught in schools around the world for a reason. Really, this book is about the teenage experience, about growing up and alienation. These are things that we can all relate to.Read this book at least once; if you want to take something away from this book, you will. Otherwise, it's still a good story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most moving books I have ever read. With that said, I have not given the novel 5 stars, because it does have some flaws, and with that, comes some disappointment. None of that comes from the novel's main character though. Holden Caulfield is one of the most intruging and lost souls ever created. The way he searches for himself in this novel is unbelievable. We feel sorry for him, and sympathise with him, and the weird thing is, we don't even realize that we're doing it. He is so hypnotic that by the end of the novel, we are just like him, and actually want to be like him. We wish we could be as courageous as he was. It's amazing that a novel could have that much power on you, but The Catcher in the Rye actually does."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this book is in one way a kind of tragic.

The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but this you will hear in class.(...)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I haven't read The Body of Christopher Creed, however I think that it should be used in conunction with The Catcher In The Rye in the education of young adults. &quot;Catcher&quot; will remain a timless classic for quite some time, but it has moments where it tends to loose a readers interests.

Salinger, through Holden Caufield's use of extremes with death and temperature, displays his distaste of reality. Death is an extreme that is used quite often throughout the novel. The book begins with Holden talking about why he is not at the big football game, and how the students were &quot;supposed to commit suicide &quot;if they lost (2). This clearly shows the distinction between Holden and everyone else in reality. He takes the normalcy of attending the football game and places himself at the other end of the spectrum, and then aggrandizes it by saying how the mere loss of a football game could supposedly result in a mass forfeiture of life. Suicide arises as an extreme measure that occurs in reality over sometimes-small things like a loss in a football game. Holden mocks this occurrence within reality. When Holden meets the three girls in the bar, his attitude labels them as the norm of girls in New York. Holden relates how the girls did not speak and then he talks about how they &quot;nearly committed suicide,&quot; when they saw an actor (74). From the beginning Holden displays how he abhors the movies. This shows the reality of how the three girls are affected by society to the point that they would go to the extreme of committing suicide to see a mere person, an actor. Holden ends up hating the girls and this parallels with his distaste towards reality. Holden also belittles a couple who were &quot;feeling each other&quot; as the male spoke about a kid committing suicide. This clearly shows how disturbed people in reality become and how Holden hates the phoniness of them. To all these stories and observations, Holden replies with &quot;It killed me (119).&quot; This remark soars in every other page at least a couple of times. In a way, it does kill Holden, for his view of the good in reality deteriorates with each of his revelations. This leads to Holden's obsession for an Odyssey-like voyage away from reality. Temperature also plays an important role in overwhelming the reader with the depressing mood of reality. Holden uses temperature quite often to make the reader feel uneasy and uncomfortable as he reads. This lets one feel Holden's misery and allows one to incorporate the hatred of the reality through Holden's eyes. Holden characterizes the temperature in the beginning as &quot;cold as a witch's teat (2).&quot; Holden then describes why he feels that way, which includes that someone stole his jacket and gloves, while he was at his Pencey Academy. This leads to the emphasis on the appearance vs. reality of Pencey. Pencey mounts supposedly to an ambiance of well-educated and morally right men, while Holden instead shows how thieves roam the halls and rooms. The reality of Pencey scars him mentally, and impels his apathy towards his eternal suspension. The reader finds out that, &quot;At Pencey, you either froze to death or died of the heat (23).&quot; This foreshadows the extremist view of Holden. Here, he displays the lack of finding a middle area, and both ends suffering the same consequence. This also is analogous with his view of reality, that either way you are cooked. Holden relates himself to the ducks and wonders where they go when the lake freezes over. In a sense, he feels his life has frozen over and he needs to escape reality like the ducks. The most extreme form of cold temperature is ice, and that is where Holden feels surrounds him. The temperature outside never raised, it was only frigid. This shows how the reality of the world could be escaped when he departed to a house, but he always ends up cold again. He talks about how hot he felt when Mr. Antolini pats him on his head inside Mr. Antolini's house, then the next thing &quot;I [Holden Caufield] was getting sorta cold (95).&quot; The temperature relates to how people can evade reality, but they always have to come back in the end. Holden parallels the two extremes of death and temperature when he says, &quot; I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die.&quot; This correlation portrays Holden's reality and its virulent extremes. Holden expresses how the extremes of death and temperature exist in every day life, and portrays them as flaws in order to incorporate his purpose of displaying his aversion towards the reality of the world. I enjoyed the novel and Holden's depiction of the real world, and the way the book did not hide the truth. The world is full of corrupt and phony people. Holden views this phoniness and through his book attempts to educe it to his readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Ever since I was really young, I have been hearing about the &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;, and what an amazing piece of work it was, how it was going to live forever,how it deserved every prize possible, ect. And when I saw in on my eighth grade reading list, I thought, well, why not? I should read it. Fall in love with it, as everyone told me I would. Well. So I read it. And while &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is a good book, and a really good book, I must say, I have read better. It really isn't the one of the worlds Wonders, believe it or not.Holden is a cynical guy, charming, nice, open, honest, sweet and funny, a rebal at times, way critcal, and pretty much a liar. And in the book he mentions what phonies everyone are. Yet, he, at times, was phony too. Since I read the book a long while ago it's pretty hard to remember, but let's try. Holden lies at every chance he gets, calls up girls he says he hates, becuase he wants to make out with them, judges people by how their suitcases look and cost, and wants to marry a girl cause she's pretty. But Holden? Phony? Never!Still, you can relate to him. Holden doesn't feel like he belongs, and everyone feels like that sometimes. He feels everyone is phony, and a lot of people think that, too. He feels the stress of trying to fit in, of homones, school, parents... anyone who ever dreamed of being free, going wherever you want, whever you want, being totaly anoyynimas, (sorry,I can't spell that!), can relate to this book. This is a classic because it's about teen angst: once a story like that is written well, and this one is, it really can live forever, because this topic doesn't change. It still exists. You can realte,no matter what your age. So my point? Read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading the first 20 pages, I thought \\" What a crumby book!\\" In the beginning I found it really difficult to keep on reading it, because of its long and difficult sentences, with a lot of symbolisme. But after a while, and after I had finished this book, I found it a quite amazing novel! Why? Because of several things.Let's start with the style and the language of J.D.Salnger. I think his style is very different from any other book I've ever read in English. He has a, quite genius, way of telling everything very detailed and, in my opinion, very true. The use of his language annoyed me sometimes, because it consisted of a lot of repetition. He used words like \`crumby', \`old', \`buzz', a lot, and after a while, I hated that! The thing I did like was the way he sometimes wrote dialect words. For example: \\"wuddayacalit\\" or something like that. Then we have the characters of the book. For me, they were extremely realistic. Not that I had the need to identify myself with them, but I recognized all the different types in a certain way. I'm not saying that I liked them (I think Holden is a rather phony guy himself, to tell you the truth!), but I liked the way they were described and became realistic to me. Finally, I'm going to say something about the content of \`The catcher in the Rye\\" In my opinion, the story is both original as interesting. It wasn't a book that bored me after 10 pages, because it is full with adventures that Holden goes trough. I also liked Holden vision on everything. His remarks were often smart, to the point and well thought, although they were sometimes exaggerated and childish.So, what I can conclude is that this novel has a lot of different qualities. Some of them are good and some not. But overall, the good qualities dominate and they make the book really worth reading. I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, because it is written for a certain, young, public. The only thing for me that's left to say is: \\" All you youngsters out there, read this book and it will catch you to!\\"M.Geerinckx Engels"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm an 18 year old boy and I most of the time enjoyed the book.The fact that the main character in the book, is a person who is almost as old as me(only 2 years of difference)so I could easy imagine what Holden means, you really can transform yourself into his mind and you can understand the things he says. A lot of other reviewers say the book is written in the &quot;slangy&quot; language of teenagers. I agree with that and although the novel has been written in '51, you see that there hasn't changed a lot for teenagers. Despite this all, I haven't started to read the book with the intention of discovering a deeper meaning and I didn't found one either. So I don't believe people who say that this book can help teenagers to find their true self and the truth about life. Books are in my opinion written to entertain, to let the readers relax. I want to finish with an advice:if you are a teenager, read the book, otherwise :DON'T. Thank you for reading my review and greetings from Belgium."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye talks about problems that teenagers face every day. While I can identify with Holden and his situation, I find the transition between childhood and adulthood a bit too negative and there is no real development. Holden describes the adult world too negative. The story is good but I think that it isn't a very typical story of people finding themselves. The book is easy to read because the vocabulary isn't difficult but there are a lot of deaper meanings in it that make sence if you try to figure out what they mean. A down point is that Salinger goes on and on about unimportant things and that it is too pessimistic. The Catcher in the Rye was outsanding but also a bit disappointing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't really know what to think about the book. In a way I liked it, because the author just writes down every little thing he has on his mind and you really go through the mind of a teenager. (you get to see the good stuff, the bad stuff, but also the stuff of all-day.) The way Holden Caulfield has written this book is very realistic and open-minded. So that's definitely a part I liked a lot ( and I'm sure all readers who are interested in how people think, will like that to!). The happenings in the book aren't very various, but I don't think they were supposed to be, because if you want to describe the life of a teeenager in four days, it's not always that exciting and various. Also the other characters are really realistic, no drivel, just real life. All by all, it's a pretty nice book for those who are interested in human behaviour (and thinking), so read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When we got the book 'the catcher in the rye', it was quite a task for me. When I started to read it, I found the novel very difficult and I couldn't understand the story very good. After a while my interests for the story came and reading the book was a lot easier. Although there doesn't happen a lot in this story, the catcher in the rye is a good and entertaining book. The way Holden thinks about the world surrounding him, is really written in a great way. holden really despises everyone, except for his brothers and sisters. The writer has reallly made the thoughts Holden has come to life. I think that is a hard thing to do. The most touching piece of this book was the last one. Holden had made sure that phoebe received a little paper with a message from him in which he told her to meet him. When Phoebe arrived with her suitcase, I thought I was going to cry. That part of the story touched me a lot. It was so sweet!!! I also liked the way it was written. holden tells you everything he thinks and so on. His language is excellent, especially because it is written the way he says it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You can read the story plot from someone elses reveiw, I don't think I need to take the time. I have just started to go back and read all the books I was suppose to read in high school and can't remember if I actually read this one or not back then. This is the type of book that turned me off to reading. With books like this mandatory to read in high school no wonder I have not read a book in 10 years. Maybe I don't get the hidden messages that are suppose to be buired in some books but this was not an enjoyable book. I did read the whole thing thinking something would eventualy happen and it did not. If you are just starting to read books don't pick this one up for a while."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Jonas' opinion of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", by Jerome David Salinger.I find it a very good novel because it learns the reader about American schools and the reader is exposed to the American tradition. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but that's not so interesting for me.My greetings to you, Mr. Geerinckx,Your pupil of 6MWb,J.Duyck"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It has everything in it that could be appealing to any such person. The adventures of Holden Caufield are entertaining and my dog's name is pow-wow"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've looked at this book a couple of times and I never really wanted to read it but then we had to for ninth grade english so I finally got around to reading it. I suppose it was good for what it is (character sketch?) but Holden Caufield (isn't that the most awesome name? too bad it had to be wasted on this guy) is a complete and total loser. I can't relate to him at all. He's a lazy bum who doesn't seem to care about much of anything. Through the whole book, he complains about how phony people are. Well, yes. People are phony. It's a fact of life. You can't change it. Get over it. Many of his observations on people and things in general are extremely witty and the writing is phenomenal but I still can't understand why anyone would want to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, By J.D. Salinger was a very interesting novel that everyone should have the pleasure of reading. The story tells of a 16 year old adolescent named Holden Claufield. Holden narrates his story, which takes place over a two day time period. The story starts with him in a prep school and ends with him in a mental ward. The story replicates the changes of a teenager and how they can push people away.Holden retells the story of his journey in New York after being kicked out of prep school. In the two days that he spends there he has many experiences. Most of which he explains as not pleasant.Holden spends a lot of time telling how he feels about people and other things in society. He often states that people are \\"phonies\\" and how much he dislikes them. Holden seems to be lonely throughout the book and is always looking for someone to talk too. He finds it hard because he alienates himself from people. Instead of finding good qualities in people he seeks the bad. To me this represents ones depressed state of mind, in which Holden is stuck in. I have related to this book because like everyone I have been in a depressed state of mind and can some how relate to Holden.&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, by J.D. Salinger, was a great book that I recommend everyone should read at least once. The book shows the struggles that an adolescence can go through. These struggles are shown through a colorful story that will catch the reader's feelings and attention"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although originally published in 1951, this book still seems like it could have been written in today's world. It is about a typical American teenager going through adolescents and experiencing human nature. The main character/narrator, Holden Caulfield, is straightforward in expressing his ideas about everything around him. He is rebellious and doesn't cope with his problems too well. Instead he either runs away from them or hides from them. For example, he leaves Pencey early just because he didn't feel like hanging around the people there or the fact that he wanted to wait until after his parents received the letter about his expulsion before he came home. He finds his life lonely and the more he ponders and contemplates his life he feels more and more depressed.The way Salinger made the character really sound like an adolescent helped me to relate to Holden. I could completely understand Salinger's style of writing despite his use of slang. Although some reader's may not experience the same idea's that Holden brings up in the story they can certainly relate it to someone else's life.I was quite disappointed, however, that the book ended without any really big, dramatic twists. The book ended so fast and I wish that Salinger could have carried on with the story. I would be interested to know where Holden ends up going to school next, if he does go back to school, and what he feels about the world now that he's 17 at the time that he tells the story.I would recommend this book to young adults but I would strongly discourage readers who are impressionable and inclined to imitate the narrator's words and actions. It is something that I would enjoy reading over and over again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher in the Rye at the end of the last academic school year in my english class my senior year. The novel was a good piece of literature. There was language that was harsh in it and my teacher warned us about that before we started, but the value of the novel as a historical piece was great and more students should be made to read it. The symbolism was incrediable and I enjoyed J.D. Salinger's style of writing. I honestly dont remember as much of the novel as I would like, but I remember that it was a good piece of literature and I would recommend it to any avid reader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the story of sixteen year old Holden Caulfield, a boy flunking out of a faumous prep school. He tries to prevent people from acting beyond their ages, and to keep childhood as long as possible. Holden leaves the school on a journey to find himself. He ends up in Manhatten. This book is filled with symbolism. The language used is raw and edgy. Holden shows us that it is very important what is on the inside and not out. It is a depressing work of fiction, but teaches many lessons."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After 50 years in publication, and 25 years since I personally read this book for the first time, this book stands up. Whether read chronologically, or opened to any page, this book will make you think, laugh, reflect, and observe.Truly seen from the eyes of a sensitive adolescent on the verge of adulthood, this book captures the absurdity of every human nuance. Recommended to anyone who ever breathed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book had me from the first page. It was a pleasure to read. I found it funny, sad and interesting. What most intrigues me about this book is its lack of traditional model. there is no build-up, climax, and conclusion. It just is. Except for some strange terms used by the speaker, it is difficult to imagine that it was written so long ago. There are some memorable scenes from this book that will no doubt stay with me. I was very taken with the main character's sarcasm, wit and innocence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this, I think, as a teenager and I don't remember being all that impressed then. But now that I'm 40-something upon re-read I can see why it's a classic. Catcher in the Rye is VERY funny, cynical, honest, and, well, alot like I felt when I was a teenager. Yes, the main character (Holden Caulfield) tends to repeat himself but that's intentional. The book is written as an on-going narrative and it works--flowing naturally. It's as if someone is sharing his thoughts, with their attendant depth and idiosincrasies, only more articulate and easier to digest. Holden describes in fine detail his relationship with various teachers, his parents, his sister, other kids at school, girls, New York city, and society at large. Unfortunately, all the phonies Holden mentions are still alive and proliferating. So don't just chuck this book away. Give it a read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This novel wasn't exactly one of my favourite books I've ever read however it wasn't too bad, just a little bit boring from time to time though. There isn't much to say about this book, I believe. it read easy, that's for sure but I truly hated the fact he had to use the following words/sentences over and over again, for example:... and all....and all; and suddenly I felt depressed; and suddenly I felt like giving OLD Jane a buzz;...especcialy this last sentence: instead of always saying it, just do it and don't repeat it constantly. In a way I was always expecting something to happen, it's like he wanted us to. instead he just told his enire history, ver detailed and with a lot of talking. Although he didn't do so very much during those 4 days, he makes it seem like a lot happened.The main character, Holden, was a sweet guy; friendly, golden heart,...but so critical about everything and everyone. I wasn't impressed with Salinger's style too. It's all very realistic; the way Holden thinks and feels, the things that happen. but I prefer books with a little action in it, so... it was quite a good novel but I've read better, I mean it just isn't my style..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked this book as much as I hated it sometimes. I found it a good novel because the story of Holdon often relates to my own life. The reason I hated it smoetimes was that it took Salinger so long say what I already knew after one page.Because it's a story that we, teenagers, all know , it's fun reading. I often caught myself thinking : He's absolutely right or I know that feeling My opinion on school and authority is quiet the same as Holdon \`s. The big difference is that I don't blame others for my mistakes or hate society. I'm not suicidal either nor depressed.When I read this I realised that Holdon is not the kind of person I would like to become. This book came actually right on time for me. I'll have to work very hard to get my certificate and I don't want to do my year over in another school like Holdon did several times.I'll think of Holdon when I'm losing faith, ending up like him is tha last thing I want ."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, well, well!!

Later on, Holden faces many sudden obstacles and while he's facing his current New York experience he shares with us stories which happened with him in the past.

I take a look at Holden Caulfield and then a look at myself, a highschool senior, not knowing which direction life is taking me. I feel his same fears, not knowing what to do, or what not to do, or how to feel about this, or how to feel about that. Quit blaming his actions on his youth, he is merely scared.

Everyone I have ever met loves this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a book about a teenager in search of himself. Because he does not know who he is, Holden Caulfield, the main character, goes on a quest to try to turn his life around because the life that he has been leading is not the one he wants. Holden knows who he doesn't want to be so he uses that knowledge as a guide on his quest. He doesn't want to take responsibility for himself because he is not ready to deal with the world. In particular, his descision to leave Pency early and the conversation he has at the end of the book are examples of this quest and how it never ends. Holden's quest begins when he is \\"given the axe\\" from his boarding school. Right before he leaves he gets in a fistfight with his roommate because, \\"Stradlater was a dirty stupid sonofabitch of a moron.\\" This fight was the spark that lit the fire for Holden because he realized that he wasn't happy and that he was surrounded by phonies which is the one thing that he cannot stand. Holden decided to leave soon after this for two reasons, so that he can get away and have a break from responsibility before his parents find out about his expulsion because he \\"...didn't want to hang around anymore\\" and because he is tired of being surrounded by \\"phonies\\" at school. He took a break because he \\"figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying I'd been given the axe till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I didn't want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all. I didn't want to be around when they first got it.\\" The reason behind his escape is that he needs to figure out who he is before he can deal with reality. At the end of the book Holden talks about a psychoanalysist who asks him questions about his future. He is not able to answer these questions because he has trouble taking responsibility for himself because he just doesn't want to deal with things like school and life in general. He never did any schoolwork and he never cared much when he got in trouble for not doing it. Holden does not know any reason for what he thinks and he can't explain himself. He just wants to be left alone to figure things out for himself. This is not the end of his journey but he is definitely closer to understanding himself. I thought that this book explained a lot about what life is like for some teenagers who are sent off to boarding school. Some teenagers are sent off so that they can find themselves spiritually. Holden is an interesting character and the way that the author lets him come across is very true to life. The language, tones, and actions of Holden make him seem like a real person."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am gonna make this short and sweet. This book is a must for anyone.

I didn't finish 100 pages. I fail to see what the fuss is about. I hated it in High School and couldn't finish it 14 years later.It's poorly written, dry, quite boring in its masturbatory ramblings, and lacks any sincere depth. Angst? No, its self-pity at its worst. The line between a cynical critique and mere whining is crossed so far that it is a point in your rear view mirror. How can you feel anything for this character?The scariest quality is that the whiny &quot;disenfranchised&quot; teens of today still identify with a character, who if he survived, would be their grandfather. I feel that this only perpetuates the cult of personal irresponsibilty that pervades America. The undercurrent that leads people to seek excuses for their actions, like &quot;I was abused&quot;, or &quot;I had post-partum depression.&quot;This is poorly written complaining. I agree with the teenager who whined for 200 words and asked for the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\`The catcher in the Rye' is a boring, uninteresting book. Holden Caulfield is not someone I feel related to at all. Everybody feels depressed once in a while. But that doesn't mean you think and feel like Holden does. He criticises everything he keeps calling peoples phoneys just he can't imagine being like them. When somebody's positive about life Holden thinks it is because they didn't live in reality. I think Holden himself has no idea what life is about, he is just a scared messed-up teenager, that tries to loose his frustrations by criticising others. He behaves like a brat because he doesn't want to admit the good things n life. When his little sister Phoebe asks m to list the things he loved he couldn't think of anything at all. I kept hoping the book would get better but it didn't, the whole story was about nothing. Normally I can find at least one thing in a book that made it worth reading but I didn't this time. I don't understand that it is considered to be literature. Maybe it was a very modern book in the fifties but that is the only good thing I can say about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading this book was a dull thing to do. I didn't like it because the style Salinger used began to work on my nerves after a while. The language Holden uses is recognizabel from TV and rap music because he swears a lot. In the beginning this was quite amuzing but it irritated me in the end.Holden never knows what he has to do, he constantly hesitates when he has to make a decision.The only thing what matters for him is what other people think about him. The things Holden does aren't very realistic, which 16-year-old boy would hire a prostitute in stead of visiting his mum who lives a few blocks further? I think Holden is a sick person whose personality is only interesting for psychiatrists. The only good thing about him is the fact that he always wants to protect others. But if he is really so loving and caring, why does he lie so much? The intire book is one big lie, none of it is thrue and therefor reading this book is a useless thing to do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is sadly misunderstood. Ironically, in favor of thebook. Many people are often misled, thinking that this book has adeeper meaning, some even feel it's symbolic or dissects the anatomyof a teenage mind. The truth is, this book has none of that, it's a simple book. That in some cases a book's simplicity can be the beauty of a story, such as the novel Of Mice and Men, but not in this case. I'm saying that everyone doesn't understand this book! People find that they can relate to this book. It's the bible for all adolescents and teens. It preaches thoughts of every struggling, unhappy kid, yearning for attention and to grow up ASAP! To be honest, this book is an autobiography about not the author himself J.D. Salinger, (who grew up, moved into the sticks, became a recluse and married many times to children as young as 16). If this is what a normal person is, than call me weird, but I just can't relate. I know it's not fair to judge a book by its author, but I also think that the book was delivered with the elegance of a four year old child. Hearing the F*#@ word every once and a while was a relief. Over all, this is a selfishly written book, that is 70 min out of my life, that I don't think I can ever recover, if you want to read a REAL book that studies human nature, society, and other wide and racy topics, I strongly suggest the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, by Ken Kesey."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am very open minded when it comes to literature (I even read through Mein Kampf without any objection) but I just hated this book!

If the goal of the book is to teach us that we create our own problems in life, it is successful. It approaches this topic in a very vulgar, drawn out way.

First of all, all this guy does is complain. I mean sure, there is at least one thing that people hate about everyone they know. But Holden, the main character in the book, he seems to hate everyone for the wrong reasons. I mean sure, I can relate with him because I know what depression is like and I know what it's like to run away. But he hates so many people for common behavior and all he does is complain about it. Not only that, but he's also extremely shallow. He doesn't like ugly people, especially girls. He just doesn't like people for being people.

It's as simple as that, there are no other characters besides holden, no plot besides his narrations which are a series of complaints. I hated holden and his obnoxious bitching over everything that happens to him. The book is basically a review of the things he finds most annoying in life and his complaints on them. It gets really tiring after only one chapter, not to mention the annoyance of his comments after making an observation, such as: &quot;honestly, i'm not lying, I swear i'm not this really happened&quot; this phrase or something like it are once a page.

In New York, Holden runs into the 1950s jazz scene, prostitutes, homosexuals, and ample opportunities to drink himself to oblivion. Told from a first person viewpoint, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE depicts a young man's painful journey toward a coming of age.I won't try to deconstruct the symbolism in this novel. Perhaps Holden's red hat refers to his attempts to lose his virginity and his expensive lugage is a Freudian symbol for the female. Perhaps his name indicates the need to hold onto something (certainly his dream of becoming the 'Catcher' does. Certainly sex and death underlay the entire novel. Holden attempts to confront his sexuality by picking up older women, flirting with nuns, dating a school-girl contemporary, and watching his young sister sleep. At the same time, he seems fascinated by homosexuality and fights off a homosexual encounter with an older man.Anyone who has survived the teen years will identify with Holden's concern that he be cool even if it means not being able to enjoy music, the movies, or the company of the women he spends time with. His introspections on his brother's death are moving and further justify Holden's alienation from society.CATCHER IN THE RYE is a modern literary classic. As such, it is not always a lot of fun to read, but provides insights into the human psyche. Not a bad tradeoff."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved The Catcher in the Rye.

I came away feeling like Holden, depressed.Holden wants to know what makes people do the horrible things they do. Like Holden I too asked those questions and I see that many of the young people who have written reviews here are asking the same questions.For answers try: HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. It was written after many years of asking Holden-like questions in the same nave and innocent manner. Perhaps Holden would agree with some of the explanations for our world's problems!Joseph Francione [author of HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD]"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was surprised how much Holden is like me, and then later appalled that Holden was seen as a kid who doesn't want to grow up.

Well Catcher in the Rye is nothing like that. The main character, Holden Caulfield, acts just as a regular teenager would act (although probably not as they should act).Holden Caulfield is an angst-ridden adolescent. He is constantly talking about how everyone around him is a phony. He understands how everyone puts on an act to impress other people. He is a moderately intelligent boy who doesn't apply himself at school, so he keeps flunking out.At his most recent school, Pencey Prep, Holden was surrounded by kids that he didn't like. For example, Holden's roommate, Ward Stradlater. Stradlater is a stuck-up, handsome kid. He thinks he can get any girl he wants, and he's probably right. But he thinks he can walk all over everyone. A boy in the next room over, Robert Ackley has many flaws. First of all, he's completely unsanitary. He never brushes his teeth, and he's always popping his zits in public. Secondly, he is completely obnoxious and can't take a hint when people want him to leave. Finally, he is always lying about having had sexual intercourse.So because he's tired of being surrounded by morons and phonies (and because he's flunked out) Holden runs away from Pencey. He is loaded with cash, so he decides to take a train into New York City and stay there until he's ready to go home. The rest of the story recounts his adventures in the City.For example, on the train to NYC, Holden runs into the mother of the biggest jerk at his school. She is a nice, pretty woman. Holden gives her a fake name and lies through his teeth about the boy. He tells her that her son is the most popular kid in the school, and that the rest of the student body at Pencey wanted to nominate him for president, but he was too modest.After having a few more adventures of the like, Holden decides to visit his nine-year-old sister Phoebe. His family doesn't know that he got chucked out of Pencey yet, so he has to hide from them. Phoebe is quite a talker. From the moment Holden gets there, she doesn't stop talking. And she's so smart. She realizes all of a sudden that Holden got thrown out, and she is angry with him for the rest of the night. This is the climax of the book, because this is the first time you see the sensitive side of Holden, and because his relationship with Phoebe is very important to him.If you want to read a book with interesting characters, sophisticated writing, and exciting plot, then The Catcher in the Rye is the book for you. Holden, Phoebe, Ackley, and Stradlater are all colorfully depicted in this eloquently written novel. J. D. Salinger's writing matches the speech of a teenager in the fifties perfectly. Holden's adventures in the Big Apple will keep your eyes glued to the page."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading reviews for this book, I dug it up in my dad's old books and read it. It stunk. It seemed to me that Holden spent too much time whining. It was fluff. If you have the desire to read a book that goes nowhere in 200 pages, read this book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"By giving 'Catcher&quot; one star I realize that I am ruining its high average, but I also figure that if you're really interested in buying it, you'll read the bad stuff before ALL the reams of good stuff otherwise availiable. So I tricked you. One star for one terrific book. I assure you, Holden offers more insight to the average teenage lost soul than most anything out there. Granted it doesn't speak to everyone in the same way, but I assure you if you found 1 minute of your teenage years awkward, Catcher will strike a chord with you. So read it, it won't take long, as it is hard to put down. Ciao."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A very good friend told me that I MUST read this book. That it was a 'literary classic' and was her favorite book of all time. So I buy the book and start reading, waiting for the new insights to start rolling in. And waiting, and waiting......AND WAITING. I guess this pointless dirvel may appeal to the &quot;awwww, nobody understands me&quot; baby boomer generation but to me it was a complete waste of time. By the end of the book, you can't decide if you are more irritated with the character (Holden Caulfield) or yourself for wasting your time on this twaddle. Don't become another victim of hype, skip this book and read something 10 times more insightful, like &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...I bought this because I thought I \\"ought\\" to read it. Yes, it's a charming ramble through the adolescent/adult interface and, yes, it sparkles at times with obervations about a lost era of American nostalgia. BUT, it's not a something I would recommend anyone to read unless it was on their exam curriculum. Sorry."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like (probably) most folks who read this book, it was jammed down my throat as Required! Reading! in my Honors English class in High School (I guess they saved it for the Honors class because we were all Ivy-bound brilliants who wouldn't be seduced into the gutter by all the naughty language and behavior depicted in the book).Why?Since when was rebellion for its own sake considered radical in the literary sense?Reading this book was like getting stuck on the last commuter bus home next to a drunken, rambling teenager.Its style may have been \\"radical\\" for its time, but it's neither interesting nor particularly well-written. I have no idea why this is considered a \\"classic.\\"To me, an example of a \\"classic\\" is something like Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\"--even though it was written back in the 60's, before the lunar landing, it still remains an epic story in and of itself, even with the science fiction aspects removed. \\"Catcher\\" on the other hand is more of a period piece, and makes for boring reading, like most of the Bronte sisters' works which we were also required to slog through (oooh, Edwardian social mores, and written by a WOMAN! How RADICAL and RELEVANT!! not....).In short, this book for me sums up everything that's wrong with the way that English-language literature is taught in school. No, we shouldn't let kids read the funnies and the White Pages and call it literacy, but there has been enough new stuff in the past 40 years to push out some of the no-longer relevant stuff."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield, thrice expelled, narrates his own story of \\"this madman stuff,\\" namely, his journey from school to home after being kicked out for academic reasons, happenings along the way, and any old thought that comes into his head. He's bothered by phonies and would love to (and does) tell you about the many he's encountered during his short lifetime. Anyone and everyone, except his younger sister and deceased brother, is a potential target of his frequent verbal attacks filled with scorn, ridicule and/or disgust. Although possessing quite a vocabulary, his expletive filled speech is grammatically deficient. He inexplicably (perhaps because he's a teenager?) prefers the word \\"that\\" over \\"who,\\" For example: \\"What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.\\" Loathing the concept of cemeteries, he says, \\"People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday, and all that c[*%&]. Who wants flowers when you're dead? Nobody.\\" His relationships are superficial and fleeting, although he can occasionally charm. Self-described as \\"the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life,\\" and \\"sort of an atheist,\\" he is also vulgar, funny, silly, witty, profound, paranoid, disgusting and true to life. Similar in some ways to A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, Catcher in the Rye is a timeless classic filled with symbolism (all of which went over my head) and is a must-read, if for no other reason than to understand the title."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a young boy around 1950 who hasn't find what to do with his life.

He doesn't have to worry about money either because he comes from a wealthy family.It all begins when he is expelled from the nth school of his life and decides to spend a week just hanging around in NY.The story is quite sad because, although Holden tries to be funny, you start to feel pity for the poor guy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would not recomend this book because the whole book is about the main character, Holden Caulfield, and how he spends the first couple days of hiding in New York from his parents. he was hiding because he found out that he had gotten kicked out of his prep school. THe whole book is about how he meets some of his old friends and always says how phony they are, or how much he thinks they are anoying. yes...i don't like this book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book started out pretty good. In fact, the middle was fair, but the ending was atrocious.This book is about Holden Caulfield, a young man that isn't enjoying a whole lot of life. He's been kicked out of yet another prep school and he's on his way back home to be chastised by his family. The book is in first person and it is Holden telling the story. Throughout, we are introduced to several of Holden's old acquaintences and what he thought of them. The story progresses all the way to the point where Holden returns home and visits with his younger sister.And THEN.... bam.... the ending... which wasn't there.I really didn't enjoy this book much. It reads quickly, which is about the only thing going for it. Even in it's briefness, it was wordy and had many two page paragraphs, which most high school English teachers would blow a gasket over. I enjoyed the slang, but it seemed overdone.It's not one of the worst books I've ever read, but in it's in the lower 10%. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who actually enjoys reading for a well thought out story with a good ending. I would recommend it to high school students who have reading requirements. Like I said, it reads quickly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger is an idiot. The Catcher in the Rye has no artistic merit. I wrote similar pieces as a 2nd grader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being the regular cynical high school teenager that I am, I especially understood the character of Holden Caulfield. I liked him and found him very enjoyable as a narrator. He is funny and depressing at the same time, and he can't stop lying. This only adds to his intrigue. Holden gets kicked out of his school, and travels to New York because he wants to leave his depressing school atmosphere.All he found in New York, though, was more depressing things. He even was depressed by the hooker that he got. Anyway, in someone else's review, there was this quote:\\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\\"This is now one of my favorite qoutes in every book I have read. I think it really shows how Holden really wants one thing above all others. He wants to somehow preserve that innocence that children have. He wants to \\"keep all his kings in the back row.\\"Without giving away too much of the points and happenings that I felt made the book so great, I will say that this book is a must read at least once in everyone's life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book to read if you are a teenager. It is a story about a young teenager named Holden Caulfield who lives with the trials and tribulations of being a young man in a society demanding more responsability, taking away childhood and demanding an early adulthood. In his \\"quest\\", after he is expelled from a prep school, he encounters all kinds of different people and lies his way through the story. He experiences life as it is in a big town (New York) and finds himself confronted with the notion of growing up and the demands of society. Such is the nature with which he dreams of growing up to be A catcher in the rye, a seemingly impossible \\"job\\" in today's world. Nonetheless, throughout his bizzare experiences he retains a bit of a child in himself without knowing what awaits him further on in his life.Any teenager can connect with the story, and all the characters in this novel are well developed (from the school's ladies man, to the paedophile professor). The problem with this book, is that it falls flat... even if the novel is full of small subtleties the plot is not very engaging and powerful but retains enough of your attention so that you wonder what happens or may happen to Holden Caulfield, and through him, you wonder what exactly awaits you in the future in this uncertain world full of unexpected turns.So in fact, this is more of a 3 1/2 stars. a recommended read of one of the books considered a classic in american literature (still applies today even if it was written in the late 1940's)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Wow. This is the only word that I was able to say when I started reading \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and when I finished reading it. I could never take my eyes from this book when I first started reading it because of the way it was written. It was so different from the novels I had read before. It was special. Unlike other stories which use big fancy sophisticated words with complicated and twisted plots this book was very casual, making it easy to understand and relate to. This novel was so interesting and humorous that I could not take my eyes away from it until I finished reading the whole thing.I think I loved this book because I was able to relate and connect with the main character. The way the high school student Holden Caulfield is afraid of change and growing old reminded me of myself a lot. I too am a high school student who is afraid of growing up, graduating school and entering the harsh adult world where there is indeed hypocrisy and falsehood like Holden describes. While reading this novel and looking into the society through the young teenager's eyes, I felt like he was the extreme side of me.This book was really interesting in the way how it was so easy to read, yet containing a deep view about reality and society. The content portrays reality in a somewhat exaggerated and humorous way and it is great how most of the readers are able to relate to this story since most of the readers have experienced the age of sixteen once in their lifetime.Overall the book was amazing: In the end I really hope Caulfield resolved all his pessimism and problems toward the world and lived a better life than what he had lived before."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My first Salinger...caused me to read the rest of his works along with recent novels with characters that critics compare to Caulfield"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a Senior at a technical school.

The creature is smitten with it's human existence, and masquerades a humanized quagmire of mood disorders and sociopathic behavior. Salinger grants the whited sepulcher the privilege to be exempt from humanity to play humans as mere objects for wry manipulation and sanctimonious observation. Uncontested words speak louder than actions, and unchecked self-righteousness equals hypocrisy. Holden Caulfield bears a grim cloak within a gilded charm. Perhaps this book should be called \\"The Reaper in the Rye\\"."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the seminal books in American Literature, it captures the spirit of an age yet is timeless. I have read this book several times and love it more each time. Holden Caulfield is one of the great characters in modern literature, he is so easy to relate to, yet complex, he tells you his story from his point of view so you always know that this is his concept of events through the prism of his memory. I have known people who just have not gotten this book at all and some like me who it has effected for a lifetime, but even the people who didn't get it didn't feel like reading it was a waste of their time. I urge everyone to read it from start to finish and develop their own opinion, I assure you, you will get something out of it, at the very least you will be about to say, yes I read the Catch in the Rye and I thought......"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just one flaw:The narrator of this story is presented as an avid reader, yet he speaks with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure.By my count, he uses the catch-all phrase \\"and all\\" 174 times.He accuses most adults of putting on a false front, so, by my count, he uses the word \\"phony\\" 47 times. A student with above average literacy skills would likely look the word up in a thesaurus.His little sister Phoebe, who is presented as an honor student, is likewise verbally deficient. During the conversation in the bedroom, she uses the phrase \\"and everything\\" 5 times.This is especially unrealistic considering that Holden and Phoebe's parents are viligant about their children's verbal expression. During the bedroom conversation, we see that the word \\"lousy\\" is verboten in the Caulfield household.Salinger probably held a stereotype that all adolescents and children speak with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The catcher in the rye is a classic piece of literature for a good reason.

Most high school English curriculums include this book, unless you went to high school in Albania. In that case you must read this book as soon as you get a chance. I realize how much I have been missing out.Whether it's evident that the targeted audience would be teenagers, anyone can benefit from the superb narrative of J. D. Salinger. The coming of age story of Holden Caulfield is the story that most teenage boys can relate too. And as most contemporary literature points fingers at rebellious no-good teens, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" will tell the story from the point of view of a very troubled teen. This will help understand somewhat what goes on through the mind of such troubled teens, and why they behave the way they do.Times have changed, and New York is not the place that J. D. Salinger describes in 1949, but kids will always be kids, and teenagers will always be teenagers. So, if you are a parent of a teen, I would highly recommend this book. If you are not, then read this book for pure entertainment.The observations of J. D. Salinger regarding human characters and behaviors narrated through the mind of Holden are worth their weight in gold."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is probably the most boring, irrelevant book I have ever read, about a boring and irrelevant character and no surprise in the plot or use of language.

But if a person dismisses CITR based purely on a sentiment of annoyance at Holden's &quot;incessant whining&quot;, then they've only read the words on the page and didn't read the actual story. Holden Caulfield has a perspective most of us agree with but seldom express. Especially a feeling among tweens and teens about the world of adults where there is so much disingenuousness and posturing (phoniness in Holden's words) to cover up ulterior motives and advance one's personal agenda. He longs for honesty and spontaneity which is so often suppressed by peers and adults. And don't be mistaken by his brash attitude: Holden does manage to see some good in everyone, even those he says he hates. He even feels sympathy for those he looks down on and battles with his own sense of isolation. So even underneath his air of arrogance and contempt, there lies a vulnerability that softens the harsh edges of his confrontational personality. This is a real person with real issues. So don't just dismiss this book out of turn till you've really uncovered what he means, not just what he says or does.Oh. And it's very entertaining and funny to boot. How's that for a book on a high school reading list?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is one of the most realist characters, i feel, in american literature.

It's basicly about a boy, Holden Caulfeild, that gets kicked out of a prep school because he is failing every class. His parents don't expect him home for a few weeks, so he wanders around New York city. Throughout the book he calls up people he knows from the past just to talk. I also wasn't to fond of the author's writing style. He always goes into so much detail about stuff that isn't relevent to the story.Besides that, I thought the story was funny, although they probobly weren't supposed to be. I also thought the story itself was pretty good, as I'm sure anybody can relate to Holden in someway or another."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that this book was a very good read. I mostly liked it because it was a teenager that the book was about. I could relate to it. I also liked how Holden told the story. In the story Holden went through a lot of problems that kids go through now. Some are different but you could definitly relate to them.It talks about how when you were a child that you really couldn't see over the rye field and how his name resembled that. Also how if you were an adult you were able to see the edge of the cliff. You can also relate to that because there are some things your parents just don't tell you, but you want to know but you just can't. That is how i kinda of interpreted it.I loved the detail in this story. I really liked how the author described exactly how Holden was feeling about what was going on in the story. I thought the whole part about Allie and her death was really good and how he explained how Holden felt about it. Also how he kinda of held back about a lot of things, but when he would go and visit Phoebe he would act a lot different. How he would open up about a lot of things around Phoebe.Well, overall I really liked this story a lot, mostly because I could relate to some of the situations. I really liked how the author wrote the story I just thought that it was really great. I definitly suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I find this book to be a good read beacuse it gives an insight in the mind of a teenager who is confused about what he wants to do in life. He is not motivated and has a very restless mind. While reading the book you will feel as if you know the character(Holden) very well as during his conversations he also tells us what is going in his mind. The story is basically his thoughts and people he meets in a four day period after he gets kicked out fom his High School and wanders in New York.I say read it for pleasure or to find out how does someone confused and less motivated see and perceive things in life. I found it very interesting as how his mind wandered from thought to thought without making any decisions. It will help you understand the confused and disoriented crowd to some extent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can you say about this book without sounding phony?

J.D. Salinger wrote this book in first person which makes you feel like you are living Holden Caulfield's life. You get to know his innermost thoughts and see through his eyes.Holden Caulfield comes from a very wealthy family and has attended many private schools in a small amount of time. He has been kicked out of every school due to pure lack of interest. Even though he is very bright, his perspective on life is all wrong. To Holden, the world is made up of phonies, lies, and cheats. Holden has never felt that any of his teachers or mentors has ever cared much about his life, but more so the grades he gets. He can barely get along with anyone because of his past experiences with people. The mere fact that he cannot cope with others makes his life very depressing. He also is involved with many things a young man shouldn't. Even though times have changed drastically since the 1940's I think that anyone could relate to some of the things he is goes through. J.D. Salinger allows you to get very close with this character by giving you an insight on Holden's life and never letting you know what's going to go on next."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the best books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in high school and in the same span of a few months had also read Momaday, Kerouac, Steinbeck, Harper Lee, and Hemingway to name only a few, all on my own, as I did Salinger. I was not impressed with &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; in the least. So it amazed me when at university, I was required to read more Salinger! He is a decent writer, MAYBE a good writer, but far from great. Salinger's manipulations always seemed overly meticulous (and thus, ultimately shallow) to me, and any meta-view of his work requires leaps of faith a literary agnostic like myself finds hard to make. I can see how certain teenagers might identify with Holden, but perhaps I was just too insecure and sincere to understand him then, and a bit too arrogant to buy into his spiel later. Hell, if Salinger could write with a bit more color and with a flair for language beyond just smart-alecky, we might be able to call him post-modern. Not exactly a complimentary label in some circles, but it would be a step above the post-pubescent one he holds now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D.

One tiny example: the abuse of Jane Gallagher by her father. Salinger says enough in just three words to convey a bone-chill and water the reader's eyes. Time after time, page-after-page he grabs the reader in the gut and won't let go. Filled to the brim with insightful positive ideas, simple humanity, embraced now by three generations.

I feel like sometimes I can relate to Holden wanting to be in the rye, wanting to save all those children from the evil of the world. I would recommend this book to any age group, it is one of those books you can read at different times in your life and get something new out of it every time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read. I read it a short while ago, and I was mesmerized immediately. After hearing about Catcher in The Rye for many, many years, I finally went and got a copy. The Author seems to suck you into the characters' Spirit. I felt as if I knew Holden personally, as if he and I were both sharing these memories. This timeless book will always remain a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A lot of people I have talked to have either loved the book or hated it. I just happened to love it. What I found extremley important was the relationship Holden had with his sister. I loved the way Salinger was able to describe that. It's a fast read and it may like there is no real plot, but that's what makes the book so special. Here is a boy that has just made a drastic chage in his life, and it feels mundane."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is so down to earth and true its ammazing. You can really relate to the main character Holden on many different levels. Theres something in it for you when your 13 and something more advanced in it for when your 19. Anyone who doesn't like it does not appreciate anything other than boring books that are fake. They like to read things about perfect lives, lives that can never be true. About the whole cursing thing, who cares!? Teenagers curse all the time, its only realistic. People are not perfect. You hear a lot worse cursing from your average teen on the street. So whats so bad if its in a book!? Nothing. And there is not anything wrong with being critical about stuff, most stuff isn't that great anyway! This book will really open your eyes!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I actually had to read this book for my English II class (gasp! no one likes doing that!) and I absolutely loved it. I could identify with so many of the feelings that Holden had--a lot of these reviews pass him off as being \\"just a jerk who likes to swear a lot\\", but I think that Holden is actually representative of all of our inner selves. We all have that cynical, hateful person somewhere inside of us. Someone who'd just love to get kicked out of school and run rampant on the streets for afew days. He does what we sub-conciously want to do, he says what we sub-conciously want to say. I think the reason a lot of people don't like this book is that it lays out all of these feelings that Holden has, and people become threatened, so to speak, when they realize that they can identify with those feelings. But it's an excellent book, really very well written. If you would like to dispute my review, or talk about this book,you can e-mail me..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love the writing style, the main character is well developed, this is a journey of a time in his life, from devastation to finding the place when you know you're going to be ok."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"good book, very depressed,immature teenager. Wouldn't be able to roam the streets these days. I'm not sure what all the fuss was with this book. Not that interesting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield got kicked out of another school and disappointed his family yet again. However, he's not due home until Wednesday so he embarks on a trip through New York. Holden is horrible at getting what he wants. He's a hypocrite and he finds fault in everyone. The only people that he cannot blame are his sister Phoebe who is ten and his brother Allie who died when he was ten.It's been five years now, but Holden has never gotten over Allie's death. Now seventeen he 's beginning to question his sanity. He is desperately lonely, only he does not how to express it because he has been pushing people away for so long.In the space of three to four days the reader learns enough about Holden to love him. Salinger has successfully created one of the most dynamic, complicated characters I've ever encountered. Holden may not be likable but he's real.If you've not read this classic, I strongly recommend it. It's a phenomenal story for boys and girls of any age.Originally posted on 3 Book Bees Blog"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not a big reader, never have been and still not one today. I was able to avoid many literature classes in school but this was one of the books I was eventually forced to read in college. At the time, I was glad I read it since it was one of few books I felt I could easily understand and relate to.That said, at the end of the semester, I sold all my books to a local store, including this one that I got a whole 25 cents for (hey, every penny counts in college)! I regretted selling this book back almost immediately so a few short years later, I bought this book again. Even after almost 20 years, I still have fond memories of reading this and I proudly have this as part of my personal library.I won't go into all the details of the book since many reviewers have already done that. However, I must add that most \\"classics\\" are not readable for me. They were written at a different time, using seemingly different language, typically about a different culture so that my brain has to work really hard to muscle through them. In this book, Salinger created a universal story that anyone, not only English majors and habitual readers, can thoroughly enjoy. Buy it, read it, and give it to your kids one day. Unlike many \\"classics\\", this one is truly timeless."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye debuted in 1951, some 60 years ago. 60! That's a generation and more. Yet the book remains as relevant today as when it first appeared. How and why? Two words.Holden Caulfield.Holden is the 16-year-old narrator of The Catcher in the Rye. He is also the main character of the book and a true character in every sense of the word save one: fictional. Holden Caulfield is more than a literary invention. To his readers, he is real, and in many cases, he is them.He was certainly me the first time I read the book in high school. I related to his feelings of self-imposed alienation. I'm not phony like all the phonies around me, even when I'm being phony. I understood his reluctance to grow up. I like being me and don't want to lose him. I followed his academic path. Not living up to potential.Who among us cannot relate to Holden? His struggle toward adulthood is our struggle. Times may change. Vocabulary may change. But Holden is eternal, immortal, because he is one of us. He is human. He and his book are so much more than works of fiction."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book. It's one that almost everyone reads in high school but it's worth revisiting. This classic novel is a great addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The catcher in the rye is a great book,it combines humor and much more in a brilliant way. My only problem with the catcher in the rye is thatplot doesn't seem to go anywhere. This book is the best written story story I have ever read, the characters feel almost real and very believable. Holden points out many things that could be useful in todays society, he isn't your average teenager and thats what makes him brilliant."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not entirely sure why I love this book so much. I read it for the first time when I was 11 or 12. My mom told me I should read it and I was really hesitant to do so. I didn't know anything about it, I had no clue that it was considered an \\"American classic\\", I was expecting to hate it. I finished it in about a day and I read it again the following year, and the year after that, and the one after that. I'm 18 now and I just finished reading it again. I find it somewhat disturbing that I was so attached to this book almost immediately. I understand now how much I am like Holden. When I was younger I was kind of...well, slightly weirder than I am now. I usually would prefer to read a book with a female protagonist. I guess I assumed that I'd be able to relate to a character who was of the same sex as myself. That's ironic, seeing as I've never been able to relate to a character more than I am able to relate to Holden. My point is, it's hard to appreciate this novel with all of the hype surrounding it. Most people find it boring and slow because they're just expecting something more exciting. It isn't a fast paced story and Holden's constant whining can get annoying, but it's an honest tale of a confused and lost teenage boy. It's at times witty, beautiful, and sad. I usually feel somewhat lonely when I re-read it. Anyway, I'm lucky that my mom handed this to me when I told her to \\"give me something to do\\", because if I had read it for the first time in the 10th grade, it would not have had the same impact on me. I don't want to spoil the story or anything, but if you somehow stumble upon this review and you don't really know anything about this book, read it. It just may change your life...or annoy the hell out of you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Very good recording- reader is clear and entertaining, and brings the text to life. My only complaint is that each CD only has 1 track- the chapters are not separated into tracks. I'm a teacher and using it in class, and it's keeping the high school students engaged. All in all, it was worth the rather high price I paid."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was an entertaining classic. Much better than a lot of the others. But for me, this book means so much more after you have researched it a little and find out what it truly means and the deeper picture behind it. I honestly did not really pick up on anything while I was reading it and began to wonder why it was so famous. After analysis though, I can appreciate it much more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book about the life of Holden Caulfield. The entire book takes place in three days while Holden leaves his former school and roams around New York City. Most of the book is Holden's present and past thoughts. The book also shows his interactions with other people, such as his roommates, friends from his past, and his family.When Holden is talking to his teacher Mr. Spencer, they have this conversation:\\"Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\\"\\"Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it.\\"Game, my a**a. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game.\\"This shows us that Holden can relate to the other side, that isn't the hot-shots. This shows a lot about how Holden sees himself and how he views the world.Reading this book was difficult at times. A lot of Holden's view and ideas don't match with my own so it is hard to connect with him and really get into the story. There were many times that I got frustrated with Holden and it was hard to keep reading. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to anyone; it didn't change my life or help me realize anything significant. It wasn't very entertaining to me either."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved the language, the run-on though paragraphs. K tells me this is fancily called the stream of consciousness. I'm not sure about the fancy but I loved the way that this really drew me into the descriptive experiences that Holden was thinking about. Holden has an excellent sense of humor and his (mostly sarcastic) observations were witty and entertaining.His attitude is one thing I'm torn over. While it is his story and it needs to have pieces of Holden in the narrative, he was very self-absorbed and this started to annoy me about half way through. Holden is a teenager and they generally pretty self-centered but something about this rubbed me the wrong way. Cocky and amusing, his attitude permeated every paragraph and thought and it definitely knocked down my enjoyment of the book. Still, it definitely wouldn't have been the same without it. I can absolutely see why generations of teenagers have fallen so hard for this book though; it is very easy to relate to with Holden as the imperfect, misunderstood and most important character in this, the story of his holiday.Another element I did enjoy though, was how Holden, as a character within his own story, was visibly developed over the pages. I am always appreciative of growth and a smidge of self-awareness in the person I'm reading about. The side characters were well created too. Each had a specific contribution to propel Holden's adventures and were either adored or disdained as appropriate. For the most part, I agreed with Holden's assessment and we absolutely got enough background on each to justify his conclusions.Final ramblings: I can definitely see the comparison between this and The Perks of Being a Wallflower and in retrospect I wish I had read Catcher in the Rye first, it probably would have made a lot more sense. Again, it is one of those books that I wish I had read when I was younger, 15 perhaps, when it would have made more of an impression. As it is now, I thought it was a pretty good read but not one I will return to soon, maybe in the future a reread would make me love it more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Strong voice. The first several chapters read like a Quentin Tarantino scene, where I'm watching a dialog that, for some reason, is completely captivating. But then something has to happen and I didn't feel like it ever really does in this book. I was interested in the narrative tangents throughout the first half of the book, but my interest turned to tolerance. When Holden goes off for two pages about a guy he remembers that could whistle, I started speed reading. And then I lost interest altogether. While Holden is an interesting a character -- a phony that despises phonies -- I didn't feel the need to finish the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the first of three modern boyhood novels, and it became an icon. Catcher introduces Holden Caulfield, and earthiness-sex is present. Angela's Ashes introduces Frank Mc Court, and earthiness-sex is prominent. I Knew I Was Naked introduces Sean Lacey and Bryan O'Neill, and earthiness-sex takes center stage from start to finish. The three books were written in the named order, each giving a different perspective on young males from the psychosexual standpoint. Warning: The last-named will test your shock resistance."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't get it... I don't get why The Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be this great, amazing, classic. Did it go over my head? Is The Catcher in the Rye really this amazing book that provides insight into teenage alienation? Or is it really just a substandard book? The answer to this question is a matter of opinion. And in my opinion, the first theory is a load of crap.First of all, if Holden was even alienated, it was by his own doing. Everyone was a moron. Everyone and everything was STUPID! Everyone was a phony. Everyone, but Holden himself, of course. Holden was the most real guy that you will ever meet. Or at least he is, according to his delusions. Holden was a hypocrite and the biggest phony in The Catcher in the Rye. He was a pathological liar. Was THIS the point of the book...to show how alienation affects teens so bad that they become flaming hypocrites, and issue-infested liars?Holden Caufield was also bratty and pretentious. His so-called \\"astute\\" observations were average and typical (were they supposed to be some inner look into the mind of an unapplied genius? Because I so didn't get that) and more often than not kind of boring. His observations also made me roll my eyes quite a bit. And man, was he repetitive! He mentioned the same sentence twice (and even three times) in the same paragraph.So why did I give The Catcher in the Rye two stars instead of the dreaded one? Well, this book was written in a fairly breezy, easy to read style. That's important to me when I'm reading a classic. Sure, it's all fine and dandy to admire the semi-dry writing of the classic writers, but if it takes me a half hour to read a page, some of the pleasure fades. That was the good thing about this book. It was easy to understand. Too bad that my understanding is that this book is a bit overrated. In fact, I understand why it's heralded as the book of the sociopaths. I'm not saying that everyone who enjoys the book is a sociopath, but I can see why sociopaths love it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As many people previously said, this book is a book that every living person should read it. I've have read already like 3-4 times on my mother language (Macedonian), but I always wanted to read it on its original language so I order it from here.What blocked my impressions was that the print is really bad, the font is bold and not sharp, some parts are ligher some havier, the paper is yellow (for christ sake - what Holden would said), it is very bad paper. the Cover is very thin and light, I espected some better quality and design here.There isn't any Author's Biography or something, some info etc, that's strange.I had bigger expectations, I am dissapointed by the quality of this edition."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely loved \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Thought it was an excellent book with an extremely interesting main character, Holden Caulfield.

I can certainly understand why he chose to become a recluse and refuse to confront his fans and critics. This is one of the greats of modern literature because it dares to expose the sensitivity of an emerging adult who is questioning the world he is about to enter. If you read it carefully, you learn that he does not accept the world. Salinger was prophetic in that the world intelligent, sensitive teens are entering now is even worse, far more phoney, than Salinger could have ever imagined. I loved this book as a teen, and recently reread it as a parent of teens. It broke my heart."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remember reading this book some nine years ago and thinking what was all the fuss about it. During that time I was still accquiring my taste but something just didn't sit right with me and Holden. It is interesting (at least to me) that I find this book way better now that I am somewhat older and rather exeperienced in literature.What seemed than as boring, uninteresting, endless bragging about nothing now revelaed itself as carefully structured novel wich is full of life, sometimes the real life, which lies outside the borders of language, sometimes paper life of imaginary characters but life nevertheless.I read this first time in translation (Croatian) and it is not possible to say how much is lost in it. This slang of Holden's that came from the mid forties and which I find so peculiar when reading ol' Stan Lee's comic books, really has a function here.We are able to see struggle in text itself. One can observe everlasting change, one can feel with Holden on empatical level or one can observe Sallingers hand which puts him in solutionless positions and logical inadequacies.It is not the kind of bildungsroman that you may be accustomed to from German authors. There is no message which must be relayed to the audience. At least no explicit one. Sallinger experiments to extent that it's almost scarry.Maybe, from the today point of view this book can be viewed as \\"corny\\" (to use the word from it) and it may not be able to relate itself to modern audiences which is accustomed to different type of literature. Maybe one can view it as oversimplistic, old, batterd or whatnot.All that doesn't speak trully for this book. Sallinger's effort to weave the tale (which he is doing extremely well) can be observed on every step. And this observation leads you to interesting readings of this book that are very often overlooked, but they themself make this one a true classic recommendable to all ages, from 7 to 77."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye displayed a teenager's angst in a world seemingly turned against him. Salinger's novel revolves around Holden Caulfield, an angry teenager who feels he has nothing going for him in a world that gets more superficial by the minute. Ok, this book is totally awesome if you just want to vent. Salinger does a great job in accurately portraying the pure anger and despair every teenager has sometimes experienced in his/her moody world. But don't take this novel lightly. Salinger didn't write this book merely to sympathize with the teenage world. Rather, he has some crucial themes relating to a world that is unsympathetic and the power of healing and moving on.Holden believes that the majority of what's going on in his life is on the verge of being worthless. His happy life the way that he knew was shattered when his younger brother died of cancer. The Caulfield family was destroyed. Salinger then comes in to analyze the family's response to a major tragedy. The parents force themselves to quietly cope and as a result send Holden off to a preppy boarding school. Here, Holden reveals to the reader that his faith in the world completely vanished, and now he has to learn how to accept himself and those around him.It was a straightforward analysis on the pathetic hypocrisy of our society, and this was what I enjoyed the most was how easily I could understand this boy's pain due to the vivid portrayals by Salinger. Read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that this book was very good. It showed how authors have the freedom of writing. And the fact that J.D. wrote about a kid with problems, it showed how people should see the world. The way Holden Caufeild speaks about this \\"great nation of ours\\", makes us think, \\"Man, is that what we all sound like??\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J. D. Salinger has written a psychological novel, The Catcher in the Rye. This novel describes the period of everyone's life, when a teenager becomes an adult and begins to realize that the world is very far from perfect. The main character, Holden, is from a rich family, which is trying to get him a decent education, but he does not understand the importance of an education and tries to live a dream life, not really thinking of the outcome. Holden has just dropped out of another college and goes to New York, to wait before his parents get the news. He basically wanders around the big city, trying to pass the time, and thinks about life. The author portrays New York in great detail, to add to the reader's understanding of what makes Holden different from the rest of the crowd.Salinger describes the main character with surprisingly realistic accuracy by using word choice, and mainly the use of slang language. His carefully chosen words and phrases make the reader become a part of the book. Throughout the novel, the reader worries about Holden's future, and thinks about what would need to be done better in that situation. Also, Salinger uses examples from everyday life to show how the main character feels about each event; like going to the ice rink or to the movies or just walking in Central Park.Overall, the book shows the reader that life is not just a bowl of cherries, and neither are the people in it, but not much can be done to fix it. It suggests that it's better to concentrate on making your life better instead of trying to fix others. This book can be read in about a week or less, and highly recommended as a must-read classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Book \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was a great book. As the main character Holden goes through his life story, he had to go through geting kicked out of prep school. He didn't like alot of people in that school and hated the school itself. The author makes the character talk freely and open, makes the character pick his words carefully, and talks like a normal teenager doesn't care much for the rich things in life that much, even though he comes form a wealthy family. This book is really good its not like Huckleberry Finn that was dull and boring for me, this book is very captivating and interesting coming from a teenagers point of view and is ahead of its time. This book shows how he goes through his life with love and the rest of the challenges he faces.In some parts the book does get depressing with this character with the life challenges he went through. I recommend this book to everyone, it's a really great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a great book that teenagers can relate to very well. It captures almost all of the emotions that teens go through. It tells stories that most authors wouldn't usually write about. It gives you first hand experiences that the narrator goes through and tells you exactly how he is feeling. It is an easy read and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had received a copy of this book from my sister as i was going to uni, and had always been told what a good read it is. I started to read it on the way to my halls from home, and couldn't put it down. It's one of those books, that although not a lot is going on, you still find yourself stuck, and needing to read on, always feeling that there must be something big about to happen, but the event always eludes you. The main bulk of the book is nothing special, it is fairly sloppy, but almost mesmorising in the abrupt language. Not so much the profanities, but also the short comments and insults directed at not just those in the book, but at whole sections of society by Holden.The process of reading the book is enjoyable, its a definite must, but dont expect to learn anything from it. It seems to lead to a dead end, and i cannot really understand its huge following. It is a book that will most likely be read a couple of times then left on the top shelf of the bookcase and left to get dusty. Its supposed links to certain infamous killers also is beyond me. I can almost understand how it could plant resentment in your mind, but not to an extent that it has been believed to have had. But then i haven't had an incling to go out and destroy a part of society, so i suppose i must have a different mind setting to those that did find this book a precursor to murder."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of Pency school, he's not sure where to turn. For the next few days he meets with some past school friends and teachers, has some very interesting conversations, and gets himself out of some pretty bad situations. Somehow he goes through all this while still managing to have a 'Caulfield' sense of humor. The thing I liked most about the book is that Holden thinks life is phony, lousy, and deppressing. Then sometimes he changes his mind and realizes that mabey the simple things in life are the best, like watching Pheobe ride around and around on the carosel while it's raining. What I didn't like was how his teacher Mr. Antolini turns out to be a very 'special' person. I wonder what Luce would say? My favorite charater was, of course, Holden. It's funny, he thinks everything in life is always phony, and when I think about, it certain things are but sometimes it's just different. My favorite line Holden says is: \\"It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do you'll start missing everybody. If I was telling someone about this book I would explain how it might be crude but it's so real, and you can relate to it so well, that you feel as if you need to know about his life, but you really don't because you can just tell from his attitude. I still wonder what happens with Jane and the rest of Holden's life. All I really know is that if you relate well to a book, it's not phony, and it actually makes you cry when you finish, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Re-read \\"Catcher\\" after Salinger kicked the bucket awhile back. Disappointing to say the least. I think this novel only survived on hype--hyped by other people who are caught up in the \\"hype\\" of thinking the book is \\"profound\\" etc, sort of the way we all look at horrible artwork but are told by the \\"critics\\" that it's a masterpiece, and, not wanting to appear unsophisticated, we rush to agree, when in fact the piece is merely crap. I think the novel gained prominence in its day simply because the language, at that time, was shocking, and publishers were showing their \\"daring\\" by putting it out. It's a dumb book, quite frankly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield ia a very likable character. An excellent novel to remind everyone that being a phony is not cool."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My sister and I are basically literature partners in crime. Maybe that's why we get along so well. We basically will go to each other \\"Hey check out this awesome book called ________! I'll lend you my copy!\\" every week. Me being the bookworm I am, she raved about this book like it was the second coming of Jesus. However my parents both hated the book, calling it \\"dated garbage\\". Nonetheless I chose to ignore the warning signs and borrowed her copy in the wink of an eye.I'm never doing that again. Especially not after reading this garbage.This is quite possibly the most over-rated book ever. Even moreso than Twilight or any Robert Jordan book. This book took me a MONTH to get through, it's so boring... and it's only 214 pages.I can literally not name a single memorable thing about this book. 75% of the time I felt like I was reading the incoherent ramblings of a stoner. Plus, if I wanted to read complaints about life and people, I'd listen to a crappy emo band. I'm serious, it really is that bad. I really can't tell if this book has a story at all- aside from some kid who clearly has issues. Yeah he gets kicked out of school, yeah he has a crappy family life, yeah he's screwing up his life at 16. Problem is... WHO CARES??????The writing is so poor I'm amazed I didn't throw this book in the trash. Salinger clearly has a lack of vocabulary, as the word \\"goddam\\" appeared at least 20 times per page, and at least in every line of Holden's. Towards the end I got so tired of J.D.'s lack of vocabulary or lack of ways to portray Holden's expletive-riddled mind I was just waiting for the end of the book to come. Oh and don't get me started on the amount of times the word \\"phony\\" was repeated. That, plus I swear there were a lot of pages where the same description of someone was repeated 3 times but just re-worded differently.I'll admit I can forgive bad writing if the book has good story development or interesting characters. This has neither. The plot isn't a plot. It's just a bunch of rants and uninteresting stories thrown together. Holden is an awful character- I find it baffling people look up to this guy. He just strikes me as a loser. His swearing doesn't make him a badass. His sexual conquests don't make him badass. He's just a cheap lowlife with issues.I'm ready for your \\"THIS BOOK IS ART AND YOU DON'T GET IT!!!!\\" insults, so go right ahead. I'm sure it's art. But you can puke all over a canvas and call it art, at the end of the day it's still puke."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought I was purchasing a regular hardback copy of the \\"Cather in the Rye\\" and the product received was less than anticipated.I received a book 7\\" X 4\\" that was a high school copy for a literature class at F.D.

I had not read it before, but it's a classic. And hey, I wanted to see what could be so bad in it to ban it.Hoo boy! Did I ever figure out. This book was obviously banned for being the single most boring book ever written. Or perhaps the incidence of boredom induced coma was so high, they felt the need to ban it. I don't know. But I never did see anything horrible or even questionable in this book - nevermind interesting.I'm sure people will comment about what a great piece of work this is. To them, I say \\"meh\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I was that teenager, too. Yeah, Salinger writes like he talks (so what?). Yeah, it made an impact on a certain era of teenagers. But does it deserve to be called a classic now? Absolutely not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had not read this book since I was a teen and my Son mentioned he recently read it & loved the book. I picked up a copy and figured since he generally makes good recommendations to me, it would be worth reading again. WRONG!I suppose if you like reading about someone who has some \\"issues\\" or difficulty fitting in with peers, this book could appeal to you. That being said, the story just rambles, doesn't seem to have an actual story line, just randomness. I was neither inspired nor entertained by it. The story left me wondering who determines what is an \\"American Classic\\". Half way through the book, I was hoping the story would suddenly grab me. Regretfully, that never happened. I would recommend not wasting your time (or money) on this book. When I finished the book, the only positive feeling I had was now I could begin reading another book. I truly wondered why a publisher would have agreed to publish this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have always had a strong predilection of reading banned books, and considering that \\"The Catcher in The Rye\\" is in the Top 50, I decided to give it a try. I also have an affinity to coming of age novels, and after finding out that that's what this book was about, I approached the book with great alacrity. Though I dont mind the acerbic language used in the book, it bothers me how Holden can be such a Cynic at times; I guess he gets his kicks out of deriding other people. Despite a few flaws, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a must read for any J.D. Salinger fans and anyone who is in the mood for a great read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recenty read this book after my much older friend reccomended it to me. He said he read it when he was in school and he liked it a lot. I thought it was okay. Nothing special or anything, but a good story none the less. The ending was also kind of weird. I didn't understand it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hated Catcher in the Rye, maybe it's because I'm a teenager, and undestand what Holden is going through, but it was just whiny. It's like an eloquent teenager started a livejournal and they turned into a book. I give it two stars out of kindness, but if I wasn't feeling so generous I would give it one star."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It seems like the reviews of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" are fairly polarized. Some people identify strongly with Holden Caulfield, while others tend to think he is spoiled or annoying. I think there are good reasons to feel either way about him. For me, though, Holden Caulfield is one of the most likeable characters I've ever encountered, and it's probably because he's so honest. He tells you everything he's thinking, whether it's embarrassing or not. Most of the time what he's thinking is either hilarious or depressing; often it's both at the same time. But every now and then he also explores deeper emotional territory...like the loss of a loved one, or the fleeting nature of youth and innocence.In fact, although people view the book in different ways, for me \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is not the story of a rebellious malcontent. Instead, I see Holden as a sensitive young man who is struggling to deal with the death of his brother...while at the same time making the confusing transition between childhood and adulthood. Although on the surface we see Holden going around calling a lot of stuff phony, underneath his defensive exterior he literally aches to connect with other people, and he treasures the few moments when real connection becomes possible. To enjoy this book, then, you've just got to remember that Holden Caulfield has a heart of gold...it's just that he's also in a lot of pain. And like everyone else, he's not perfect. Great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let me start off by saying I was very tempted to mock J.D Salinger's prose for this review by littering it with the \\"god d#%\\" curse word and other phraseology that is repeated ad nauseam throughout the book. I tell you \\"g dam\\" is everybody's favorite word in this book. Anyway, my tongue in cheek review would become tedious, so I'll play it straight.Despite its popularity, The Catcher in the Rye was never a book I had to read in high school or college. So, I took it upon myself to read it for pleasure simply because I enjoy reading.In the beginning I thought I would hate Holden Caufield. He is vulgar-mouthed, and at times, a silly guy. You can tell very early on there is something \\"off\\" about him. But there are a few things that make him endearing to me: he has a heart; he is unintentionally humorous; he despises phonies and cruelty; and he craves a return to innocence. Like me, he is disgusted by the actions and ways of humanity. He sees the world as a trivialized, bull-sh-it world, and I have to agree with him. In a word, he's a misanthrope; but is he a justified misanthrope?My problem with Holden is in my realization that he is a nonconformist because he can afford to be. If Holden were a minority and/or poor, he would have to play by the rules of the world in order to simply SURVIVE. But because Holden is a white male in the Fifties, and has a rich corporate lawyer father, he has the luxury to be lazy, uninterested, and detached from the world around him without suffering any serious consequences.This reality makes Holden less of a hero and more of a spoiled brat whose problems are trivial and whose outlook on life would be very different if he could trade places with someone less fortunate than him for a couple of weeks. Instead of cheering him for his nonconformity, we should jeer him for his blatant stupidity. There is an obvious difference between refusing to conform to rules that hurt you and refusing to conform to rules that help you. If everybody is wearing blue and I show up in orange, I'm being a clever nonconformist. But if my nonconformity includes flunking out of school and damaging my chances at leading a successful life, then I'm simply an idiot.But he is an idiot we can still empathize with and even root for. This is a sign of great characterization. Of course, we spend the entire book with Holden, so there's really no excuse for not knowing/liking him very well.Bottom Line: A good, breezy book that I would put on the same level with To Kill A Mockingbird. Like Mockingbird, the love people have for it is more explanatory of its popularity than its actual technical greatness. It's a book that may still speak to many, but it's not necessarily a mind-blowing literary achievement. But, hey, it's Winona Ryder's favorite book (for whatever that's worth). And if you've seen Heathers, then you know underlining passages from it can be a sign of suicidal tendencies."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a coming of age story that should be read by everyone. The narrator is a dynamic character. The language may seem offensive to some, but the brutally honest story telling and reflection is what makes this story so powerful."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Jeff Madisons review below is taken from another book site. All 75 of his reviews are like that, nearly all that I have found are from BarnesandNoble. Just to show you, below is the review from their site. Look at the date, then decide for yourself. I have reported this to amazon. The Hunter has spoken.Katie Hyland, A reviewer, February 22, 2006,Recommended for mostJ.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye was an interesting account of one point in the 17 year-old Holden Caulfield's life during the late 1940's. Holden is incredibly smart and witty character, who also has a soft sentimental side. Holden felt disinclined to apply himself in school and wanted to be independent. He was flunking out of Pency Prepatory in Angerstown, Pennsylvania and they finally kicked him out. He didn't like anything that went on at Pency so he really doesn't care that he gets kicked out. Then he desides to get on a train and go to New York. He spends some time in New York and discovers so much while he's there. He took a cab and went to the Edmont Hotel and got a room. Holden doesn't like this room at all. He discribed it as crumby. After deciding his room wasn't anything to stay in he goes down to the lobby and dances with some girls. The next day he checked out and snuck into his parent's apartment to see his siter Phoebe. He arranged to meet her in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. After seeing how upset she was that he was leaving he couldn't leave. In the end, Holden stays at home knowing he would be sent to another school in the fall. I really enjoyed this book because J.D. Salinger's writing isn't like any other. He gives Holden a really good sense of humor which is what I enjoy the most in a book. One thing in particular that bothered me was the fact that the setting wasn't really talked about but most of them were self-explanitory. The Catcher in the Rye is a great novel to read, espically if you are interested in American culture in the late 1940's."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To all people who give this book one star because it has no moral or point, you simply did not read the book closely enough. There are several morals.1. Work hard now because in the future when you find out what you want to do with your life, you will be able to.2. There are certain norms that one must function inside of society.Oh and to all those who said Holden is not what I thought as a 16 year old, WELL OF COURSE NOT READ THE BOOK HE\\"S IN AND ASYLUM AT THE END. to those who havent read it, that didnt ruin the experriance and this book is certainly worth a read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The main character, Holden Caulfield first comes across as being very pestimistic about life. He is a lost soul and through the meeting of certain people and events occuring, he learns that one has to make the best of his/her situation.One thing that Holden might teach reader's is that judgement should not be based on what a person does, but who they are. As messed up and desolate as Holden might be with getting in fights and being kicked out of school, he still manages to have a heart. Reader's encounter a real person, who obviously struggles, but also believes in justice while in his search for truth and meaning in life. His heart and loyalty is demonstrated in how he interacts with two nuns at a restaurant and is also evident when he feels sorry for a young prostitute and dismisses her from her paid duties. Ultimately, the reader, believes in Holden Caulfield as being a real person rather than a mere character.It was interesting, how J.D Salinger chose to end the story. Things don't wrap up in a nice, neat package as would be expected. Instead, Holden Caulfield's issues are left being almost resolved, which is nice since it allows the reader to imagine what the \\"ending\\" would be.I highly recommend this to someone if they want to get some insight into themselves or if they just want an easy read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful account of a young boy's life. Although this book covers only a very short period of Holden's life (between 3 and 4 days), in that short time, the reader gets to know Holden very well- and like him! He may be a liar and a college flunkee, but this, along with the author's way of writing, make Holden seem to be come to life. Holden's sarcasm and frankness can be funny at times and is key to making the reader part of this story. His outlook will enlighten you and inspire you. If you haven't read this book yet, go read it. Now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's greatest work of art The Catcher in the Rye expresses the decade of stress not only going on within Holden but also within life.Holden a young student journeys back to New York after flunking out of Pency Prep in Agerstown Pennsylvania. Throughout the novel Holden hides himself from the world, the pressures of growing up, and having to deal with \\"real issues.\\" One of the most famous quotes is from Holden's old teacher Mr. Spencer \\"Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\\" This is ironic because Holden does take life very seriously, he just doesn't express this. The book has all sorts of themes, symbols, and characters. It also explores the mind of a child through the dialoged and situations Holden has to face.This book not only gave me insight on the world around me, but also helped me cope with events that have halted my adventure I call life. Being 17 and a senior in high school has its tolls. One just noticing how life is about to change and everything that I have found innocent has already or soon will be corrupted by, and how the dissensions that I make effect others around me. This is exactly the kinds' of things Salinger states in this novel. I would suggest this book to anyone who has second thoughts about life and themselves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that I am still pondering after reading it. The main character is the narrator and his name is Holden Caulfield. I would say that this story is very much a character study in that the whole book we're figuring out what Holden wants, what's going through his mind, and the reasons for the stories of all the people he encounters. He has very much growing up to do and I'm coming to the conclusion that he doesn't want to think that there is bad in anyone. That there is this continued innocence that he doesn't want to let go of. I enjoyed the style that the book was written in. It gave a sort of originality, being that it was Holdens exact thoughts and written in such an informal way that you felt he was just speaking to you. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I think that teenagers would enjoy it most though."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield has problems. He is feeling sorry for every one else, and can't see that he can't help the whole world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found this book in the bookshelves of our basement. I think my mother must have picked it up at a garage sale many years ago. It sounded interesting and so I started to read. This book takes you on such an emotional roller-coaster! One moment you are rolling on the floor laughing and the next you're crying for dear Holden. I go back and read my favorite passages, especially when I am sad, to remind myself that other people go through tough times too. For weeks after I initially read the book I looked at life through Holden's eyes. It really gave me a whole new view. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that the language is like a toilet overflowing. In some ways, I think it makes it more realistic, though. I was telling my mother how hilarious tis book was. I don't think I'd want her to read it though. She wouldn't really understand....."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in The Rye is a great book written by a great writer of fiction and symbolism. Being a writer, I know how hard symbolism is to write. Salinger has done such an outsanding job. It is very obvious that Holden needs a catcher, and at the same time is a catcher. I love this book, and I'm sure there are millions that feel the same way I do. Holden is such a great character. I can relate to him so much. I thank J.D. Salinger for writing a wonderful book. I am sure it will continue to be a success, as others discover how truly fantastic this novel is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a sophomore in high school and enjoyed reading this book from front to cover. How anyone can possilby say this book is terrible I will not understand. I have to admit that in the first chapters of the book i wanted to quite reading it because it seems boring but once you've read the second chapter you cannot put it down. Adults who say they are only hoping to pull it of a required reading list but are against cencorship are just plain confused. Holden may not be the most &quot;Cheery&quot; person in the world but that doesn't mean anything. I have read this book only once and would read it again in a second. I feel that Holden is not just another case of a manic depressent but is a teenager who just has different views than most people. In many instances Holden proves that he is caring and has a great heart that is in the right place. I am not saying everyone has to enjoy this book but those of you who don't please try to find at least a smigin of good that this book does. If you cannot you are really not a critic your just as sinical."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All I can say is thank you, &quot;freedom of speech&quot;. What's that I hear? &quot;What is this 'feedom of speech' of which you write?&quot; Ahh, I could tell that most of you 1-rating reviewers had never heard the term. I apreciate the intelligent negative commentary; I didn't love the book myself. But those who say it shouldn't be taught because it's &quot;vulgar language&quot; shouldn't be allowed to &quot;poison another child's mind&quot; oviously don't know any children. Children, I hate to say it, can be the most visciously cruel and vulgar things on the planet... The Catcher in the Rye is quite mild compared to some of the things that I have heard out of the mouths o' babes. I guarantee that the average fifth-grader (there are OF COURSE exceptions) knows at least as many &quot;dirty&quot; words as you do. What else could a child be &quot;poisoned&quot; by? The insanity here adressed? Oh look, the prevailing American attitude once again rears its ugly head: if we ignore it it will go away. Sorry, welcome to the real world. Lets not pretend we're doing kids a favor by keeping them ignorant. And, as I said before, don't assume that kids don't already know about these things. They do, especially by the age that a child reaches the reading level necessary to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many of the people who read the book don't understand the meaning. Not only is it an enteraining piece of literature, but Salinger is showing the life of a &quot;seemingly everyday teenager&quot;, but the reader realizes there is nothing normal about Holden. Holden's hatred of &quot;phoniness&quot; turns out to be an ironic twist as his whole life has been a farce and he cannot come to grips with the truth. He cannont bear to realize that innocence is something that is meant to be lost."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this has to be my favorite book of all time!!! the way Salinger describes Holden Caulfield's journey through adolescent life is extrordinary. Salinger makes you feel like you are right in the action!!! this is a definite MUST READ."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading all these reviews, I don't know what to think. You could write a book on just the REVIEWS of this book. Its no Lord of the Flies, but its ok. And to all the parents out there offended by the book, spend a day at your kids school, and you'll find Holdens &quot;vulgar&quot; vocabulary mild and infantile in comparison to the average student...or teacher."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was talking to someone who read the book and she mentioned the fact that she was very depressed after having read the book. I suppose I can understand where she is coming from, as there are many potentially depressing parts in the book, but I myself found the book much more humourous than depressing. I, too, laughed out loud at certain parts. Holden Caulfield is simply a very humourous character. Although I don't identify much with the main character, I find that, after reading the book, I am starting to talk like him. I really am. Okay, that was a bad joke. Anyway, I would not recommend the book to anyone who is very young, as there IS a lot of coarse language. However, I find it interesting that so many people condemn the book for its language, while a major part of the book, in my opinion, is dealing with telling people how absurd the obscenity in our world is. After all, near the end of the novel, Holden (although he swears a lot himself, which is another interesting point) gets quite angry at all the profane writings he sees on the walls of various buildings. In any case, although I think some of the coarse language in the book could have been avoided, I would recommend the book to anyone who is old enough and who has a good sense of humour. J. D. Salinger paints a vivid (and usually bleak) picture of the world that many people have never seen before, and a glimpse at it, as well as a good laugh, might do them good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this is an excellent book which reviews the lives of pretty much every teen. If everyone in the world takes the time to analyze the people around them they will realize everyone has been or is a phony. Holden continuously looks around at everyone in the book and sees that he doesn't really fit in but the reason for this is because he's normal. He acts like himself and no one really accepts that. Everyone is phony because they want to feel they are liked by someone and that they fit in with the rest of the world so they feel they can't really act like themselves. I realized this just before I had started to read this book and found out I'm not the only one who feels that way. I myself tried to fit in but I have now realized how full of it people are and this book has helped me to realize I can act like myself and if someone has a problem with that, that's just a problem they'll have to live with. J.D. Salinger is and excellent writer and I'd like to thank him for writing this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let me set it straight, if anyone comes to a problem in life, SOLVE IT, DONT B*TCH ABOUT IT.

But it's not, the writing is so-so the story is a bore, the characters are dated and the twists are so overly perfect that it couldn't be real life. The connections Salinger makes throughout the story are so obvious and forced that it made me want to laugh, I could write better then this. A complete waste of an hour!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You should only read this if you are seriously into character studies. I must admit that I only read the first half of the book and I had to force myself to get that far. The book is plotless.

A story about a spoiled preppy can only appeal to preppies and wannabe-preppies.People overlook Bukowski because they refuse to acknowledge their working-class similarities to the Bukster. Rather, they pretend that they too are preppy types.Caulfield's problems are self-inflicted. He's a whiny moron who deserves nothing but contempt. Readers of Salinger are gullible nuts who are just padding Salinger's bank account.If you want a real look at reality and adolescence then read more Bukowski!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a classic example of a book that would be much better as a movie. It really is just a watered down, tame Dawson's Creek episode. Salinger doesn't know how to write dialogue or project teenager's emotions, but some of the visuals and situations would play out well in a film. I could see this starring Freddie Prinze Jr. This screwy book should be stripped from the shelves and turned into a WB show, maybe it could replace Dawson. Two thumbs down, Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is very profane.

I honestly think that this book was not based on the thoughts of a regular teen. Now I am not an average 12 year old.. I take education a little to seriously, but not all teens get kicked out of school( there ALL not THAT &quot;dumb&quot; ), smoke(at that age and year ), etc. I don't think this is a very good reprsentation of a &quot;normal teen&quot;. Holden Caulfield was a very peculiar character. The whole story itself was weird. The book just ended with him deciding to stay home.

Several well-read friends highly recommended it. I walked into a square room. There were four white walls and a white ceiling. Leaning against one of the walls was a bag of cat litter. That's all.

The only reason I can muster up is the fact that J.D. Salinger was quite before his time. I was recommended this book by my ninth grade English teacher because she knows I enjoy classics. However, I was highly disappointed by the way this book was written. Sixteen year old Holden Caulfield has just endured expulsion from a prestigious preperatory high school and does not want to tell his parents of his extreme failure so he decides to head to New York for the carefree life he has always dreamed of. The language used in this book is quite improper for my taste and there really is no plot. I must admit that the author uses impeccable detail, yet there is not sufficient character development or plot growth. I forced myself to read the whole thing because I ALWAYS finish every book I start, but it was extremely difficult to refrain from cringing at every curse - used after every three words. When I reached the end, I still did not understand why the book's title is Catcher in the Rye. I found no hidden meaning or life-altering theme, I just found a long rambling of a jaded teenager. I also find that the book supports the age old stereotype that teenagers are whining ne'er do wells. Not all teenagers think or act like the teenager depicted in this book. I now offer some final advice: Save some money and do not buy this book. It is not worthy of all the praise that it has recieved and it certainly does not live up to its &quot;good name&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the most over-hyped farce of a novel.

And it really is amazing just how timeless this book is, I mean, for the most part, it feels like this could have been published this year. It just feels very fresh and modern, which I suppose is one of the tell-tale signs of a true classic novel. I didn't really know what to expect from the book, and I did really enjoy reading it. I will say, though, I read somewhere that there is a window of opportunity to read this book, and that if you read it when too young, or too old, you lose the book's full power, and I can definitely see how that statement is true.

But it should not be assigned to kids to read in high school. The assumption is that because it is about a teenager they will somehow empathize with Holden Caufield, and so be introduced to great literature. But I don't think that kids that age have the level of self-awareness necessary to appreciate what Holden is going through. It's the kind of thing you have to look back on to get. Certainly that is the experience of Holden himself. He has no appreciation of the events that are transforming him and only a dim understanding that he might be receiving useful advice along the way. So I expect it is the same with many of the kids who are forced to read this in high school. Wait until you are well past the experience, and I think you will appreciate this book a lot more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Teenager Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another prep school for failing his classes and having a really bad attitude. Here he recounts his adventures and observations during a weekend on his own in New York City.I remember being quite shocked at Holden's anti-social thoughts and non-stop profanity and not liking him at all when I first read this book. It was a pleasure to reread it forty years later and find that my feelings for him had changed a lot; now I find him a bright, charming, and pitiable combination of the social misfit from \\"Napoleon Dynamite,\\" the angry young man from \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" and a bit of Eddie Haskell, too. His penchant for vulgarity and manic emotionality remind me of a scared puppy who's all bark and no bite; he's in desperate need of attention and affection and luckily, he gets it.This classic character study of a troubled boy is highly recommended for mature readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I looked everywhere for this and was so happy when I found it here on Amazon.

I guess you can say that I unfortunately feel that I hadn't been missing out on much after all.Sure, I can appreciate the uniqueness of this novel with its brash first person perspective that makes it a different sort of read from the very beginning. That's what gets it two stars instead of one. The descriptions approach stream of consciousness almost to the point of Kerouac's On the Road. Unlike other forms of art, however, I believe a truly great novel should not just rely on uniqueness to become famous, but also has the responsibility of paying the reader back for the time invested in the reading. The problem is that the story that follows does not have the strength to hold us the unique perspective because there really isn't much story at all. Rather, it's a description of consecutive events over three days in the life of Holden Caulfield, who I never really found a reason to care about.Salinger, in my opinion, never really strikes any chord with the reader to make them care about his main character. Sure, he's going through coming of age events, but so what, who doesn't? The repetitive use of foul language and degenerative thoughts becomes very tired as we quickly get the point that Holden is a rebellious youth going through tough times. It's too bad Salinger never does much with it. It's like one of those long movies that you want to quit watching, but you're sure the director is about to make a point soon, so you keep watching. Then, you get to the end of it and realize there was no point to it at all. Hopefully, other people's experience in reading this will be better than mine, but there's surely not much in this novel to make that probable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Anyone who has yearned to tell a spontaneous, elaborate lie to a total stranger, just for the heck of it, will love the character of Holden Caulfield in this book. That's OK as far as it goes, but when assassins of popular cultural icons, like John Lennon's killer, seek to relate their motives for evil actions by referring to this book, what does that mean?It means this book can also function as a magnet for the unhinged, who wish to be free by reinventing themselves.The whole catching image articulated by irresponsible young Holden is hard to understand, too, and who really knows what a field of rye looks like anyway? Why the cliff image? Could it be that being caught in a big whopping lie is like suddenly falling over a cliff? No way to repair it? Just time for sudden, dramatic consequences?Salinger is a riveting personality, and also a great anti-hero, exemplified by his resolution to never talk to a single critic about this book, with the sole exception of a girl writing for her high school newspaper. Maybe he was tired of over-serious, over-credentialed literati types, who are too late and too ill-equipped to redeem their heavy, boring lives from their earlier failure to embrace a little more spontaneity, a little more fun, a little more high school newspaper derring-do.Whatever it is, it's still fun to read. Buy this book and carry it around and just watch the looks you get. Especially airports and bus stations, teeming with would-be foils for the next Holden Caulfield to play with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden repeatedly asks different people the simple question of what happens to the birds in the lake when winter comes; he asks whether they die or fly away, or someone moves them. People tell him what a stupid question it is and they change the subject, but no one answers it for him. I'm not sure exactly what to make of it, but this conveys a part of human nature and how teenagers feel at times. Similar is the situation when Holden meets a pimp who hooks him up with a prostitute for a set amount of money. Holden doesn't even have sex with her, but agrees to pay her the agreed sum if she'll just talk with him. Later, the pimp comes back and claims the agreement was for five dollars more than Holden paid. Holden says he would pay that amount if that's what he agreed upon but it wasn't so he refuses to pay five more dollars. The pimp breaks in and beats him up, taking the five dollars. This is an example of Holden stubbornly standing up for what he believes is right, which seems to be what IS right. I wasn't sure about the dispute myself so I went back into the book. Sure enough, Holden paid the pimp what he originially agreed to and the pimp was B.S.ing him. Symbolically, Holden stands up for the truth but it costs him and he loses in the end. It also shows some human nature. Why wouldn't the pimp just get right to the point and say either Holden will give him five dollars he doesn't deserve or he's going to beat him up then take the five bucks? That's how some people act when they are caught in the act-- they are in denial and lie even though it's obvious what they did. Like how convicted felons continue to deny their crime despite overwhelming evidence.The encounter with the nuns shows that Holden isn't such a bad guy after all. He talks about everyone else with bitter sarcasm and criticism, but he finds no phoniness in them and he genuinely enjoys having lunch with them. He gives a sincere monetary donation to them. After reading this passage, I felt I saw a totally different side of him; that when confronted with sincerely good people, Holden too is good. It is the corruption in his environment that makes him bad.Holden is disillusioned with the world and he plans to have some fun and get away for a few days before he faces his parents about failing out of school. The sad part is, he can't even manage to \\"get away\\" for those three days. He runs himself down mentally and financially even while he's trying to be happy just for a few days.This book gives a far more thorough description of \\"phony\\" than any written definition could. To Holden, phony means typical, conventional, or insincere. I've actually come across a book that markets phoniness as a means to success- \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\\" It says to smile whether you're happy or not, fake interest in and exaggerate admiration for other people, shift blame for your actions elsewhere, protecting your image, and the kind of phony things that would make Holden's blood boil. This book is very popular and if you read it you'll be able to detect those who use it and you'll be reminded of this book. I'm reminded of this book whenever I see the kinds of superficial, artificial social interactions that Holden decries. Every time I see graffiti, especially a \\"F*ck You\\" written somewhere, I'm reminded of this story, because Holden talked about how he always erased the \\"f*ck you's\\" written everywhere and how no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't erase them all.Holden speaks with authentic teenage language-- using fragments, simple sentences, and slang words like \\"heighth\\". This book is written in poor English but it's good writing because it really sounds like a teenager speaking and not the author.I've found that a \\"caul\\" is a membrane that covers the head of a fetus during birth which represents the blindness and innocence of childhood. Hold-on Caul-field. Holden doesn't want to grow up because he doesn't like what he sees of the adult world.Although Holden Caulfield feels so detached from society, he is still very adversely affected by it. He seems to be the only one in the whole story who has reacted like this to the world. Why? Partly because Holden has redeeming qualities-- he refuses to become phony and corrupted as best as he can. He's too reactive though. He needs to focus on developing himself and try to tune out what bothers him. He should more seriously consider Mr. Antolini's advice and even consider going back to him as the good friend he was of Holden. He's too pessimistic, shown by how he hardly likes anyone he meets and he even runs from Mr. Antolini, who understood him, cared for him, and listened to him. In the ending, even Phoebe blames Holden for his own problems.The ending is somewhat inconclusive. All we know is Holden is in some type of mental hospital \\"taking it easy.\\" But will he recover? I don't know. First of all, he probably won't get along with his shrink. He might eventually commit suicide. It seems the only way for him to recover is to take on the very qualities he hates. Holden tells the story from his viewpoint. If it were told from the viewpoint of someone else, they might say he just needs to \\"grow up\\" and appreciate what privileges he has and stop being so cynical and critical. He sure is a cynic but remember what they say: \\"A cynic is a disillusioned idealist.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I like Holden Caulfield, I really do, and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a pretty amusing book. I mean it, it really is. But it isn't the literary Olympus many claim it to be. Holden Caulfield is immature, crude, lying and hypocritical, yet he's also caring, sincere, open, and likable. All of that blends to make him also charming The story reads similarly to Virginia Woolf's experimental fiction, &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, though more focused, not as severe in its wandering, and less of a bore because Salinger is a better writer than Woolf. Did I say &quot;less&quot; of a bore&quot; than &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;? Yeah. Holden really is completely likable; the kind of kid you'd want to hug every time you saw him, but he rambles and much of that rambling is unrelated to anything of importance, much as is the case in &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a fast, easy read, but there are still times when I just felt like putting it down for good, because it too often becomes little more than a featureless droning, much like &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. Salinger had a spectacular ability to build a character with just a few lines of dialogue. There is a host of personalities within the covers of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and though we rarely get more than a glimpse of each we come away feeling that we know far more about them than is included in the written word. Holden is both remarkably perceptive and remarkably naive. This keeps the narrative interesting where it would otherwise bog down again. Emotional content is most often flat, because Holden has a too frequent habit of flat out telling us how depressing this and that and him and her and . . . and . . . and, is. It's one thing after another, told without any feeling, and by three quarters of the way through the reader starts thinking, &quot;so what&quot;. There ARE parts that will make you stop and think, &quot;wow&quot; in a subdued, even melancholy way, but don't expect to have to set the book aside while you wait for the tears to dry up. It isn't going to happen. It's difficult in the extreme to find a discussion You'll find a good-sized handful of things that WILL make you stop and say, &quot;Hmmmmm.&quot;, but if you're expecting to have your beliefs regarding self, life, societal woes, or the fundamental goodness/evil of mankind challenged then you're reading the wrong book. That isn't going to happen, either. Is &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; a great book? A work of unparalleled literary genius? Heck no. As with Woolf's &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; it's missing far too much to even be considered a story. But it's pretty good, and I'm glad that I took the time to read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have heard people rave about how wonderful this book is and I must ask...why? Aside from it being written in a style that a teenager speaks, quite annoying frankly, this book was a bore. If there was symbolism, I didn't catch it. As far as characters go, I like Phoebe better than Holden. I wanted to give up on this book after the first two or three chapters but I read on waiting for the excitement to begin. Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is a reason why this book has stood the test of time. I had not read this since high school (40 years ago)and wondered if it would be as good as I remembered it. It is better. It is brilliant. Mr. Sallinger has given us one of the great protagonists in the history of American literature - Holden Caulfield. He takes his place with Jay Gatsby and Huckleberry Finn. I remembered the story as being irrevertently funny but I did not remember it's profound sadness. It is about Holden's slow descent toward breakdown as he attempts to deal with the loss of his younger brother in the midst of his troubled adolescence. This may be one of the best psychological novels ever written. It is now back on my personal \\"10 Best Books Ever\\" list!On a final note, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers, you will either love this or hate it. Holden's internal voice is brilliantly concieved and executed. This will either work for you or it won't. It is very unique."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't believe I came to reading this American classic with huge expectations, I was more intrigued.Frankly, I was disappointed. The reason for my disappointment was that I struggled to develop any empathy for Holden Caulfield, the major character the book is about and is in fact its narrator.There are some good powerful themes that are very much in your face: loss of innocence as one matures, the phoniness of the adult life as one seeks to find our way in the world, the urge to flee as life doesn't meet your expectations, to name a few.Salinger's language is powerful but I just didn't like Holden and accordingly, the 219 pages was a real struggle for me to get through. I imagine in the 50s and 60s, this work was revolutionary, as it dealt with many \\"taboo\\" issues. The themes are universal and still very relevant today, but I just couldn't like Holden enough for it to keep me sufficiently interested.I won't be recommending it. 2.5 out of 5."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was always curious about this book. I have heard of it for as long as I can remember. I have seen many referencs made to it. And I know there was a relationship with this book tied to Mark David Chapman, the assasin of John Lennon.What I don't understand is what the big deal is about it. It is well written and very discriptive but ultimately seems pointless. It follows a few days in the life of a student expelled from his school and doesn't really go anywhere or make any point. I am not a big reader of fiction so maybe I'm missing something here.All I can say is if you have been one, like myself who has always been curious about \\"The Catcher and the Rye\\", don't waste your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a classic American novel beloved by many. I read it first time in high school and read it over a few more time over the past decade just to understand the appeal. Even if I am not enthralled by a famous novel, I am usually able to understand why people like it, and I kept an open mind. I still fail to see the appeal. Perhaps this book is just not for me.All I see is a whiny, confused child angry with the world without really knowing why. The child seems inteligent and caring and will probabaly grow into a fine person eventually. But the pointlessness and lack of substantiation for his anger makes it seem like a simple teen angst. It felt melodramatic and self-centered during my teen angst days, and now that a decade has passed, it looks just downright immature. O his brother sold out to Hollywood and does not write things that he likes anymore! O his father is just an upper-middle class corporate manager! Well, grow up, will you? Perhaps this was new and fresh back when there were many fewer outlets for teen angst and rebellion, but now it's just boring.There is no denying Salinger is a fine writer, and the story flows and reads very nicely. But I just do not see a timeless literary classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A book that was never assigned to me while in school, I felt deprived of the fact, so I picked it up and read it right after graduating Uni.I wanted to like the book, I really did. I hadn't the slightest clue of what it was about, just knew it was a highly regarded piece of literature and that it was the book Mark David Chapman was obsessed with when he shot John Lennon.I enjoyed the writing style. The main character speaks to you directly, as if telling you a story over a cup of coffee. The opening paragraph has got to be one of the most appealing openings to a book I have ever read. When you finally learn what the title of the book means, you wonder why it never caught on as a mainstream phrase like \\"Catch-22\\" did.With that being said, the book really goes no where. It starts off promising; a teenage boy named Holden Caulfield, talking about how he ended up where he currently tells his story from, a rest home he was sent to for therapy. I expected the rest of the book to tell me some horrific tale of terrible events that led up to Holden having to be sent away.Far from it. We follow Holden through the days following his expulsion from school and him going back to New York to eventually face his parents, who have yet to learn of the news.That's about it. There's nothing concrete about what causes Holden to end up a 'mad man'. Maybe this book has lost its touch over the years. Holden often talks about what society now considers 'light' subjects, but will interject with a 'could you believe it?' or a 'I swear it's true', or something along those lines, leaving me to chuckle at the fact those particular topics were considered taboo at some point in time. Yet the way Holden speaks, cursing every chance he gets (to the point where characters in the story are constantly telling him to steady off the curse words), would make someone think that he's no stranger to those sort of things.Some memorable quotes here and there, but overall I wouldn't be bothered recommending the book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For an English research paper, I decided to read Salinger's works. No wonder the 1950's were referred to as &quot;The Age of Holden Caulfield&quot;. The many themes of childhood innocence that is lost to the vulgar adult world and the quest for spiritual fulfillment in a material world are genius. The ideas can still be applied to todays world. It is by far a wonderful book that is easy to read. (It CAN be read in 1-2 days)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a masterpiece truthful, funny, and thought provoking it belongs on the shelf alongside tom sawyer, huck finn, old man in the sea, and the sun also rises as one of the best novels to comment on human behavior a must have and great read on so many levels."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You need a change in your life! You do! I did, I just didn't knew that until I read it. Before I read it I was a stupid kid who does what everybody do, and goes after whatever everybody go. After I read it I actually got smarter! I did! I start writing, I found a love, changed my life style, start reading some good books (Heller, Carver, Auster) and understand reall art. This book is so reall it's in-sane. I love it and I admire J. D. Salinger, for this book and all of his other books, (&quot;Nine Stories&quot;, &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, and &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters Seymour An Introduction&quot; wich you can't find here, in Amazon)Thanks you Salinger, you made me be truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was an interesting book, and very funny, but i didn't quite understand it. And what was all the swearing for? wasn't that book from the 40's or something? Oh well. I liked it all right cause I liked the guys attitude."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is much more to this novel than mere 'teenage' relations. You can read Archie comics for that. There is much more to this novel than Holden's 'course' language and intemperate disdain. The books outlines something lost; the lost innocence of society. Today, we no longer meet a body in the rye-- we merely pass it by with our narrow and flattened vision.We've lost all our Holden Caulfields..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have just finished reading this book for the third time and I am fairly confident now that the acclaim this novel has received is well deserved. It provokes discussion and it is an important and well-thought out examination of a life. Some readers may come away thinking that the story should have been more entertaining or more forthcoming with trite and upfront assessments about life. This is not the case with &quot;Rye&quot;. Read it to educated yourself... read it for the experience. For a more modern tale along the same lines as this one, also check out Joseph Green's PSEUDO COOL. Young people examining their lives has always been an interesting topic for debate."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for my english class (11th grade). I thought the book was really great. Being 16 myself I could relate to Holden in many ways. I think Sallinger's writing style is great. His narrative is easy to read and it paints a crystal clear picture of what's going on. Holden does curse a lot, but who doesn't? The one draw back of this book is its ending. But I guess it acts as a symbol of how Holden's life is not wrapped up in one nice little package. Instead, it continues on with its trials and tribulations--nothing is ever perfect."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i'm not even done with the book and already i want to read it again. i can relate to holden a lot and the book is hilarios."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I accidently stepped on this book at my friends appartment. I asked him what was that laying on the floor, and he just replied &quot; a child cartoon book&quot;. Isn't there somewhere a part of us who wants to be Holden forever... Saygio says:&quot;What is that i don't know/but with gratitude my tears fall&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is like a bible to me....I have read it more than ten times.It represents me the freedom of life,the love and passion towards everything.The book of wisdom."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was obliged to read this novel in eleventh grade. Obviously, I cringed at the fact that I was being forced to read it, a book which looked dull and anything but promising. However, subsequent to reading this, I determined that this book might just be the most breath-taking book I've ever had the oppertunity of reading. Holden and the remainder of the characters were so realistically portrayed, you felt as if you were tagging along with them the entire time. I've read this ingenius book many, many times, and not once has it failed to entertain me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I loved the main character's rebellion against the things most people think are normal. His likes and dislikes remind of so many people I know. This book is awesomely real."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye's greatness lies in its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden's life is a perfect picture of adolescent male life, in the way he sees the world, in the way he sees himself, and especially in the way he sees other people. His concept of &quot;phoniness&quot; describes incredibly accurately the vast majority of adults in the world. Salinger manages to transmit emotions perfectly though Holden to the reader, and can show even the most ignorant, self-absorbed, and phony adults what its like to be a righteously despressed and pessimistic youth in a corrupt world. Holden even beat out Tom Sawyer to become the single greatest literary character of all time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Amazing, I was supposed to read this book in high school &amp; simply could'nt be bothered. After reading it for the fourth time, eight years after high school I wish I had of read it back then. Only one thing of importance to be said &amp; that is, this book is extremly profound &amp; must be read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those books that haunts you. Much like a great film or a great piece of music The Catcher In The Rye stays with you, and that is how I judge greatness. This book is pretty much the angy loner's handbook. It seems like every stalker or mad gunman has a copy in his back pocket. I just gotta respect a book that makes people go insane...you know...like the bible. I would have to say Catcher is my second favorite book next to Paradise Lost. These are my opinions and I am absolutely correct."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Loved it as a kid, love it as an adult, an awesome coming of age that will always help you remember what it was like."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book numerous times. Although I am only 18, I can grasp the concepts, feelings, and thought the author was trying to display. I enjoyed, and found it humorous that the teenager who hates everything is scraping curse words off buildings and keeping his little sister, Phoebe amused. What a caring person and an excellent book for teens to become &quot;interested&quot; in reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I didn't read this book in school, and I haven't discussed it with many people. So I was somewhat surprised to read some reviews claiming that the protaganist, Holden Caulfield, is a cynical brat. Although Holden is certainly frustrated with humanity, he is also desperate to love and to help people. I would identify this internal conflict as the major theme of the book, exemplified by the title."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as a 27 year old a few years ago, and I completely enjoyed every page of it. You do not have to identify with Holden Caulfield to apreciate the story, which I found to be an exquisitely written representation of one snobby teen-aged boy's thoughts as he goes home by himself after an expulsion from a prep school. What makes a great novel is the way in which it entertains, presents observations and defines its characters, which I found this book to have done exceptionally well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hateful, insecure, immature... whatever you feel about old Holden Caulfield, it is impossible to deny certain resemblances between his train of thought and your own. This book is to me, not a story, but a cross-section of an inexperienced, stuck-up, angst-ridden teenager who cannot seem to channel his resentment towards adult life in a constructive manner. He catagorizes almost everyone by the comfortable term &quot;phony&quot;, yet he doesn't realize that to succeed in life, one needs to utilize some of that malarky once in a while. After reading this book, I have thought twice before voicing my various complaints aloud, so as not to sound as much like a brat as Holden. The dialogue was extremely catchy, even for being almost half a century old. You go, Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Read this book in high school read it and enjoyed it great little story and an easy read. Once you start it you will read it and really enjoy it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The customary way to look at this, is as a coming of age story. A 17 year old boy who's struggling to come to terms with the commitments and responsibilities that a well-adjusted adulthood requires. One who's cynicism and lack of obedience call into question his psychological disposition, as well as his ability to make the transition into adulthood successfully.The lengthy meditations on his childhood museum trips, the summer days spent with Jane and especially, the brother he lost, all betray Holden's nostalgia for the past. And further contribute to the question of his maturity. All together, he can't deal with anything, doesn't like anything and can't do anything right. We learn right away that he can't even keep track of his sporting equipment.Or is it that Holden is one of the sensitive ones, one who sees through it all?A clever reader isn't supposed to buy into this cleverness. He is awful smart, though. And observant for a young kid. We're supposed to question his reliability as a narrator because, well, because he's blinded by his own disdain for everything.But Salinger's nascent tendency and leanings toward eastern spirituality serve as an indication of the root of his protagonist's general discomfort in life. The illusory world, defined by material gain and interest, is ripe for all manner of game playing--games less innocent than Jane's checkers. Piercing this veil, seeing through this world of appearances and machinations, where conformity gets you the prize, the approval and a good lay, is no small feat.And for your accomplishment, you end up looking like the weirdo. It almost makes you think of Camus' The Stranger, especially the beginning of that book, when Camus' lead couldn't grieve for his mother in the way that was expected by society. Oh, the absurdity of a manufactured, or as Holden is wont to say, a phony emotion!Even though our young Holden Caulfield is smart, he's getting the ax. Again. Why? Mostly for his lack of conformity. He doesn't write papers exactly as instructed (even though there's no lack of creativity, as evidenced by the paper he wrote for Stradlater), nor does he join in the testosterone-fueled, group jeer-fest, just because some kid digressed in his classroom speech.Everyone's a phony. It's all artificial. Artificial, just like his brother's Hollywood, itself--the very same Hollywood that took a good writer and reduced him to a tool. And it'll keep going round and round like the carousel, or like Hinduism's own samsara - the endless cycle of life and death which will continue until we wake up. We'll keep playing the games, like acting in a grand, absurdist theater, just like that Christmas play Sally loved so much. We'll continue all the nonsense. We'll keep defending the bad guys and fooling each other and stealing from each other. And we'll make big money doing it. The highest calling in Salinger's beloved Gita is, after all, service to others. \\"Catching\\" others, as in Holden's fanciful vision.But going around drunk will never get you off this ride. Yes, Holden teeters between nobility and the inebriation, in all its varieties, that keep us on this merry-go-round. And that's where he's stuck. But alas, no one has offered him any real options. Is there room for a soul like Holden's in this world? Until we wake up to our own truth and integrity, and until, we have the courage to stick with it, as only a precious few ever have, we'll continue to be beaten--as he himself was, in that miserable hotel room.Because much too often, not giving in, not giving up your ideals or your integrity, gets you expelled. Or like Castle, costs you your life. But it's the only way off the ride."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To start off, no one has ever personally recommended me this book. Of course everyone has heard something about it, whether they've heard good or bad things about it. I figured I'd read it (I didn't know a single thing about this book). Actually, I'm not even a frequent reader, but I randomly decided to go and buy it yesterday around 8:00 PM. I read it for 2 straight hours, and I didn't take a single break. I was hooked from the first page on. Before I went to bed, I was halfway through the book. I instantly felt a connection with Holden. The way he looks at life and people, it was so relatable. I finished the book this morning, and I was so pleased. I kept having to remind myself that this was written a little over 60 years ago, because the way people act today is seriously the same. I can't really explain this book, because everyone has a different opinion on it and many people may disagree with my idea of this book. However, everyone gets something different out of it, and if you have never read it, you absolutely need to. While reading, I fell in love with Holden Caulfield, and he's changed my perspective on so many different things. This is the first review I've written on a book if you can't tell, but the best thing I can say is read it for yourself. If you didn't enjoy this book, I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought it as a gift for my son. I was a little disappointed in the size of the hardcover book but he was very happy. That is all that matters."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought this book through Amazon. It arrived on good time, I had no trouble ordering, paying o recieving it. the book was used. I knew that before I bought it. The information concerning the condition of the book was quite clear. Only one thing I would recommend them, and that is that if a book has writing on edge, they should say it clearly. My daughter needed the book for a school assignment, and the book served it's, but you can't ignore the fact that even though the book is used it doesn't have a good presentation.Rub&eacute;n Ca&ntilde;ez R"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book, for at least one thing, lots of one star reviwers talked just like Holden, man, How phony was that."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was everything I expected it to be.

This is a classic book that is great to read..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"first off it's J.D. Salinger, he's brilliant. This is a must read, and should be on every personal book shelf."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not really going to waste a lot of time trying to convince you that this is a great novel. I am not going to insult you if you happen to think its overrated. People are entitled to their opinions. But really. This book is more than a masterpiece. Its really a great read. It one of the great American Novels and perhaps I can say the 20th century's equivalent to Huckleberry Finn. Not because of the subject matter. Its really because everyone tries to copy it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden was a very depressed young man. His telling of this story occurs at a mental institution. He is not just a mixed up or upset teenager. He suffers from mental illness. Why do pointy -headed high school &quot;intellectual moron&quot; teachers insist that this book is about teen angst? They've probably been told that and so they pass on their ignorance. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;is a great book because it probes the psyche of a disturbed person without editorializing. We're getting just what Holden got. As we move along with Holden from one misadventure to another we recognize our own moments of confusion, doubt, and pain."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would like to sit down and have dinner with J.D. Salinger. If indeed there was one person I could, it would surely be he. To have the recall, the perception, that he has as an adult is remarkable. If a read or re-read of &quot;A Catcher in the Rye&quot; does not rekindle some flame in you, then STOP! Stop and read it again. If you don't, or you don't get something from it, you have surely lost some touch with the past and growing up. The beauty of this book is that I think it indeed touches everyone in some way. Caufield is us, at feeling our worst, and makes us feel good again. The book is especially monstrous to anyone who grew up felling different. It is at once, sympathetic, rebellious, understaning and certainly explanitory to anyone who felt they didn't belong, as well as those who did and knew someone who didn't. I have read the book many times and actually gave it out as Christmas presents this year to let others experience it. I can only say Bravo and I wish we could have heard more from Salinger or, in fact, Caufield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The best thing about this book is that the main character, Holden Caulfield is the most real chatacter I have ever read about. He's got thoughts that most everyone his age has. Even as an adult I think a lot like Holden does. He is a really &quot;cool&quot; guy. He's got a crew cut, and he's got grey hair in most of it. He smokes and has emphysema. He wears one of those red hunter's caps even though he thinks it looks silly. He's so cool because of the way he is, and how he sees things.. his ideas of people and things are so cynical and honest, that you wonder if Holden Caulfield's character was based upon someone J.D. Salinger once new. I can only hope that one day I find someone just like Holden. There's a Holden out there for everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Easy to read, funny.

I liked a few of the views he had in the first few chapters, but then it just gets ridiculous.The only interesting thing about this charater is that he lies about things on purpose sometimes.The way the book got its name is good, but the rest is just completely boring and full of useless complaining done by some bitter teenager. (it gets tiring after awhile, y'know)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the book in highschool. My teacher and I had a large difference on what is &quot;acceptable&quot; ;iterature. Her views seemed to relegate &quot;acceptable&quot; to the realm of social acceptability. What is an expression dictated by morals? Anyway, as soon as i found this book to be controversial, I HAD to read it. Since then I've read many tmes over. I Love it! It's exactly like confused college life. If your in high school and you've got a &quot;proper&quot; teacher, make sure you pick this title for an in-depth review. She/He might discover how much artistic, creative, and literative talent we &quot;improper&quot; people have."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I glanced through the first few pages of The Catcher in the Rye, as a teenager, I felt as though I could have written this book myself. The sentences are not as eloquently formed as I would expect in a classic literary masterpiece. The words and paragraphs are not perfectly styled with skill and perfection and left to be admired by countless readers, professors and students. That is what a good writer is supposed to do. Not J.D. Salinger. The words in his novel appeared to be thrown together as they came to his mind. It is compiled of slang, foul language, and incorrect grammar, but it is a masterpiece. Perhaps Salinger was bored with perfection, just as many famous artists have been. Piccaso, for example, could reproduce anything in his paintings exactly as they appeared in real life. He soon became bored doing this, and developed a new style of his own. Piccaso's artwork may resemble a kindergardener's paintings, but they contain incredible beauty and talent that cannot be found on the surface, but hidden within. Within a few hundred pages of seemingly unorganized writing, Salinger manages to create a priceless story. As I reached the final pages, I was not only touched by this story, but I also walked away with an invaluable lesson about life. I finally realized that the thing I thought I would dislike most about the novel was the very thing which made it a work of art."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think, the catcher in the rye is a really good book!

Being a teenager, Holden's thoughts seem at times too real and too present for me to accept without getting scared. Salinger has achieved here what Kafka failed to do in Metamorphosis; to make me look myself in a mirror and be scared of what I saw. And by being scared, he has helped me confront my fears and lead life with a braver heart.

It made me laugh and feel sorry for this troubled, truthful character who will never leave my memory. The banning of this and any other books is absurd. The author should be able to express his feelings in any way that he feels it no matter if he wants to use bad language or sex or whatever. It's his right. I am writing a book now and am taking no crap from anybody on how to write it because it's my own creation. And it shouldn't be banned from schools because kids should be able to read any book that they want even if they don't really understand. I was eleven or twelve when I first read it and found it funny and sad then. I still do. But someone please help me--what does it all really mean? Is there some hidden meaning behind everything?

I may be giving this book a bad rating because I was forced to read it in school, but still there are too many good books out there to waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i loved this book. i'm telling everyone out there who actually has one iota of intelligence that this is one of the most revealingly honest books ever written. as holden caulfield would say, &quot;this is for real&quot;. if you have any interest in the truth of the human condition, you better have an eye on the catcher, and that's a fact."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, actually, no it didn't, but I wanted you to read my review...I really did. Ha ha. I love this book. The character of Holden is so alive on these pages that I feel like I know the guy after reading this book. Sure, some people may not think that Jane Gallegher keeping all of her kings on the back row is interesting reading, but that does not go for this little black duck. I enjoyed every detail and every nuance that made this book a real classic. Holden's dislike for phonies is what drives him to become such a messed up kid. Haunted by thoughts of his dead brother, Allie, he sometimes think that he is really crazy. But inspired by his little sister, Phoebe, he finds a reason to give life at home another shot. Don't forget about the S.O.B. Maurice and his little female friend...Ha ha. Anywho...I really thought this book was good, I really did. You have to be in a mood to read this book, you really do. If you are not in a mood to read this book then you shouldn't read it. You really shouldn't. Just kidding. That is how the book goes. It gives the book a flavor that you may have never experienced before. Read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved it. You have to read it to understand. It is so amazing and inspiring and entertaining, just... wow."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield - The ultimate image of a confused, contradicting, moody, iconoclastic, adventurous, brutally honest, and searchingly rebellious teenager perplexed by the flatulating, artificial behavior of his peers stuck in their &quot;good school&quot; pre-Ivy league training environment known as Pencey prep school. After a final betrayal from his roommate concerning a girl, Jane, he knew very well, Holden knowing that he is going to be expelled for flunking 4 out of 5 classes decides to hit the road early.He arrives in NYC, his hometown and in a period of 2 days, this seventeen years old goes on a spending spree amusing himself with all the glitz and glamour that NYC has to offer. Barhopping, girl scouting, cigar chain smoking, and reuniting with people from his past, Holden goes through a spiraling swirl of experiences with most of them leaving him left in the dark with only a beer in one hand, regret in the mind, and a trickling, diminshing wad of cash in the other hand.Dealing with depression, trust, a longing for escape from dependencies and repetative life, an attempt to find one's passion, interests, and right environment, and lastly girl, girls, girls, Salinger strikes a chord with a lot of people who have doubted whether the by-the-book, staight-edged course that has been set out for them to complete, is really the right and rational passage on should take.The fact that Holden finds a rejuventated spirit in being with his upbeat and insightful younger sister when he's faced with the reality of how his negative actions disrupt her mental focus, he reconciles with his rebellious nature and seems to learn be on a path to learning the importance of patience and discipline, something all rebellious independently minded young adults have had to learn, many times through such a hazy, spinning, rollercoaster-riding, tornadic ride that saw Holden Caufield exemplify the inner workings of a teenage in American Society in only a matter of two days. This book is a right of passage and must be read by every questioning, doubting, mystified teenager as well as those looking back on how they've changed/not changed by re-reading and reminiscing on their own lives in their later years."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger records teenager Holden Caulfield's thoughts and actions in a first person tone in this book. Salinger deftly employed colloquialism and literary eloquence in expressing Caulfield's inner psychological battles as that of a typical teenager. The book reflects the main character's coming of age struggles in the reflection of the American society. For anyone who has lived through adolescence, this book will conjure up great memories, though not necessary nostaligia. At times, the stubborness of Caulfield vexes the reader. That's precisely when the book achieves its merits. Worth reading, fast page turner too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, okay... maybe not quite, but it's pretty damn good. I was indeed forced to read this book for school, but I'm glad that I was. Holden is just soooo right about everything. Read it, hopefully you'll see what I mean. Some people say that it's a depressing book, but I would say the opposite. I was feeling somewhat down when I started reading it but by the end I felt much better. (Yeah, I read it in one sitting, it's that kind of book--read it now.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield, the protagonist in Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, is a wry, funny, though somewhat depressing individual. Wise behond his years, Holden finds so much of daily life to be filled with phoniness and ambiguity. His &quot;job,&quot; as it were in a manner of speaking, is to save children from falling over the edge into adulthood. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a page-turner and I would highly recommend it. Even fifty years after its first being published, it rings true.Another book about a young man's battle with the powers that be is a much more recent novel titled &quot;Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf&quot; by Asher Brauner. It tells of a young man in modern days. This young man is similarly disenchanted with life. But he becomes involved with a girl who pulls him into political action. &quot;Love Songs&quot; is extremely humorous too, I found myself often laughing aloud."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" reminded me of waiting for a bus for about three hours, getting up to get the newspaper and then missing it. It wasn't that it was tedious, because I was hooked from nearly the beginning to the end, and it wasn't that it was poorly written, because J.D. Salinger wrote from the perspective of a confused and angry seventeen-year old so perfectly, I just about believed that Mr. Salinger was Holden Caufield. But after finishing the book, I was left with an unusual feeling that I couldn't quite put my finger on, until a day or two after reading the book. That feeling would have to be disappointment; the ending came a little too abruptly. I wish it would have continued into Holden's adult life. I would have liked to see what sort of places he would travel to, what adventures he would face and what people he would encounter. In conclusion, I thought \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was an interesting and well thought out tale of innocence lost, and was clearly ahead of its time in philosophy and structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This will be the normal cliche reveiw for this book. I read it a year ago amazingly (in others opinions) at age 13. The book completly blew me away. It was the first book in my short life I could really relate to. It gave me a completly new out look on life. Catcher in the Rye also started my love afair for everything Salinger. If you haven't read this book it will change your life. Okay maybe not change your life but change the way you look at things. I know everyone will look at this reveiw and critque the poor writing ect. but it was written by a tired 14 year old girl.If you enjoyed this book check out everything else Salinger wrote. Also read A Sperate Peace by John Knowles (i think)and read The Bell Jar by Slyvia Plath. Thanks a bunch for taking the time to read this-Ashley"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must say, I was awfully surprised at the number of negative comments that were left on this book. I happened across this book in the store and the clean-cut cover got my attention. I picked it up, knew it was a classic, and figured I ought to read it before I headed off to college. As soon as I started reading, I couldn't put it down! I was instantly drawn in to Holden's cynicism and wit. The book didn't have a twisting plot, but that is what makes it so great! It's a thought provoking book, for sure, so if that is what you are looking for in a book, read this! I must say, it's become my all time favorite book, right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird. This a fantastic classic, and after you read it, you'll know why."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a high school student and I guess it's uncommon that I haven't had to read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. I read it on my own because I've heard a lot about it. It was even mentioned in a movie, &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;. I was disappointed to say the least. I did enjoy some parts, but I think all the hype about it being a classic and all got my hopes up. I frequently found myself trying to discover what the point of the book was. Holden was really just a lazy student who liked scotch. He wasn't unique or dynamic in any way. It's not bad if you have to read it, because then you're at least going to get credit for it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For a book written in the 50's--well, it's pretty 'goddamn' good and courageous. I suppose it was the first of it's kind--a realsitic view into the typical adolescent. after all, we aren't all perfect straight-a straight thinking kids. I liked it for it's honesty and it was funny, sweet and beautiful at parts, too.Holden Caulfiend is the biggest dweeb, though, oh my god. An interesting, vivid character, though. I recommend you read it...just to see"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Rereading this again after almost half a century, I am struck by its brilliance, its compression, and its truth. Despite the fact that Holden Caulfield is rich and preppy and that much of his slang is irretrievably dated, his feelings might be those of any intelligent and self-aware teenage boy wanting to be part of the sophisticated adult world and yet condemning it as phony. You can feel him trying to establish his own identity, succeeding already in his unique voice, yet rejecting anything that might measure him against standards not his own. I was also struck by his flashes of sheer goodness: loyalty, compassion, huge generosity, and a clear if reluctant sense of morality. Although he is almost embarrassed by these, one feels that they will carry him through, and that this alienated adolescent will not ultimately end as a drop-out."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 10 years old and I just read the Catcher in the Rye.It was an excellent book and I reccomend it to everybody.The main character(Holden Calufield)is an underage smoker and drinker and he hates school.He also got kicked out of every prep school he'd been to for bad grades.So I would not hold him up as an example of good behavior.But it was still funny and entertaining anyway."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I enjoy reading and I haven't read all the so-called &quot;classics&quot; so every once in a while I'll pick one up to see what all the 'fuss' is about and to say that I've actually read it. This way I don't have the bias of teachers and/or professors etc.Perhaps it is my upbringing but Catcher in the Rye, for me, was in a word, boring. Holden Caulfield, to me, was not a &quot;psychologically challenged&quot; youth but a whiny teenager who needed a good kick in the pants. It was well written but I found myself continually asking &quot;what's the point?&quot; and when I reached the end my reaction was &quot;That's it?? That's all?&quot; I suppose 'intellectuals' will insist I missed the point but I will remain off the bandwagon and say that I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't seem to quite grasp why some people just dislike &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. One negative reviewer said just read the Cliff Notes version to spare the time. If you really want to find the true emotion in the book, READ IT. Sure, the protagonist, Holden Caufield is basically a messed up, immature person who has problems with life but if he didn't exist, there would have been no story. The basic summary is about a problematic 16 year old who hasn't lost his virginity and complains and questions things about life as he is kicked out from his fourth boarding school and tries to put things together by going to New York, his hometown. The book is well written even though he uses a lot of cuss words. It tells a message on his views on the adult world thinking that school is nothing but an ongoing path just to get a job and making money. Holden just doesn't want to accept the adult life and doesn't want to grow up and be part of society. And Holden explains this through his bad experiences in life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the rebel trying to escape from society but if you just seem to hate that and don't want to read about some guy who complains a lot, then this book is probably not for you. Not the best book I've read, but still worth the time if you're interested. It is J.D. Salinger's best work and if you want to read more of his works, read the short story &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot;. It's not as good as Catcher in the Rye, but with some good analysis, you'll be able to find the inside track."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Somehow I, a quite literate person, managed to live 31 years without reading this book. I never really took the time to see what it was about; I just pictured some guy out in a rye field, and the notion did not strike me as interesting. I hope no one else has such an idea because this book is inherently honest, gripping, and interesting. This is really a story of young angst , and it should really appeal to young people. I actually see a lot of Holden Caulfield in myself, which is not necessarily a good thing. However, I think there is some of Holden in almost everyone because Holden thinks and says the things that many people think (but perhaps will not admit). This guy hates everything and everybody at some point. One minute, he does something he doesn't want to do because he is afraid of looking foolish. The next minute, he rushes headlong into a conversation full of tall tales and impassioned statements and requests he may or may not even mean. Ironically, such maniacal conversations often reveal the deepest truths about himself. Through it all, he questions why he does certain things, and repeatedly asserts that he is crazy.What struck me most is the way seemingly small and arbitrary things depressed him. The same thing happens to me, and such little things can actually be more depressing than major traumas. These are feelings I have never been able to really explain, nor have I attempted to do so, yet Holden seems to express my own strange feelings clearly and eloquently. He is just a confused young man, scarred by the death of his younger brother. As he is away at school(s) so often, he is left quite lonely, yet he does not really know how to relate to other people. The guy is to some degree a typical teenager, it seems to me, searching for a direction in life. In his own mind, bothersome things happen to him all the time, and he is constantly disgusted by the action of phonies all around him. Like him or not, Holden is no phony.In a way, I'm not sure why this book is such a critical success. It doesn't read like a traditional classic of literature, especially with the abundant cursing. I consider this to be a painfully real and honest story, reflecting a very important viewpoint on life and society. It pulls no punches, and it offers no apologies. As a result, Holden Caulfield is one of the most \\"real\\" fictional characters in all of literature. While some readers may not like him, almost everyone can understand him, sympathize with him, and even learn from him. This book is one to be read and read again. I wish the story had gone on, that some of my questions had been answered. Part of the point, though, seems to be that there really are no answers to be found.I would recommend this book to anyone. It should especially appeal to young people. It's relatively short, and it is realistic and gripping from start to finish. While he is not a hero, Holden will become a soul mate of sorts to folks who are lonely and confused about their places in life. If for no other reason, read it because it is a perpetual target of the banned books crowd. There is a lot of cursing in these pages, but it is nothing extreme or unfamiliar to anyone out there who doesn't live in a convent. I believe the cursing is actually necessary in terms of truly bringing Holden to life. Concentrate on the story, not the words. I have an old copy of this book, and on the cover are these words: \\"This unusual book may shock you, will make you laugh, and may break your heart--but you will never forget it.\\" That pretty much says it all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Most people who have not read Catcher in the Rye believe it to be about some old boring literary stuff that takes place a long time ago and is about things that don't pertain this day and age. I was one of these people and I couldn't have been more wrong.Catcher in the Rye is a story of a 16 year old boy, Holden Caulfield, who just got kicked out of his private school because he never did what he was supposed to such as going to class and doing homework. Being kicked out a few days before Christmas break enabled him to have some time to himself to do as he pleases in near by New York City. With money in his pocket Holden does what any 16 year old male would do, he gets drunk and interacts with prostitutes.The story is told in first person by Holden which creates a very smooth flow of descriptions, emotions, and situations. Along the way Holden gives his ensight on all sorts of subjects from his thoughts on girls to why Jesus wouldn't have sent Judas to Hell. The style of the first person story telling is one of the most unique parts of the book and will keep the reader from putting the book down.This story can be read by teenagers on up but it is NOT for children. Catcher in the Rye is entertaining and a very fast read. It is an excellent choice for a high school book report as the teacher will be highly satisfied with the students choice and the student will have a great time reading it. Bad language runs rampant through the story as well, however, so if &quot;GD&quot; is a problem for you then steer clear of this novel. Otherwise, Catcher in the Rye is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden was at times interesting, at times VERY boring. He really does ramble and a lot of that rambling has nothing to do with anything. Still a good book, though. Still worth reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've spent the past half hour at work reading the reviews of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; &lt;blowing UPenns money&gt;. I first read this book a few years back when I was 16 years old. It was assigned to us for an English class. I suppose that's how most teenagers get their first glimpse of Holden Caulfield. Most of the reviews have already covered what I consider to be some of the more critical themes within the novel. However, I wanted to point out a portion of a rather recent movie that deals eloquently and poignantly with the major theme of emotional paralysis that Salinger so lucidly portrays by way of Holden. &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;, a movie that stars Stockard Channing, Will Smith, and Donald Sutherland, contains an incredibly articulate monologue related to the aforementioned theme. It's one of the most artfully done movie scenes I think I've ever viewed. I urge you ALL to rent this movie &lt;in addition to the scene related to Catcher, it is a fantastic film&gt;.Furthermore, I wanted to commend Salinger on one of the most accurate and forthright portrayals of a clinically depressed teenager I have ever encountered within all of literature. The beauty of this novel, for me, was the inclusion of all of Holden's faults w/o apologies. Finally, when we look at adolescents today and recognize the same fear, foibles, insecurities, and hubris that we see in Holden I think it behooves us to realize that all of these perceived character flaws are without premeditation and more so are the result of a naivete that is probably the closest thing we have to innocense in society today. The quality of the reviews of this book is truly a testament to the universality of the adolescent experience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought the book because I knew it was a classic. I didn't know anything about it when I started reading. My first impression was one of humor. I smiled to myself as I read Holden Caulfield's comments and perceptive observations about people.The bond between reader and protagonist is made right from the start. Salinger writes in a very conversational style. It flows easily. The use of short and succinct phrases and sometimes one word sentences makes a sharp point. Salinger is a deft writer, entertaining his reader with his colorful language and writing style. I found it hard to put the book down especially as I gained momentum and read to the final chapter. I liked the insight given into Holden's life experiences and innermost thoughts and emotions. He is, by his own admission, a very depressed young man trying to deal with the challenges life hands him. I was however, slightly disappointed with the ending."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this crap in high school of my own accord, so please don't think that I don't enjoy reading. I do! Reading rocks!Reading this garbage however, is painful. The main character is spoiled, whiney and obnoxious. The author fails to make the reader care about the main character, Holden. Follow that with the fact that nothing happens in the book and you realize that this is 200 plus pages of crap. Seriously, the manuel to my camera is more interesting. It's overrated bunk that appeals to other spoiled, angsty teenages, and those that find said characteristics appealing.The best thing about this book is that for some odd reason, it's still ever-so-popular and one can still sell it used at a bookstore or here on amazon, and some more schmuck will actually buy it.I hated this book when I was an agnsty teen and I hate it 10 years later. If I could give it less than one star, I would."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is supposed to describe the universal teenager and reveal all the problems a teenager faces. However, the book fails miserably. Holden is not a typical teenager, but rather a deluded child. The central images of death, sex, and innocence do not combine well. Salinger attempted to write a novel giving insight to every teenager's life, but all he does is focus on the phoniness of society, and the breakdown of Holden Caufield. Holden Caufield is portrayed as a typical teenage male, obsessed with death and sex. He wants to devote his life to protecting the innocent, yet he is far from being pure. Holden's younger brother died two years ago, but Holden still talks to him. Holden remembers anything that has to deal with death or sickness because he fears death. Salinger saturates the book with references to Holden's fixation on death. Holden is also haunted by his sexuality. He describes himself as a sex maniac, but he can not bring himself to actually use a prostitute. Salinger again gives the reader detail after detail proving how much Holden thinks about sex, but he never quite gets there. Holden does not like &quot;phony&quot; people or &quot;phony&quot; things, but Holden is the phoniest person in the book. Holden acts like he is the best person to stand on the cliff and catch the children playing in the rye, but he is not innocent. Holden, as the narrator, gives a skewed view of society that is not very accurate. Phoebe should have been the narrator of the story because she has control of her feelings and she thinks things through. Also, she represents the innocence Holden is trying to protected. She can be influenced, like any normal human being, but she gives a more accurate view of society than Holden. Phoebe is the person who keeps Holden in check because she has not been corrupted. Salinger's style makes this book easy to read, but the constant cussing makes the book a struggle. Also, Salinger uses the same phrase, &quot;that kills me&quot;, in so many different ways it is sometimes difficult to catch the meaning. Salinger is not realistic in describing his characters. Phoebe and Allie are too perfect. They are portrayed that way because of the way Holden sees them, but Holden is disillusioned. Holden himself is not an accurate portrayal of a teenager. I sympathize with Holden because he is so confused, but I do not agree with Salinger's description on the &quot;normal&quot; teenager. Overall, I think The Catcher in the Rye was a well-written novel with lots of symbolism to connect its major themes, but the themes did not mesh and the book was not realistic, so I did not like it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Phony. It's the only word that can actually describe this book. Most of the reviews I have read tell me its such a great book because it truthfully describes a teen's life. Some people even tell me that they are in love with Holden Caulfield, but that's another story... I had to read a book of my choice for my English class. I chose The Catcher in the Rye because I had heard so many great things about this book from movies and people. After only ONE page I became bored with this book. I don't like how Holden always begins to think about something else when he is already thinking of something. For example, on the second page he keeps talking about being at the football game and then starts to think about past games for no apparent reason. The profanity in the book was not that much of a bother to me. The only reason someone should ever want to read this book is if they have to do it for an English assignment or for their job. I rate this book with a star because of its poor story, and boring style. Finally if Amazon would of let me give it zero stars I would have because I truly believe that is what it deserves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although this book is world known and acclaimed, in my opinion, The Catcher in the Rye is over rated. I heard so many higholy esteemed remarks about this book. People had told me it related to the youth of today so accurately. They told me the main character, Houlden, had to deal with many of the same things we deal with today. This statement in some areas could be considered somewhat correct, but it one sense, it is incorrect. I am a junior in high school and the only thing that Houlden and I have in common is that we are both seventeen. Houlden does not apply himself in school, like I apply myself in school, and when he fails he blames it on other people. he runs away from his problems, and it seems he tries to find all the negatives in life. I noticed how ignorant and immature Houlden was by how he dealt with people. This book also suggests that it is okay to not to try your hardest and grow up into a responsible adult. It gives readers a wrong idea of what is important in life. I would not recommend this book to people who would be influenced by Houlden's behavior. This book was a easy book to understand and read through though. It is a good book to say that you have read it, because most people have."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This masterpiece was like a light house to my lost soul floating on the dark sea last winter..

The proverbial \\"literary community\\" wants people to think that this book was a turning point in society because people never realized that teenagers had the thoughts and feelings highlighted in this work. To that I say, \\"People never realized it because teenagers shouldn't have these feelings!\\" Today's media is filled with the problems of over-privileged teens (MTV's Laguna Beach)who are exactly like Holden Caufield: screw ups who can't get their acts together and have a general poor attitude about their life. Students, and high school students especially, should be reading books that make them more worldly and teach them about how \\"the other half\\" live.

This is the first book I have ever read in my entire life where I could actually put it down and not look forward to reading it where I left off. Most of the time I get a book I read it until I can't see anymore, then sleep and finish it the second day. NOT THIS ONE!

I am mainly bitter about The Catcher in the Rye because i always hear how good it is, blah blah blah, so i read it, and its basically about a 16 year old kid who needs to go to a correction facility.

The 50's was a time of teen angst and revolution when American teens moved to the suburbs and began to live life through their cars. Car culture also encourage rebellion against their parents, the rebel without a cause, James Dean and others led the pack of teens carving out a new American identity.

It made me laugh, cry, etc. etc. And in the end I felt changed in the most significant way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Length:: 7:04 Mins"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I first read this in High School for summer reading that we were required to do. It is a story of a boy coming into adulthood and shows the trials and tribulations that he goes through during his schooling and life. I didn't totally understand Holden's point of view or where Salinger was coming from the first time I read it, but then I read it again and again. Each time I read it I was enlightened by Holden's take on people and reality to him. When reading this book you can't help but kind of relate to Holden and the craziness that he is going through. There is a very unique style of cynicism that Salinger brings to this book. Holden shares many of his life struggles through this book and some of us may have gone through them or know someone that has. That is what makes this book very relatable. Holden's brother is dead, he failed out of one school and now is in a prep school where he believes that everyone is phony. Holden hates life and the world not because they are bad, but because he doesn't know how to adapt in the world where fake people live. Holden tells everyone what he feels and never holds back.This book is well worth the read over and over again. I highly recommend this book to anyone, old or young."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book should be mandatory for every 14-16 year-old to read. It applies more for that age, but I just reread it after about 30+ -years and it still applies for life. The voice is unmistakable as one of an adolescent in serious doubt about growing up. The transition from child to adult is difficult, but this book gives such a great account of it. The metaphor of catching children about to fall off a cliff is fitting. It is unfortunate that Salinger will be remembered more for his lifestyle in his later years than this book. Or some notorious killers had it in their possesion when they did their deeds. But it will always live as one of the great books of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It seems a bit presumptuous to review a classic of the caliber possessed by \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", but the book is so foundational in modern society that it's impossible for me to simply bypass. Salinger will enjoy a permanent place among the greats of American literature and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" will always be remembered as a book with such intense perspective into teenage rebellion and detached apathy that it became one of America's most censored book.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" follows the exploits of Holden Caulfield following his expulsion from boarding school as he seeks temporary solace in order to delay relaying his failure to his parents. Honestly, there isn't anything particularly exciting about Holden's exploits... instead what makes the book so influential is Holden's insights and observations as he waits out the days until he must reveal his plight to his parents. Holden finds himself in a number of adult situations including drinks in piano bars and encounters with prostitutes and pimps... each situation revealing his bizarre state of mature (that of an individual stuck somewhere between the wisdom of a 12 year old boy and a 50 year old man).\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a must read. The detachment that Holden views the world with can at times be disturbing, but it's also extremely thought provoking. Salinger manages to weave an entire existentialist narrative into a simple story involving a delinquent teen. In this existentialist narrative, Salinger provides prolific insight and vivid commentary. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" will not cause you to commit suicide or go on a shooting rampage, in fact much of the controversy seems to have been inflated by overly conservative censors. Holden will challenge your world view and often forces readers to question the certainty of the most certain social institutions."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is without doubt the best book I have ever read. I see so much of my cynical self in Holden Caulfield, and I guess many people do - that's why the book is so good. It illuminates even the smallest and seemingly insignificant of human thoughts. Salinger's book is simple yet complex, as is the main character. A joy to read and re-read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really enjoyed this book and strongly recommend it to adult readers who have kids. It reminded me how quick and heavy the thinking of a teenager can be. I was engaged from the moment I picked up the book and I never got bored the entire time I read. I am only sorry I finished the book so quickly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The themes of this book and the strong voice of Holden are most likely what have pulled in so many young readers. He is so easy to relate to because of his situation. He is surrounded by people he can't stand, his moods fluctuate at the drop of the hat, he doesn't care about what the adults in his life think he should care about, he is searching for authenticity, and yet he is able to see and capture the beauty in the littlest moments. These are the emotions and interests of a teenager, and it is always nice to feel really connected to the character you are reading about.The search for and subsequent moments with Phoebe were priceless, and it was nice that Holden had this connection to bring him down to Earth once in a while. Without Phoebe he probably would have set off on his great American roadtrip, which would have been exciting to read, but ultimately would have left Holden unfulfilled just as his adventure in New York City did.It is so refreshing to see a male character - in a book that is so great for boys - who has interests that aren't \\"typical\\" of adolescent boys. Admitting his flaws and his disinterest in cars and sports makes him seem very real and heroic. He is not shying away from what others might consider his faults, but instead embraces himself, even if he is sometimes disappointed in his own feelings."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading The Catcher In The Rye, and I'm very confused. Maybe I took this book too literally, maybe the entire book is symbolic of something other than a kid wondering the streets of NY for a few days. My wife kept asking me how the book was, and I kept telling her that it's boring but something exciting is bound to happen soon. I mean this book is supposed to be great right? Well, nothing ever really happened. This book is very short, but it seems to take forever to read. Perhaps, after years of reading Stephen King books, I've come to expect too much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you really want to hear about it, I'll tell you what I think about this book. I don't really want to go into all that much goddam detail and all, if you want to know the truth, but I'll tell you what I think anyway.You might think this book is funnier than hell or depressing as hell. I don't know about you, but boy, I thought it was funnier than hell. I really mean it. I mean, I was laughing out loud at some of the parts. Boy, my dog must have thought I was half crazy when he heard me laugh, if you know what I mean. But if you had a childhood like old Holden did, then you might think it was depressing as hell or something.This title, though. Boy, that's really strange. I mean, something about catching people in rye fields before they go over a cliff or something. But you have to have a title like this so all the phonies will buy it and talk about it at their goddam cocktail parties and all. I mean, what if it was called The Holden Caulfield Story or something. All those phonies wouldn't buy it so I guess it's OK even though it is kind of a stupid thing to call a book.Really, I liked this book a lot. I mean, old Holden is a great guy and he can really spot those phonies. But he does get a little annoying and all. But when you think about it, he's so goddam funny that I like him a lot. That's how I feel about it, if you want to know the truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I regret that I am reading this book for the first time at age 25, and not 10 years earlier, because it feels like it was written either to:1) placate teenage insensibilities and insecurities;or2) urge parents to make peace with incomprehensibly rebelliouschildren.The result of my perusal is that I am unable to identify with either audience and hence, felt utterly disconnected with Holden Caulfield's travails and misery. In fact, I detested the protagonist and found it hard to sympathize with what felt like self-wrought despair. Therein lies the mystery of literature -- I suppose if I ever harbored thoughts similar to Holden's, I would be embracing this much-loved anti-hero.It was not until the final chapter that I found myself feeling sorry for Holden. Come to think of it, he does not even fit the official definition of an anti-hero. An anti-hero tries, but fails. He is defeated by the forces of nature (which includes human nature, in my book). His downfall is sometimes the undoing of an unsuspecting individual. Perhaps the closest Salinger comes to defining the anti-hero in his piece de resistance are the early references to Thomas Hardy's The Return Of The Native. Sadly, Holden does not even come close to the tragic heroes that are Clym Yeobright and Eustacia Vye.But in a strange and probably effective way, that disconnect sums up the person of Holden Caulfield. He is an empty shell of a boy, as compared to his peers, and the irony of it all is -- for all that Salinger tries to convince us being \\"true\\" is about, you realize that truth is manifest as a human being that amounts to nothing, one who has been defeated by his own principles and beliefs.Prejudices against Holden Caulfield aside, there is no denying that the writing is sharp, engaging, and brilliant... it does unlock the part of me that identified with Holden at some point in my life. I don't like this book because of its irrelevance to me, now, but I applaud Mr. Salinger for putting into words what every 16-year-old has always found it hard to say aloud, especially to adults. For capturing so succinctly the experience of growing pains and the disease of socialization and acclimatization, that the anti-hero has become a hero."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I heard so much hype about this book I really thought it was a must read. I was disappointed. It did have some good thoughts but you really can not get that much out of three days in a persons life. There was more swearing than actual writing. Don't read this book for its literary content but for the fact that you can say you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I will tell you right now dont waste your time with this book it is annoying and pointless. There is no plot it is just a stupid mental teenager that needs to shut up really pointless. if you are going to read this for pleasure dont. I doubt you would like it i had 25 people in my class who read it not one gave it a good review and thought there was a point to the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand how anyone can list this book part of their favorite books. The books is boring--and I don't find that many books boring; in fact, just this one. The language of the book is boring, simple, and highly informal. The plot is simple, linear, and boring. The protagonist is a boring college drop-out who hates the whole world but is too afraid to do anything about it. So nothing really develops from the beginning to the end; just some guy ranting and then getting over it! And the story...THERE IS NO STORY! I can almost see J.D. Salinger with a huge smirk on his face as he's writing the last page. It's just a phony book.I don't know. I'm just comparing this with some other novels I've read.Take Albert Camus's The Stranger for example. The story is somewhat similar to this one--some depressed guy's typical day in Algers.... But Camus makes it interesting--and I don't mean interesting as in humorous or erotic; rather, Camus brings out the human experience, the emotions and feeling. These are all lacking in this book.And, of course, my favorite up 'til now: To Kill A Mockingbird. That...I just couldn't put down. This one is like asking your friend how his day has been and having him tell you how boring his day has been: how he's gone to the town; watched a movie he didn't really wanted to see, and how much it sucked; called up all his friend but none of them were home; watched another movie just to kill time; called all his friends again (with the same exact details as the last time he called them); finally got a date with some girl he barely remembers; tried to hit on the girl but she freaked out; how he felt depressed; and how he finally got over it--and of course having someone write everything he says down (exactly as he says them) and publish them in a book.But again, it's a \\"classic.\\" You might want to try reading it, just so you know what people are talking about. But don't expect to learn anything from it. I did expect to learn something from it, and that's why it gets only one star."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I know everyone loves this book. I'm sorry. I had to read for English, and the teacher got mad at me for not liking it so bear with me here.. It was whiny, it sounded flat and cardboardy, it was confusing, it was dated and worst of all it's the \\"quintessential teen book.\\" Bah. I'll take The Perks of Being a Wallflower or Speak any day."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Perhaps I am one of the few teenagers that hasn't fallen in love with Catcher in the Rye! Many people favor the book so much because of its realness and their ability to relate to the story of its main character. Well, I have suffered through depression like Holden Caulfield, but I didn't find the book appealing nor realistic! It totally lacked any plot, but was FULL of frivelous writing and cussing. I can't seem to understand why so many people acclaim this book to be one of the best ever when it has no content! It is full of rambling and endless pages that contribute to its lack of interesting aspects. However, the narration was realistic; similar to the way a person would tell a story. But I do find it hard to believe someone could repeat so few words so often! I don't reccommend this book because of its lack of entertainment. Perhaps the brats like the main character will find it to be a book to re-read, but I think The Catcher in the Rye will just sit on my shelf! I welcome any comments to either agree or disagree . . .

Yes, Holden Caulfield has some universal connection because of the angst. Yes, he addresses phoniness in the world.But those things alone don't make a classic. One reviewer at this site mentioned the fact that there really is no plot, and she is right. If most of us knew Holden Caulfield and were subject to his ranting we would certainly dismiss him and not consider him a classic. I normally finish every book i read, but i got exaclty into the middle of he book and put it awaay for good.If Catcher in the Rye is a classic, then we've lost the ability to distinguish something that is truly classic, like say To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, from a mediocre novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was just plain stupid.

When the author passed away, I decided it was time to buy and read it. Had no idea of what to expect, and was surprised with what it was about. I think the main character had ADHD.

First of all, it isn't a \\"first edition, first printing,\\" obviously, BUT, it has the format of the edition back then when it was first published in the 50's. This is a great detail since you can appreciate the model they used before for a cheaper price if you'd want to buy an original copy. Great edition, wondeful book!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A good book depicting thoughts of a youth who doesn't know where he belongs yet while he \\"puts down\\" most actions of others. A book for youth; a bit tiresome reading for adults."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had the choice to read this or the Grapes of Wrath in high school, I went with the latter and decided to see what I missed. Here is a character suffering from a wealth of mental maladies, made more real by the use of the language of the times. The slang terms of the late 1940s/1950s pepper the dialogue throughout, effectively bringing the reader back to an earlier era. Here is a young man with issues, many issues, trying to keep his head above the surface and survive with a mental illness. Is he self-destructive, is he irresponsible, is he homophobic, is he a womanizer, is he immature, and why can't he cope with everyday life? Frankly by the time I was done reading, I was glad the story was finished. I'd had enough of the main character, and his crazy speech and was looking forward to something more substantial. I made the better choice of books in high school, and only can recommend reading Catcher in the Rye if you are interested in psychology."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The firs time I read this book, I thought it was a rather heartwarming coming-of-age story that takes place all in one weekend. Holden is at times the annoying smarty-pants sibling and roomie, but he's always authentic as a character. He's terribly unreliable as a narrator, but that reveals so much more about him than if Salinger had chosen to give an omniscient perspective.All that is still true on my second reading of it, but this time round, I felt Holden's loneliness as well. He prattles nonstop to keep himself occupied and deflect from his aimless search for something or someone to fill the silence. He is the king of digression, famously failing oral composition because he claimed he had a headache, but like he reveals about a classmate who failed as well, it was because he couldn't stick to just one subject. In many ways, Holden's stream-of-consciousness narrative is reflective of the fragmented and seemingly directionless discourse that Modernist writers engage in as a comment on the sentiments of an age of uncertainty and cynicism at structure and order. It is an attempt to articulate the quest to forge new meaning and purpose against the threat of all that is \\"phony\\" (a favourite Holden observation).As Holden observes of a polished skater at Radio City, \\"He was a very good skater and all, but I couldn't enjoy it much because I kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller-skates the stage. It seemed so stupid.\\" Holden can't understand artifice, and his unadorned thoughts and feelings often get him into trouble when he articulates them. In a sense, for all of Holden's unreliable ramblings, he is just being incredibly honest.Holden, at the end of the day, is a deeply compassionate character whose innocence and simplicity provides him with the most moving connection with his kid sister, Phoebe."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a really great book. I can't remember when I read a book so fast like that. It was so fun that I couldn't take my eyes off it. I think this book is misunderstood, too. The reason I read this book is because I wanted to find out WHY it got banned. But I don't see no particular reason. Sure, the language isn't great, but if it weren't for that language, the book would have lost it's meaning. They're crazy if they want to bann this book. The language that kids use these days are no compared to the one in Catcher in the Rye. Anyway, the story isn't what you call good, but the ending was touching. I won't tell you what was touching because you've got to figure out yourself. I don't want to spoil it for you!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All my life I have read hundreds, possibly thousands of books, and i have not had a book affect me as much as this book. All the books that i had read prior to this one had been a means to escape life and reality. As other people turn to drugs to escape unhappiness, i turned to books to do the same.However, CITR made me face reality, made me question my disillusionment and my anger. The first time i read this book at age 13 i was too young and immature to see the significance of it. I read it again three years ago when i was 17. During that reading i felt chills at the back of my neck...i felt Holden was me personified.Since then i've learnt the reasons for my depressive episodes. Ive learnt to deal with the imperfections of society and the weaknesses of humans. Like Holden I too, am recovering.I wish all people could see the love in this book, the love Holden had for innocence, for the purity of life and for the goodness in people.This book is great to me because it has incited such passion in one whom thought she was passionless.I feel a sense of futility in writing this review. One tiny review amongst many, some of which captures the essence of CITR much better than i have. But i feel compelled, as with many others, to defend this book, and maybe to hope that at least one person reading this will find it helpful.

Speaking as a high school student and a well- read young adult. I would recomment this to ANYONE over the age of 13. Reading it has removed the blinder of my fellow students , even though some have written bad reviews it has given them a new insight of the tortured souls of their fellow peers. I ejoyed about this book is the presence of it in the movie Conspiracy Theory. When I had to read this book as an assignment I thought it would be a treat for others. Instead, I think it horrified or confused them. It was like nothing they had ever read and most of their opinions on this book were negative because they didnt understand the meaning of the book . I know that it can be very easy to hate this book because Holden Caulfied rambes, lies, and does nothing but try and get drunk throughout this book. But what are the majority of high school students doing? I just wish one of my fellow students would have just gotten some glimpse of what Holden was really talking about when he used the metaphors such as the ducks or being the catcher in the rye. The duck represent his personality frozen to everyone else and one caring about what really happened to him. To be the catcher Holden is trying to catch the other children before they fall into the abyss of adulthood. A no bull acount of athe life of amisfit teen, this book inspires me to think and question my own phony actions and try to better myself.

This is the best of the banned books that I have read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Simply because a book wasn't written the way you would like it to be, does not mean it is a bad book. If every book was an adventure novel written in the same voice with the same tone, reading would get pretty pointless. The Catcher in the Rye is an extremely creative novel and should not be looked down upon simply because it is different. Why not enjoy a book for its good qualities and toss aside your single-minded view of the way a &quot;perfect&quot; book should be?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think catcher in the Rye is a great book. One of the best I've ever read. I first read it when I was eleven and to be honest, I thought it was the stupidest book in the world. Holden swore constantly and not that much seemed to happen. He hated everyone he knew almost and I couldn't stand the book. People were always talking about what a good book it was though and I started thinking maybe I'd missed something in it. When I was twelve I read it again. I thought it was okay but still sort of dumb. Then this year (I'm fourteen) I decided to try reading it again. I was shocked. It was like a completely different book than the one I'd read only two years ago. Of course the book didn't change, I did. It was brilliant and Holden seemed like a very realistic person. My favorite parts are where he gets completely off track and just starts talking about his younger brother, Ally, who died or Jane, an old friend of his who he sort of had a crush on. I loved how he wasn't afraid to tell his opinions on anything. By the end of the book you feel like you really know Holden. I would recommend this book to anyone over about 13. Any younger than that and it might be too difficult to really understand what Holden thinks and is going through.

This book reads like it could have been written only years ago, and not decades ago. Salinger perfectly and accurately captures male adolescence, and in the process creates a novel for all ages. This is a timeless work, a book that I read usually once every year or two. The tone of the speaker (Holden Caufield) is typical of a disenchanted youth, confused with so many issues in his life. It is a novel that is probably over-analyzed (as many great works of literature are) and can be enjoyed purely on entertainment value, without all the psychological gobbledegook that professors attempt to shove down student's throats. Read it and enjoy it for what it is, a fascinating story about a boy who is going through a difficult time in his life and how he deals with it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read Catcher years ago and loved it, as anyone in their right mind would!

I can actually think and feel what Holden was thinking and feeling. That was one of the big reasons that I really enjoyed this book because it felt like I was in it. When reading, I found that Holden was feeling alot of pain and agony throughout the novel with a ton of problems. I recongnized many hurdles that Holden and I have faced as young teenagers.

I am constantly quoting it, like I will pull a hat over my head and ask mother darling to give me her hand. But before you do anything like that, you better make sure the people around have read the book or you will end up just looking like an idoit. After reading the book I found that I had adapted holden's remarks. For weeks I said goddamn constantly.I also kept saying that stuff &quot;Killed me&quot;. It is a remarkable book and everyone should read it. I have read it about a thousand times."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful display of the stress of adolescence. This is the first book that I have read in which I can honestly say that I relate to. Every teenager should read this book, and every parent for that matter."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield, and average high school kid, until his brother Allie dies. He misses his brother that he loved so much, i think that it caused him to flunk out of boarding school and run away to the city. in the city he gets very depressed, and feels like he can't ever go home. i won't give away the end, but all i'll say is that i couldn't put it down! READ THIS BOOK! it was awesome!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It seems to me that a great many of the reviewers of this unique and timeless literary gem are sadly too dimwitted to appreciate Salinger's commentary. Is Holden a remarkable or unremarkable character? Does it matter? Unfortunately, too many people these days are preocuppied with proof of excellence and celebrity. Anything too like ourselves creates discomfort.Read the book again kids and get jiggy with reality."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is the greatest book I have ever read. As soon as I had read the first page I knew the book was special. It seemed to voice exactly how I thought about topics and certain people in the world today. When I found out when it was written my jaw dropped, lets just say it was in the 1950\`s and this amazed me as the book seemed so modern and up to date. Its the type of book you dream about writing yourself and has ALL the qualitys that you associate with good books. Its very funny, its very sad, its very gripping, its very...incredible. The emotions you feel during this book could not be listed there are so many. You will read through it quickly because you\`ll never put it down. Still now however I pick up the book and read certain parts of it again and again. If I could have a wish it would be that I was the in-complete person I was before embarking on reading the book and with no idea of what it lay instore for me. Absolutely outstanding, if you haven't read this book before than I feel deeply sorry for you...go and read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wish I could give out more stars.

I love this book....."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Caution: loyalties to traditional ethics may become tarnished. Once you read this book it seeps in and eats away like intelectual cancer urging you to realise certain things that you may not want to, or are unwilling to accept - it exposes the frivalty of social behavour, placing a wholly impotent charge on the effect of one person on another. It will be the best book or it will be the worst book you ever read, either way it effects you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wrote an online review over a month ago, and I wanted to point out some other points that I missed. The fact that there was no racism in the book (Holden referred to black people as 'colored', which is better than the racist word), but America didn't care. In fact, at that point of America, racism was abundant so a book filled with racism probably wouldn't turn America's head except black people, who had to face this. I see more why the book was banned. The bad language was too much. Holden mouth could've been washed out of its vulgarity alot, and America banning the book because of the bad influence it would have on kids is probably a reason to ban it, but then, alot of books could've been banned along with it, if it wasn't. Holden didn't have to stress out some parts in the book, and he should've had more concern on what he put his parents through. With the death of a brother, one who keeps messing up purposely would cause a heart attack. If I didn't put in, we do know Holden's a little mentally ill because he keeps looking at his world as phonies(which the world is, but real phoninest comes from the people who make it), his reaction to his brother's death, his depression, the things he does around his environment, andhis willing to keep making himself get chucked from one school to another. The Catcher in the Rye is the late forties version of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; There is more I could stress on, but I don't need to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in 10th grade.

I'm 16 and go to prep school, it was so true and has so many hidden messages, an amazing book. Holden is without a doubt the best character ever created in a novel. But I think this book is more autobiographical than fiction. This is definitely one of the very few books that I will keep forever. I don't know how anyone could not enjoy this."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book speaks for itself. Holden Caulfield is the classic disgruntled adolescent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well I'm 10 pages away from finishing the book and it was a great book. At first I was confused(I kept thinking, &quot;Ok, he's been kicked out of school so why is he still there?&quot;). But later as I read more it all became clear. I started to be able to relate to Holden. I thought, &quot;Wow this guy is me in a nutshell.&quot; He's sarcastic, and overall not likeable. He can sniff out a phony before they even open their mouth. I had to read this for my tenth grade English class. At first I was not looking forward to reading this(hey it's summer why should I have school work?) but as I got into I couldn't stop reading it."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},A={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],Y={key:0},q={key:1};function S(n,o,s,u,h,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",A,[(e(!0),t(m,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(r,y)=>(e(),w(c,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:h.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},[h.isLoading?(e(),t("span",q,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",Y,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(R,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-58e62e54"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/68.md","filePath":"quotes/68.md"}'),x={name:"quotes/68.md"},B=Object.assign(x,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(j)]))}});export{O as __pageData,B as default};
