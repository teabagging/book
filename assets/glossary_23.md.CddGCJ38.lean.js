In The Halliburton Agenda, Halliburton and its subsidiaries form the foundation of a fascinating story of influence peddling and behind-the-scenes political maneuvering that has only increased in momentum over the last decade-culminating in a firestorm of problems arising as soon as Cheney took office. This intriguing book shows readers where Halliburton has been doing business and with whom-topping the list so far are Iran, Iraq, and Libya. It also reveals how this juggernaut of a corporation has engaged in a cycle of profits that begins by selling products and services to potential terrorist states, contracting with the federal government during times of war against those states, then gaining valuable rebuilding contracts to help repair those states. It will also show how a Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg Brown & Root, has become an indispensable part of the U.S. military, so much so that the two are indistinguishable at times. Halliburton is one of the first American companies to recognize the importance of aligning itself with powerful politicians, heavily contributing to campaigns, then cashing in on lucrative government contracts. Engaging and informative, The Halliburton Agenda carefully explores the arc of the company's success, its use of political affiliation, and the scope of its international business.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2e5OLa6W54oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh, Volume 2","description":"In the twentieth century, an international cabal of scientists launches the Chrysalis Project, the development of an artificially enhanced breed of humans, while Gary Seven, an undercover operative for an advanced alient species struggles to neutralize the threat while watching the children of Chrysalis, including the brilliant Khan Noonien Singh, grow to adulthood.

Over a third of this population currently lives in the continental U.S. forming one of the nation's most significant \\"minority\\" communities. Yet no complete study of mainland Puerto Rican or Boricua literature has been written. Until now. Boricua Literature is the first literary history of the Puerto Rican colonial diaspora. The result of a decade of research in archives and special collections in the Caribbean and in the U.S., Lisa S nchez Gonz lez argues that the writing of the Puerto Rican diaspora should be considered an integral field of study. Covering 100 years of Boricua literary history, each chapter looks at the single writer or group of writers who are most emblematic of their respective generation, from William Carlos Williams and Arturo Schomburg, to latina feminism and salsa music. The story of an American community of color, Boricua Literature is also about contemporary critical race and gender studies. Unlike virtually all studies concerning mainland Puerto Rican writing, Lisa S nchez Gonz lez is less concerned with \\"cultural identity\\" than with unearthing a substantive cultural intellectual history. The first explicitly literary historical analysis of Boricua Literature, this definitive study proposes a new and discreet area of literary historical research in American studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3AkVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Boricua+Literature:+A+Literary+History+of+the+Puerto+Rican+Diaspora&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing foods from the Bible (Globe digest series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a2PYngEACAAJ&dq=Healing+foods+from+the+Bible+(Globe+digest+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected poems of William Blake","description":"Writer and religious rebel, William Blake sowed the seeds of Romanticism in his innovative poems concerning faith and the vision that inspired him throughout his remarkable life.

At the heart of the book is its unprecedented revelation of how legislative power works in America, how the Senate works, and how Johnson, in his ascent to the presidency, mastered the Senate as no political leader before him had ever done. It was during these years that all Johnson s experience from his Texas Hill Country boyhood to his passionate representation in Congress of his hardscrabble constituents to his tireless construction of a political machine came to fruition. Caro introduces the story with a dramatic account of the Senate itself: how Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun had made it the center of governmental energy, the forum in which the great issues of the country were thrashed out. And how, by the time Johnson arrived, it had dwindled into a body that merely responded to executive initiatives, all but impervious to the forces of change. Caro anatomizes the genius for political strategy and tactics by which, in an institution that had made the seniority system all-powerful for a century and more, Johnson became Majority Leader after only a single term-the youngest and greatest Senate Leader in our history; how he manipulated the Senate s hallowed rules and customs and the weaknesses and strengths of his colleagues to change the  unchangeable  Senate from a loose confederation of sovereign senators to a whirring legislative machine under his own iron-fisted control. Caro demonstrates how Johnson s political genius enabled him to reconcile the unreconcilable: to retain the support of the southerners who controlled the Senate while earning the trust or at least the cooperation of the liberals, led by Paul Douglas and Hubert Humphrey, without whom he could not achieve his goal of winning the presidency. He shows the dark side of Johnson s ambition: how he proved his loyalty to the great oil barons who had financed his rise to power by ruthlessly destroying the career of the New Dealer who was in charge of regulating them, Federal Power Commission Chairman Leland Olds. And we watch him achieve the impossible: convincing southerners that although he was firmly in their camp as the anointed successor to their leader, Richard Russell, it was essential that they allow him to make some progress toward civil rights. In a breathtaking tour de force, Caro details Johnson s amazing triumph in maneuvering to passage the first civil rights legislation since 1875. Master of the Senate, told with an abundance of rich detail that could only have come from Caro s peerless research, is both a galvanizing portrait of the man himself the titan of Capital Hill, volcanic, mesmerizing and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings and personal and legislative power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wBE-34_KfcAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Content-Based Classroom: Perspectives on Integrating Language and Content","description":"Shows how to apply the tenets of a content-based approach to language instruction.

His search is not for exact parallels, but rather for fundamental affinities between the equally &\\"organismic&\\" thought systems of indigenous peoples and classic American philosophers. Wilshire gives particular emphasis to the affinities between Black Elk& s view of the hoop of the world and Emerson& s notion of horizon, and also between a shaman& s healing practices and James& s ideas of pure experience, willingness to believe, and a pluralistic universe. As these connections come into focus, the book shows how European phenomenology was inspired and influenced by the classic American philosophers, whose own work reveals the inspiration and influence of indigenous thought. Wilshire& s book also reveals how artificial are the walls that separate the sciences and the humanities in academia, and that separate Continental from Anglo-American thought within the single discipline of philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qGu-h4C_UbMC&dq=The+Primal+Roots+of+American+Philosophy:+Pragmatism,+Phenomenology,+and+Native+American+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thought and language (M.I.T. paperback series)","description":"2012 Reprint of 1962 Edition.

As a result, conservatives' mobilizing efforts increasingly turned to law schools, professional networks, public interest groups, and the judiciary--areas traditionally controlled by liberals. Drawing from internal documents, as well as interviews with key conservative figures, The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement examines this sometimes fitful, and still only partially successful, conservative challenge to liberal domination of the law and American legal institutions. Unlike accounts that depict the conservatives as fiendishly skilled, The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement reveals the formidable challenges that conservatives faced in competing with legal liberalism. Steven Teles explores how conservative mobilization was shaped by the legal profession, the legacy of the liberal movement, and the difficulties in matching strategic opportunities with effective organizational responses. He explains how foundations and groups promoting conservative ideas built a network designed to dislodge legal liberalism from American elite institutions. And he portrays the reality, not of a grand strategy masterfully pursued, but of individuals and political entrepreneurs learning from trial and error. Using previously unavailable materials from the Olin Foundation, Federalist Society, Center for Individual Rights, Institute for Justice, and Law and Economics Center, The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement provides an unprecedented look at the inner life of the conservative movement. Lawyers, historians, sociologists, political scientists, and activists seeking to learn from the conservative experience in the law will find it compelling reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jLTkmAEACAAJ&dq=The+Conservative+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Appalachia","description":"\\"The Encyclopedia details subjects traditionally associated with Appalachia - folklore, handcrafts, mountain music, food, and coal mining - but goes far beyond regional stereotypes to treat such wide-ranging topics as the aerospace industry, Native American foodways, ethnic diversity in the coalfields, education reform, linguistic variation, and the contested notion of what it means to be Appalachian, both inside and outside the region.\\" \\"Researched and developed by the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East Tennessee State University, this 1,864-page compendium includes all thirteen states that constitute the northern, central, and southern subregions of Appalachia - from New York to Mississippi.

Amenra, mystical shaman of the deserts, banished forever from his Egyptian homeland. But when an evil conspiracy rises, a plot to assassinate the Pharaoh s only daughter, the brash but powerful ruler of Egypt must swallow his pride and call upon the one man who can save his daughter s life, the mighty Amenra. Amenra of the Sands, The Pharaoh s Daughter takes place during the 3rd Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, when Egypt was the most powerful nation in the world. Based heavily on historical fact, Amenra of the Sands follows Pharaoh, Netjerikhet Djoser, and his predecessors as they expand the borders of Egypt, pushing South into the kingdom of Kush and West towards Libya. This story takes place approximately in the year 2622 BC, less than 400 years after the two regions of Egypt, Upper and Lower Egypt, were united. Even 400 years after the union, there remains a great deal of regional pride among the inhabitants of Lower and Upper Egypt, and it is into this atmosphere that some level of dissention and at times, rebellion are able to occur. A dark conspiracy takes shape against both the Pharaoh and his daughter, fueled by an ancient prophecy. It is into the midst of this strife that the mystic Amenra finds himself plunged, forcing him to reopen old wounds between himself and the Pharaoh. Through mystical dreams and visions, Amenra attempts to piece together the mystery surrounding the conspiracy, but can he find the answers before it is too late? Amenra of the Sands embodies the best elements of epic historical fiction, presenting a suspenseful and engaging story of family, betrayal, power and lust in a fresh and realistic depiction of the ancient world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JlakOAAACAAJ&dq=Amenra+of+the+Sands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KILLS","description":"A MASTERWORK OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE SET IN THE ASHES OF WAR-TORN IRAQ, ITALY, AND AREAS IN BETWEEN.

According to David Wells, the answer lies in seeing how modernity is reshaping the whole of Western culture, including that part of it which is religious. This book provides a compelling critique of the modern world and the state of evangelical theology. Wells's sweeping analysis explores the collapse of theology in the church, the academy, and modern culture. The new environment in which we live, with its huge cities, triumphant capitalism, invasive technology, and incessant amusements, is homogenizing daily experience, bringing about a world cliche culture. While the modern world has produced astonishing abundance, it has also taken a dreadful toll on the human spirit, emptying it of meaning, depth, and morality. Seeking respite from the acids of modernity, people today have increasingly turned to religions and therapies centered on the self. And, whether consciously or not, evangelicals have taken the same path, refashioning their faith into a religion of the self. Because the modern churchgoer is so often a consumer, pastors are redefining their roles in terms of their own marketability. Evangelicals, argues Wells, have largely lost the truth that God also stands outside all human experience, that he still summons sinners to repentance and belief regardless of their self-image, and that he calls his church to stand fast in his truth against the blandishments of the modern world. Written expressly to encourage renewal in evangelical theology, No Place for Truth explores the interface between Christian faith and the modern world in entirely new ways and with uncommon rigor. It raises profound questions about the future of conservative Protestant faith. Here is provocative reading for scholars, ministers, Christian leaders, seminary students, and all theologically concerned people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p7ekPoVwjlkC&dq=Minister%27s+Service+Book+for+Pulpit+and+Parish&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Hours to Darkness","description":"At the height of the Cold War the commander of a British nuclear submarine receives a letter from his wife threatening divorce.

Pike tells the colorful story of logging and log-driving in New England. The New England loggers and river drivers were a unique breed of men. Working with their axes and peaveys through Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, they contributed mightily to the development of the United States. The daily life of the loggers was hard   working in deep icy water fourteen hours a day, sleeping in wet blankets, eating coarse food, and constantly risking their lives. Their pay was very low, yet they were proud to call themselves loggers. When they came out of the woods after the spring drives, they ebulliently spent their pay carousing in the staid New England towns. Robert E. Pike, who as a youth worked in the woods and on the rivers, writes affectionately and knowingly, with humorous anecdotes, of every detail of lumbering. He describes the daily life of the logging camps, giving a picture of the different specialist jobs: the camp boss, the choppers, the sawyers and filers, the scaler, the teamsters, the river men, the railroaders, and the lumber kings. His descriptions bring the reader vividly into the woods, smelling the tangy, newly cut timber, hearing the boom of the falling trees. \\"The author's lively prose matches the temper of his subject. . . . This is basic history, geography, psychology, economics, and folklore all rolled into one top-quality volume.\\"   R. S.

Do You Feel Like I Do? is the incredible story of Peter Frampton's positively resilient life and career told in his own words for the first time. His monu-mental album Frampton Comes Alive! spawned three top-twenty singles and sold eight million copies the year it was released (more than seventeen million to date), and it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in January 2020. Frampton was on a path to stardom from an early age, first as the lead singer and guitarist of the Herd and then as cofounder along with Steve Marriott of one of the first supergroups, Humble Pie. Frampton was part of a tight-knit collective of British '60s musicians with close ties to the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the Who. This led to Frampton playing on George Harrison's solo debut, All Things Must Pass, as well as to Ringo Starr and Billy Preston appearing on Frampton's own solo debut. By age twenty-two, Frampton was touring incessantly and finding new sounds with the talk box, which would become his signature guitar effect. Frampton remembers his enduring friendship with David Bowie. Growing up as schoolmates, crossing paths throughout their careers, and playing together on the Glass Spider Tour, the two developed an unshakable bond. Frampton also shares fascinating stories of his collaborative work with Harry Nilsson, Stevie Wonder, B. B. King, and members of Pearl Jam. He reveals both the blessing and curse of Frampton Comes Alive!, opening up about becoming the cover boy he never wanted to be, his overcoming sub-stance abuse, and how he has continued to play and pour his heart into his music despite an inflammatory muscle disease and his retirement from the road. Peppered throughout his narrative is the story of his favorite guitar, the Phenix, which he thought he'd lost in a fiery plane crash in 1980. But in 2011, it mysteriously showed up again saved from the wreckage. Frampton tells of that unlikely reunion here in full for the first time, and why the miraculous reappearance is emblematic of his life and career as a quintessential artist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5RrRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second World War: Europe And the Mediterranean","description":"From the prewar development of the German war machine to the ultimate victory of the Allied coalition, here is an in-depth analysis of the battles that raged on the Western and Eastern Fronts.

In The New Division of Labor, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane show how computers are changing the employment landscape and how the right kinds of education can ease the transition to the new job market. The book tells stories of people at work--a high-end financial advisor, a customer service representative, a pair of successful chefs, a cardiologist, an automotive mechanic, the author Victor Hugo, floor traders in a London financial exchange. The authors merge these stories with insights from cognitive science, computer science, and economics to show how computers are enhancing productivity in many jobs even as they eliminate other jobs--both directly and by sending work offshore. At greatest risk are jobs that can be expressed in programmable rules--blue collar, clerical, and similar work that requires moderate skills and used to pay middle-class wages. The loss of these jobs leaves a growing division between those who can and cannot earn a good living in the computerized economy. Left unchecked, the division threatens the nation's democratic institutions. The nation's challenge is to recognize this division and to prepare the population for the high-wage/high-skilled jobs that are rapidly growing in number--jobs involving extensive problem solving and interpersonal communication. Using detailed examples--a second grade classroom, an IBM managerial training program, Cisco Networking Academies--the authors describe how these skills can be taught and how our adjustment to the computerized workplace can begin in earnest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRhCNqnyX_8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Robots: Ragged Bears","description":"A rhyming presentation of a variety of robots, from a \\"bendy\\" orange one to a scruffy dog robot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZA9APQAACAAJ&dq=Little+Robots:+Ragged+Bears&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choose the Moose!

Can self, soul, consciousness,  I  arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? I Am a Strange Loop argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is the  strange loop  a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. The most central and complex symbol in your brain is the one called  I.  The  I  is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. How can a mysterious abstraction be real or is our  I  merely a convenient fiction? Does an  I  exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? These are the mysteries tackled in I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter's first book-length journey into philosophy since G?del, Escher, Bach. Compulsively readable and endlessly thought-provoking, this is a moving and profound inquiry into the nature of mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=78S6swEACAAJ&dq=I+AM+A+STRANGE+LOOP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Papers on Depression","description":"Gathers the classic articles on the subject of depression.

The artworks and cultural artifacts that survived have traumatic, layered histories. This book traces the biographies of these objects--including paintings, sculpture, and Judaica--their rescue in the aftermath of the war, and their afterlives in museums and private collections and in our cultural understanding. In examining how this history affects the way we view these works, scholars discuss the moral and aesthetic implications of maintaining the association between the works and their place within the brutality of the Holocaust--or, conversely, the implications of ignoring this history. Afterlives offers a thought-provoking investigation of the unique ability of art and artifacts to bear witness to historical events. With rarely seen archival photographs and with contributions by the contemporary artists Maria Eichhorn, Hadar Gad, Dor Guez, and Lisa Oppenheim, this catalogue illuminates the study of a difficult and still-urgent subject, with many parallels to today's crises of art in war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4HvAzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Jewish+Museum+Address+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (Interactive Technologies)","description":"This groundbreaking book defines the emerging field of information visualization and offers the first-ever collection of the classic papers of the discipline, with introductions and analytical discussions of each topic and paper.

At the same time, professional philosophy remains relatively invisible. Anderson traverses American life to find places in the wider culture where professional philosophy in the distinctively American tradition can strike up a conversation. How might American philosophers talk to us about our religious experience, or political engagement, or literature or even, popular music? Anderson s second aim is to find places where philosophy happens in nonprofessional guises cultural places such as country music, rock n roll, and Beat literature. He not only enlarges the tradition of American philosophers such as John Dewey and William James by examining lesser-known figures such as Henry Bugbee and Thomas Davidson, but finds the theme and ideas of American philosophy in some unexpected places, such as the music of Hank Williams, Tammy Wynette, and Bruce Springsteen, and the writings of Jack Kerouac. The idea of  philosophy Americana  trades on the emergent genre of  music Americana,  rooted in traditional themes and styles yet engaging our present experiences. The music is  popular  but not thoroughly driven by economic considerations, and Anderson seeks out an analogous role for philosophical practice, where philosophy and popular culture are co-adventurers in the life of ideas. Philosophy Americana takes seriously Emerson s quest for the extraordinary in the ordinary and James s belief that popular philosophy can still be philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zIuUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Time to be Born (American Odyssey Series #1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4qUjzwEACAAJ&dq=A+Time+to+be+Born+(American+Odyssey+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ratcliffe Power Station","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cI1CAAAACAAJ&dq=Ratcliffe+Power+Station&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Main Currents in Sociological Thought 1: Montesquieu - Comte - Marx - Tocqueville","description":"This is the first of Raymond Aron's magisterial two-volume treatment of the sociological tradition--perhaps the definitive work of its kind.

With his usual scrupulous fairness, Aron looks to the major social thinkers to discern how they answered this pressing question. Volume 1 explores three traditions: the French liberal school of political sociology, represented by Montesquieu and Tocqueville; the Comtean tradition, anticipating Durkheim in its deemphasis of the political and its elevation of social unity and consensus; and the Marxists, who posited the struggle between classes and placed their faith in historical necessity. A foreword by the eminent French philosopher Pierre Manent highlights Main Currents as a unique contribution to political philosophy as well as the history of sociological thought, while Daniel J. Mahoney and Brian C. Anderson provide an introduction situating Main Currents within the corpus of Aron's work as a whole. This work is essential reading for philosophers, historians, sociologists, and political scientists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIJ2ASK9Lc8C&dq=Main+Currents+in+Sociological+Thought+1:+Montesquieu+-+Comte+-+Marx+-+Tocqueville&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danger!

A high school student when interned in 1942, Minoru Kiyota was so infuriated by his treatment during an FBI interrogation and by the denial of his request to leave the camp to pursue his education that he refused to affirm his loyalty as required of all internees. For this he was sent to Tule Lake Segregation Center in northern California - a holding pen for \\"dangerous\\" and \\"disloyal\\" individuals. While imprisoned there under deplorable conditions, Kiyota learned of a new law offering Japanese Americans the \\"opportunity\\" to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Although barely old enough to do so, Kiyota took this drastic step. Throughout his four long years of incarceration, he refused to resign himself to the injustices he witnessed and experienced. His story shares the fury and frustration aroused by gross violations of his rights as a U.S. citizen and shows how the painful years of internment determined the course of his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8wfFPtRskgC&dq=Beyond+Loyalty:+The+Story+of+a+Kibei&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where is Mary Bostwick?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFmmwwEACAAJ&dq=Where+is+Mary+Bostwick%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creature Catalog (Dungeons and Dragons Accessory AC9 )","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0h7VAAAACAAJ&dq=Creature+Catalog+(Dungeons+and+Dragons+Accessory+AC9+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A diary from Dixie;","description":"The original diary of Mary Chesnut, an important work that was repeatedly quoted during the famous television documentary The Civil War, provides an insightful look into how the war affected the daily lives of the people of the South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dGgbAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+diary+from+Dixie%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Physiological Handbook for Teachers of Yogasana","description":"This illustrated handbook attempts to reconcile the quantitative, objective observations of Western Medicine with the qualitative, subjective observations of Eastern Yoga.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xyJEDt9LrGsC&dq=A+Physiological+Handbook+for+Teachers+of+Yogasana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maine Bassin: A Complete Guide to Catching Bass in Maine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hiuWAAAACAAJ&dq=Maine+Bassin:+A+Complete+Guide+to+Catching+Bass+in+Maine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forgotten Generation: The Status and Challenges of Adults with Mild Cognitive Limitations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The cook","description":"One of BBC Culture's Ten Books to Read this March and The Rumpus Book Club Pick for March Maylis de Kerangal follows up her acclaimed novel The Heart with a dissection of the world of a young Parisian chef More like a poetic biographical essay on a fictional person than a novel, The Cook is a coming-of-age journey centered on Mauro, a young self-taught cook. The story is told by an unnamed female narrator, Mauro s friend and disciple who we also suspect might be in love with him. Set not only in Paris but in Berlin, Thailand, Burma, and other far-flung places over the course of fifteen years, the book is hyperrealistic to the point of feeling, at times, like a documentary. It transcends this simplistic form, however, through the lyricism and intensely vivid evocative nature of Maylis de Kerangal s prose, which conjures moods, sensations, and flavors, as well as the exhausting rigor and sometimes violent abuses of kitchen work. In The Cook, we follow Mauro as he finds his path in life: baking cakes as a child; cooking for his friends as a teenager; a series of studies, jobs, and travels; a failed love affair; a successful business; a virtual nervous breakdown; and at the end a rediscovery of his hunger for cooking, his appetite for life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JPaKDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+cook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buying a Business With Little or No Capital: A Practical Guide With $0-Down Strategies","description":"Our goal in publishing this guide is to help aspiring (or existing) business owners to purchase businesses using very little or no capital.

His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in \\"putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long.\\" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business. Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jBxPraEoW58C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shells","description":"Along summer beaches, shells beckon with their timeless beauty and wonder.

In Shaping Suburbia, Paul Lewis argues that a fundamental political logic underlies the patterns of suburban growth and argues that the key to understanding suburbia is to understand the local governments that control it - their number, functions, and power. Using innovative models and data analyses, Lewis shows that the relative political fragmentation of a metropolitan area plays a key part in shaping its suburbs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8GqxAAAAIAAJ&dq=Shaping+Suburbia:+How+Political+Institutions+Organize+Urban+Development+(Pitt+Series+in+Policy+and+Institutional+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raggedy Ann Stories","description":"\\"[...]would be very glad to be their leader. \\"Follow me!\\" she cried as her wobbly legs carried her across the floor at a lively pace.

What is narrative fiction? How does it differ from other kinds of narrative? What featuers turn a discourse into a narrative text? Now widely acknowledged as one of the most significant volumes in its field, Narrative Fiction turns its attention to these and other questions. In contrast to many other studies, Narrative Fiction is organized arround issues - such as events, time, focalization, characterization, narration, the text and its reading - rather than individual theorists or approaches. Within this structure, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan addresses key approaches to narrative fiction, including New Criticism, formlaism, structuralism and phenomenology, but also offers views of the modifications to these theroies. While presenting an analysis of the system governing all fictional narratives, whether in the form of novel, short story or narrative poem, she also suggests how individual narratives can be studied against the background of this general system. A broad range of literary examples illustrate key aspects of the study. This edition is brought fully up-to-date with an invaluable new chapter, reflecting on recent developments in narratology. Readers are also directed to key recent works in the field. These additions to a classic text ensure that Narrative Fiction will remain the ideal starting point for anyone new to narrative theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a2CBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natural Selection (BattleTech, No. 5)","description":"When sporadic Clan incursions into Inner Sphere territory supply mercenaries with more work than they can handle, Khan Phelan Ward and Prince Victor Davion--cousins, rulers, and enemies--must decide what to do.

And nowhere in literature is it so apparent as in this classic work, \\"The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest.\\" This autobiography of a Jesuit priest in Elizabethan England is a most remarkable document and John Gerard, its author, a most remarkable priest in a time when to be a Catholic in England courted imprisonment and torture; to be a priest was treason by act of Parliament. Smuggled into England after his ordination and dumped on a Norfolk beach at night, Fr. Gerard disguised himself as a country gentleman and traveled about the country saying Mass, preaching and ministering to the faithful in secret always in constant danger. The houses in which he found shelter were frequently raided by priest hunters; priest-holes, hide-outs and hair-breadth escapes were part of his daily life. He was finally caught and imprisoned, and later removed to the infamous Tower of London where he was brutally tortured. The stirring account of his escape, by means of a rope thrown across the moat, is a daring and magnificent climax to a true story which, for sheer narrative power and interest, far exceeds any fiction. Here is an accurate and compelling picture of England when Catholics were denied their freedom to worship and endured vicious persecution and often martyrdom. But more than the story of a single priest, \\"The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest\\" epitomizes the constant struggle of all human beings through the ages to maintain their freedom. It is a book of courage and of conviction whose message is most timely for our age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bCdtbsfDKHkC&dq=The+autobiography+of+a+hunted+priest%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reinhard Heydrich: The Chilling Story of the Man Who Masterminded the Nazi Death Camps","description":"A biographical account of the professional ambition, military training, ideological fanaticism, rise to power, and career as head of the SS intelligence service of the man who oversaw Hitler's Final Solution","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fRRoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reinhard+Heydrich:+The+Chilling+Story+of+the+Man+Who+Masterminded+the+Nazi+Death+Camps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil Procedure - Cases and Materials (American Casebook Series), Second Ed ition","description":"This casebook covers major aspects of civil procedure.

There is no full-time neo-Indian. Both indigenous and non-indigenous practitioners assume Indian identities only when deemed spiritually significant. In their daily lives, they are average members of modern society, dressing in Western clothing, working at middle-class jobs, and retaining their traditional religious identities. As a result of this part-time status the neo-Indians are often overlooked as a subject of study, making this book the first anthropological analysis of the movement. Galinier and Molini  present and analyze four decades of ethnographic research focusing on Mexico and Peru, the two major areas of the movement s genesis. They examine the use of public space, describe the neo-Indian ceremonies, provide analysis of the ceremonies  symbolism, and explore the close relationship between the neo-Indian religion and tourism. The Neo-Indians will be of great interest to ethnographers, anthropologists, and scholars of Latin American history, religion, and cultural studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYngCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Red Ronnika","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Alessandro Piperno.

Three well-off young men former students at Rome s prestigious all-boys Catholic high school San Leone Magno brutally tortured, raped, and murdered two young women in 1975. The event, which came to be known as the Circeo massacre, shocked and captivated the country, exposing the violence and dark underbelly of the upper middle class at a moment when the traditional structures of family and religion were seen as under threat. It is this environment, the halls of San Leone Magno in the late 1960s and the 1970s, that Edoardo Albinati takes as his subject. His experience at the school, reflections on his adolescence, and thoughts on the forces that produced contemporary Italy are painstakingly and thoughtfully rendered, producing a remarkable blend of memoir, coming-of-age novel, and true-crime story. Along with indelible portraits of his teachers and fellow classmates the charming Arbus, the literature teacher Cosmos, and his only Fascist friend, Max Albinati also gives us his nuanced reflections on the legacy of abuse, the Italian bourgeoisie, and the relationship between sex, violence, and masculinity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sIpgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ponson Case","description":"Inspector Tanner unravels one of the most complicated cases of his career, as he doggedly pursues a murder investigation.

He later worked with the Beatles as they recorded their singles  She Loves You  and  I Want to Hold Your Hand,  the songs that would propel them to international superstardom. In 1964 he would witness the transformation of this young and playful group from Liverpool into professional, polished musicians as they put to tape classic songs such as  Eight Days A Week  and  I Feel Fine.  Then, in 1966, at age nineteen, Geoff Emerick became the Beatles  chief engineer, the man responsible for their distinctive sound as they recorded the classic album Revolver, in which they pioneered innovative recording techniques that changed the course of rock history. Emerick would also engineer the monumental Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road albums, considered by many the greatest rock recordings of all time. In Here, There and Everywhere he reveals the creative process of the band in the studio, and describes how he achieved the sounds on their most famous songs. Emerick also brings to light the personal dynamics of the band, from the relentless (and increasingly mean-spirited) competition between Lennon and McCartney to the infighting and frustration that eventually brought a bitter end to the greatest rock band the world has ever known.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WOk8TP8o018C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant People-Reading Through Handwriting","description":"Describes the six major types of personality handwriting analysis can reveal, and explains how to predict compatibility, and perform self-analysis","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pVjXwvXsZQsC&dq=Instant+People-Reading+Through+Handwriting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Deck Book (Southern Living (Paperback Sunset))","description":"Shows a variety of deck styles and designs, explains each step of the building process, and offers advice on materials and customization","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6pOGAAAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Deck+Book+(Southern+Living+(Paperback+Sunset))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Minute Journaling (Scrapbook Storytelling)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Duets 2-In-1 (68) (Naughty Or Nerdy?/The Husband Hotel) (Harlequin Duets)","description":"A 2015 Whitney Award Nominee!

A working class family with a 50 inch plasma TV? A 27-year-old Japanese administrative assistant with a collection of Coach purses? An 87-year-old retiree in Ohio exclaiming the value of Aldi brand honey? What's going on in the mind of the new consumer? Today's consumers can seem impossible to understand, and even harder to please. For instance, the average mall shopper will spend her $100, then leave when she hits that limit. She'll probably buy shoes rather than clothing, because she doesn't want to think about her dress size. And the store most likely to get her money isn't the one with the nicest display or the deepest discounts... it's the one closest to her parking spot. In his research with dozens of leading companies, Michael J. Silverstein has interviewed thousands of customers, extracting fascinating patterns about what really drives their purchase decisions. His first book, the acclaimed bestseller Trading Up, has taught a generation of marketers about the \\"new luxury\\" phenomenon, and why consumers will happily pay a steep premium for goods and services that are emotionally satisfying, from golf clubs to bathroom hardware to beauty products. But Trading Up only revealed part of the story of the new consumer. The same middle class consumers who are happily trading up at Victoria's Secret and Panera are going on treasure hunts at Costco and Home Depot. And they are often getting as much emotional satisfaction in the discount stores as in the luxury stores. Silverstein's new book explains how the new consumer approaches bargain hunting, and how even the most mundane shopping ? for things like paper towels and pet food -- have become an adventure rather than a tedious chore. It turns out that, in just about every consumer category, both the high end and the low end are growing and innovation rich. Many middle class consumers gladly spend $5.00 a day for a vente Starbucks latte; others spend 40 cents a day on home brewed coffee, feel good about their frugality, and save up the difference to buy Apple's newest Nano. Treasure Hunt explains the success of companies as diverse as Dollar General, LG, H. E. Butt, Ebay, Commerce Bank, and Tchibo. Beware: in our bifurcated global market, businesses need a clear strategy for aiming high or low, while staying away from the treacherous middle, where so many have recently stumbled. If your offering isn't exciting enough to inspire trading up, but not enough of a bargain to satisfy the treasure hunters, you'll have no emotional connection with your target audience. And, like General Motors or Sears in recent years, your tried-and-true marketing strategies will go into a severe stall. Treasure Hunt takes us into the homes of real people making real decisions, and into the CEO's offices of innovative companies finding new ways to accommodate them. Written with the same flair, empathy, and intelligence that made Trading Up an instant business classic, this book is an essential guide to the moods and habits of the constantly changing consumer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c4jgguFPYLsC&dq=Treasure+Hunt:+Inside+the+Mind+of+the+New+Consumer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children of India","description":"We, the children of India  Former Chief Justice Leila Seth makes the words of the Preamble to the Constitution understandable to even the youngest reader.

Is there any way to defend the intuition that a work of literature says something that can't be said in any other way? Drawing on recent work in the philosophies of language and action, Steven Knapp presents a challenging new definition of \\"the literary\\" in a forceful analysis that will radically change the sometimes heated debate about formalism. Formalist theorists have maintained that the uniqueness of the literary lies in the special nature of literary language. Their critics argue that to draw sharp distinctions between literary and nonliterary language is to privilege one kind of text and to insulate cultural activity from social conflict and political change. In the course of a rigorous engagement with such literary theorists, old and new, Knapp develops a provocative defense of the notion of a uniquely literary mode of discourse--a defense that challenges proponents as well as critics of formalism. He extends and deepens current debates about the literary canon, the purpose of literary study, and the aims and implications of the recent critical return to history. His bold and surprising argument has significance for the ethical and political role of literary studies that no one interested in literary theory or the philosophy of art will be able to ignore. Literary Interest will engage theorists, literary critics in all fields, and philosophers addressing issues of aesthetics and language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CSyNndDscwQC&dq=Literary+Interest:+The+Limits+of+Anti-Formalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conflict of Generations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=znydAAAAMAAJ&dq=Conflict+of+Generations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey &Persuasion;","description":"During an eventful season at Bath, young, na?ve Catherine Morland experiences the joys of fashionable society for the first time.

Foreword by Emma Tennant. Barnet and Downe are old and good friends in the Wessex town of Port Bredy yet fate has treated them differently. Barnet, a prosperous man, has been unlucky in love and now lives with the consequences of a judicious but loveless marriage. Downe, a poor solicitor, is radiantly happy, with a doting wife and adoring children. A chance meeting one night causes them to reflect on their disparate lots in life and sets in motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. Both a meticulous record of English provincial customs and a melancholic reflection on the brevity of human happiness, this short work displays all the artistry of Hardy s major fiction. Thomas Hardy (18401928) is one of Britain s greatest authors; among his most famous works are Tess of the D Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d4CZQgAACAAJ&dq=Fellow-Townsmen+(Hesperus+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heraclides of Pontus","description":"An outline of the life of Heraclides and his fragmentary writings (on the theory of matter, astronomy, ethical and religious topics) is followed by an attempt to reconstruct his thought.

It is an extraordinary story, told with unique insight and authority by an author who knew the prince for more than forty years. Philip - elusive, complex, controversial, challenging, often humorous, sometimes irascible - is the man Elizabeth II once described as her 'constant strength and guide'. Who was he? What was he really like? What is the truth about those 'gaffes' and the rumours of affairs? This is the final portrait of an unexpected and often much-misunderstood figure. It is also the portrait of a remarkable marriage that endured for more than seventy years. Philip and Elizabeth were both royal by birth, both great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, but, in temperament and upbringing, they were two very different people. The Queen's childhood was loving and secure, the Duke's was turbulent; his grandfather assassinated, his father arrested, his family exiled, his parents separated when he was only ten. Elizabeth and Philip met as cousins in the 1930s. They married in 1947, aged twenty-one and twenty-six. Philip: The Final Portrait tells the story of two contrasting lives, assesses the Duke of Edinburgh's character and achievement, and explores the nature of his relationships with his wife, his children and their families - and with the press and public and those at court who were suspicious of him in the early days. This is a powerful, revealing and, ultimately, moving account of a long life and a remarkable royal partnership.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hn8qEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Screen Door Jesus & Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LEZOMwEACAAJ&dq=Screen+Door+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's Horse","description":"In the Morland Dynasty series, the majestic sweep of English history is richly and movingly portrayed through the fictional lives of the Morland family.

The book explores the problems faced by branding, marketing and advertising facing multiple radical changes in this decade. Communities Dominate Brands discusses how disruptive effects of digitalisation and connectedness introduce threats and opportunities. The authors compellingly illustrate how modern consumers are forming communities and peer-groups to pool their power resulting in a dramatic revolution of how businesses interact with their customers. The book provides practical guidance of how to move from obsolete interruptive advertising to interactive engagement marketing and community based communications, with dozens of real business examples from around the world. Communities Dominate Brands addresses its topic from a marketing (including advertising and branding) perspective and maintains a rigorous focus on business and profit dimensions of the issues involved.The book discusses such recent phenomena as blogging, virtual environments, mobile phone based swarming and massively multiplayer games. The book introduces a new generation of consumers called Generation-C (for Community). The book also discusses such new concepts as the Connected Age, Reachability, the Four C's, Alpha Users, and introduces Communities as an unavoidable new element into the traditional communication model. Combining the digital trends, modern management theories, and emerging new customer behaviour, Communities Dominate Brands arrives to its conclusion, that traditional marketing methods are increasingly ineffective and even becoming counterproductive. The power of the brands and the abuses by marketing have created a vacuum for a counterbalance, and digitally connected communities, the blogosphere, gamers, and especially the always-on connectedness of those on mobile phone networks, are emerging as the counterforce to redress the balance. The power of smart mobs and digitally enlightened communities will react rapidly to marketing excesses as the natural force balancing the power of the brands.The way a business can and must interact with the powerful new communities is through engagement marketing, by enticing the communities to interact with the brands. Communities Dominate Brands covers the major changes taking place in business and industry worldwide from leading digitally connected societies such as Finland, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, UK and the USA. The authors discuss the business relevance of such community related technologies and phenomena such as blogging, CANs, iPod, MMOGs, MVNOs, PVRs, Ringing Tones, SMS text messaging, swarming, VOD. This is the definitive business book on the impact of new technologies, not explaining how technology works, but showing what businesses need to do to make money in the new digitally converging environment. Communities Dominate Brands analyses early successes of engaging communities by global brands such as Adidas, Apple, Audi, BBC, Boeing, Coca Cola, eBay, Ford, Google, Guinness, Hush Puppies, Lonely Planet, MTV, Nokia, Orange, Philips, Red Bull, Sony, Tesco, Tony & Guy, Vodafone, etc.The lessons are amplified with insights from rough punishment by communities suffered by Hutchison/Three networks, Kryptonite locks, Mazda, the Philippines Government, etc. Fully indexed, impeccably researched with documented sources, offering over 50 current business examples and over a dozen case studies, Communities Dominate Brands is a hands-on practical business handbook on how to adjust marketing to deal with communities. With tools such as the Four C's and Reachability, the authors provide a competitive head-start to all who want to achieve customer satisfaction and return business in the 21st century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYq-AAAACAAJ&dq=Communities+Dominate+Brands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain","description":"When eleven climbers died on K2 on August 1, 2008, it was a stark reminder that the world's second-highest mountain has, for more than a century, been regarded as the most difficult and dangerous of all for every four people who reach the top, one dies in the attempt.

Within these pages Maria Housden shares the transformative lessons in living she received from her three-year-old daughter Hannah, who brought courage, honesty, and joy to her struggle with cancer. During the last year of her short life, Hannah was fearless in the way she faced deathand irrepressibly joyful in the way she approached living. The little girl who wore her favorite red Mary Janes into the operating room changed the life of everyone who came in contact with her. Now, in a book that preserves Hannah s indomitable spirit, Maria Housden offers the gift of her daughter s last year to all of us. In a lyrically told narrative, both moving and unforgettable, Housden recounts Hannah s battle with cancer in simple, straightforward language that transcends grief and fear to become a celebration. From Hannah s story emerge five profound lessonsof truth, joy, faith, compassion, and wonderthat have the power to change our lives.

Practically every biography highlights his encounter with Shams-i Tabrizi, the wandering mystic who became his beloved companion. Rumi had been a sober scholar, teaching law and theology to a small circle of students, but Shams turned him into a devotee of music, dance, and poetry. Then, after three years, he vanished, never to be seen again. It was Rumi's longing for the lost Shams that made him one of the world's greatest poets, celebrating him as the embodiment of the divine beloved. This book makes available for the first time in any European language first-hand accounts of Shams that have never been studied by Western scholars. When Rumi and Shams talked, members of the circle took notes, which were preserved and sometimes copied by later generations, ending up in various libraries scattered around Turkey; this book arranges them in a manner that clarifies their meaning and context, with notes and a glossary.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OJcaAQAAIAAJ&dq=Me+and+Rumi:+The+Autobiography+of+Shams-I+Tabrizi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Your Home (Conran Octopus Interiors S.)","description":"The 1950's house was a scientific triumph, designed in a laboratory and tested on inhabitants of all ages before being built for the masses.

Not every Puritan had this vision, of course; not every Puritan agreed about the nature of Biblical law. But sufficient numbers of them did share this vision, especially in New England, and the world still reaps the benefits of their efforts. This is another way of saying that the Puritans expected success to come their way, and when it did, it left its mark on Western Civilization. By unleashing the talents of men in every station in life, the Puritan doctrine of the priesthood of all believers transformed the West. A grass-roots reconstruction began which was to lead eventually to the American War of Independence. The top-down hierarchy of Anglicanism did not take root in the Puritan colonies. Because of this, American political life was freed from the dead hand of a church-state bureaucratic tradition. But it was not simply in the realm of politics that Puritanism left its mark. Consider modern science. Without the doctrines of Puritanism, it is unlikely that modern science ever would have appeared. The calling before God, the legitimacy of the mechanic's trade, the optimism concerning the study of nature, and many other Puritan concepts brought forth modern science. Two articles, one by Charles Dykes and the other by E. L. Hebden Taylor, demonstrate this forcefully. Christians seldom know what modern historians of science know, namely, that Puritanism was basic to the advent of modern scientific progress. This ingrained optimism stemmed from their eschatological presuppositions, as James Payton demonstrates with respect to English Puritans and Aletha Joy Gilsdorf shows with respect to the first generation of colonial Puritans. And then there was Oliver Cromwell. Judy Ishkanian provides us with a detailed biography of this crucially important military and political leader of the Puritan forces in England. Who was he, how did he accomplish his goals, and where did he get his vision? These questions are answered in considerable depth, given the limitations of a single chapter in biography. This issue of The Journal is a continuation of an investigation into the nature of the Puritan reformation. It is followed by the third and final volume, \\"Puritanism and Society.\\" Anyone who wants access to illuminating introductions to the impact of Puritanism outside of the institutional church as such, should have these volumes in his library. They will serve later Christian scholars as starting points for further research. Even more important, they open up a whole new world of Christian history and inspiration, for the Puritans vision-that all of the earth is open ground for the establishment of God's Kingdom-can be revived in our day. That vision can become a heritage for later generations. But to become a part of that heritage, men must reconsider the standard accounts of Puritanism's influence in the less informed (but widely read) secular textbooks. For Christians who want to learn why and how Puritan theology led to Puritanism's reconstruction of seventeenth-century though and culture, these issues of The Journal are indispensable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pJFyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landscaping with Herbs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Media Monopoly","description":"When the first edition of The Media Monopoly was published in 1983, critics called Ben Bagdikian's warnings about the chilling effects of corporate ownership and mass advertising on the nation's news \\"alarmist.\\" Since then, the number of corporations controlling most of America's daily newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies has dwindled from fifty to ten to five.

What happens when we die? A recent Pew Research poll showed that 72% of Americans believe in a literal heaven and 58% believe in a literal hell. Most people who hold these beliefs are Christian and assume they are the age-old teachings of the Bible. But eternal rewards and punishments are found nowhere in the Old Testament and are not what Jesus or his disciples taught. So where did these ideas come from? In this  eloquent understanding of how death is viewed through many spiritual traditions  (Publishers Weekly, starred review), Bart Ehrman recounts the long history of the afterlife, ranging from The Epic of Gilgamesh up to the writings of Augustine, focusing especially on the teachings of Jesus and his early followers. He discusses ancient guided tours of heaven and hell, in which a living person observes the sublime blessings of heaven for those who are saved and the horrifying torments of hell for those who are damned. Some of these accounts take the form of near death experiences, the oldest on record, with intriguing similarities to those reported today. One of Ehrman s startling conclusions is that there never was a single Greek, Jewish, or Christian understanding of the afterlife, but numerous competing views. Moreover, these views did not come from nowhere; they were intimately connected with the social, cultural, and historical worlds out of which they emerged. Only later, in the early Christian centuries, did they develop into notions of eternal bliss or damnation widely accepted today. In this  elegant history  (The New Yorker), Ehrman helps us reflect on where our ideas of the afterlife come from. With his  richly layered-narrative  (The Boston Globe) he assures us that even if there may be something to hope for when we die, there certainly is nothing to fear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SaOeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Semiconductor Optoelectronic Devices: Introduction to Physics and Simulation","description":"Optoelectronics has become an important part of our lives.

Such optoelectronic devices take advantage of sophisticated interactions between electrons and light. Nanometer scale semiconductor structures are often at the heart of modern optoelectronic devices. Their shrinking size and increasing complexity make computer simulation an important tool to design better devices that meet ever rising perfomance requirements. The current need to apply advanced design software in optoelectronics follows the trend observed in the 1980's with simulation software for silicon devices. Today, software for technology computer-aided design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) represents a fundamental part of the silicon industry. In optoelectronics, advanced commercial device software has emerged recently and it is expected to play an increasingly important role in the near future. This book will enable students, device engineers, and researchers to more effectively use advanced design software in optoelectronics. Provides fundamental knowledge in semiconductor physics and in electromagnetics, while helping to understand and use advanced device simulation software Demonstrates the combination of measurements and simulations in order to obtain realistic results and provides data on all required material parameters Gives deep insight into the physics of state-of-the-art devices and helps to design and analyze of modern optoelectronic devices","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qqVuFz1kDp0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girls' World Book of Jewelry","description":"Presents instructions for making a variety of jewelry, including necklaces, bracelets, rings, hair bands, and chokers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VqZyAlD72CIC&dq=Girls%27+World+Book+of+Jewelry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The descent of man,: And selection in relation to sex","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j-8hm8eHg-UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Immersion English Grammar & Pronunciation Crash Course","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jLfwnQAACAAJ&dq=Instant+Immersion+English+Grammar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girlfriend's Guide to Getting Your Groove Back: Loving Your Family Without Losing Your Mind","description":"Bust out of that mommy rut and get into the groove!

Vision for Life presents an approach to eye health for people with 20/20 vision who wish to maintain their perfect vision as well as people who see poorly and would like to improve their eyesight. Clients of the Meir Schneider Self-Healing Method experience their own capacity to bring about recovery, reversing the progress of a wide range of degenerative conditions including eye disease. Based in part on the established Bates Method of eyesight improvement and in part on his own professional and personal discoveries, Meir Schneider's pioneering approach has helped thousands of people successfully treat a host of eye problems, including near- and farsightedness, astigmatism, lazy eye, double vision, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and nystagmus. This revised edition includes a new chapter on children's eye health and new research and exercises for specific conditions, i.e., glaucoma and nystagmus, near- and farsightedness. Born blind to deaf parents, Schneider underwent a series of painful operations as a young child and was left with 99 percent scar tissue on the lenses of his eyes, resulting in his being declared incurably blind. At the age of seventeen, he discovered how to improve his vision from less than 1 percent to 55 percent of normal vision with the eye exercises presented in this book. Today Schneider drives a car, reads, and enjoys the benefits of full natural vision. He and his clients prove time and time again how much vision can improve with exercise. His contributions to the field of self-healing are recognized by alternative health practitioners and medical doctors alike. In Vision for Life, Schneider shares forty years of discoveries made on his personal and professional journey. The book details simple but effective techniques to gain great vision such as sunning and palming. Such exercises are not only strengthening but also restorative and deeply relaxing. The reader learns how to reverse developing issues before they cause damage or to remedy existing problems, including pathologies such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and optic nerve neuropathy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jogpDAAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Improve+your+sight,+new+and+revised+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiger Lillie","description":"Always the wedding coordinator, Lillie Bauer makes brides' dreams come true, but when it comes to her own love life, she's never the bride.

A few years ago, Andy Rosenzweig, an inspector for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, was abruptly reminded of an old, unsolved double homicide. It bothered him that Frankie Koehler, the notoriously dangerous suspect, had eluded capture and was still at large. Rosenzweig had known the victims of the crime, for they were childhood friends from the South Bronx: Richie Glennon, a Runyonesque ex-prizefighter at home with both cops and criminals, and Pete McGinn, a spirited restaurateur and father of four. Rosenzweig resolved to find the killer and close the case. In a surprising, intensely dramatic narrative, Philip Gourevitch brings together the story of Rosenzweig's pursuit with a mesmerizing account of Koehler's criminal personality and years on the lam. A Cold Case carries us deep into the lives and minds, the passions and perplexities, of an extraordinary cop and an extraordinary criminal whose lives were entwined over three decades. Set in a New York City that has all but disappeared, and written with a keen ear for the vibrant idiom of the colorful men and women who peopled its streets, this is nonetheless a book for our times. Gourevitch masterfully transforms a criminal investigation into a searching literary reckoning with the forces that drive one man to murder and another to hunt murderers.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qCvM6qwfhQ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of the Exile","description":"In this epic, original novel in which Hawaii's fierce, sweeping past springs to life, Kiana Davenport, author of the acclaimed Shark Dialogues, draws upon the remarkable stories of her people to create a timeless, passionate tale of love and survival, tragedy and triumph, survival and transcendence.

In the War of 1812, U.S. troops are battling the British on the Canadian border, even as a fierce fight is being waged against the Creek followers of the Indian leader Tecumseh and his brother, known as The Prophet. In Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte s war has become a losing proposition, and the British are only months away from unleashing a frightening assault on Washington itself. Fateful choices are being made in the corridors of power and on the American frontier. As Andrew Jackson, backed by Cherokee warriors, leads a fierce attack on the Creek tribes, his young republic will soon need every citizen soldier it can find. What ifat this critical momentbonds were forged between men of different races and tribes? What if the Cherokee clans were able to muster an integrated front, and the U.S. government faced a united Indian nation bolstered by escaping slaves, freed men of color, and even influential white allies?

It is perhaps the most misunderstood of modern philosophic positions misunderstood by reason of its broad popularity and general unfamiliarity with its origins, representatives, and principles. Existential thinking does not originate with Jean Paul Sartre. It has prior religious, literary, and philosophic origins. In its narrowest formulation it is a metaphysical doctrine, arguing as it does that any definition of man s essence must follow, not precede, an estimation of his existence. In Heidegger, it affords a view of Being in its totality; in Kierkegaard an approach to that inwardness indispensable to authentic religious experience; for Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Rilke the existential situation bears the stamp of modern man s alienation, uprootedness, and absurdity; to Sartre it has vast ethical and political implications. Walter Kaufmann, author of Nietzsche, is eminently qualified to present and interpret the insights of existentialism as they occur and are deepened by the major thinkers who express them. In every case complete selections or entire works have been employed: The Wall, Existentialism, and the complete chapter on  Self-Deception  from L  tre et le N ant by Sartre; two lectures from Jaspers  book Reason and Existenz; original translations of On My Philosophy by Jaspers and The Way Back into the Ground of Metaphysics by Heidegger.

Beginning in 1789, this period of extreme political and social unrest saw the end of the French monarchy, the death of an extraordinary number of people beneath the guillotine's blade during the Terror, and the rise of Napoleon, as well as far reaching consequences still with us today, such as the enduring ideology of human rights, and decimalization. In this Very Short Introduction, William Doyle introduces the French old regime and considers how and why it collapsed. Retelling the unfolding events of the revolution, he analyses why the revolutionaries quarrelled with the king, the church and the rest of Europe, why this produced Terror, and finally how it accomplished rule by a general. Doyle also discusses how and why the revolution destroyed the age-old cultural, institutional, and social structures in France and beyond. In this new edition, Doyle includes new sections highlighting the main developments in the field since the first edition, before exploring the legacy of the revolution in the form of rationality in public affairs and responsible government.

All of Grace is a theological study by Charles Spurgeon who is known as the \\"Prince of Preachers\\". Grace is the hallmark of Christianity which is often out of the focus of the Christian church. Spurgeon suggests that the grace is the central glue of faith, redemption, and repentance. He argues that through grace, repentance gets a meaning. A gospel centered study tells about the greatness of Jesus and the Lord's redemptive heart towards his own. Spurgeon deals with the sin that entangles us by showing us Jesus. He reminds us that the Lord knows very well that we can't change our heart, but he can, when we submit to him by faith in Jesus. And with faith comes repentance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kLLoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lyonesse: Bk.1 (Fantasy Masterworks 27)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1ZemAAAACAAJ&dq=Lyonesse:+Bk.1+(Fantasy+Masterworks+27)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CLASSICS OF THE AIR: An Illustrated History of the development of Military Planes from 1913-1935","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BNlDAAAACAAJ&dq=CLASSICS+OF+THE+AIR:+An+Illustrated+History+of+the+development+of+Military+Planes+from+1913-1935&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Stories from Grandma's Attic","description":"Presents a collection of stories of life in the late nineteenth century, many of them reflecting the Christian faith of the author's family, including tales of a contest for the best handiwork, a pig asleep in a baby carriage, and a visitor without a name.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QuVZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sir Winston Churchill: His Life and His Paintings","description":"Written by the renowned art critic who, along with Churchill's granddaughter, catalogued all of his paintings shortly after his death, this sumptuous art book collects all of the images and provides a look at his life story through his paintings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xFgyrgEACAAJ&dq=Sir+Winston+Churchill:+His+Life+and+His+Paintings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Rod Horsepower Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thanks for the Mammogram!: Fighting Cancer with Faith, Hope, and a Healthy Dose of Laughter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhPIQt_9qQwC&dq=Thanks+for+the+Mammogram!:+Fighting+Cancer+with+Faith,+Hope,+and+a+Healthy+Dose+of+Laughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snow Blind","description":"This translation originally published: Great Britain: Orenda Books, 2015.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m_DZDQAAQBAJ&dq=Snow+Blind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy Japanese Crossword Puzzles: Using Kana (English and Japanese Edition)","description":"Learn Japanese through crossword puzzles!

Rather than supporting place-sensitive curricula and establishing networks within community populations, the rural school has too often stood apart from local life, with the generally unintended consequence that many educationally successful rural youth come to see their communities and lifestyles as places to be left behind. They face what Michael Corbett calls a mobility imperative, which, he shows, has been central to contemporary schooling. Learning to Leave argues that if education is to be democratic and serve the purpose of economic, social, and cultural development, then it must adapt and respond to the specificity of its locale, the knowledge practices of the people, and the needs of those who struggle to remain in challenged rural places.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r1_iywEACAAJ&dq=Learning+to+Leave&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golf at St. Andrews","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Haunting of Lamb House","description":"A fictional account of the haunting of one of the most literary houses in history speculates on the supernatural dimensions of the house that inspired Henry James to write \\"The Turn of the Screw\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g6_BcaW6dG4C&dq=The+Haunting+of+Lamb+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hymns for the Living Church","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CX1tzgEACAAJ&dq=Hymns+for+the+Living+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poverty: Opposing Viewpoints","description":"Presents opposing viewpoints on various aspects of poverty, including its causes, ways to end it, the welfare system, the homeless, and the relationship between poverty and discrimination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WBVHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Poverty:+Opposing+Viewpoints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protect Your Sight: How to Save Your Vision in the Epidemic of Age-Related Macular Degeneration","description":"Two professors at the University of Iowa, experts in the field of macular degeneration, discuss the disease and its treatment, and suggest lifestyle changes that may reduce the risk of vision loss.164 pp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7U9cUXeIqMQC&dq=Protect+Your+Sight:+How+to+Save+Your+Vision+in+the+Epidemic+of+Age-Related+Macular+Degeneration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Azucar!

Azucar?s story is a complex and hauntingly atmospheric tale of sustained intrigue, murder, revenge, forbidden love, and an unnerving journey into the mystical spirit world of Caribbean ritual. Even after Azucar?s fiercely determined grandmother arranges for her to emigrate to Canada -- with a most unlikely couple-- where she is dramatically transformed, she is still not completely free from the hypnotic pull of the distant Caribbean plantation. Azucar meets and falls in love with Lucien, whose own mysterious history shockingly brings them both back to Esperanza Dulce to confront the terrifying ghosts of an unknowingly shared past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JFLRAAAACAAJ&dq=Azucar!+The+Story+of+Sugar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edge of Passion","description":"An anthology of twenty-one crime, mystery, suspense and romance stories from nineteen authors, including Emmy-nominated John Goldsmith and Booker-nominated Jim Williams.

Jamesburg and Monroe Township have a shared history dating back to 1734, when the first mill appeared on the shores of Lake Manalapan. Early settler James Buckelew settled on the lake's banks in 1832, and he became the namesake of Jamesburg. Today, the area consists of .877 square miles and is home to approximately 6,000 residents. While Monroe Township's first settler dates back to 1685, the township's namesake, James Monroe (the fifth president), served as a captain of George Washington's Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. In the last 30 years, more changes occurred within Monroe Township than since its creation 181 years ago. The establishment of Leisure World retirement community, now Rossmoor, in 1965 marked the beginnings of major development within the town. Today, Monroe Township is 43.7 square miles with a population of approximately 50,000 residents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CHXADwAAQBAJ&dq=Monroe+Township+and+Jamesburg+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muddy Waters (ISIS Large Print)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5LcPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Muddy+Waters+(ISIS+Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Irish Verse: An Anthology of Irish Poetry from the Sixth Century to the Present","description":"Works by Ireland's finest, from the sixth-century bards, through Swift and Goldsmith, to Yeats, Graves, Beckett, and today's young poets, provide a full survey of Irish poetry","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VNCCs9aFlOgC&dq=The+Book+of+Irish+Verse:+An+Anthology+of+Irish+Poetry+from+the+Sixth+Century+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Reformation Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","description":"The European Reformation of the sixteenth century was one of the most formative periods in the history of Christian thought and remains one of the most fascinating events in Western history.

How did the Civil War alter the lives of women, both white and black, left alone on southern farms? How did the Great Depression change the lives of working class families in eastern cities? How did the discovery of gold in California transform the lives of native American, Hispanic, and white communities in western territories? Organized by time period as spelled out in the National Standards for U.S. History, these four volumes effectively analyze the diverse whole of American experience, examining the domestic, economic, intellectual, material, political, recreational, and religious life of the American people between 1763 and 2005.

Miller, professor of history at St. Joseph's University, a group of expert volume editors carefully integrate material drawn from volumes in Greenwood's highly successful Daily Life Through History series with new material researched and written by themselves and other scholars. The four volumes cover the following periods: The War of Independence and Antebellum Expansion and Reform, 1763-1861, The Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Industrialization of America, 1861-1900, The Emergence of Modern America, World War I, and the Great Depression, 1900-1940 and Wartime, Postwar, and Contemporary America, 1940-Present.

Without the shield of a strong, silent deterrent or the intellectual sword of espionage beneath the sea, that war could not have been won. John P. Craven was a key figure in the Cold War beneath the sea. As chief scientist of the Navy's Special Projects Office, which supervised the Polaris missile system, then later as head of the Deep Submergence Systems Project (DSSP) and the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle program (DSRV), both of which engaged in a variety of clandestine undersea projects, he was intimately involved with planning and executing America's submarine-based nuclear deterrence and submarine-based espionage activities during the height of the Cold War. Craven was considered so important by the Soviets that they assigned a full-time KGB agent to spy on him. Some of Craven's highly classified activities have been mentioned in such books as Blind Man's Bluff, but now he gives us his own insights into the deadly cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet forces played deep in the world's oceans. Craven tells riveting stories about the most treacherous years of the Cold War. In 1956 Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine and the backbone of the Polaris ballistic missile system, was only days or even hours from sinking due to structural damage of unknown origin. Craven led a team of experts to diagnose the structural flaw that could have sent the sub to the bottom of the ocean, taking the Navy's missile program with it. Craven offers insight into the rivalry between the advocates of deterrence (with whom he sided) and those military men and scientists, such as Edward Teller, who believed that the United States had to prepare to fight and win a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. He describes the argument that raged in the Navy over the reasons for the tragic loss of the submarine Thresher, and tells the astonishing story of the hunt for the rogue Soviet sub that became the model for The Hunt for Red October -- including the amazing discovery the Navy made when it eventually found the sunken sub. Craven takes readers inside the highly secret DSSP and DSRV programs, both of which offered crucial cover for sophisticated intelligence operations. Both programs performed important salvage operations in addition to their secret espionage activities, notably the recovery of a nuclear bomb off Palomares, Spain. He describes how the Navy's success at deep-sea recovery operations led to the takeover of the entire program by the CIA during the Nixon administration. A compelling tale of intrigue, both within our own government and between the U.S. and Soviet navies, The Silent War is an enthralling insider's account of how the submarine service kept the peace during the dangerous days of the Cold War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ih8MVZlibxYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Routledge Study Guide and Sourcebook (Routledge Guides to Literature)","description":"Robert Morrison sets Pride and Prejudice within the social contexts of female conduct books and political tales of terror and traces criticism of the novel from the nineteenth century to the present, including material on the 1995 film adaptation.

The dismissals are clearly presented for what they are: sendings. Candidates and catechumens are sent from the liturgy to be nourished by the Scripture readings of the day. Since the text for the catechumenate is the Lectionary, each dismissal is based on the readings of that particular Sunday. Using this tool, the parish community will understand why they are dismissing these individuals and will also experience the call to listen to and reflect on the Scriptures. A prayer of the faithful, which links the Sunday readings to the dismissal, is also included each week so that the parish family may offer prayerful support to their candidates and catechumens. The readings used as a basis for the dismissal are referenced. Sturdy \\"ease\\" binding allows the book to open flat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q1s5PQAACAAJ&dq=Sunday+Dismissals+for+the+RCIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Warrior","description":"A trick of magic, a twist of fate. As the orphaned nephew of the king, trusted companion to his cousin, and second heir to the throne of Skala, Prince Tobin s future is clear. But not as clear as the spring in which a hill witch shows him his true face--and his secret destiny.... Now Tobin carries a burden he cannot share with even his closest friend, Ki, his squire. He is to rule--not as he is but as he was born: a woman. Given the shape of a boy by dark magic, Tobin is the last hope of the people of Illior--those who desperately seek a return to the old ways, when Skala was ruled by a line of warrior queens. They still believe that only a woman can lift the war, famine, and pestilence that have run rampant through the land since the king usurped his half sister s throne. It is these outlaw wizards and witches who protect Tobin--and it is for them that Tobin must accept his fate. With the unsuspecting yet fiercely loyal Ki at his side, Tobin must turn traitor against the only blood ties he has left. He must lift the masks of Skala s rulers to show their true colors--before he can reveal the power of the woman within himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W8Hv5DiBZQoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for Answers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cH1doLEpzEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morality: Its Nature and Justification","description":"In this final revision of the classic work, the author has produced the fullest and most sophisticated account of this influential theoretical model. Here, he makes clear that morality is an informal system that does not provide unique answers to every moral question but does always limit the range of morally acceptable options, and so explains why some moral disagreements cannot be resolved. The importance placed on the moral ideals also makes clear that the moral rules are only one part of the moral system. A chapter that is devoted to justifying violations of the rules illustrates how the moral rules are embedded in the system and cannot be adequately understood independently of it. The chapter on reasons includes a new account of what makes one reason better than another and elucidates the complex hybrid nature of rationality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K1TGzNrSDxUC&dq=Morality:+Its+Nature+and+Justification&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brewer's Star","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Book of Jonah: Illustrated for Children by Niko Chocheli","description":"Presents the story of Jonah who was sent to warn the people of Nineveh that God planned to destroy them if they did not change their ways.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r7TxMS8rQKQC&dq=The+Book+of+Jonah:+Illustrated+for+Children+by+Niko+Chocheli&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theories of ethics; (Oxford readings in philosophy)","description":"Rachels's two-volume Ethical Theory provides a comprehensive overview of contemporary moral philosophy, reprinting classic and contemporary articles, including many that are not otherwise readily available.

Judith Braverman, a teenager living in an Orthodox Jewish community in the GFS, is not only a talented artist accomplished in the ancient craft of papercutting, she also has the gift of seeing into peoples  souls and can tell instantly if someone is good or evil. Jeffrey Schwartz has no love for religion or conformity and yearns to escape to the freedom of the UPR. When he s accepted into an experimental pen pal program and paired with Dani Fine, an openly queer girl in the UPR, he hopes that he can finally find a way out. As danger mounts and their alarm grows, Judith embeds a secret code in her papercuts so that she and Jeffrey can tell Dani what s happening to Jews in the GFS without raising suspicions from the government. When the three arrange a quick, clandestine meeting, Jeffrey is finally faced with the choice to flee or to stay and resist. And Judith is reeling from a pull toward Dani that is unlike anything she has ever felt before. Content note: the book contains one brief memory of sexual assault of a male teen by another male teen.

The place is Fazenda Pau D'Alho, Brazil, where she and her husband, Carson, have lived and farmed since 1961. Healing the ravaged coffee plantation, rearing five children, exploring the outposts, the Gelds have created a dynamic yet peaceful life far from Ellen's native Ohio. Their practice of sustainable agriculture, and Ellen's plea for the preservation of Brazil's remaining wilderness areas, reflect the legacy of her father, the novelist and farm visionary Louis Bromfield. Their shared vision is crystallized in her account of a cattle drive across the Pantanal, the vast flood plain on Brazil's side of the Paraguay River. She describes a two-hundred year symbiosis between ranchers and a fragile ecosystem that is being threatened by development. View from the Fazenda is distilled from fifty years of living in Brazil, weaving daily life on the farm into her quest to understand a nation. It portrays a true melting pot of people who--as conquerers, immigrants, or slaves, their blood and history mingled with those of native Indians--have created the character of Brazil. This huge, diverse county, living in several eras at the same time, is ever changing through its people's amazing ability to \\"find a way.\\" Ellen Bromfield Geld evokes the land and people of Brazil and offers readers an invigorating glimpse into a soulful life. \\"It seems to me that being a bit of a poet is perhaps the only way one can survive as a farmer,\\" she explains. \\"For in the end, more than anything, farming is a way of life you either love or become bitter enduring.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ACly62fZ3xEC&dq=View+from+the+Fazenda:+A+Tale+of+the+Brazilian+Heartlands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish fairy tales","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vWwFAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace In Passing : How to find peace in the passing of someone you love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xuAuAAAACAAJ&dq=Peace+In+Passing+:+How+to+find+peace+in+the+passing+of+someone+you+love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trucks of the Wehrmacht: A Photo Chronicle (German Vehicles in World War II)","description":"Covers the numerous Volkswagen trucks and cars used by the Wehrmacht during WWII.

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. Professors Bakuzis and Hansen, with the assistance of a number of co-authors of individual chapters, present an exhaustive survey of the literature on the balsam fir, providing a coherent picture of the species and its place in nature and forestry practice. The balsam fir is used extensively in the pulp and paper industry, and it is known to millions as a traditional Christmas tree. In North America it is a major tree species in Canada, in the northeastern United States, and in the Great Lakes region. In the search of the literature, over 2000 sources were consulted and considerably more than half of them are cited in the book. The references, organized in an ecological framework, cover the period from the seventeenth century to the present. The authors have reviewed and integrated these data in a unified, but multipurposed, book. In the integration of the source material the authors also made contributions of their own. The book contains the following chapters: Botanical Foundations, Geography and Synecology, Ecological Factors, Microbiology, Entomology, Reproduction, Stand Development, Growth and Yield, and Utilization. Appendixes list fungi and myxomycetes and insects associated with balsam fir. There are 30 illustrations, including a frontispiece drawing by the noted nature artist Francis Lee Jaques. The book will appeal to a wide range of readers specifically concerned with forestry, including research workers, educators, entomologists, pathologists, and managing foresters, as well as conservationists and wildlife biologist in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=slOFJEP8ckMC&dq=The+Agaricales+(Mushrooms)+in+modern+taxonomy+(Lilloa,+revista+de+botanica)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of Haiti","description":"Paris tells the story of Larry and Gwen Mellon and the passion that inspired them to leave behind a world of almost unfathomable luxury to devote their lives to the practice of medicine amongst the poorest of the poor. of photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LjFgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Song+of+Haiti&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2000 Ford Focus Owners Manual","description":"This is an automotive maintenance and repair manual for the VW Beetle vehicles.

For decades the FBI let Bulger get away with murder, protecting him from prosecution for crimes it knew he had committed and allowing him continued control of his criminal enterprise in exchange for information about the rival Italian mafia and even members of his own gang. During the 1980s, Edward J. MacKenzie, Jr.,  Eddie Mac,  was a drug dealer and enforcer who would do just about anything for Bulger. In this compelling eyewitness account, the first from a Bulger insider, Eddie Mac delivers the goods on his one-time boss and on such former associates as Stephen ''The Rifleman'' Flemmi and turncoat FBI agent John Connolly. Eddie Mac provides a window onto a world rarely glimpsed by those on the outside. Street Soldier is also a story of the search for family, for acceptance, for respect, loyalty, and love. Abandoned by his parents at the age of four, MacKenzie became a ward of the state of Massachusetts, suffered physical and sexual abuse in the foster care system, and eventually drifted into a life of crime and Bulger's orbit. The Eddie Mac who emerges in these pages is complex: An enforcer who was also a kick-boxing and Golden Gloves champion; a womanizer who fought for custody of his daughters; a tenth-grade dropout living on the streets who went on, as an adult, to earn a college degree in three years; a man, who lived by the strict code of loyalty to the mob, but set up a sting operation that would net one of the largest hauls of cocaine ever seized. Eddie's is a harsh story, but it tells us something important about the darker corners of our world. Street Soldier is as disturbing and fascinating as a crime scene, as heart-stopping as a bar fight, and at times as darkly comic as Quentin Tarantino s Pulp Fiction or Martin Scorsese s Good Fellas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FX4DAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diario de un buscador de respuestas","description":"?Esta obra singular, concebida por el autor como interludio entre novelas o trabajo preparatorio para El adolescente y Los hermanos Karam zov, es imprescindible para conocer y comprender al escritor y a la persona.?

Redbooks? publication explains the capabilities of IBM WebSphere? Application Server Liberty profile (Liberty profile), which is lightweight, easy to install, and fast to use. Liberty profile provides a convenient and capable platform for developing and testing your web and OSGi applications. The Liberty profile server is built by using OSGi technology and concepts. The fit-for-purpose nature of the run time relies on the dynamic behavior that is inherent in the OSGi framework and service registry.

That \\"the whole nine yards\\" comes from (pick one) the length of a WWII gunner's belt; the amount of fabric needed to make a kilt; a sarcastic football expression? That Chicago is called \\"The Windy City\\" because of the bloviating habits of its politicians, and not the breeze off the lake? If so, you need this book. David Wilton debunks the most persistently wrong word histories, and gives, to the best of our actual knowledge, the real stories behind these perennially mis-etymologized words. In addition, he explains why these wrong stories are created, disseminated, and persist, even after being corrected time and time again. What makes us cling to these stories, when the truth behind these words and phrases is available, for the most part, at any library or on the Internet? Arranged by chapters, this book avoids a dry A-Z format. Chapters separate misetymologies by kind, including The Perils of Political Correctness (picnics have nothing to do with lynchings), Posh, Phat Pommies (the problems of bacronyming--the desire to make every word into an acronym), and CANOE (which stands for the Conspiracy to Attribute Nautical Origins to Everything). Word Myths corrects long-held and far-flung examples of wrong etymologies, without taking the fun out of etymology itself. It's the best of both worlds: not only do you learn the many wrong stories behind these words, you also learn why and how they are created--and what the real story is.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5LEWiomDiEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tori Amos - Scarlet's Walk","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Work on the ASV was completed in 1901. The translation was tasked with the goal of an accurate, literal, word-for-word translation of the Holy Scriptures. The ASV took advantage of two 19th century developments to achieve their goal: improvements in understanding the grammar and syntax of koine Greek (the language of the New Testament), and a more complete library of manuscripts than previous Bible translators had access. As a result of this work the ASV translation was developed that retained distinctions made in Greek that are not normally expressed in modern English. For example, second person personal pronouns in modern English usage are normally  you  which gives no distinction between the singular and plural. Koine Greek unambiguously makes the distinction between a second person personal singular pronoun and the second person personal plural pronoun. In this case the ASV retained these distinctions by using archaic English ( you  for the singular and  ye  for the plural). The word-for-word translation of the ASV was attractive in the scholarly environment, and the ASV was adopted as the standard version used by many American seminaries. The ASV is the foundation and starting point for several modern translations. Hence it is a very good reference and even primary translation to use. Note: Paperback is 8.5x11 with regular thickness pages for durability. Also only 263 pages for portability.

Urging readers to look beyond traditional understandings of what constitutes genius, Armstrong describes 12 such qualities: curiosity, playfulness, imagination, creativity, wonder, wisdom, inventiveness, vitality, sensitivity, flexibility, humor, and joy. He cites research in various fields that supports this broader understanding of genius and explains how influences in the home, the popular media, and the school itself \\"shut down\\" the genius in students. Combining thoughtful insights and practical information, Armstrong offers guiding principles to help educators awaken genius in the classroom--beginning with awakening the genius in themselves. Readers will find dozens of suggested activities and helpful resources to provide \\"genius experiences\\" and create a \\"genial climate\\" in the classroom. In addition, suggestions for further study at the end of each section provide starting points for personal and professional reflection and growth. As it celebrates the potential brainpower waiting to be unlocked in classrooms everywhere, Awakening Genius in the Classroom inspires educators to look at their students from a different perspective and to reinvigorate their teaching with a new sense of excitement and possibility. The result, Armstrong concludes, could extend far beyond the classroom and transform not only our schools, but the entire world.

Sure to shock, confound and ultimately inspire readers, The Ronin is loosely based upon an ancient legend told to the author by the Zen Master Nyogen Senzaki.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s5DTAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Avatars of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace","description":"In Avatars of the Word, O'Donnell reinterprets today's communication revolution through a series of refracted comparisons with earlier revolutionary periods: from the papyrus scroll to the codex and from copied manuscript to print.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0wVEK6Kzfr0C&dq=Avatars+of+the+Word:+From+Papyrus+to+Cyberspace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yellow Snake","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

According to Hick, Jesus did not teach what was to become the orthodox understanding of him: that he was God incarnate who became human to die for the sins of the world. Further, the traditional dogma of Jesus' two natures--human and divine--cannot be explained satisfactorily, and worse, it has been used to justify great human evils. Thus, the divine incarnation, he explains, is best understood metaphorically. Nevertheless, he concludes that Christians can still understand Jesus as Lord and the one who has made God real to us.

This brilliant woman reporter, greatly admired by the fighting men, has dodged bullets with troops on the line, has asked neither favor nor privilege for herself, and has been commended publicly for bravery in helping grievously wounded men under fire. This is her up-front, personal report of the human side of the war. With the discerning eye of the expert reporter and the sympathy of a woman living through the agony of her countrymen, Miss Higgins tells the whole story of the bitter Korean campaign: young, green troops maturing in battle, Communist bullets kicking over the coffeepot at breakfast, the initial inadequacy of American arms, and the terrible price in men we are paying for unpreparedness. Miss Higgins also sketches brilliant thumbnail portraits of Generals MacArthur Walker, and Dean, and of many line and staff officers as well as GIs. In WAR IN KOREA she has written a tremendously compelling book that calls a spade a spade as it reveals the hell and heroism of an ordeal which compares to Valley Forge in the annals of American fighting men.

His 1973 novel, The Sunlight Dialogues, was on the New York Times bestseller list for fourteen weeks. Once in the limelight, he picked public fights with his peers, John Barth, Joseph Heller, and Norman Mailer among them, and wrote five more bestsellers. Gardner's personal life was as chaotic as his writing life was prolific. At twenty, he married his cousin Joan, and after a long marriage that was both passionate and violent, left her for Liz Rosenberg, a student. Only a few years later, he left Rosenberg for another student, Susan Thornton. Famous for disregarding his own safety, he rode his motorcycle at crazy speeds, incurred countless concussions, and once broke both of his arms. He survived what was diagnosed as terminal colon cancer only to resume his prodigious drinking and to die in a motorcycle accident at age forty-nine, a week before his third wedding. Biographer Barry Silesky captures John Gardner's fabulously contradictory genius and his capacity to both dazzle and infuriate. He portrays Gardner as a man of unrestrained energy and blatant contempt for convention and also as a man whose charisma drew students and devoted followers wherever he went. Amazingly, Gardner published twenty-nine books in all, including eleven fiction titles, a book-length epic poem, six books of medieval criticism, and a major biography. Twenty-one years after his death, his On Moral Fiction and The Art Of Fiction are still read and debated in MFA programs across the country. This is a full-scale biography of a writer who was, for ten years, almost bigger than life. It lives up to its subject magnificently.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a8_5g5qF_t0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Did I Meet You Grandma?","description":"A child asks the question: \\"When did I meet you Grandpa?\\" and remembers their occasions together.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lY_gs9AtULkC&dq=When+Did+I+Meet+You+Grandma%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mouse Cookies: 10 Easy-To-Make Cookie Recipes with a Story in Pictures (With Cookie Cutter)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t4hYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Mouse+Cookies:+10+Easy-To-Make+Cookie+Recipes+with+a+Story+in+Pictures+(With+Cookie+Cutter)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City Survival City Resistance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zeZaGwAACAAJ&dq=City+Survival+City+Resistance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saadat Hasan Manto; Selected Stories","description":"The gentle dhobi who transforms into a killer, a prostitute who is more child than woman, the cocky, young coachman who falls in love at first sight, a father convinced that his son will die before his first birthday.

In 1971 Deirdre Bair was a journalist and recently minted Ph.D. who managed to secure access to Nobel Prize-winning author Samuel Beckett. He agreed that she could be his biographer despite her never having written or even read a biography before. The next seven years comprised of intimate conversations, intercontinental research, and peculiar cat-and-mouse games. Battling an elusive Beckett and a string of jealous, misogynistic male writers, Bair persevered. She wrote Samuel Beckett: A Biography, which went on to win the National Book Award and propel Deirdre to her next subject: Simone de Beauvoir. The catch? De Beauvoir and Beckett despised each other and lived essentially on the same street. Bair learned that what works in terms of process for one biography rarely applies to the next. Her seven-year relationship with the domineering and difficult de Beauvoir required a radical change in approach, yielding another groundbreaking literary profile and influencing Bair s own feminist beliefs. Parisian Lives draws on Bair s extensive notes from the period, including never-before-told anecdotes. This gripping memoir is full of personality and warmth and gives us an entirely new window on the all-too-human side of these legendary thinkers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0mOIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hizballah of Lebanon: Extremist ideals vs. mundane politics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lY5BJAAACAAJ&dq=Hizballah+of+Lebanon:+Extremist+ideals+vs.+mundane+politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s","description":"High Art Lite takes a cool and critical look at the way in which British art in the 1990s has reinvented itself, successfully appealing both to the mass media and to the elite art world.

It is fiction based on the truths that loom before us all. Chapter 1 is totally true, as the main character encounters a stigmatic, through a third party, on his 21st birthday ? the day he was to decide about becoming a priest. There are many other truths that manifest themselves throughout this book. The author is able to identify who the angels of the Apocalypse actually are by name, which is very bold, and is able to back these up with Biblical facts, that are thrown into this work. The author spins a web of world events that develop well, with many twists and turns, and in the end, all things come together, in a very climatic scene. Don?t overlook any details given by the author, as there are many covert themes present. He seems to say a lot with few words, as if he trusts the reader?s intelligence. Peter is able to bring these world events to a level that relate to the lives of everyday people, while giving us an insight to the way our world leaders would handle the apocalyptic situations. One point brought up by one of the book?s characters, Pope Peter II, is monumental, \\"The Bible is the most widely published book ever?why does no one know how it ends?\\" The insight the author has is straight forward, and Peter does not hesitate to challenge other schools of thought. The \\"Left Behind\\" theory is put under scrutiny, and the characters give argument to this widely accepted theory, quite successfully. The Seven Angels of the Apocalypse, is not a long, drawn out novel, which is good, because the readers attention will be so intense, that you just can?t put this book down. This book takes you from today, to the Second Coming. There will be a sequel, The Millennial Reign of Jesus Christ, to take us from the Second Coming to the end of Revelations.

Bill Blair finds the land by accident, three wooded acres in a rustic community south of San Francisco. The year is 1954, long before anyone will call this area Silicon Valley. Struck by a vision of his future family, Bill buys the property and proposes to Penny Greenway, a woman whose yearning attitude toward life appeals to him. In less than a decade they have four children. Yet Penny is a mercurial housewife, overwhelmed and undersatisfied, chafing at the conventions confining her. Years later, the three oldest Blair children, adults now and still living near the family home, are disrupted by the return of the youngest, whose sudden presence sets off a struggle over the family s future. One by one, they tell their stories, which reveal Packer s  great compassion for her characters, with their ancient injuries, their blundering desires. The way she tangles their perspectives perfectly, painfully captures the tumult of selves within a family  (MORE Magazine). Reviewers have praised Ann Packer s  brilliant ear for character  (The New York Times Book Review) and her  naturalist s vigilance for detail, so that her characters seem observed rather than invented  (The New Yorker). Her talents are on dazzling display in The Children s Crusade,  an absorbing novel that celebrates family even as it catalogs its damages  (People, Book of the Week).

The mystery of the biblical heart is unveiled by integrating psychology and Scripture to delineate the five dispositions of the heart, the choice of which we morph into could either enhance or hinder the attainment of abundant life in Christ. Throughout time, people have been searching for the meaning of life and the way to find fulfillment. It is the intention of this book to show how, by Looking upon the Heart, where Jesus may live, we can actualize healing and holiness at any moment in time. In this in-depth, Christian psychology and self-help/textbook, the reader is enlightened as to what good and bad choices we can make about our character and personality; the goal is to consistently be transformed (morphed) out of the unhealthy dispositions of the heart (the broken heart and the hard heart) into healthier ones (the open heart, sweet heart, and the brave heart). Our first basic premise is that we all, believers and unbelievers alike, can and do spontaneously morph continually in and out of various dispositions, character states and personality styles, and so are capable of immediate transformation. The second premise is that grace must prevail; we all would be hypocrites if we judged, because we are all morphing, having our good moments and bad, at any particular moment in real time. Ultimately the overall perspective is that the heart should be the most important human entity known to man. The heart is the primary gatekeeper and decision-maker and, therefore, the overall determiner of the whole person's behavior, personal growth, and spiritual maturity. We are to embrace a complete understanding of the biblical heart, its five dispositions, in order to overcome psychological, behavioral and relational dysfunction and sin. Only then can we successfully and consistently experience oneness with God through Jesus, living and actively operating within our hearts. As a result of \\"Looking upon the Heart,\\" the Lord reigns and leads us to a life of victory in Jesus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rqEuEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy (Suny Series in Philosophy)","description":"Presents a synoptic, compact, and accessible exposition of this influential and interesting sector of twentieth-century American philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8MjR29eJLYIC&dq=Process+Metaphysics:+An+Introduction+to+Process+Philosophy+(Suny+Series+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlocking the Bible Story: Old Testament Volume 1","description":"For all who are wondering how the pieces fit into the jigsaw of God's revelation, Colin Smith has provided an answer, which is refreshingly simple, biblically accurate, and will prove phenomenally helpful to the serious Bible student and the new beginner alike.   Alistair Begg, senior pastor, Parkside Church In Unlocking the Bible Story, Colin Smith moves gradually through portions of the Bible to explain how it all holds together. He tells God's one grand story of salvation and reflects on major themes along the way. In volume 1 he moves through the Pentateuch and Historical Books of the Old Testament, which tell the story of God creating the world, choosing a people for Himself, and loving them despite their continued sin. Includes the study guide formerly sold separately. One of the most urgent needs in the church today is for a crisp and comprehensive knowledge of the Bible's storyline. To grasp how the sacred history moves from Genesis to Revelation not only brings fresh insight into how the Bible hangs together, and what each part contributes to the whole, but also is crucial for developing a Christian worldview. Colin Smith has met these needs admirably. I hope these volumes will circulate widely and be read and re-read.   D. A.

The Complete Guide to Border Collies has in-depth knowledge and advice from the first time you get your pup, right up to their later years. No matter if you are an experienced or a new owner; it has everything that you will need to know throughout the whole life of your Border Collie.\\" - Dawson McClements, Border Collie Owner If you've ever seen a dog in a television commercial, there's a pretty good chance it was a Border Collie. Or, if you've watched herding competitions, you've probably seen a Border Collie controlling the herd. First and foremost, Border Collies are sheep herders. But when they're not on the clock, they can make excellent companions. They're energetic, playful, and extremely intelligent. They're also sensitive, affectionate, and adorable. Even though this breed is still vital to livestock owners, we will focus on the Border Collie as a pet in this book. Intelligence is perhaps the most prominent trait of the Border Collie. In the pasture, this dog can understand specific commands and respond accordingly. They also excel at obedience competitions and agility runs because they can pick up new skills quickly and respond to challenging commands. This book will give you the information you need to jump-start your ownership journey, including: Border Collie History Choosing a Border Collie Preparing your Home for your Border Collie Bringing Home your Border Collie Being a Puppy Parent Housetraining Socializing with People and Animals Border Collies and Your Other Pets Physical and Mental Exercise Training your Border Collie Basic Commands Dealing With Unwanted Behaviors Traveling with Border Collies Nutrition Grooming your Border Collie Basic Health Care Advanced Border Collie Health and Aging Dog Care This book will become your go-to guide throughout your BC's life, as it has helpful hints and reminders that will prove to be practical far into their adulthood. Border Collies are an absolute joy to have as pets. These dogs are beautiful, intelligent, and silly. They love to test their owners and call the shots, but at the end of the day, they're capable of following orders. You'll never find another dog quite like them, as they're capable of running around one minute and snuggling up beside you the next. All your Border Collie wants is a purpose. While they may drive you nuts when they're bored, it's amazing to watch them work. Whether your Border Collie's \\"job\\" is to tend livestock, chase the rabbits and birds from your garden, or just be a loving companion, you'll find that your Border Collie will do anything for the love and affection with which you pay them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8y7vzgEACAAJ&dq=Collies:+How+to+Take+Care+of+Them+and+to+Understand+Them+(Complete+Pet+Owners+Manual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MeruPuri, Vol. 1 (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Inspector Ghote Breaks an Egg (Nelson Graded Readers)","description":"The Mahabharata is at once an archive and a living text, a sourcebook complete by itself and an open text perennially under construction.

Amid waving flags and boozy celebration, the three men - Fen, his best friend Locky and self-assured Frank, rival for the woman Fen loves - enlist as volunteers to take on the Germans and win glory. Through ramshackle training in sodden England and a stint in arid Egypt, rebellious but brave Fen proves himself to be a natural leader, only undermined by on-going friction with Frank.

In every genre of statuary, Verrocchio made formal and conceptual contributions of the greatest significance, and many of his sculptures, such as the Christ and St. Thomas and the Colleoni Monument, are among the masterpieces of Renaissance art. A favorite artist of Lorenzo de' Medici and the teacher of Leonardo da Vinci, Verrocchio was a key link between the innovations of the fifteenth century and the creations of the High Renaissance. This beautiful catalogue raisonn  is the first comprehensive and detailed study of Verrocchio's extraordinary and innovative sculptures. Andrew Butterfield has combined careful visual analysis of the sculptures with groundbreaking research into their function, iconography, and historical context. In order to explain Verrocchio's contributions to the different genres of Renaissance sculpture, Butterfield provides new and important information on a broad range of issues such as the typology and social history of Florentine tombs, the theoretical problems in the production of perspectival reliefs, and the origins of the Figura serpentinata. Furthermore, Butterfield draws on a spectrum of often overlooked texts to elucidate fundamental iconographical problems, for example, the significance of David in quattrocento Florence. In its scope, depth, and clarity, The Sculptures of Andrea del Verrocchio will rank as one of the finest studies of an Italian sculptor ever published.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXN3cFrzzGgC&dq=The+Sculptures+of+Andrea+del+Verrocchio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The General Councils: A History of the Twenty-One Church Councils from Nicaea to Vatican II","description":"A succinct, up-to-date and chronological history of the 21 general councils, along with their major tasks, achievements and failures and their impact on their times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K6rsAx2F1IcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Is How We Do It: The Working Mothers' Manifesto","description":"An entertaining handbook for new mothers and mothers-to-be helps readers maintain their individual flair, identity, and style in their new role as a parent, with witty guidelines on everything from fashion and decorating, to nutrition and finding one's personal parenting style.

What is it for? How should judges decide novel cases when the statutes and earlier decisions provide no clear answer? Do judges make up new law in such cases, or is there some higher law in which they discover the correct answer? Must everyone always obey the law? If not, when is a citizen morally free to disobey? A renowned philosopher enters the debate surrounding these questions. Clearly and forcefully, Ronald Dworkin argues against the  ruling  theory in Anglo-American law legal positivism and economic utilitarianism and asserts that individuals have legal rights beyond those explicitly laid down and that they have political and moral rights against the state that are prior to the welfare of the majority. Mr. Dworkin criticizes in detail the legal positivists' theory of legal rights, particularly H.L.A. Hart's well-known version of it. He then develops a new theory of adjudication, and applies it to the central and politically important issue of cases in which the Supreme Court interprets and applies the Constitution. Through an analysis of John Rawls's theory of justice, he argues that fundamental among political rights is the right of each individual to the equal respect and concern of those who govern him. He offers a theory of compliance with the law designed not simply to answer theoretical questions about civil disobedience, but to function as a guide for citizens and officials. Finally, Professor Dworkin considers the right to liberty, often thought to rival and even pre-empt the fundamental right to equality. He argues that distinct individual liberties do exist, but that they derive, not from some abstract right to liberty as such, but from the right to equal concern and respect itself. He thus denies that liberty and equality are conflicting ideals. Ronald Dworkin's theory of law and the moral conception of individual rights that underlies it have already made him one of the most influential philosophers working in this area. This is the first publication of these ideas in book form.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-HuwatdQKhgC&dq=Taking+Rights+Seriously&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BECOMING A HEALTHY DISCIPLE","description":"In Becoming a Healthy Disciple, Macchia explores the ten traits of a healthy disciple, including a vital prayer life, evangelistic outreach, worship, servanthood, and stewardship.

Just ask the Diplomatic Security Service. It was on February 6, 1993, that the United States was first attacked on its own soil by foreign terrorists. A zealous band of Middle Easterners, holy warriors determined to punish the U.S. for its supposed transgressions against Islam, packed over a ton of home made explosives into the back of a rented van. They drove their bomb across the Hudson from New Jersey, maneuvered it through downtown traffic and parked it in the underground garage at the Vista Hotel, beneath the twin towers of the World Trade Center. They lit a long fuse, which allowed them time to get back to New Jersey to watch the results of the explosion on CNN. They hoped to topple one mammoth tower into the other and kill ten thousand people or more. Miraculously, only six people were killed. Most of the group were captured within a week, but the mastermind behind the attack, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, had immediately gone to JFK airport to fly to Pakistan. Before leaving, he phoned the Associated Press and claimed responsibility for the bombing in the name of the Arab Liberation Army, a terrorist group led by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. A succession of such brazen crimes has revealed complex connections among terrorist groups with an implacable hostility toward Western civilization. Outrages such as the assassination of the Jewish Defense League founder Meier Kahane, a huge plot in the Philippines to plant bombs on intercontinental airlines and to assassinate the Pope, the bombing of U.S. embassies, culminating in the African embassy bombings of 1998, the attack on the USS Cole in 1999, and the devastating attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 have made it clear that a worldwide network of terrorists led by Osama bin Laden is making war on the United States. On the front lines combating these terrorists in 150 countries around the world have been the 1,200 agents of the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service. A little-known but highly effective branch of the government, the DSS is the one arm of federal law enforcement with international powers of arrest. These agents maintain close ties to local police commanders in many countries and can entice informants with bounties of up to $4,000,000. After a challenging international search, it was DSS agents in Pakistan who captured Ramzi Yousef. DSS agents have been in the vanguard of the War on Terrorism long before it was declared. In Relentless Pursuit, Samuel Katz review the escalating series of terrorist attacks on the U.S. during the last decade, including those in many foreign countries and finally in New York and Washington. In the process, he tells the gripping story of the DSS and its agents protecting us and our representatives here and abroad. Katz's detailed, personal, on-the-ground anecdotes bring home the contexts and linkages of the War on Terrorism that has been fought on our behalf by the DSS since the 1980s. Relentless Pursuit is a stirring tribute to an unsung group of brave Americans.

Kane, from a prominent Philadelphia family, became one of the most renowned and honored explorers of the antebellum era. Fox grew up in rural upstate New York and, as one of the Fox Sisters, became a famed and somewhat notorious spirit rapper whose strange knocks were said to be communications from the dead. The two were rumored to have had a love affair, and they may even have been secretly married. new and strange (though not necessarily true) to their audiences - the unknown worlds of the globe and the spirit. They brought experiences to their listeners that were exotic and delightful. The burgeoning commercial mass culture of antebellum America provided a natural venue for tales of huge icebergs, fierce polar bears, and messages from the dead. Their public careers bridged the gaps between the scientific investigations of an earlier Enlightenment age and a newer form of sensational inquiry growing up in a democratic marketplace. While Kane and Fox began by generating curiosity about geography and the nature of the human soul, in time their personal relationship became the basis for what newspaperman Horace Greeley would call an impertinent curiosity. Newspapers printed letters about their supposed romance, and eventually a book purporting to be the famous explorer's love-letters to the notorious spiritualist was published.

The second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's semiautobiographical George Sherston trilogy picks up shortly after Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: in 1916, with the young Sherston deep in the trenches of WWI. For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled \\"Finished with the War: A Soldier s Declaration\\", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind coming to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.

This New York Times bestseller has been translated into more than thirty languages, has sold nearly a million copies between editions, and has most recently inspired a romantic comedy starring Whitney Cummings and Sofia Vergara. And its profound scientific understanding of the nature and experience of the female brain continues to guide women as they pass through life stages, to help men better understand the girls and women in their lives, and to illuminate the delicate emotional machinery of a love relationship. Why are women more verbal than men? Why do women remember details of fights that men can t remember at all? Why do women tend to form deeper bonds with their female friends than men do with their male counterparts? These and other questions have stumped both sexes throughout the ages. Now, pioneering neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine, M.D., brings together the latest findings to show how the unique structure of the female brain determines how women think, what they value, how they communicate, and who they love. While doing research as a medical student at Yale and then as a resident and faculty member at Harvard, Louann Brizendine discovered that almost all of the clinical data in existence on neurology, psychology, and neurobiology focused exclusively on males. In response to the overwhelming need for information on the female mind, Brizendine established the first clinic in the country to study and treat women s brain function. In The Female Brain, Dr. Brizendine distills all her findings and the latest information from the scientific community in a highly accessible book that educates women about their unique brain/body/behavior. The result: women will come away from this book knowing that they have a lean, mean, communicating machine. Men will develop a serious case of brain envy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dGfQ2TMB1lIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afternoons in Mid America: Observations and Impressions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uWwTAAAAYAAJ&dq=Afternoons+in+Mid+America:+Observations+and+Impressions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War and Rememberance","description":"These two classic works capture the tide of world events even as they unfold the compelling tale of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom.

A great work of fiction.\\"  Per Svensson, Dagens Nyheter In February 1940, the Nazis established what would become the second-largest Jewish ghetto, in the Polish city of L dz. The leader they appointed was Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, a sixty-three-year-old Jewish businessman and orphanage director and the elusive, authoritarian power sustaining the ghetto's very existence. A haunting, profoundly challenging novel, The Emperor of Lies chronicles the tale of Rumkowski's monarchical rule over a quarter-million Jews for the next four and a half years. Driven by a titanic ambition, he sought to transform the ghetto into a productive industrial complex and strove to make it and himself indispensable to the Nazi regime. These compromises would have extraordinary consequences not only for Rumkowski but for everyone living in the ghetto. Drawing on the detailed records of life in L dz, Steve Sem-Sandberg, in a masterful feat of literary imagination and empathy, captures the full panorama of human resilience and probes deeply into the nature of evil. Through the dramatic narrative, he asks the most difficult questions: Was Rumkowski a ruthless opportunist, an accessory to the Nazi regime motivated by a lust for power? Or was he a pragmatist who managed to save Jewish lives through his collaboration policies? How did the inhabitants of the ghetto survive in such extreme circumstances? A critically acclaimed breakout bestseller in Sweden, The Emperor of Lies introduces a writer of great significance to American readers. The archives detail daily life in the Lodz ghetto, under the reign of Rumkowki, but it takes a writer with Sem-Sandberg's singular talent to help us understand the truth of this chilling history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Db2odFmVOqAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historic shrines of Spain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oy2BQQAACAAJ&dq=Historic+shrines+of+Spain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Moral Liberalism","description":"In this important book, Jeffrey Reiman responds to recent assaults on liberal theory by proposing a \\"critical moral liberalism.\\" It is liberal in maintaining the emphasis of classical liberalism on individual freedom, moral in adhering to a distinctive vision of the good life rather than professing neutrality, and critical in taking seriously the objection-raised by feminists and Marxists, among others-that liberal theories often serve as ideological cover for oppression of one group by others. Critical moral liberalism has a conception of ideology, and resources for testing the suspicion that arrangements that look free are really oppressive. Reiman sets forth the basic arguments for the liberal moral obligation to maximize people's ability to govern their own lives, and for the conception of the good life that goes with this. He considers and answers objections to the liberal project, and defends liberal conceptions of privacy, moral virtue, economic justice, and Constitutional interpretation. Reiman then takes up specific policy issues, among them abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, moral education, capital punishment, and threats to privacy from modern information technology.

Magic Time should be required reading for three types of people. One, those starting in show business, two, those that have been in show business for a long time, and three, everyone else. Like every movie Hawk has made, Magic Time is a fascinating journey of self-identity. I love this book.   Mike Myers, Actor, Writer, and Director  Magic Time recounts what I remember about Hawk: someone who never took an opportunity for granted and worked hard to achieve success in his own right. Plus, he was a lot of the fun, and, as the book reflects, we had some memorable adventures.  Robert Redford, Oscar-winning Actor & Director, Founder of the Sundance Institute & Film Festival  Hawk Koch is without a doubt one of the great Hollywood storytellers I ve ever known. His adventures in the movie business are so funny and so incredible that I re-tell stories from his career more than ones from my own. And his own personal journey is as heartfelt as it gets.   Edward Norton, Actor, Writer, and Director  I can personally relate to this moving journey of a man learning to step out from under a father s shadow. But Magic Time is also filled with fun, surprising stories that only a deep insider could tell.  Jane Fonda, Oscar-winning Actress, Bestselling Author  I found the book profoundly moving, and insightful about not only the entertainment industry, but human nature. Bravo and congratulations!  Gale Anne Hurd, Producer, Terminator and The Walking Dead  This book is more than just a great Hollywood memoir. Hawk Koch shares his story with us in a funny, touching, and vulnerable way in contrast to the glitz and glamor of the show business life he leads. If you want to hear a story about what Hollywood is really like read this book. It s a winner.

How should we love? What constitutes a good society? Is there a soul that outlasts the body and a truth that transcends appearance? What do we know and how do we know it? Plato's inquiries were all the more resonant because he couched them in the form of dramatic and often highly comic dialogues, whose principal personage was the ironic, teasing, and relentlessly searching philosopher Socrates. In this splendid collection, Scott Buchanan brings together the most important of Plato's dialogues, including Protagoras, The Symposium, with its barbed conjectures about the relation between love and madness, Phaedo and The Republic, his monumental work of political philosophy. Buchanan's learned and engaging introduction allows us to see Plato both as a commentator on his society and as a shaper of the societies that followed, who bequeathed to us a hunger for the ideal as well as a redeeming habit of humane skepticism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qCaWfmEhbJkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Alcalde de Zalamea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PxcdnQEACAAJ&dq=El+Alcalde+de+Zalamea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mommy Made and Daddy Too: Home Cooking for a Healthy Baby & Toddler","description":"Everyone loves a home-cooked meal--even babies and toddlers!

Several different projects during five years guided me from the basics of the RF IC design to the implementations of highly integrated radio receiver chips. Sharing time and effort between IC and system issues is not always straightforward. I have been lucky to follow both topics and share experiences with diligent and enthusiastic people having different specialities. As a result, this book will cover a wide range of different topics needed in the design of highly integrated radio receivers. Experiences from the first receiver prototypes for the third generation cellular systems form the basis of this book. Most of the issues are directly related to the early proposals of European and Japanese standardization organizations. For example, the chip rate was originally set to 4. 096 Mcps in a wide-band CDMA channel. I have kept that number in the book in most of the examples although it has been later changed to 3. 84 Mcps. I hope that the readers will accept that and the possible other incompabilities to the latest specifications. At least in the research phase the changes even in the most essential requirements are definitely not a rare incident and IC designers should be able to react and modify their designs as soon as they can.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N-XjBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Repentance and Confession in the Orthodox Church","description":"In a significant essay, the author provides penetrating insights for the renewal of the Sacrament of Confession in the Orthodox Church.

Using a structure of 12 stations, which can be visited and revisited in any order as often as needed, he guides readers through six fundamental and six emergent modules of this process for healing the \\"spiritual-sexual split\\" and the \\"cultural pain... of oppressed minorities,\\" and ultimately achieving the \\"shame-free presentation of self.\\" Picucci says he offers \\"nothing less than a re-birthing process\\" through a combination of one-on-one psychotherapy, support groups and spirituality. His own life experiences as a gay man, once married, now HIV positive, surviving AIDS, cancer, a heart attack, triple-bypass surgery and drug and alcohol addictions give him a uniquely credible perspective on healing and wholeness. In his cogent, well-organized handbook, Picucci functions a bit like the gay shamans who had a special place in North American Indian tribes. His compassionate acceptance of diversity will inspire many readers to care to take the next step and seek the help they need.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2qpeYHxpmQIC&dq=Journey+Toward+Complete+Recovery+:+Reclaiming+Your+Emotional,+Spiritual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Watermarking: Principles & Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Multimedia Information and Systems)","description":"Digital watermarking is a key ingredient to copyright protection.

But like our chimpanzee cousins, we, the naked apes, have evolved to flourish in our surroundings--a cultural environment largely of our own creation. For the human race, the critical evolution of the past million years has been the evolution of our minds. Yet psychology, the very science that purports to understand us, has long been deeply ambivalent about Darwin's unsettling discoveries. In an accessible, level-headed overview, Henry Plotkin describes the new rapprochement called 'evolutionary psychology.' He examines how such a powerful theory as Darwinism could have been disregarded by much academic psychology and shows why the relationship between the two must be readdressed. The theory and data of evolutionary biology and animal behavior can illuminate many of our most basic mental processes and activities: language learning, perception, social understanding, and most controversially, culture and the sharing of knowledge and beliefs. Ranging from the nature-nurture question, which has bedeviled philosophers and scientists for thousands of years, to recent debates about the mind's structure, Evolution in Mind vividly demonstrates how an evolutionary perspective helps us understand what we are, and how we got that way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nJN9AAAAMAAJ&dq=Evolution+in+Mind:+An+Introduction+to+Evolutionary+Psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California in the Year 2000: A Look into the Future of the Golden State As It Approaches the Millennium","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lyoMAAAACAAJ&dq=California+in+the+Year+2000:+A+Look+into+the+Future+of+the+Golden+State+As+It+Approaches+the+Millennium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moss Haggadah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yW5OAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Moss+Haggadah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rare and unusual fly tying materials: A natural history treating both standard and rare materials, their sources and geography, as used in classic, contemporary, and artistic trout and salmon flies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uwBbkgAACAAJ&dq=Rare+and+unusual+fly+tying+materials:+A+natural+history+treating+both+standard+and+rare+materials,+their+sources+and+geography,+as+used+in+classic,+contemporary,+and+artistic+trout+and+salmon+flies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Only Desire (Harlequin Intrigue, # 627)","description":"His Only Desire by Adrianne Lee released on Jul 25, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Zg37xyGawkC&dq=His+Only+Desire+(Harlequin+Intrigue,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pointers from Nisargadatta Maharaj","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iw3MAAAACAAJ&dq=Pointers+from+Nisargadatta+Maharaj&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FULL MOON DREAMS-20% LARGER PRINT","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jWKGkgTMhbMC&dq=FULL+MOON+DREAMS-20%25+LARGER+PRINT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moorstone Sickness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Math Chat Book (Spectrum)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HMH2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice: William Shakespeare (New Casebooks)","description":"This collection of essays is aimed at students who are working on The Merchant of Venice and who are looking for new ways of thinking about the play and new ways of thinking about their own practice as critics.

For a century that fabled place, lying somewhere beyond the Rocky Mountains at the farthest reaches of the continent galvanized the American people. Its riches, in furs, timber, fish, and fecund soil for farming, awakened the avarice of nations. Spain, Great Britain, Russia, and the United States all vied for this trackless Eden of the pacific littoral, and not until the 1840s did the Americans claim it once and for all. In these pages are the explorations of the fierce Scots who scaled the mountains and mapped the rivers of the Oregon country before the time of Lewis and Clark; the imperial fiefdom created for profit and Britannia by the fur-trading ventures of the Hudson's Bay Company; John Jacob Astor's ill-fated experiment on the Columbia River; the mountain men who risked their lives in Indian country in pursuit of beaver furs; and the arrival of the missionaries and pioneers of the Oregon Trail. Pacific Destiny is the Spur Award-winning story for best historical non-fiction, told by a distinguished chronicler of nineteenth century America. A story of the clashing of empires, coveting the matchless wealth of the Pacific Northwest-the story of The Oregon Country.

Combining his extensive ethnographic experience in Iran and his broad command of critical theory, Michael M. J. Fischer argues that the widespread appeal of Iranian cinema is based in a poetics that speaks not only to Iran s domestic cultural politics but also to the more general ethical dilemmas of a world simultaneously torn apart and pushed together. Approaching film as a tool for anthropological analysis, he illuminates how Iranian filmmakers have incorporated and remade the rich traditions of oral, literary, and visual media in Persian culture. Fischer reveals how the distinctive expressive idiom emerging in contemporary Iranian film reworks Persian imagery that has itself been in dialogue with other cultures since the time of Zoroaster and ancient Greece. He examines a range of narrative influences on this expressive idiom and imagery, including Zoroastrian ritual as it is practiced in Iran, North America, and India; the mythic stories, moral lessons, and historical figures written about in Iran s national epic, the Shahnameh; the dreamlike allegorical world of Persian surrealism exemplified in Sadeq Hedayat s 1939 novella The Blind Owl; and the politically charged films of the 1960s and 1970s. Fischer contends that by combining Persian traditions with cosmopolitan influences, contemporary Iranian filmmakers many of whom studied in Europe and America provide audiences around the world with new modes of accessing ethical and political experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KibBH6cI8BgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"According to the Scriptures;: The sub-structure of New Testament theology (Stone lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=djGsDAEACAAJ&dq=According+to+the+Scriptures%3B:+The+sub-structure+of+New+Testament+theology+(Stone+lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East of the Cascades,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Billy Whiskers' Kids","description":"Recounts the adventurous voyage of Night and Day, the kids of Nanny and Billy Whiskers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PtspAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Beard Cooks with Corning: Selected Recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=epinHAAACAAJ&dq=James+Beard+Cooks+with+Corning:+Selected+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wiring Simplified: Based on the 2002 National Electrical Code","description":"Translates NEC rules into easy-to-understand explanations of how to do complete, safe wiring installations in homes and on farms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eHCepgIVxqwC&dq=Wiring+Simplified:+Based+on+the+2002+National+Electrical+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crystal Boys: A Novel","description":"\\"Crystal Boys is the first Chinese novel on gay themes.

Successful child rearing is an essential skill for any parent. For most of us this skill is handed down from our own parents and society in general. In real terms this means that rather than relying on any formal instruction to help us, we bring up our children using skills based largely upon common sense and a willingness to do our best. These methods are, by-and-large, successful in everyday situations. However, when it comes to more difficult aspects of developing skills in our children, we need something more dependable than good will. Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), the systematic implementation of scientifically proven behavioural principles offers just that. Aimed at enhancing people's lives in ways that they or their carers feel are important, it includes a variety of methods and techniques which can be used to promote, decrease, or maintain skills for daily living. ABA has been used to help children with autism for many years in many countries. In Northern Ireland the PEAT group offers parents the education necessary to become their own child's therapists using ABA. In this book these parents and the professionals involved in their training share their knowledge, experience, and successes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ur_M0xQI2zwC&dq=Parents%27+Education+as+Autism+Therapists:+Applied+Behaviour+Analysis+in+Context&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Springs of Nevada","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K9b_NwAACAAJ&dq=Hot+Springs+of+Nevada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pasta Light: Over 200 Great Taste, Low Fat Pasta Recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HxGCAAAACAAJ&dq=Pasta+Light:+Over+200+Great+Taste,+Low+Fat+Pasta+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Are My Children, Too: A Mother's Struggle for Her Sons","description":"The author recounts her unsuccessful attempts to get her German ex-husband to return her two sons whom he has kept in Germany in violation of their custody agreement","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rHYsAQAAMAAJ&dq=They+Are+My+Children,+Too:+A+Mother%27s+Struggle+for+Her+Sons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indo-European Languages (Routledge Language Family Series)","description":"The Indo-European Languages presents a comprehensive survey of the individual languages and language subgroups within this language family.

Gellman s exhaustively researched work is the definitive account of Richard Nixon s rise from political unknown to the verge of achieving the vice-presidency. To document Nixon s congressional career, Gellman combed the files of Nixon s 1946, 1948, and 1950 campaigns, papers from the executive sessions of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and every document dated through 1952 at the Richard Nixon Library. This singular volume corrects many earlier written accounts. For example, there was no secret funding of Nixon s senate campaign in 1950, and Nixon won universal praise for his evenhandedness as a member of HUAC. The first book of a projected five-volume examination of this complex man s entire career, this work stands as the definitive political portrait of Nixon as a fast-rising young political star.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zba_DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Kitchen Cabinetmaker: Shop Drawings and Professional Methods for Designing and Constructing Every Kind of Kitchen and Built-In Cabinet","description":"Provides instructions for designing and making custom cabinets, including how to develop working shop drawings, how to build traditional face-frame cabinets and Euro-style cabinets, and how to cut and join the basic box for any project.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qzw_nQEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Kitchen+Cabinetmaker:+Shop+Drawings+and+Professional+Methods+for+Designing+and+Constructing+Every+Kind+of+Kitchen+and+Built-In+Cabinet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Commission Companies: The Emerging Role of Business in Missions","description":"In this landmark book, economist Steve Rundle and missiologist Tom Steffen offer their paradigm for the convergence of business and missions--the Great Commission Company.

When Brautigan took his own life in September of 1984 his close friends and network of artists and writers were devastated though not entirely surprised. To many, Brautigan was shrouded in enigma, erratic and unpredictable in his habits and presentation. But his career was formidable, an inspiration to young writers like Hjortsberg trying to get their start. Brautigan's career wove its way through both the Beatinfluenced San Francisco Renaissance in the 1950s and the \\"Flower Power\\" hippie movement of the 1960s; while he never claimed direct artistic involvement with either period, Jubilee Hitchhiker also delves deeply into the spirited times in which he lived. As Hjortsberg guides us through his search to uncover Brautigan as a man the reader is pulled deeply into the writer's world. Ultimately this is a work that seeks to connect the Brautigan known to his fans with the man who ended his life so abruptly in 1984 while revealing the close ties between his writing and the actual events of his life. Part history, part biography, and part memoir this etches the portrait of a man destroyed by his genius.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-NwREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The pentateuch","description":"In this volume, Terence E.

But do we ever include preachers in that category? Preachers have opportunities to be some of the greatest risk takers. In Preacher as Risk Taker, Richard Hart, O.F.M. Cap., challenges preachers to be on the cutting edge by taking risks resulting in better preaching. How many preachers are willing to submit their homilies to an editor or have their homilies taped? Are poetic preachers ready to preach in a changing Church? How often do preachers discuss social sin, the environment, ageing, the reign of God, or Paul's epistles? Do today's preachers realize how important it is to preach through healing or Jesus as a wisdom figure? Finally, do preachers know the true difference between a eulogy and a homily? Hart offers insight to each of these questions for preachers interested in improving their homilies. Preachers might not be asked to scale a mountain or act as a magician. But preachers are asked to take similar risks when preaching on challenging topics. In Preacher as Risk Taker, Father Hart provides answers for those interested in becoming spirited preachers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZfwSaAzYON0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cognitive Connection: Thought and Language in Man and Machine","description":"Discusses the differences between natural language and programming languages, looks at mathematical logic, and describes the future of computer programming","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0pxQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cognitive+Connection:+Thought+and+Language+in+Man+and+Machine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paths of Soaring Flight","description":"This book is concerned with the sport of soaring, mainly with the mathematical basis of sailplane design and operation.

The New York Times Book Review \\"Fantastic  a book that feels alive on the page.\\" The Washington Post From the New York-Times bestselling author of The Vanishing Half, the beloved novel about young love and a big secret in a small community. Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \\"All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\\" It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance and the subsequent cover-up will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt. In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \\"what if\\" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1PE0DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+mother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forest Trees of Illinois","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Nubian Guard Pocket Address Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zJHaBAAACAAJ&dq=The+Nubian+Guard+Pocket+Address+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freedom: A History of US","description":"A History of US is the story of the history of the United States written especially for all ages to enjoy.

McManus showed us the American experience in Operation Overlord. Now, in this succeeding volume, he does the same for the Battle of Normandy as a whole. Never before has the American involvement in Normandy been examined so thoroughly or exclusively as in The Americans at Normandy. For D-Day was only one part of the battle, and victory came from weeks of sustained effort and sacrifices made by Allied soldiers. Presented here is the American experience during that summer of 1944, from the aftermath of D-Day to the slaughter of the Falaise Gap, from the courageous, famed figures of Bradley, Patton, and Lightnin' Joe Collins to the lesser-known privates who toiled in torturous conditions for their country. What was this battle really like for these men? What drove them to fight against all sense and despite all obstacles? How and why did they triumph? Reminiscent of Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day, The Americans at Normandy takes readers into the minds of the best American strategists, into the hearts of the infantry, into hell on earth. Engrossing, lightning-quick, and filled with real human sorrow and elation, The Americans at Normandy honors those Americans who lost their lives in foreign fields and those who survived. Here is their story, finally told with the depth, pathos, and historical perspective it deserves.

Brought together for the first time, these essays were originally published in specialized periodicals in the United States and abroad. Explaining and systematizing the elements of creative innovation in industrial history, Mr. Gerschenkron opens new paths of research and poses a number of pertinent questions for the modern problem of economic development in backward countries.

A. F. O. ABOUT THE AUTHOR . . . by Samuel Hopkins Adams Hamilton College graduates have the habit of keeping an attentive eye upon their fellow alumni. Thus, although he graduated eighteen years after me, I knew of Alex Osborn long before he had any inkling of my interest. There was another Alex in that able class of 1909, Alex antler Woollcott, whom I had sponsored into a newspaper job upon his graduation. Only a few years thereafter he was a notable in the newspaper and theatre worlds. About the time of his early success, we met at the home of Laurette Taylor, where one met everybody. Aleck buttonholed me What do you know about my classmate Alex Osborn Nothing I answered. Weil, youd better. Why What am I supposed to do about this Osborn Nothing, Nobody has to do anything about him. Hell do it, himself AH right I said. Tm open to conviction. What is he doing Aleck was a bit vague about that. His friend and class mate had been teacher, reporter, had taken a shot at maga zine writing, had touched upon banking and a few other lines, and was something in factory management. It isnt what hes doing its what he fe Woollcott insisted. When the subject next came up between us, Alex Osborn was well on his way to becoming head of the great advertis ing firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osbom, and I had come to know and admire him personally as one of the most versatile, vigorous, and provocative minds among my wide range of acquaintances, His classmate recalled tome our conversation of years before. What clo you think of Osbom now he demanded with rather the air of having patented, or, at least, invented him. You were right 1 admitted, I am always right, said Aleck Woollcott blandly ix ABOUT THE BOOK . . . hy Alex Osborn Ten years ago, the editor of a leading magazine invited me to lunch. I had been one of his contributors, but we had never met. lie broke the ice by asking, What is your hobby, Mr. Osbom Imagination, I replied. He paused, then wrote on the back of an envelope, u Mv HOBBY Is IMAGINATION. Mr. Osborn, he said, you must do a book on that. Its a job that has been waiting to be done all these years. There is no subject of greater importance. You must give it the time and energy and thoroughness it deserves. That remark started this book. Although I earned my masters degree in practical psy chology and have devotee most of my life to the psychology of advertising, I cannot claim to be a psychologist. Nor have I tried to write as a psychologist, I have felt free to take figurative liberties with academic concepts. For instance, I realize that imagination is an integral part of mans mind fxxly function and yet, for the sake of clarity and read ability, I refer to imagination as if it were an entity of itself. My frequent use of the term brainstorm may bother the reader at first. Although Chapter 33 will fully explain, an inkling of its meaning may be helpful here Brainstorm is used mainly to label the kind of conference where a few people sit clown together for an hour or so solely to use their creative imaginations solely to suggest ideas on a specific . subject right then and there.

We decided to inaugurate the Midnight Marquee Actors Series with horror film icon Bela Lugosi. The first reason was the fact that Lugosi is one of our favorite legends of the Golden Age of Horror Films. And the second reason is that the 1990s appeared to be the decade of his rebirth and rediscovery. With the release of pristine copies of Universal horror classics in attractively packaged, low-priced DVDs, the continued interest in cult writer/director Edward D. Wood, Jr. and the artistic triumph of Tim Burton s Ed Wood, which features Bela Lugosi (distorted history noted), a new generation of film fan was being introduced to the legendary bogeyman. As our writers attest, Lugosi was a very gifted actor, who appeared in only a handful of well-produced, quality vehicles, but whose reputation has mushroomed far beyond the movies in which he sometimes had to appear. But even the worst Lugosi film is better than most of the dreck passing for horror films today. What better star with which to start our Midnight Marquee Actors Series? And what better star to deserve a new revised and updated edition?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4tWcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day I Saw My Father Cry (Little Bill Books for Beginning Readers)","description":"When Little Bill experiences the loss of a friend, his father is there to comfort his son through his sadness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WJRTPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Day+I+Saw+My+Father+Cry+(Little+Bill+Books+for+Beginning+Readers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family Feud / Stop the Wedding!

Eighty years later he remains one of the most widely read American authors in the world. The first major critical study of London to appear in a decade,Male Call analyzes the nature of his appeal by closely examining how the struggling young writer sought to promote himself in his early work as a sympathetic, romantic man of letters whose charismatic masculinity could carry more significance than his words themselves. Jonathan Auerbach shows that London's personal identity was not a basis of his literary success, but rather a consequence of it. Unlike previous studies of London that are driven by the author's biography,Male Call examines how London carefully invented a trademark  self  in order to gain access to a rapidly expanding popular magazine and book market that craved authenticity, celebrity, power, and personality. Auerbach demonstrates that only one fact of London's life truly shaped his art: his passionate desire to become a successful author. Whether imagining himself in stories and novels as a white man on trail in the Yukon, a sled dog, a tramp, or a professor; or engaging questions of manhood and mastery in terms of work, race, politics, class, or sexuality, London created a public persona for the purpose of exploiting the conventions of the publishing world and marketplace. Revising critical commonplaces about both Jack London's work and the meaning of  nature  within literary naturalism and turn-of-the-century ideologies of masculinity, Auerbach's analysis intriguingly complicates our view of London and sheds light on our own postmodern preoccupation with celebrity. Male Call will attract readers with an interest in American studies, American literature, gender studies, and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dBocOvLI4P0C&dq=Male+call&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wreckage Begins with \\"W\\": Cartoons of the Bush Administration","description":"JEFF DANZIGER IS an independent political cartoonist whose work appears in hundreds of newspapers around the world via the New York Times Syndicate.

When they came upon the homestead of Robinson Jones, a white man who ran a post office and general store and offered lodging for travelers, the Indians opened fire on the settlers, killing almost all of them. Soon bands of Sioux were rampaging across southwestern Minnesota, attacking farms and trading posts and murdering everywhere they went-splitting the skulls of men; clubbing children to death; raping daughters and wives before disemboweling them; cutting off hands, breasts, and genitals; and looting whatever could be taken before setting fire to what remained. Perhaps as many as two thousand settlers were brutally massacred, although the number has never been firmly established. Once the uprising was suppressed, 303 Sioux warriors were sentenced to death. The people of Minnesota called for their immediate execution, a sentiment that matched the national mood. Abraham Lincoln suspected that most of those convicted were marginal players in the rebellion and that the worst culprits had escaped, and he carefully reviewed each case before selecting the 39-later reduced to 38-men to hang whom he believed to be guilty of the worst crimes. The remainder were committed to life in prison. \\"I could not hang men for votes,\\" he later explained. On December 26 the 38 were simultaneously hanged on a gallows construction especially for them. The Sioux Uprising of 1862, also known as the Dakota War, sounded the first shots of a war that continued for another 28 years, culminating in the massacre of Indian women and children at Wounded Knee in 1890. Lincoln's death at the hands of John Wilkes Booth ended his intention to reform the government's Indian policy, and both political parties continued to use the system to reward their supporters, a practice that largely continues to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gAUUbzGzg-EC&dq=Lincoln+And+The+Sioux+Uprising+Of+1862&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace Was Their Profession: Strategic Air Command: A Tribute","description":"This new large format volume is a grand tribute to all of those who served in SAC from its inception in 1947 to its disestablishment in 1992.

Critical moral liberalism has a conception of ideology, and resources for testing the suspicion that arrangements that look free are really oppressive. Reiman sets forth the basic arguments for the liberal moral obligation to maximize people's ability to govern their own lives, and for the conception of the good life that goes with this. He considers and answers objections to the liberal project, and defends liberal conceptions of privacy, moral virtue, economic justice, and Constitutional interpretation. Reiman then takes up specific policy issues, among them abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, moral education, capital punishment, and threats to privacy from modern information technology. Critical Moral Liberalism will be of interest to scholars and students of ethics, social and political philosophy, political theory, and public policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=83G4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Critical+Moral+Liberalism:+Theory+and+Practice+(Studies+in+Social,+Political,+and+Legal+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rejoice, Beloved Woman!: The Psalms Revisioned","description":"A woman's version of the one hundred and fifty beloved sacred songs, reveals a feminine image of God that embodies the strong yet nurturing feminine persona.

This reimagination of Asian young men has focused on violence, drug abuse and crime, set against a backdrop of cultural conflict, generational confusion and religious fundamentalism. The Asian gang, it seems, is the inevitable product of these social forces. But what is the reality? Based on three years fieldwork with a group of Bangladeshi young men in inner-city London, this book attempts to explore the complex mythologies and realities of contemporary Asian youth experience.

Alistair Begg, senior pastor, Parkside Church In Unlocking the Bible Story, Colin Smith moves gradually through portions of the Bible to explain how it all holds together. He tells God's one grand story of salvation and reflects on major themes along the way. In volume 2 he moves through the Wisdom and Prophetic books, which provide reflections on life with God, judgment for sin, and the hope of restoration.

To grasp how the sacred history moves from Genesis to Revelation not only brings fresh insight into how the Bible hangs together, and what each part contributes to the whole, but also is crucial for developing a Christian worldview. Colin Smith has met these needs admirably. I hope these volumes will circulate widely and be read and re-read.   D. A.

Father Ruiz-Sanchez is a dedicated man, a Jesuit priest who is also a scientist, and a scientist who is also a human being. He doesn t feel any genuine conflicts in his belief system until he is sent to Lithia. The reptilian inhabitants of this distant world appear to be admirable in every way. Untroubled by greed or lust, they live in peace. But they have no concept of God, no literature, and no art. They rely purely on cold reason. But something darker lies beneath the surface: Do the Lithians pose a hidden threat? The answers that unfold could affect the fate of two worlds. Will Ruiz-Sanchez, a priest driven by his deeply human understanding of good and evil, do the right thing when confronted by a race that is alien to its core? The Science Fiction Encyclopedia lauds A Case of Conscience as  one of the first serious attempts to deal with religion [in science fiction], and [it] remains one of the most sophisticated. It is generally regarded as an SF classic.  Readers of Isaac Asimov s Foundation Trilogy, Mary Doria Russell s The Sparrow, or Walter M.

Except in this tell-all, cheeky guide to the world's naughtiest resort, Hedonism II. Everyone returns from Hedonism II with at least one good story no one at home believes. Is Hedonism II a retirement home for worn-out swingers? Is it a testosterone tour-de-force with too few eligible single women to clamor over? Is it a cult that sucks away all your vacation time? Well, the last one might be true. Learn why Hedonism II has a 90% repeat guest rate--even though the facilities are tired, the food is mediocre, and the beach sand hurts your feet--if you are still standing after a week. The Hedo myths: Only young singles go to Hedonism II. People walk around naked everywhere. Open sex is rampant. Someone will try to steal your wife. Every myth has its truth...but Hedonism II is 50% couples--and most guests are over 30, full nudity is only allowed on one beach, the hotel does not condone public sex (but it happens), and your wife--well, that's her choice. But at Hedo you will see what you've never seen before. And you might do it too. Here are the truths and tips that will make your vacation to Hedonism II the most fun trip you'll ever take--again and again.

The second section examines aspects of ordinary life and explores how Christians related them to religious ideas (the family, hospitality, citizenship, monasticism, and attitudes toward the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West). & This very learned piece of work, which reflects lengthy study of original texts as well as of the current and important secondary literature, is distinctive because it does not conform to the present reigning ideology: The author writes as a convinced Christian thinker. He believes that there is no such thing as a purely detached observer and that the best way of being critical and fair is to make no secret of one& s presuppositions, but to face them so as to be able to discount them when necessary.

As new translations of Federico Garc a Lorca continue to appear in the English-speaking world and his literary reputation continues to be rewritten through these successive re-translations, this book explores the reasons for this constant desire to rewrite Lorca since the time of his murder right into the 21st century. From his representation as the quintessential Spanish Republican martyr, to his adoption through translation by the Beat Generation, to his elevation to iconic status within the Queer Studies movement, this volume analyzes the reasons for this evolution and examines the current direction into which this canonical author is heading in the English-speaking world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ALpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Career Colleges 2005 (Peterson's Guide to Career Colleges)","description":"Provides information on getting post-secondary education in specialized schools, and presents profiles of institutions with programs in business, allied health, technology, and other fields from acupuncture to woodworking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o67CwAEACAAJ&dq=Guide+to+Career+Colleges+2005+(Peterson%27s+Guide+to+Career+Colleges)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poet and Audience in the Argonautica of Apollonius","description":"In this innovative study of the Argonautica, Robert Albis examines structural elements of the text that recreate phenomena associated with composers and performers of epic much earlier in the Greek tradition. Such phenomena include the effect of divine inspiration on the performer, and the empathy thus created among the audience, performer, and characters of the poetry. Albis focuses on the invocations of the Argonautica, arguing that these passages reveal the poet's attempts to associate himself and the audience with the activity within the poem. Albis' approach to the Argonautica is important because it makes use of theoretical approaches to poetry while still concentrating on the place of the poet and epic poetry in contemporary Greek culture, and on the tradition the poet had inherited. This fascinating study, which includes analyses of the Homeric influence on Apollonius and Apollonius' influence on Virgil, will be of interest to scholars of ancient epic, Greek poetry, and Hellenistic Greek culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ntIs219GZFQC&dq=Poet+and+Audience+in+the+Argonautica+of+Apollonius&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Socrates","description":"After the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a number of his followers wrote dialogues featuring him as the protagonist and, in so doing, transformed the great philosopher into a legendary figure. Xenophon's portrait is the only one other than Plato's to survive, and while it offers a very personal interpretation of Socratic thought, it also reveals much about the man and his philosophical views. In 'Socrates' Defence' Xenophon defends his mentor against charges of arrogance made at his trial, while the 'Memoirs of Socrates' also starts with an impassioned plea for the rehabilitation of a wronged reputation. Along with 'The Estate-Manager', a practical economic treatise, and 'The Dinner-Party', a sparkling exploration of love, Xenophon's dialogues offer fascinating insights into the Socratic world and into the intellectual atmosphere and daily life of ancient Greece.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qwp-kOetNUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Personal Narrative of a Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent: Abridged Edition (Penguin Classics)","description":"\\"Alexander von Humboldt visited the tropics of the New World between 1799 and 1804.

Benefits of teaching sign language to hearing infants.(Parenting): An article from: Special Delivery","description":"Children are already learning at birth, and they develop and learn at a rapid pace in their early years. This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mules and men,","description":"Hurston recounts her experiences collecting Afro-American folklore and offers some seventy folk tales and a series of hoodoo rituals","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AjKnPwAACAAJ&dq=Mules+and+men,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herbs for Hepatitis C and the Liver (A Storey Medicinal Herb Guide)","description":"Providing practical guidance and hope, Stephen Harrod Buhner offers a thorough examination of the most effective herbal remedies for hepatitis C.

Hunt. He quickly plunges into action as he chases a mystery ship during a tropical storm off Cuba, deals with a seductively dangerous woman during a mission in enemy territory ashore, confronts death to liberate an escaping slave ship, and comes face to face with the enemy's most powerful warship in Havana's harbor. Wake is no longer alone in this dangerous world. His wife Linda, hiding in a pro-Union camp on Useppa Island, gives him a future to look forward to as the war nears its end. But then in January 1866, as most Union soldiers are preparing to go home, a powerful ocean raider shows up in a remote corner of the Caribbean, and Wake finds that for some the war is not over yet.

As she begins to make sense of Latin grammar and syntax, her studies open unexpected windows into her own life. The louche poetry of Catullus calls up her early days in 1970s New York, Lucretius elucidates her intractable drivenness and her attraction to Buddhism, while Ovid s verse conjures a delightful dimension to the flora and fauna that surround her. Women in Roman history, and an ancient tomb inscription give her new understanding and empathy for her tragic, long deceased mother. Finally, Virgil reconciles her to her new life no longer an urban exile, but a rustic scholar, writer and teacher. Along the way, she meets an impassioned cast of characters: professors, students and classicists outside of academia who keep Latin very much alive. Written with humor, heart, and an infectious enthusiasm for words, Patty s book is an object lesson in how learning and literature can transform the past and lead to an unexpected future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IFDNDgAAQBAJ&dq=Using+Latin,+(Language,+literature,+and+life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Different Approach to Cosmology: From a Static Universe through the Big Bang towards Reality","description":"Highly controversial book in which three distinguished cosmologists argue that the model which most cosmology research uses is incorrect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lxzxg6iHc1MC&dq=A+Different+Approach+to+Cosmology:+From+a+Static+Universe+through+the+Big+Bang+towards+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GTO Red Book: Pontiac GTO, 1964-1974 (Motorbooks International Red Book Series)","description":"GTO Red Book Peter Sessler Get all the important data and specs on the GTO in this vital fact book for owners and restorers.

The wares made were very varied, as a glance through the book will reveal. They are also appealing often with a primitive quality, the generous use of a rich but limited range of oxide colours producing pieces which, like Oriental rugs, seem at home in most surroundings.

Mahmoud Darwish vividly recreates the sights and sounds of a city under terrible siege. As fighter jets scream overhead, he explores the war-ravaged streets of Beirut on August 6th (Hiroshima Day). Memory for Forgetfulness is an extended reflection on the invasion and its political and historical dimensions. It is also a journey into personal and collective memory. What is the meaning of exile? What is the role of the writer in time of war? What is the relationship of writing (memory) to history (forgetfulness)? In raising these questions, Darwish implicitly connects writing, homeland, meaning, and resistance in an ironic, condensed work that combines wit with rage. Ibrahim Muhawi's translation beautifully renders Darwish's testament to the heroism of a people under siege, and to Palestinian creativity and continuity. Sinan Antoon s foreword, written expressly for this edition, sets Darwish s work in the context of changes in the Middle East in the past thirty years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gakwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Memory+for+Forgetfulness:+August,+Beirut,+1982+(Literature+of+the+Middle+East)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lenotre's Desserts and Pastries: 201 Prized Recipes from France's Distinguished Pastry Chef","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bj9SAQAAMAAJ&dq=Lenotre%27s+Desserts+and+Pastries:+201+Prized+Recipes+from+France%27s+Distinguished+Pastry+Chef&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nathalie Dupree's Southern Memories: Recipes and Reminiscences","description":"Offering an intimate, anecdotal, and informative look at Southern food, traditions, and lifestyles, a popular television chef presents an illustrated culinary tour of the South, with more than 150 delicious southern recipes.

It was originally rejected on grounds of indecency so the story goes  by twenty publishers, whereupon Joyce threw the manuscript in the fire, but Mrs. Joyce rescued several unburnt portions. Although Joyce later entirely rewrote his novel of a young Irishman's rebellion against church, country and family, this early version is beautifully composed, the mood being more discursive and personal than in A Portrait. Many episodes later cut for the sake of good novelistic form, especially autobiographical episodes of sensual and family life, are fully presented, with some of the most vivacious dialogue Joyce ever wrote. Between them, the two versions give us a clear example of Joyce's literary development as well as many details of his life. This edition of Stephen Hero for the first time printed the five missing pages of the novel found among the papers in the Joyce Collection of the Cornell University Library. These pages fill gaps in the text as edited in 1956 by John J. Slocum and Herbert Cahoon and also extend the narrative. The main text of Stephen Hero is a connected, nearly self-contained passage of 383 manuscript pages which turned up soon after Joyce's death. It was first edited by Theodore Spencer and published by New Directions in 1944. In this edition, introductions by the successive editors discuss the literary and bibliographical aspects of this important early work by one of the great modern masters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j0LJBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Work of Ettore Sottsass and Associates","description":"Provides examples of Italian designer Ettore Sottsass's projects in architecture, interior, industrial and graphic design from 1980 to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lfFPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Work+of+Ettore+Sottsass+and+Associates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiritual Friendship (Cistercian Fathers 5)","description":"The abbot of the English Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx from 1147-1167 explores the spiritual nature of human friendship, defining it as sacramental and as a vehicle for God to transmit his love to all his creatures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cAqLtAEACAAJ&dq=Spiritual+Friendship+(Cistercian+Fathers+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ugly Pumpkin","description":"Perfect for the changing seasons, this wacky twist on The Ugly Duckling is a great read for Halloween and Thanksgiving.

It accomplishes this dispassionately, without prejudgment, moral censure, approbation, or more than cursory involvement. Therapists and counselors in all fields of sexual functioning will find here some understanding of the causes and impulses (beyond the popular  broken home syndrome ) that lead young males into prostitution. It signals some of the signposts to danger and serious threats to health that accompany the profession of prostitution and also explains to counselors some of the activities and practices of the male prostitute, enabling them to have a better understanding of the fascination and peril of the hustler s life. The brevity of success in such a calling is also considered, with some consideration for the necessity of long-range planning for the hustler s future. Important contents: interview of a well-known hustler brief look at early male prostitution--Greek, Roman, Burton s theory the peacock period and youth as a prerequisite for hustling lures of the profession--money, power, other motivations paths and mechanisms leading to hustling characteristics of different types of hustlers types of clients patronizing hustlers literary illuminations the modus operandi of the male hustler extraordinary dangers confronting the male hustler today the attractiveness of the  seeing-through  of a hustler to past clients quo vadis for the hustler after youth passes Readers will be amazed by the daily hazards and drawbacks as well fascinated by the curiosities and rewards of the hustler s profession.

Fascism and Neofascism is a collection of essays that is distinctive in two important ways.

Secondly, this volume also aims to bring newer modes of inquiry, rooted in cultural studies, into dialogue with more 'traditional' ways of viewing fascism.

Trained in the martial arts, she has the edge. Even more of a challenge is working for one of her bosses, James Callahan. Reserved and intimidating, as well as being handsome, Angel had to prove herself capable of the job, since he's not thrilled with having a female bouncer. When malicious pranks start to happen at the nightclub, coinciding with a rash of local jewelry store robberies, Angel is suspected by James of being responsible, at least for the pranks, when she happens to be in the vicinity each time to the storeroom where they originated from. This is thanks, in part, to being sent on errands there by one of the managers, Bob Newsome. It also doesn't help that the secretary of the club, Jannelle Martin, doesn't like her and Angel doesn't know why. When Angel's told to stay away from the storeroom, she asks one of the bartenders to see if he can find any clues to help clear her. He leaves her a note to meet her in the storeroom and on her way to it, she has a confrontation with the manager who'd sent her on the errands. He accuses her of being in love with James Callahan, who he says is seeing Jannelle. Although this shakes her some, when she finds bartender John Mack in the storeroom with a knife in his chest and then Angel is attacked, she pulls it together and decides to starts investigating on her own to find John's killer. What ensues is Angel fighting to clear her name and save her life. Because whoever killed John Mack, not only doesn't want her to find out who his murderer is: they're determined to have Angel to join him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LKuzDEiy_m0C&dq=The+Fifth+Magician:+The+Great+Beatles+Impostor+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Encyclopedia Of Dinosaurs And Prehistoric Life (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia)","description":"For use in schools and libraries only.

The author has given the reader the benefit of his long experience of the game by approaching the subject in this book in the same analytical manner as he did the swing and golf fallcies in 'The Golf Secret.' I have never seen the grip and the stance so perfectly and completely described. Ball spin and its effects are fascinating and instructive. Putting, the stymie and the chip shot - the all-important \\"short game\\" - are admirably described with a view to rolling three shots into two. Shots from the rough, uneven lies and bunker shots are made to appear almost desirable for the pleasure they give, and the mathematics of them are intriguing and convincing. Wind and rain no longer seem to matter. The skillful analyses of the various golf factors provide much information that is entirely new. This book is a must for every golfer-duffer or pro.

TESTIMONIAL - Dear Judy, Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your book! I am a retired Detective Supervisor who managed squads of Detectives. I wish your book had been available during my 25 years in law enforcement! Many of your how to ( and how not to) lead lessons I learned the hard way through OJT, observing others and trial & error. You explain in a personal, straightforward way in easy to understand language how to successfully and safely work, manage and lead. Other Leadership/Management books I have read in the past I found to be dry and impersonal, difficult to understand let alone apply. In today's economy, I would recommend this book to anyone working in the public or private sector as well as to anyone running a business with employees. Whether you are a worker bee, line supervisor, middle management or executive, you can become a greater asset to your employer. You will improve the morale and your working relationship with co-workers and others, learn early recognition, prevention, and how to deal with health and safety issues that affect and cost everyone. In this era of the \\"bottom line\\", manpower hours, performance, injuries, sick time, the need for employee counselling and company costs will improve! The only ingredients needed to succeed are integrity, willingness to self-examine and minimal effort to learn, absorb and put into practice leadership methods that are not difficult. Thanks, Detective III Rick Hoefel, Retired Los Angeles Police Department","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3IETYagbCh4C&dq=Ain%27t+You+Got+No+Cah%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1 is one","description":"Rhyming verse presents the numbers from one to twenty with illustrations of animals, flowers, and children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHLJCgAAQBAJ&dq=1+is+one&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_fTuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Abstract+Algebra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Romanian Church in northwestern Romania under the Horthy Scourge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OY5TzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Romanian+Church+in+northwestern+Romania+under+the+Horthy+Scourge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective C++: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs","description":"Effective C++ has been updated to reflect the latest ANSI/ISO standards.

Dr. Robinson has rescued and enhanced this important body of data which spans traditional and contemporary varieties of Comanche speech styles and four geographically identifiable dialects. The Comanche-English section of the work, with over 5,500 entries, constitutes the central portion of the dictionary, but an English-Comanche section indexes Comanche entries to aid in locating Comanche forms from the point of view of their English equivalents. In turn, Dr. Armagost's provision of an introductory exploration of Comanche morphology and syntax further enhances this volume as an important contribution to our knowledge of this branch of the Uto-Aztecan family of languages. This second edition has been improved for user-friendliness, especially in the English-Comanche section, making it much easier to find a Comanche equivalent of an English term. Lila Wistrand-Robinson has a Ph.D. from the University of Texas, Austin and served several years with SIL International in Peru. Her research was published in the book, Cashibo Folklore and Culture: Prose, Poetry, and Historical Background (SIL International Publications, 1998). She has also published an Iowa/Otoe-English dictionary and taught Linguistics and Anthropology at Kansas State University. James Armagost has a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Washington.

The main plot deals with the middle son, 16-year-old Richard, and his coming of age in turn-of-the-century America.

Swenson on February 11, 1940, I felt dismay that he had left unfinished his translation of the Unscientific Postscript. I had longed to see it published among the first of Kierkegaard's works in English. In the spring of 1935 it did not seem exorbitant to hope that it might be ready for the printer by the end of that year. For in March I learned from Professor Swenson that he had years before \\"done about two thirds of a rough translation.\\" In 1937/38 he took a sabbatical leave from his university for the sake of finishing this work. Yet after all it was not finished- partly because Professor Swenson was already incapacitated by the illness which eventually resulted in his death; but also because he aimed at a degree of perfection which hardly can be reached by a translator. At one time he expressed to me his suspicion that perhaps, as in the translation of Kant's philosophy, it might require the cooperation of many scholars during several generations before the translation of Kierkegaard's terminology could be definitely settled. I hailed with joy this new apprehension, which promised a speedy conclusion of the work, and in the words of Luther I urged him to \\"sin boldly.\\"--Editor's pref., p.

Except in this tell-all, cheeky guide to the world's naughtiest resort, Hedonism II. Everyone returns from Hedonism II with at least one good story no one at home believes. Is Hedonism II a retirement home for worn-out swingers? Is it a testosterone tour-de-force with too few eligible single women to clamor over? Is it a cult that sucks away all your vacation time? Well, the last one might be true. Learn why Hedonism II has a 90% repeat guest rate--even though the facilities are tired, the food is mediocre, and the beach sand hurts your feet--if you are still standing after a week. The Hedo myths: Only young singles go to Hedonism II. People walk around naked everywhere. Open sex is rampant. Someone will try to steal your wife. Every myth has its truth...but Hedonism II is 50% couples--and most guests are over 30, full nudity is only allowed on one beach, the hotel does not condone public sex (but it happens), and your wife--well, that's her choice. But at Hedo you will see what you've never seen before. And you might do it too. Here are the truths and tips that will make your vacation to Hedonism II the most fun trip you'll ever take--again and again. FYI: The resort Hedonism II did not authorize this book; the book includes the good, bad, and the ugly. Although the resort's owners tried to stop distribution of the 1st ed. of the book in federal court in 1998, the author enjoys Hedonism II as a vacation destination and continues to travel there regularly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6I-YgEACAAJ&dq=The+Naked+Truth+About+Hedonism+II+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Grown Up: Living Happily Ever After with Your Adult Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURES OF NILS.","description":"Selfish little Nils learns kindness and wisdom when, bewitched into an elf-sized boy, he is carried off by a barnyard goose to join the migration of wild geese across Sweden to Lapland.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=11INAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Released to Reign","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-m6vQEACAAJ&dq=Released+to+Reign&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tools for Tantra","description":"Tantric yantras are precise geometric forms that have been used for centuries as tools for self-realization and the attainment of mystical powers.

Now, in Egyptian Mythology, Geraldine Pinch offers a comprehensive introduction that untangles the mystery of Egyptian Myth. Spanning Ancient Egyptian culture--from 3200 BC to AD 400--Pinch opens a door to this hidden world and casts light on its often misunderstood belief system. She discusses the nature of myths and the history of Egypt, from the predynastic to the postpharaonic period. She explains how Egyptian culture developed around the flooding of the Nile, or the \\"inundation,\\" a phenomenon on which the whole welfare of the country depended, and how aspects of the inundation were personified as deities. She explains that the usually cloudless skies made for a preoccupation with the stars and planets. Indeed, much early Egyptian mythology may have developed to explain the movement of these celestial bodies. She provides a timeline covering the seven stages in the mythical history of Egypt and outlining the major events of each stage, such as the reign of the sun God. A substantial A to Z section covers the principal themes and concepts of Egyptian mythology as well as the most important deities, demons, and other characters. For anyone who wants to know about Anubis, the terrifying canine god who presided over the mummification of bodies and guarded burials, or Hathor, the golden goddess who helped women to give birth and the dead to be reborn, or an explanation of the nun, the primeval ocean from which all life came, Egyptian Mythology is the place to look.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hgGNb6wM2kC&dq=Ancient+Egyptian+Gods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasure in an Oatmeal Box: The Story of a Special Boy and the People Who Loved Him","description":"The bittersweet tale of love, trials, tragedies, and triumphs of ten-year-old, mentally handicapped Kevin Hallas and his family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_cNAAAACAAJ&dq=Treasure+in+an+Oatmeal+Box:+The+Story+of+a+Special+Boy+and+the+People+Who+Loved+Him&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding Your Baby -","description":"For more than a decade, BESTFEEDING has been recognized by midwives, doctors, and nursing mothers as the definitive word on breastfeeding.

Made at a time when nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union was a real possibility, the film is menacing, exhilarating, thrilling, insightful and very funny. Combining a scene-by-scene analysis of Dr. Strangelove with new research in the Stanley Kubrick Archive, Peter Kr?mer's study foregrounds the connections the film establishes between the Cold War and World War II, and between sixties America and Nazi Germany.

The enigma that a young woman from such a closed and protected environment as a Yorkshire rectory could write the wildly romantic and complex Wuthering Heights has long been a source of fascination. Largely self-educated, Emily spent most of her life at the rectory in Haworth. Her solitary instincts are well-known, and the biographer's task has been made no easier by her refusal to give anything of herself away to anyone during her lifetime. Robert Barnard examines her insulated childhood, and the stories of Gondal and Angria, leading to the lyrical poems of her twenties which prefigure the raw intensity of Wuthering Heights. He demonstrates that many aspects of Wuthering Heights were shaped or stimulated by her own experiences, many of which can be traced to real examples. He also refers extensively to other critical sources, from early reviews of Wuthering Heights to Mrs. Gaskell's appraisal of Emily's stern selfishness, to Juliet Barker's recent biography of the Bronte family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9PcdAQAAIAAJ&dq=Emily+Bront+(British+Library+Writers%27+Lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Minute Manager Balances Work and Life","description":"This is the story of a One Minute Manager who was so successful in every way that he forgot one important thing: He forgot to stay physically fit.

Reading this book in it's entirety may cause the following side effects: Surprise, Anger, Disbelief, and even Amusement. We begin by revealing the little known, inside workings of the pharmaceutical industry, based on the experiences of people who have worked there. Why do you think it is that your drugs cost so much? Is it because of all the high tech 'stuff' that goes into making it? Or is it something else that might shock or even anger you? What goes on behind the scenes often has nothing whatsoever to do with science. This leads to the second part which has to do with our health and the things you may not even realize are making us all sick. This is not just another 'eat right and exercise' book. You will discover information you have never heard before. There are even things that have been proven to harm you but have been covered up or ignored, and even encouraged, as long as there is money to be made. Do you like investigative reporting? Do you like history, or science fiction? Do you have a taste for the macabre? Are you concerned about declining health care, government and military cover ups, or the high cost of medicine? Written with some humor and at times a touch of sarcasm, there is a little bit of something here for everyone. You may or may not agree with some of the things in this book, but once you start reading it, your curiosity will make you want to pick it up again and again until you are finished.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N48r3iTqOe4C&dq=Power+of+the+Light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditations for New Mothers","description":"A collection of daily meditations designed to refresh, reassure, and entertain new mothers covers a wide variety of pertinent subjects, including postpartum depression, priorities, time management, and much more.

At the same time that he tells moving stories about people who have received online emotional support during devastating illnesses, he acknowledges a darker side to people's behavior in cyberspace. Indeed, contends Rheingold, people relate to each other online much the same as they do in physical communities. Originally published in 1993, The Virtual Community is more timely than ever.

Swenson on February 11, 1940, I felt dismay that he had left unfinished his translation of the Unscientific Postscript. I had longed to see it published among the first of Kierkegaard's works in English. In the spring of 1935 it did not seem exorbitant to hope that it might be ready for the printer by the end of that year. For in March I learned from Professor Swenson that he had years before \\"done about two thirds of a rough translation.\\" In 1937/38 he took a sabbatical leave from his university for the sake of finishing this work. Yet after all it was not finished- partly because Professor Swenson was already incapacitated by the illness which eventually resulted in his death; but also because he aimed at a degree of perfection which hardly can be reached by a translator. At one time he expressed to me his suspicion that perhaps, as in the translation of Kant's philosophy, it might require the cooperation of many scholars during several generations before the translation of Kierkegaard's terminology could be definitely settled. I hailed with joy this new apprehension, which promised a speedy conclusion of the work, and in the words of Luther I urged him to \\"sin boldly.\\"--Editor's pref., p.

This Pentateuchal puzzle has not only perplexed ancient and modern exegetes but has also produced a multiplicity of answers. A plethora of explanations proposed by exegetes on the sin of Moses appears to be strong on conjectural ingenuity but weak on textual evidence. A fresh exegetical probe is therefore warranted using a hermeneutical strategy whereby a narrative approach is attempted in order to understand Num. 20:1-13 in the light of Exodus 17:1-7. These narrative analogies are part of a distinctive feature in the Hebrew narrative style labelled Type- scene. The main thrust of this book is that the sin of Moses recorded in Numbers 20:1-13 is linked to the unlawful and wilful act of trifling with the sacred staff in striking the rock. This is because the staff of Moses has already become the staff of God (Exod. 4:20;17;9). Moses' abuse and misuse of the staff constitutes an act of lese-majeste because it is seen as an act of rebellion against YHWH's authority. Inevitably, Moses eclipses YHWH's personality, presence and power in the eyes of the people. His condign punishment is the forfeiture of the privilege of leading the people into the Promised Land.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0KOODwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Sin+of+Moses+and+the+Staff+of+God+(Studia+Semitica+Neerlandica)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jo Verso's Complete Cross Stitch Course","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0J0aPwAACAAJ&dq=Jo+Verso%27s+Complete+Cross+Stitch+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal art of Benin: The Perls collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"Tantalizing trivia. this Hitler, spoiling everything?\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8PDPDRgO4sC&dq=Royal+art+of+Benin:+The+Perls+collection+in+the+Metropolitan+Museum+of+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spelling & Grammar (The Daily Spark): 180 Easy-to-Use Lessons and Class Activities!","description":"Give your second grader a fun-filled way to build and reinforce spelling skills.

P. Oberholtzer)","description":"In the summer of 1831, a band of some forty slaves led by Nat Turner attacked slave-owning residents of Southampton County, Virginia. One of the largest and most violent revolts in the history of the young nation, the rebellion took the lives of some sixty white men, women, and children. An outcry against the South's exploitative slave system, the revolt was suppressed within forty-eight hours, and Turner, who eluded authorities for months, was eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed. The impact of Turner's uprising was monumental. Abolitionists looked for ways to encourage and support future insurrections while white Southerners took revenge on both slave and free African-Americans. Nearly 200 blacks, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion, were beaten, tortured, and murdered by white mobs. Herbert Aptheker's account of the bloodiest slave uprising in U.S. history was the first full-length study of its kind. Meticulously researched, it explores the nature of Southern society in the early nineteenth century and the conditions that led to the rebellion. Described by the Journal of American History as \\"a thorough and scholarly treatment,\\" the text includes Turner's \\"Confessions,\\" recorded before his execution in 1831.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GkO3DAAAQBAJ&dq=John+Brown,+(American+crisis+biographies,+ed.+by+E.+P.+Oberholtzer)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Sylvester's Busy Day (Looney Tunes Lovables)","description":"Looney Tunes Lovables are the pint-sized personas of the popular Looney Tunes characters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m5eaGQAACAAJ&dq=Baby+Sylvester%27s+Busy+Day+(Looney+Tunes+Lovables)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch (The Uniform Edition, Volume 31)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R4krAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Nonesuch+(The+Uniform+Edition,+Volume+31)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calculus with Analytic Geometry, Alternate","description":"This traditional text offers a balanced approach that combines the theoretical instruction of calculus with the best aspects of reform, including creative teaching and learning techniques such as the integration of technology, the use of real-life applications, and mathematical models.

I would be consistent for a month, and then I would neglect it for a few weeks. This pattern continued until a friend of mine spoke a picture into my heart. She told me that from the moment she opens her eyes in the morning, she pictures Jesus on her couch waiting for her. When she told me that, it occurred to me how many times I had waved goodbye to Jesus without as much as a hello. At that moment, I went on a journey to find a quiet time format that would start my day right and allow the Word to bring joy to my heart.At the Feet of Jesus is the format I have been using for my quiet time for years, and I am thrilled to share it with you. This book works alone as a resource between you and your Savior, as a small group discussion, or in conjunction with the accompanying YouTube channel by the same name, The Feet of Jesus with Heather Fowler.

Los Angeles in 1974 exerted more influence over popular culture than any other city in America. Los Angeles that year, in fact, dominated popular culture more than it ever had before, or would again. Working in film, recording, and television studios around Sunset Boulevard, living in Brentwood and Beverly Hills or amid the flickering lights of the Hollywood Hills, a cluster of transformative talents produced an explosion in popular culture which reflected the demographic, social, and cultural realities of a changing America. At a time when Richard Nixon won two presidential elections with a message of backlash against the social changes unleashed by the sixties, popular culture was ahead of politics in predicting what America would become. The early 1970s in Los Angeles was the time and the place where conservatives definitively lost the battle to control popular culture. Rock Me on the Water traces the confluence of movies, music, television, and politics in Los Angeles month by month through that transformative, magical year. Ronald Brownstein reveals how 1974 represented a confrontation between a massive younger generation intent on change, and a political order rooted in the status quo. Today, we are again witnessing a generational cultural divide. Brownstein shows how the voices resistant to change may win the political battle for a time, but they cannot hold back the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rFHfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Heal From Memory: Sexton, Lorde, Anzalda, and the Poetry of Witness","description":"Through an examination of the poetry of Anne Sexton, Audre Lorde, and Gloria Anzald a, We Heal From Memory paints a vivid picture of how our culture carries a history of traumatic violence - child sexual abuse, the ownership and enforcement of women's sexuality under slavery, the transmission of violence through generations, and the destruction of non-white cultures and their histories through colonization.

Upon the fourth day of September, 1916, he set out with four companions, Sinclair, Brady, James, and Tippet, to search along the base of the barrier cliffs for a point at which they might be scaled. Through the heavy Caspakian air, beneath the swollen sun, the five men marched northwest from Fort Dinosaur, now waist-deep in lush, jungle grasses starred with myriad gorgeous blooms, now across open meadow-land and parklike expanses and again plunging into dense forests of eucalyptus and acacia and giant arboreous ferns with feathered fronds waving gently a hundred feet above their heads. About them upon the ground, among the trees and in the air over them moved and swung and soared the countless forms of Caspak's teeming life. Always were they menaced by some frightful thing and seldom were their rifles cool, yet even in the brief time they had dwelt upon Caprona they had become callous to danger, so that they swung along laughing and chatting like soldiers on a summer hike....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h4nZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 95 Game Sdk Strategy Guide","description":"Focusing on learning the techniques of game programming using Windows 95 Game SDK, this clear guide explains how the Game SDK libraries are implemented under Windows 95 and Windows NT.

Real Books Kidwriting Quotes ///////////////////////////////////////////////// SAMPLE My earlier book on children's writing, \\"The Business of Writing for Children,\\" was drawn mainly from two sources: handouts from the classes and workshops I used to give, and my articles for \\"Once Upon A Time\\" and the \\"SCBWI Bulletin\\" (earlier called the \\"SCBW Bulletin\\") -- the newsletter of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. In selecting the articles to include in that book, I tried to keep a balance among its main subject areas -- writing, publishing, marketing -- and to avoid domination by my personal specialties. I also chose to omit my more controversial articles, to make the book more generally accessible. Naturally, these criteria left out a number of articles I considered valuable. I'm pleased to offer at least some of them now, in this second collection. I've also included later articles, with some brand new ones -- some of which I've meant to write for years. (There's nothing like publishing a book to help you tie up loose ends.)

Edwards' \\"Notes on Scripture\\" confirms the centrality of the Bible in his thought and provides more balance to earlier depictions of his writings that emphasized the scientific and philosophical while overlooking the biblical dimension. In this critical edition the entries appear in the order in which Edwards wrote them, beginning with a short commentary on Genesis 2:10-14 that he penned in 1724, and ending with his last entry, Number 507 on the Book of Solomon's Song, written two years before his death. This volume provides direct access to one of America's most influential religious thinkers. Edwards' entries range across the entire scriptural canon and reveal his creativity in the interpretation of particular biblical texts and his fascination with typology. The notebook also documents Edwards' engagement with the intellectual currents of his day, in particular his response to the challenge associated with the Enlightenment critique of biblical revelation. Stephen J. Stein's introduction situates Edwards as an exegete in the larger tradition of biblical commentary and in the intellectual world of eighteenth-century Western thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHImAQAAIAAJ&dq=Notes+on+Scripture+(The+Works+of+Jonathan+Edwards+Series,+Volume+15)+(v.+15)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barbie: Her Life & Times","description":"BillyBoy, owner of the world's largest Barbie doll collection (20,000 dolls and counting), charts the history of this protean American dream girl in a good-humored and affectionate retrospective.

Vienna in 1886 was a city of elegant caf s, grand opera houses, and a thriving and adventurous artistic community.

Many of China's imperial dynasties were established as the result of battle, from the chariot warfare of ancient times to the battles of the Guomindang (KMT) and Communist regimes of the twentieth century. China's ability to sustain complex warfare on a very large scale was not emulated in other parts of the world until the Industrial Age, despite the fact that the country is only now rising to economic dominance. In A Military History of China, Updated Edition, David A. Graff and Robin Higham bring together leading scholars to offer a basic introduction to the military history of China from the first millennium B.C.E. to the present. Focusing on recurring patterns of conflict rather than traditional campaign narratives, this volume reaches farther back into China's military history than similar studies. It also offers insightful comparisons between Chinese and Western approaches to war.

President Barack Obama, from remarks given at Meyer s Medal of Honor ceremony In the fall of 2009, Taliban insurgents ambushed a patrol of Afghan soldiers and Marine advisors in a mountain village called Ganjigal. Firing from entrenched positions, the enemy was positioned to wipe out one hundred men who were pinned down and were repeatedly refused artillery support. Ordered to remain behind with the vehicles, twenty-one year-old Marine corporal Dakota Meyer disobeyed orders and attacked to rescue his comrades. With a brave driver at the wheel, Meyer stood in the gun turret exposed to withering fire, rallying Afghan troops to follow. Over the course of the five hours, he charged into the valley time and again. Employing a variety of machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and even a rock, Meyer repeatedly repulsed enemy attackers, carried wounded Afghan soldiers to safety, and provided cover for dozens of others to escape supreme acts of valor and determination. In the end, Meyer and four stalwart comrades an Army captain, an Afghan sergeant major, and two Marines cleared the battlefield and came to grips with a tragedy they knew could have been avoided. For his actions on that day, Meyer became the first living Marine in three decades to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Into the Fire tells the full story of the chaotic battle of Ganjigal for the first time, in a compelling, human way that reveals it as a microcosm of our recent wars. Meyer takes us from his upbringing on a farm in Kentucky, through his Marine and sniper training, onto the battlefield, and into the vexed aftermath of his harrowing exploits in a battle that has become the stuff of legend. Investigations ensued, even as he was pitched back into battle alongside U.S. Army soldiers who embraced him as a fellow grunt. When it was over, he returned to the States to confront living with the loss of his closest friends. This is a tale of American values and upbringing, of stunning heroism, and of adjusting to loss and to civilian life. We see it all through Meyer s eyes, bullet by bullet, with raw honesty in telling of both the errors that resulted in tragedy and the resolve of American soldiers, U.S. Marines, and Afghan soldiers who d been abandoned and faced certain death. Meticulously researched and thrillingly told, with nonstop pace and vivid detail, Into the Fire is the unvarnished story of a modern American hero. Praise for Into the Fire  A story of men at their best and at their worst . . . leaves you gaping in admiration at Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer s courage.

In 1779, Britain strategised a war to finally subdue the rebellious American colonies with a minimum of additional time, effort, and blood. Setting sail from New York harbour with 8,500 ground troops, a powerful British fleet swung south towards South Carolina. One year later, Charleston fell. And as King George s forces pushed inland and upward, it appeared the six-year-old colonial rebellion was doomed to defeat. In a stunning work on forgotten history, acclaimed historian Walter Edgar takes the American Revolution far beyond Lexington and Concord to re-create the pivotal months in a nation s savage struggle for freedom. It is a story of military brilliance and devastating human blunders - and the courage of an impossibly outnumbered force of demoralised patriots who suffered terribly at the hands of a merciless enemy, yet slowly gained confidence through a series of small triumphs that convinced them their war could be won. Alive with incident and colour.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KlQyO2RE0ikC&dq=Partisans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follow the Story: How to Write Successful Nonfiction","description":"An indispensable guide to nonfiction writing from the Columbia Journalism School professor and Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist behind the bestsellers Blind Eye, Blood Sport, and Den of Thieves.

With generational divides wider than ever, parents, educators, and employers have an urgent need to understand today s rising generation of teens and young adults. Born in the mid-1990s up to the mid-2000s, iGen is the first generation to spend their entire adolescence in the age of the smartphone. With social media and texting replacing other activities, iGen spends less time with their friends in person perhaps contributing to their unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. But technology is not the only thing that makes iGen distinct from every generation before them; they are also different in how they spend their time, how they behave, and in their attitudes toward religion, sexuality, and politics. They socialize in completely new ways, reject once sacred social taboos, and want different things from their lives and careers. More than previous generations, they are obsessed with safety, focused on tolerance, and have no patience for inequality. With the first members of iGen just graduating from college, we all need to understand them: friends and family need to look out for them; businesses must figure out how to recruit them and sell to them; colleges and universities must know how to educate and guide them. And members of iGen also need to understand themselves as they communicate with their elders and explain their views to their older peers. Because where iGen goes, so goes our nation and the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HiKaDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lesbian Sex Secrets for Men: What Every Man Wants to Know About Making Love to a Woman and Never Asks","description":"'The aim of Lesbian Sex Secrets for Men is to teach men what lesbians know about pleasing women. This is more than a primer on body parts and oral sex (though yes, there's plenty of that). It's also about how to talk (the best way to find out what your partner likes), how to listen, how to open up, and how to get your mind off your member. The chapter entitled \\"Foreplay? Honey, It's All Play!\\" should make women cheer. The writing is clever, graphic, intimate, and festive. No subject is off limits: sex toys, sex during menstruation (\\"When the Moon Is Between Her Legs\\"), \\"Finger Love (Becoming a Digital Master),\\" \\"The Lowdown on Going Down,\\" anal play (\\"Ass-istance for Two\\"), and much more. In many short quotes, women frankly discuss their likes and dislikes. Notes of special importance, titled \\"Honey, Come Closer,\\" include: \\"Quit thinking of the clitoris as a little pea-sized bump.... It is actually a whole system of erectile tissue, spongy tissue, muscles, nerve endings, blood vessels, and glands.\\" \\"By taking your time, not only do you create steamy anticipation in your partner; you also get to check out the territory and get a good sense of where everything is so there is no clumsy fumbling.\\" \\"A steady hand is worth a thousand orgasms.\\" If men understood what great sexual tools their brains, mouths, and hands were, say the authors, they'd see sex and pleasure differently and communicate in new ways.

Britain s Literary Review terms the Abbotts  Smooth, sardonic, impeccably argued, immaculately written  while author Lawrence Block says:  Frostline is the best book in a series that started strong and keeps getting better.  When Newbury s newest resident, ex-diplomat Harry King, the close confidant of Kissinger and reputed to have been heavily involved in the Vietnam War, summons real estate agent Ben Abbott to his new McMansion, Ben dreams of big dollar signs. The commission from selling the Fox Trot estate would be huge. But King doesn t want Ben s selling expertise, he wants him to act as a mediator between him and his troublesome neighbour, surly Vietnam vet Ronnie Butler. A strip of Butler s land cuts straight into King s estate like a knife, acting as a red flag for two neighbors who are as ornery and quarrelsome as a pair of rival bulls. In fact, the testoserone is flowing heavier than the waters in the stream King is damming up for a picturesque lake. Before Ben can mediate, an explosion rocks a lavish party on the Fox Trot lawn. The blast blows up the dam and Butler s ex-con son, Dickie, along with it. Butler, an army-trained sapper, is arrested for setting the dynamite. Ben, whose childhood friend Dickie had tried his patience and loyalty many times before, refuses to accept Butler s guilt. Besides, too many things don t add up. Could it be the work of terrorists? Of one of the many groups holding a grudge against King? Or just someone with his own axe to grind? With the Feds on the scene, caught in state and locallaw enforcement jockeying, Ben negotiates an unpopular course through the usual minefield of his various loyalties to friends, family and lovers, of whom there are plenty....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Qj_wAEACAAJ&dq=FrostLine+(Ben+Abbott+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's Hunt","description":"The mysterious 'Bell Man' stalks the streets of Oxford...
