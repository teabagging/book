During a TV interview with a comedian, journalist Rebecca Reid found herself unable to get a word in edgewise. So, when she put her finger to her lips and shushed him, she became instantly known on the internet as  Rebecca Rude.  It was only then that she realized that being rude could actually be her superpower. A captivating blend of advice and pop culture, this  breezy feminist guide  (Publishers Weekly) shows you how to use the power of boldness in every area of your life. Exploring famous women who have been perceived as rude including Princess Margaret, Anna Wintour, Taylor Swift, Meghan Markle, and others Rude demonstrates how those women used their  rudeness  to get what they want and deserve out of life. Reid also addresses whether there are different rules of rudeness for women compared to men (yes, there are) and how being taught not to be rude actually prevents women from being successful especially because when women are assertive, they are often judged as being aggressive. And while there s a place for politeness, Rebecca argues that it s never a bad time to stand up for yourself and achieve your dreams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4NdOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Being+Rude&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","description":"The murder of a personal fitness trainer draws DCI Bill Slider and his team into a baffling investigation where nothing is as it first appears.

Handsome Erik Lingoss had clients in high places; and he seemed to engender powerful emotions.

In 1971 a girl named Alex was born with cystic fibrosis, a degenerative genetic lung disease. Although health-care innovations have improved the life span of CF patients tremendously over the last four decades, the illness remains fatal. Given only two years to live by her doctors, the imaginative, excitable, and curious little girl battled through painful and frustrating physical-therapy sessions twice daily, as well as regular hospitalizations, bringing joy to the lives of everyone she touched. Despite her setbacks, brave Alex was determined to live life like a typical girl going to school, playing with her friends, traveling with her family. Ultimately, however, she succumbed to the disease in 1980 at the age of eight. Award-winning author Frank Deford, celebrated primarily as a sportswriter, was also a budding novelist and biographer at the time of his daughter s birth. Deford kept a journal of Alex s courageous stand against the disease, documenting his family s struggle to cope with and celebrate the daily fight she faced. This book is the result of that journal. Alex relives the events of those eight years: moments as heartwarming as when Alex recorded herself saying  I love you  so her brother could listen to her whenever he wanted, and as heartrending as the young girl s tragic, dawning realization of her own very tenuous mortality, and her parents  difficulty in trying to explain why. Though Alex is a sad story, it is also one of hope; her greatest wish was that someday a cure would be found. Deford has written a phenomenal memoir about an extraordinary little girl.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yzQRBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","description":" I swore by Elvis and all the saints that this last teenage year of mine was going to be a real rave.

But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous, and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world. His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers, the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, the slow-witted orphan Smike, rescued by Nicholas, the pretentious Mantalinis and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummels and their daughter, the 'infant phenomenon'. Like many of Dickens's novels, Nicholas Nickleby is characterised by his outrage at cruelty and social injustice, but it is also a flamboyantly exuberant work, whose loose, haphazard progress harks back to the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding. In his introduction Mark Ford compares Nicholas Nickleby to eighteenth-century picaresque novels, and examines Dickens's criticism of the 'Yorkshire schools', his social satire and use of language. This edition includes the original illustrations by 'Phiz', Dickens's original preface to the work, a chronology and a list of further reading.

Can we replicate that magic in other places? How do you foster innovation in your own networks?Discover the answers in this groundbreaking book from two of the world's leading experts at the intersection of venture capital and global development. Victor W. Hwang and Greg Horowitt propose a radical new theory to explain the nature of innovation ecosystems: human networks that generate extraordinary creativity and output. They argue that free market thinking fails to consider the impact of human nature on the innovation process. This ambitious work challenges the basic assumptions that economists have held for over a century.The authors argue that such ecosystems - what they call Rainforests - can only thrive when certain cultural behaviors unlock human potential. Their theory of the Rainforest is influenced by several breakthrough ideas in academia, including insights on sociobiology from Harvard, economic transactions from the University of Chicago, and design theory from Stanford, among others. With an unorthodox and entertaining narrative, the book reveals the mysterious mechanisms of Rainforests. Furthermore, the authors provide practical tools for readers to design, build, and sustain new innovation ecosystems.

Memorandum)","description":"In a work of sweeping scope and luminous detail, Elizabeth Borgwardt describes how a cadre of World War II American planners inaugurated the ideas and institutions that underlie our modern international human rights regime. Borgwardt finds the key in the 1941 Atlantic Charter and its Anglo-American vision of \\"war and peace aims.\\" In attempting to globalize what U.S. planners heralded as domestic New Deal ideas about security, the ideology of the Atlantic Charter--buttressed by FDR s \\"Four Freedoms\\" and the legacies of World War I--redefined human rights and America s vision for the world. Three sets of international negotiations brought the Atlantic Charter blueprint to life--Bretton Woods, the United Nations, and the Nuremberg trials. These new institutions set up mechanisms to stabilize the international economy, promote collective security, and implement new thinking about international justice. The design of these institutions served as a concrete articulation of U.S. national interests, even as they emphasized the importance of working with allies to achieve common goals. The American architects of these charters were attempting to redefine the idea of security in the international sphere. To varying degrees, these institutions and the debates surrounding them set the foundations for the world we know today. By analyzing the interaction of ideas, individuals, and institutions that transformed American foreign policy--and Americans  view of themselves--Borgwardt illuminates the broader history of modern human rights, trade and the global economy, collective security, and international law. This book captures a lost vision of the American role in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ajJoFFKv18C&dq=Moscow,+Teheran,+and+international+organization,+(Yale+Institute+of+International+Studies.+Memorandum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diaries of Syra Bond","description":"Imprisoned by a perverted captor, research student, Syra, is forced to write about the sexual misdeeds that led to her captivity. She tells in explicit detail -- and under constant censure and threat of punishment -- how, in the heat if a long Spanish summer, her cruel master, Galen, as part of an experiment in control, trains her to complete obedience. She recalls how she fulfils his every wish as, with a mixture of mental control and chastisement, he takes her to the limits of obedience where everything, real and imaginary, becomes part of the sexual world he contrives for her. Syra's exposure to Galen's cruelty serves only to increase her desire for satisfaction from humiliation. But even though she submits to everything she is told - and there seems nothing that limits her desire for degradation -- the final outcome proves to be an ultimate and unforeseen humiliation that sets the scene for the rest of her life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VxMFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Diaries+of+Syra+Bond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Navy Second to None: The History of U.S. Naval Training in World War I (Contributions in Military Studies)","description":"Previous studies of the American Navy's role in World War I have emphasized combat, logistical tasks, and the transportation of military supplies and troops to Europe.

Winner of the National Book Award, them is an enthralling novel about love, class, race, and the inhumanity of urban life. It is, raves The New York Times,  a superbly accomplished vision.  Them is the third novel in the Wonderland Quartet. The books that complete this acclaimed series, A Garden of Earthly Delights, Expensive People, and Wonderland, are also available from the Modern Library. [Oates is] a superb storyteller.

Nicola Clark, however, places women and the question of kinship in centre-stage, arguing that this is necessary to understand the complexity of the early modern dynasty.

He wrote on philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction. Chesterton is often referred to as the \\"prince of paradox\\". Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, and allegories first carefully turning them inside out. Chesterton is well known for his reasoned apologetics and even some of those who disagree with him have recognized the universal appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both progressivism and conservatism, saying, \\"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\\" Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an \\"orthodox\\" Christian, and came to identify such a position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Roman Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, Chesterton's \\"friendly enemy\\" said of him, \\"He was a man of colossal genius\\".

With an incurable illness, no prospect of financial reward, little chance of success, brain surgery looming, and one child in college with another about to start, I was not in a position to spend thousands of dollars on a search. Still, desperate for a distraction, anything to pry my focus away from the disease, I decided-the hell with Parkinson's. I'm doing it.\\" - From THE LOST INTRUDER.On a windy, Autumn day in 1989, a U.S. Navy A-6 Intruder crashed off the shores of Whidbey Island, Washington. The Navy mounted a comprehensive, four-ship search for the attack jet with advanced sonar systems and remotely operated mini-submarines. They came up empty handed.Former Navy pilot Peter Hunt knew the lost Intruder well. The jet came from his squadron; he had flown it from the deck of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Ranger. Standing in the squadron ready room, Hunt listened to the radio transmissions as the accident unfolded: the hydraulic malfunction, the aborted mission, the futile attempt to lower the landing gear, and finally the violent ejection into Puget sound. Puzzled by the failed Navy search, Hunt long imagined the thrill of finding the A-6 and accomplishing what the U.S. Navy could not.But time was running out. At age 43, Hunt was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. After ten years of worsening symptoms, no longer permitted to fly, and barely able to scuba dive, Hunt knew that he was losing the battle. Desperate for a rallying point to prove to himself that life still mattered, Hunt struck out in 2014 to find the missing A-6. Naval Aviation, deep technical wreck diving, high seas exploration, and one man's optimistic refusal to quit converge in a salute to life's possibility. The Lost Intruder soars in a triumph of the human spirit-see what it means to be alive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Q16tAEACAAJ&dq=The+Search+for+Peter+Hunt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence","description":"The lesbian victim of a violent hate crime that left her seriously wounded and her partner dead is the story of family and community, the medical system, the police and courts, and the media--and of one woman's incredible courage.

DNA, genetic engineering, deadly viruses, and fertility treatments are just some of the many topics we constantly read and hear about. But how much do most of us really know about the natural world and our place in it? Never before have we heard so much about something we know so little about -- the complexity of life itself.The Mammal in the Mirror is an ideal way to learn about this world and how it makes us who we are. It begins with the small stuff, what biologists call \\"skin-in\\": a close-up view of DNA, genes, viruses, and cells; then it moves back a bit to explore the larger systems of human biology -- sex and reproduction, the brain and behavior, and energy. Finally, The Mammal in the Mirror takes a look at Homo sapiens from the revealing distance of ecology, evolution, and evolutionary psychology. The result is an accurate, accessible view of ourselves that will enable every reader, regardless of background, to become bioliterate and able to understand the discoveries that make the headlines of today -- and tomorrow.After all, there's no getting around the fact that, ultimately, we are animals -- c","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i8R3HAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mammal+in+the+Mirror:+Understanding+Our+Place+in+the+Natural+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's Cooking Soups","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wTrfAQAACAAJ&dq=What%27s+Cooking+Soups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Dying: Creating Rituals for Embracing the End of Life","description":"The author instructs readers in the art of dying, providing useful advice on how to create rituals around death that encourage sacredness and spirituality, while exploring difficult questions surrounding the act of dying and attendant care and offering thoughtful rituals and prayers to support the needs of the dying while comforting the living.

Beginning in the early 1980s, hundreds of thousands of Maya fled the terror of Guatemalan civil strife to safety in Mexico and the U.S. This ethnography of Mayan immigrants who settled in Indiatown, a small agricultural community in south central Florida, presents the experiences of these traditional people, their adaptations to life in the U.S., and the ways they preserve their ancestral culture. For more than a decade, Allan F. Burns has been researching and doing advocacy work for these immigrant Maya, who speak Kanjobal, Quiche, Mamana, and several other of the more than thirty distinct languages in southern Mexico and Guatemala. In this fist book on the Guatemalan Maya in the U.S, he uses their many voices to communicate the experience of the Maya in Florida and describes the advantages and results of applied anthropology in refugee studies and cultural adaptation. Burns describes the political and social background of the Guatemalan immigrants to the U.S. and includes personal accounts of individual strategies for leaving Guatemala and traveling to Florida. Examining how they interact with the community and recreate a Maya society in the U.S., he considers how low-wage labor influences the social structure of Maya immigrant society and discusses the effects of U.S. immigration policy on these refugees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zj9zEAAAQBAJ&dq=Maya+in+Exile:+Guatemalans+in+Florida&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucky in Love: Secrets of Happy Couples and How Their Marriages Survive","description":"A look at successful marriages presents data culled from interviews with one hundred couples, as well as information based on decades of literature on relationships, to discuss the myths and truths of a happy marriage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zpfWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lucky+in+Love:+Secrets+of+Happy+Couples+and+How+Their+Marriages+Survive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)","description":"Deep in London s dangerous slums, Victorians transact their most secret and shameful business.

When Anne McCurry's sister Sara died of breast cancer at age 54, Anne was devastated at losing her hero and best friend. She found little help or information anywhere in dealing with the overwhelming grief of adult sibling loss. Adding to the anguish of losing her only sister was the bewildering behavior of Sara's husband of 24 years, which included a total absence of grief and an immediate search for a new woman. Anne had a terrible need to \\"talk\\" to Sara about her paralyzing grief and about her brother-in-law's surprising behavior. She began writing letters to Sara, which became the basis for this non-fiction book. Interwoven throughout the letters is the story of Sara's illness, as well as discussion of numerous aspects of grief such as anticipatory grief, the stages of grieving, anniversary grief, survivor's guilt and the universality of grief. The letters also reveal Anne's dogged attempt to solve the mystery of her brother-in-law's hurtful behavior. In the end, she does.

More Than Shelter makes clear that such limited perspectives do not capture the rich reality of tenants  active engagement in shaping public housing into communities. By looking closely at three public housing projects in San Francisco, Amy L. Howard brings to light the dramatic measures tenants have taken to create and sustain and strengthen communities that mattered to them. More Than Shelter opens with the tumultuous institutional history of the San Francisco Housing Authority, from its inception during the New Deal era, through its repeated leadership failures, to its attempts to boost its credibility in the 1990s. Howard then turns to Valencia Gardens in the Mission District; built in 1943, the project became a perpetually contested and embattled space. Within that space, tenants came together in what Howard calls affective activism activism focused on intentional relationships and community building that served to fortify residents in the face of shared challenges. Such activism also fueled cross-sector coalition building at Ping Yuen in Chinatown, bringing tenants and organizations together to advocate for and improve public housing. The account of their experience breaks new ground in highlighting the diversity of public housing in more ways than one. The experience of North Beach Place in turn raises questions about the politics of development and redevelopment, in this case, Howard examines activism across generations first by African Americans seeking to desegregate public housing, then by cross-racial and cross-ethnic tenant groups mobilizing to maintain public housing in the shadow of gentrification.

She dug her nails into the crinkled paper beneath her bottom, and her voice emerged a whisper. \\"Why couldn't he have been you?\\" Dr. Bottari's forehead wrinkled, then smoothed. He tilted his head slightly left. \\"I don't know, but I would never have walked away.\\" ----- Dr. Marco Bottari has heard many stories from his patients, some more heartbreaking than the rest, and he's learned how to show compassion while holding them at arm's length. But something about Patricia Fanning is different. She's beautiful, for one. Pregnant and single, she's also scared. The good guy in him simply won't let him walk away, especially when a dead body is found in her trunk right outside his clinic. She has no one else and nowhere to go. Yet what starts as a helping hand, soon involves his heart, and a split-second decision that may have sealed his fate forever. From best-selling author, SUZANNE D.

Begun as an organized form of predator control in the 1920s, for many years rattlesnake roundups have been promoted as community events and civic fundraisers. The western diamond-backed rattlesnake is the main attraction, with pits full of thousands of writhing rattlesnakes serving as the featured spectacle. Often taking advantage of the animals' denning behavior to capture large numbers at a time, hunters deliver live snakes to commercial dealers who are contracted by event organizers to supply the animals as a source of entertainment: from snake handling and snake races to snake sacking, snake skinning, snake milking, and snake education activities. Rattlesnake products of various types are also sold and consumed at the events. In this close-up look at rattlesnake roundups in Texas, Clark E. Adams and John K. Thomas present perhaps the first full description of this social and environmental phenomenon, tracking its popularity, its participants, its opponents, its impact on the communities where it occurs, and, as much as is possible, its effects on the rattlesnake itself. In recent years, the commercial trade in Texas animals has emerged as a serious and controversial issue, and the number of roundups has declined sharply. Texas Rattlesnake Roundups promises to provide a balanced starting point for all those interested in knowing more about this curious custom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VwJKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Texas+Rattlesnake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","description":"This thrilling \\"prequel\\" to Robert Louis Stevenson's classic pirate tale imagines how Captain Flint and Murray sacked the Spanish galleon and buried their ill-gotten treasure on the Dead Man's Chest and on Treasure Island.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KxGXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slaves of Sumuru","description":"Of Sins of Sumuru, the Manchester Evening News wrote: Dr. Fu Manchu, Sax Rohmer's celebrated character, gives way to a woman -- Sumuru --in this new novel.

Gardner brings together exceptional French and Eastern European scholars who present first-hand accounts of their experience and knowledge of the region. Each provides differing political, social, cultural, and economic perspectives on Central and Southeastern Europe. The volume begins with a general discussion of the place of central and southeastern Europe in the greater scheme of European history. This is followed by an examination of the western European and Russian attitudes toward the Balkans, and the largely ignored affects of the Ottoman empire on the Balkans. The importance of culture and the crucial role it played in undermining both the theory and practice of communism is explored. The impact of the media is then examined in two chapters that look at the process of media liberalization in the context of each country's political situation and the particular problems the media faces in the region. The focus shifts to the role of finance capital and its impact in emerging privatized economies. How the global drug wars affect the Balkan region are also explored. The ecological damage to Central and eastern Europe and Russia caused by the communist system is detailed, and the volume ends with a look at the complexity of factors that led NATO to enlarge into Central Europe and intervene in Bosnia and Kosovo. This wide-ranging collection will be of particular interest to scholars and researchers involved with all facets of contemporary central and eastern European life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7dxoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Central+and+Southeastern+Europe+in+Transition:+Perspectives+on+Success+and+Failure+Since+1989&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Yankee Flier in the Far East (The Air Combat Stories for Boys)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xbLlGAAACAAJ&dq=A+Yankee+Flier+in+the+Far+East+(The+Air+Combat+Stories+for+Boys)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alien vs. Predator: Thrill of the Hunt (Aliens Vs.

Taking Carr as his core, Stoppard spins this historical coincidence into a masterful and riotously funny play, a speculative portrait of what could have been the meeting of these profoundly influential men in a germinal Europe as seen through the lucid, lurid, faulty, and wholly riveting memory of an aging Henry Carr.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j6tLvDy2yEQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Count on Golf","description":"Jimmy, the golfing bear, counts his equipment as he prepares to play in a golf tournament.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lIkKAAAACAAJ&dq=Count+on+Golf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historical Greek coins (Argonaut library of antiquities)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sCR6ygEACAAJ&dq=Historical+Greek+coins+(Argonaut+library+of+antiquities)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","description":"Do you feel stuck in life, not knowing how to make it more successful?

Born into an aristocratic family in 1875, his life spanned two centuries and nine decades of personal, social and political change, and it is against this background that Stuart Ball, a leading historian of modern British politics, discusses the remarkable ups and downs of Churchill's career. After election to Parliament in 1900, Churchill rose quickly to high military and political office. But he changed parties twice, bringing his character and judgment into question, and during the 1930s he became politically isolated. His warnings of the need to deter Hitler were largely ignored and it was only after the failure of appeasement in 1939 that his reputation rose again. As a much-admired war-time prime minister and subsequently, during the Cold War, he traveled the globe tirelessly in pursuit of alliances and dtente between America and Russia. This concise biography is extensively illustrated with photographs, cartoons and documents, including personal correspondence, reflecting Churchill's dedication to literature, art and family alongside his tremendous public achievements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vxgVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Mothers+Who+Kill+Their+Children:+Understanding+the+Acts+of+Moms+from+Susan+Smith+to+the+%22Prom+Mom%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Place Maybard","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I4iBNQAACAAJ&dq=Quiet+Place+Maybard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utterly Me, Clarice Bean","description":"When someone steals the winner's trophy for the school book project, Clarice emulates her favorite book heroine, Ruby Redfort the detective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MlQ1MbBPZkAC&dq=Utterly+Me,+Clarice+Bean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the First Maine cavalry, 1861-1865","description":"Eight companies of the First D.C.

Can having faith really change your life? Is hope still alive in today's chaotic world? Does God truly love us? You may find the answers to these questions and other situations in your life through the inspirational poetry in this book. \\"Believe\\" takes you on a journey of vivid imagery through poetry to enrich, inspire, and minister to your soul. After all, poetry paints with words the same way an artist does with oils, creating images on blank paper. For me, writing these poems helped to ward off self-pity following an auto accident that left me confined to a wheelchair paralyzed from the waist down, secluded for a time. Now, through the poetry in this book, I hope to show readers from teens through seniors the healing power of faith.

It is a book by and about a sportswriter who grew up near Ebbets Field, and who had the good fortune in the 1950s to cover the Dodgers for the Herald Tribune. This is a book about what happened to Jackie, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, and the others when their glory days were behind them. In short, it is a book fathers and sons and about the making of modern America. 'At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams.' Sentimental because it holds such promise, and bittersweet because that promise is past, the first sentence of this masterpiece of sporting literature, first published in the early '70s, sets its tone. The team is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTrLAgAAQBAJ&dq=Boys+of+Summer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Spanish Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MMyBzQEACAAJ&dq=Business+Spanish+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sages","description":"The Sages is the first work from the influential rabbi Binyamin Lau to appear in English.

The New Yorker \\"If I had a talent for anything, it was a talent for knowing who was talented.\\" Mike Medavoy is a Hollywood rarity: a studio executive who, though never far from controversy, has remained well loved and respected through four decades of moviemaking. What further sets him apart is his role in bringing to the screen some of the most acclaimed Oscar-winning films of our time: Apocalypse Now, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, and Sleepless in Seattle are just some of the projects he green-lighted at United Artists, Orion, TriStar, his own Phoenix Pictures. \\"The ultimate lose-lose situation for a studio executive: to wind up with a commercial bomb and a bad movie.\\" Of course, there are the box office disasters, and the films, as Medavoy says, \\"for which I should be shot.\\" They, too, have a place in his fascinating memoir -- a pull-no-punches account of financial and political maneuvering, and of working with the industry's brightest star power, including Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, Meg Ryan, and countless others. \\"Putting together the elements of a film is a succession of best guesses.\\" Medavoy speaks out on how movie studio buyouts have stymied the creative process and brought an end to the \\"hands-off\\" golden age of filmmaking. An eyewitness to Hollywood history in the making, he gives a powerful and poignant view of the past and future of a world he knows intimately.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe4nFeemPMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Soldier's Story: From Ottoman Rule to Independent Iraq: The Memoirs of Jafar Al-Aksari","description":"The Memoirs of Jafar Pasha Al-Askari shed a vivid light on the early days of Arab nationalism and on the creation of modern Iraq in the 1920s and 1930s, as experienced by one of the prime movers of Iraqi independence. They provide a timely reminder of the all but insuperable obstacles to be overcome in building an open Iraqi state, and add much fuel to the ongoing debate about the Arabs' quest to shape their own political destiny. Born in Mosul in 1885, Jafar Al-Askari played a colourful part in the events that led to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Physically large and courageous, with a sharp intellect, a talent for languages, and a jovial and commanding personality, he was sent for military training in Germany before the War, and was rapidly recognised by the Young Turks as a gifted military commander. He was however also strongly drawn to the Arab nationalist ideas then current, and the consistent theme of his career was his intense Arab patriotism. As one of the youngest generals in the Ottoman Army, he led the Sanusi regular forces in Cyrenaica in 1915-16. His capture by the British and incarceration in Cairo led to an abortive - and comical - escape attempt, and also to cordial relations with various British officers, among them T. E. Lawrence. In Cairo he realised that the Arab cause might best be served by Sharif Hussain of Makkah's revolt against Ottoman rule, then getting under way with British support. He was released in March 1917 to take command of the Arab regular forces fighting under the Amir Faisal bin Hussain (later King Faisal I of Iraq) in the Hijaz. Jafar describes his leading role in the Arab Revolt at length. His achievement was to shape and inspire an effective force of Arab regulars to form the core of Amir Faisal's army. Co-operating with Lawrence and the bedouin irregulars, they disrupted Turkish communications along the desert flank of Allenby's northward advance through Palestine. By the end of the War Jafar had accomplished the rare feat of having been decorated by both the Germans and the British. In 1919, Faisal appointed Jafar Military Governor of Aleppo. He became one of the first members of the new Iraqi government under the British Mandate, and spent the remainder of his life serving his King and country as Prime Minister (twice), Minister of Defence (five times), and Iraqi Minister in London, where he also found time to be called to the Bar (at Gray's Inn). Jafar Pasha was assassinated outside Baghdad in 1936, on a doomed quest to forestall Iraq's first military coup. He had not by then completed his Memoirs, which break off in 1919 at Aleppo. Material describing the remainder of his career is given in the Epilogue and Appendices. Jafar's Memoirs, published here in English for the first time, give a colourful demonstration of how much one gifted individual can achieve in a single lifetime, even one so tragically cut short.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4Q_AQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Soldier%27s+Story:+From+Ottoman+Rule+to+Independent+Iraq:+The+Memoirs+of+Jafar+Al-Aksari&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Things I'Ve Had to Learn over and over and over (Plus a Few Minor Discoveries)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_FK0Jyo-RVcC&dq=Things+I%27Ve+Had+to+Learn+over+and+over+and+over+(Plus+a+Few+Minor+Discoveries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educating Your Child in Modern Times","description":"Educating Children is a translation and commentary of a classical Arabic poem about bringing up children.

Pearl Harbor changed all that. In 1942 he enlisted in the Navy and, for the next three years, fought in a war that transformed him, the nation, and the world. From that time Furey has fashioned this superbly written memoir that follows him from his stateside training, his service as an air crewman on a patrol bomber, his long recovery from a fiery plane crash, all the way to his poignant homecoming. Along with harrowing accounts of air actions over the South Pacific and grim descriptions of wounded men in hospitals, Going Back includes many vividly portrayed characters and offers remarkable insight. Readers will long remember such men as Lieutenant Morrison, the man whose small gesture forged an intense camaraderie among his crew, and Murphy, the Marine whose humor helped dull the pain of Furey's wounds. Nor will they soon forget the author's reflections on the fate that history held for him, his friends, and all those who came of age with him, or his stunning evocation of a period of great national change. Going Back provides a colorful and honest recollection of the war years and addresses such timeless themes as loyalty, humor, family, and profound loss.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0nZv6SI2cUsC&dq=Going+Back:+A+Navy+Airman+in+the+Pacific+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","description":"Lestat.

Ekins vividly details the innermost desires and the varied practices of males who wear the clothes of women for the pleasure it gives them (cross-dressers), or who wish to change sex and are actively going about it (sex-changers). This unique and fascinating book transforms an area of study previously dominated by clinical models to look instead at cross-dressing and sex-changing as a highly variable social process. Giving precedence to the processual and ermergent nature of much cross-dressing and sex-changing phenomena, the book traces the phased femaling career path of the 'male femaler' from 'beginning femaling' through to 'consolidating femaling'. Based upon seventeen years of fieldwork, life history work, qualitative analysis, archival work and contact with several thousand cross-dressers and sex-changers, the book meticulously and systematically develops a theory of 'male femaling' which has major ramifications for both the field of 'transvestism' and 'transsexualism', and for the analysis of sex and gender more generally. Male-Femaling provides social and cultural theorists with a lively case study for the generation of new theory. Social psychologists and sociologists interested in seeing grounded theory applied to a particular case study will be well rewarded. It will be essential reading for students of gender studies who seek to explore the interrelations between sex, sexuality and gender from the informants' point of view.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2LKIAgAAQBAJ&dq=Male+Femaling:+A+grounded+theory+approach+to+cross-dressing+and+sex-changing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amphibians & Reptiles of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks","description":"Amphibians and reptiles thrive in New Mexico's many landscapes and varied environments.

Managing Risk in Construction Projects offers practical guidance on identifying, assessing and managing risk and provides a sound basis for effective decision-making in conditions of uncertainty.

It discusses a number of general concepts, including projects, project phases, and risk attitude before introducing various risk management techniques.

However, to avoid them is to miss their messages of hope and faith for today's Christians living in a world seemingly engulfed by evil. With easy to understand explanations of why and how apocalyptic literature was written, Dr. Efird strips away the mystery surrounding the strange visions and symbols. Putting them in their proper perspective, he leads the reader to the heart of the biblical writers' very simple message -  God is always in control.  Dr. Efird presents Daniel and Revelation not as mere road maps for the end of the world, but as magnificent biblical literature to give Christians confidence in the supreme majesty and power of God. Excellent for personal or group study with reflective questions for each chapter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yqNKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fludd","description":"Spring/Summer 2000","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zA7aLwGsbbUC&dq=Fludd&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Scrapbook Styles (Memory Makers)","description":"Tips, tricks and techniques from the Memory Makers Masters If you're ready to graduate to a whole new level of scrapbook artistry, Mastering Scrapbook Styles is the resource that can show you how.

Within a year of his death, two posthumous collections were published. At the time of this death, as Leon Stokesbury asserts in his introduction, \\"Stanford was the best poet in America under the age of thirty-five.\\" The Light the Dead See collects the best work from those nine volumes and six previously unpublished poems. In the earlier poems, Stanford creates a world where he could keep childhood alive, deny time and mutability, and place a version of himself at the center of great myth and drama. Later, the denial of time and mutability gives way to an obsessive and familiar confrontation with death. Although Stanford paid an enormous price for his growing familiarity with Death as a presence, the direct address to that presence is a source of much of the striking originality and stunning power in the poetry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rtumzZ-I8gwC&dq=The+Light+the+Dead+See:+The+Selected+Poems+of+Frank+Standford&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polyrhythms: The Musician's Guide","description":"\\"This book is adaptable for all instruments or none at all\\"--P. 3.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6qRRmgEACAAJ&dq=Polyrhythms:+The+Musician%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Evaluative Image of the City","description":"In 1960, Kevin Lynch wrote The Image of the City, which transformed the way design professionals and social scientists dealt with the urban form and design.

Basil Deane explores the score: he shows that Mozart's characters are illuminated here not so much in soliloquies but in their reactions to each other. Composer Stephen Oliver discusses how the comedy exists not just in the words but, essentially, in the music. The full Italian text is given, with a note on the order of scenes in Act Three and the alternative passages Mozart wrote for the 1789 revival. The classic translation of E.J. Dent is an excellent way to get to know the twists and turns of the plot and the stylish wit of da Ponte's innuendos.Contents: A Society Marriage, John Wells; A Musical Commentary, Basil Deane; Music and Comedy in 'The Marriage of Figaro, Stephen Oliver; Beaumarchais's Characters; Le nozze di Figaro: Libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte; The Marriage of Figaro: English version by Edward J.

Best known for his steady-state theory of cosmology, he described a universe with both an infinite past and an infinite future. He coined the phrase 'big bang' to describe the main competing theory, and sustained a long-running, sometimes ill-tempered, and typically public debate with his scientific rivals. He showed how the elements are formed by nuclear reactions inside stars, and explained how we are therefore all formed from stardust. He also claimed that diseases fall from the sky, attacked Darwinism, and branded the famous fossil of the feathered Archaeopteryx a fake. Throughout his career, Hoyle played a major role in the popularization of science. Through his radio broadcasts and his highly successful science fiction novels he became a household name, though his outspokenness and support for increasingly outlandish causes later in life at times antagonized the scientific community. Jane Gregory builds up a vivid picture of Hoyle's role in the ideas, the organization, and the popularization of astronomy in post-war Britain, and provides a fascinating examination of the relationship between a maverick scientist, the scientific establishment, and the public. Through the life of Hoyle, this book chronicles the triumphs, jealousies, rewards, and feuds of a rapidly developing scientific field, in a narrative animated by a cast of colourful astronomers, keeping secrets, losing their tempers, and building their careers here on Earth while contemplating the nature of the stars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7utAxx7PSd0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Amusing Ways to Develop Your Child's Thinking Skills and Creativity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xwBKAAAAYAAJ&dq=101+Amusing+Ways+to+Develop+Your+Child%27s+Thinking+Skills+and+Creativity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nietzsche's New Seas: Explorations in Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Politics","description":"Nietzsche's New Seas makes available for the first time in English a representative sample of the best recent Nietzsche scholarship from Germany, France, and the United States.

It has a structure with long conversations and extended debates, and much of its content is not found elsewhere. Jesus' relationship to the Father and his teaching on the Holy Spirit are given special prominence. Ultimately, faith, believing in Jesus, is at the centre- with signs highlighted to provoke faith, and stories of those who responded to Jesus as examples of faith. Colin Kruse ably shows how the Fourth Gospel weaves its themes of belief and unbelief into its rich Christology. The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world's most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable, and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series. These Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date, and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tQo9MQAACAAJ&dq=John+(Tyndale+New+Testament+Commenta)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valentine to a Flying Mouse","description":"During preparations for the fourth grade Valentine party, Tammy meets the wheelchair-bound owner of the local bookstore who helps her learn to cope with her parents' separation and to believe in herself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6eqnI9vtu9wC&dq=Valentine+to+a+Flying+Mouse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","description":"Journal of a Trapper is one of the most important first hand accounts of the mountain man era. In it, Russell provides a detailed narrative describing the day-to-day life of an ordinary trapper in the Rocky Mountains. The Journal begins when Russell hired on with Nathaniel Wyeth's second expedition to the west. He participated in the establishment of Fort Hall, and later became a free trapper. He trapped for nine years in the greater Yellowstone region before leaving the mountains to settle in Oregon.Osborne Russell (1814 - August 2, 1892) was a mountain man and politician who helped form the government of the U.S. state of Oregon. He was born in Maine.Russell first came to the Oregon Country in 1834 as a member of Nathaniel J. Wyeth's second expedition. He returned to the country in 1842 with the Elijah White party. He participated in the May 2, 1843 Champoeg Meeting, voting in favor of forming a government. In October of that year he was selected by the First Executive Committee to serve as the supreme judge for the Provisional Government of Oregon and served until May 14, 1844. In 1844, he was elected to the second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon. He was allied with the group that planned to create an independent Republic of the Pacific and thus was unsuccessful in his run for governor of the Provisional Government in 1845, losing to George Abernethy. Russell eventually went to California.Although not published until well after the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, Osborne's Journal of a Trapper contains an early description of the Lamar Valley or Osborne's Secluded Valley in Yellowstone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3glTMQAACAAJ&dq=Osborne+Russell%27s+Journal+of+a+trapper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rapture of the Deep: The Art of Ray Troll","description":"A celebration of the author's artistic vision offers a vivid retrospective of the artist's legendary works, as well as the author's commentary on the thought and inspiration behind his art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FHRtdqlM4LYC&dq=Rapture+of+the+Deep:+The+Art+of+Ray+Troll&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outwitting Clutter: 101 Ingenious Space-Saving Tips and Ideas to Make Any House or Apartment More Livable","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zH9YAAAAMAAJ&dq=Outwitting+Clutter:+101+Ingenious+Space-Saving+Tips+and+Ideas+to+Make+Any+House+or+Apartment+More+Livable&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plays, Vol. 2: Guiding Star / Hushable Mountain / Out in the Open (v. 2)","description":"Three stories starring Golden Age heroes and featuring existential themes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eVsaygEACAAJ&dq=Plays,+Vol.+2:+Guiding+Star+/+Hushable+Mountain+/+Out+in+the+Open+(v.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Profits of Extermination: Big Mining in Colombia","description":"The extractive sector is a particular area of expertise for Canada and more than half of Canada s mining assets abroad are located in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Colombia.

Using Colombia as a case study, James Rochlin and his international and multidisciplinary line up of Canadian and Colombian scholars, and activists working in the area of human rights, and the judiciary explore: What is the best way to identify and operationalize for mutual benefit the concentric space between the interests of extractive corporations in profit and security, on the one hand, and the interests of the host communities in the promotion of human rights and human security, on the other? What can the four emblematic and diverse cases in Colombia (Meta, Sergovia, Marmato, and Bolivar/La Guajira) tell us about how to fine tune and improve a newly implemented governmental HRIA to render it an increasingly useful global instrument to promote simultaneously corporate security and human security for host communities? What is the most efficient and effective way to design and implement Corporate Social Responsibility Programs in a manner that promotes simultaneously corporate security and community human security?

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s she was 'a devout advocate of poetry' believing that 'to go to poetry is the most ambitious act of the mind'. Her subsequent renunciation of poetry in the 1940s gave rise to bemusement. Jack Blackmore tackles the causes of the neglect of Riding's poetry and establishes new and productive approaches to the poems. His close readings of fifteen poems demonstrate the progress of Collected Poems and the remarkable range and scope of her poetry. He establishes both the strength and unity of the poems and the continuity between them and her 'post-poetic' work, in particular her spiritual testament The Telling.

XIV Panzer Korps was to make a stand there, holding up the advancing US 5th Army - two thirds American, one third British - whilst Cassino was being fortified. If the 5th Army broke through Mignano Gap before Cassino's fortifications were really strong, Allied armour would smash its way through the town and go on to take Rome. Drawing on the memories of veterans who fought at Mignano Gap, and on extensive archive research, this book presents a wide-ranging account of this major battle, and describes how close the 5th Army came to making the crucial breakthrough. The author served with the Green Jackets in World War II and his 1969 publication, \\"The Recollections of Rifleman Bowlby\\", was republished 20 years later.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e2x-AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Inquiry: Questioning Strategies for K-6 Classrooms","description":"Asking questions is one of the most essential functions of teaching. In this book, the authors Nancy Lee Cecil and Jeanne Pfeifer show teachers how to develop both their own questioning skills and those of their students. The authors explain how to model provocative, open-ended questions, and provides many useful teacher- and student-directed questioning strategies. From these strategies, children learn how to ask questions that enable them to construct their own meaning from what they read and experience. This revised edition includes several new questioning strategies. In addition, many of the strategies found in the original edition have been updated and/or expanded to reflect today's best practices in educaiton. The Art of Inquiry is divided into two sections. Part I identifies the many types of questions and the thinking skills they promote (such as knowledge, comprehesion, analysis, and evaluation), and discusses how to foster the free flow of questions and anwers. Part II provides practical questioning strategies and activities (for example, Polar Opposite, Think Aloud, and Self-Instruction) that stimulate the highest critical and creative thinking skills. The authors also show how asking the right questions can help children to understand content, learn to ask effective questions of themselves, and make clear connections between diverse thoughts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6cqe7Bi9HkUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linguistics (Oxford Introductions to Language Study)","description":"This work investigates real-world problems involving language.

But despite one's good intentions, the life-enhancing abundance heaped on our children often becomes more than they need or can handle, and the line is crossed into overindulgence. In How Much is Enough?, best-selling parenting and family experts Clarke, Dawson, and Bredehoft offer an in-depth look at how damaging overindulgence is to children, affecting their ability to learn many of the important life skills they need to thrive as adults. In warm and empathetic language, the authors reveal the three different ways children are overindulged (giving too much, being over-nurturing, and providing soft structure), guide parents in determining whether they're doing something overindulgent, and show them how to do things differently. The truth is that overindulgence is not the badge of a bad parent; in fact, it comes directly from having a good and generous heart. Based on solid, groundbreaking research involving 1,200 parents and their children, How Much is Enough? gives parents the insight and advice they need to parent in an effective and loving way and put their children on track for a happy and successful life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hp-OswEACAAJ&dq=How+Much+Is+Enough%3F:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+to+Steer+Clear+of+Overindulgence+and+Raise+Likeable,+Responsible+and+Respectful+Ch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outwitting Contractors: The Complete Guide to Surviving Your Home or Apartment Renovation","description":"Tells how to avoid some of the pitfalls of remodeling and offers advice on dealing with architects, contractors, builders, laborers, and inspectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xUNBSXhO_3cC&dq=Outwitting+Contractors:+The+Complete+Guide+to+Surviving+Your+Home+or+Apartment+Renovation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cape Light (Cape Light Series, Book 1)","description":"A heartwarming novel from America's most popular living artist journeys to the picturesque village of Cape Light on the coast of New England, a hamlet populated by colorful inhabitants who share a strong sense of community and caring for their neighbors.

Whether through escaped captivity or purposeful release, many of these parrots are now breeding in new habitats. Indeed, no less than 75 species of parrots have established breeding populations in countries where they were introduced, and parrots are now among the most widely distributed group of birds. Naturalized Parrots of the World is the first book to examine this specific avian population. Bringing together the work of leading researchers in one convenient volume, this book explores the biology of naturalized parrots and their interactions with native ecosystems. Experts discuss the global distribution of parrots, their genetics, conservation implications, and human responses to these birds. They also consider debates surrounding management issues and the lack of consensus around nonnative species in the wild. Later chapters feature case studies of the two most successful species the Rose-ringed Parakeet and Monk Parakeet as well as studies of the introduced parrot species located in specific countries and regions, including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, northern Europe, South Africa, and Australia. Highlighting critical aspects of conservation biology and biodiversity, Naturalized Parrots of the World will be an invaluable resource for parrot owners, ornithologists, conservation biologists, and birdwatchers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kcUZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When I was Jersey","description":"Mobsters. Big hair. The smelly Turnpike. The poor cousin of its glittering neighbor Manhattan. Could that really be all there is to New Jersey? In Living on the Edge of the World, the best and brightest young writers from the much maligned state answer back with edgy, irreverent pieces of nonfiction paying tribute to New Jersey's unique place in the cultural consciousness. Like a drive along the Garden State Parkway, their stories travel to just about every corner of the state, from Princeton and Hillside to Camden and Hoboken. In \\"Straight Outta Garwood,\\" Tom Perrotta writes of the near inescapability of returning to his home state again and again in his novels; in \\"Exit 15W,\\" Joshua Braff tells how all roads led back to the Jersey Girl he'd fallen for as a seventh-grader; Kathleen DeMarco takes a nostalgic look at her grandfather's cranberry bog in \\"The Family Farm\\"; Jonathan Ames recounts a failed attempt to consummate his flirtation with a boardwalk beauty in \\"Rose of the Jersey Shore\\"; and Frederick Reiken offers an elegy to a high-rise in Fort Lee that opens his eyes to a new, dangerous world. A celebration of all that's weird and wonderful about the Garden State -- including Bruce Springsteen, the Nets, the Jersey Devil, the films of Kevin Smith, and Great Adventure -- Living on the Edge of the World will have New Jerseyans everywhere ready to stand and be counted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=USObjGsiaa8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Runic States: The Shamanic Perception of Quantum Realities","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OyizYWZvikcC&dq=Runic+States:+The+Shamanic+Perception+of+Quantum+Realities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Review text in preliminary mathematics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IYh7AAAACAAJ&dq=Review+text+in+preliminary+mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appreciative Team Building: Positive Questions to Bring Out the Best of Your Team","description":"Appreciative Team Building: Positive Questions to Bring Out the Best of Your Team provides your team with everything it needs to discover the keys to past successes and future possibilities.

Likened by many to Gibraltar and Malta, the colony was a vital but vulnerable link in imperial strategy, exposed to a succession of enemies in a turbulent age and a troubled region. This book examines Hong Kong s developing role in the Victorian imperial defence system, the emerging challenges from Russia, France, the United States, Germany, Japan and other powers, and preparations in the years leading up to the Second World War. A detailed chapter offers new interpretations of the Battle of Hong Kong of 1941, when the colony succumbed to the Japanese invasion. The remaining chapters discuss Hong Kong s changing strategic role during the Cold War and the winding down of the military presence. The book not only focuses on policies and events, but also explores the social life of the garrison in Hong Kong, the struggles between military and civil authorities, and relations between the armed forces and civilians in Hong Kong. Drawing on original research in archives around the world, including English, Japanese, and Chinese sources, this is the first full-length study of the defence of Hong Kong from the beginning of the colonial period to the end of British military interests East of Suez in 1970. Illustrated with images and detailed maps, Eastern Fortress will be of interest to both students of history and general readers. Kwong Chi Man is an assistant professor in the History Department of Hong Kong Baptist University. Tsoi Yiu Lun teaches history and liberal studies at Mu Kuang English School, Hong Kong.  Armed with a range of declassified archives many of them unpublished Kwong and Tsoi expertly weave together military, political, social, and economic history to show how Hong Kong played a strategic role in East Asia and the British Empire from the early 1840s to the 1970s. Eastern Fortress is a must-read for anyone interested in Hong Kong and its history.   John Carroll, author of A Concise History of Hong Kong and Edge of Empires: Chinese Elites and British Colonials in Hong Kong  This careful and well-written study does a difficult balancing act very well indeed. It connects the military history of Hong Kong to both the general Hong Kong experience and the wider military history of the region and beyond. Weaving its way with confidence from archive to library, from grand strategy to battlefield, this volume provides what we have long needed. Hong Kong s experience was unique, but at the same time it was integrally connected to the wider circles of empire, region, and Asia. Nothing brings that trajectory out more strongly than the military dimension, and by ranging from the Opium War to the Cold War, with a critical eye, this volume does that story justice. It is the capstone that brings together a generation of good scholarship on the military history of Hong Kong.

And so, in a series of letters, she takes  Oma  on this great adventure with her family . . . and takes us as readers. Sometimes the letters are dark with discouragement, for the Von Scholls find, as did many German-Texas families, that the Society for the Protection of German Emigrants, known as the Adelsverein, was unable to fulfill its promises of land, housing, horses, and farm implements. But they are Germans, determined and willing to work hard. More often these letters and the text woven in between them are bright with adventure, for Tina finds Texas an exciting, if puzzling, place. There are new customs to learn, new foods to eat, even while the family preserves its traditional German ways.

But MIT Media Lab researcher and technology policy expert Kate Darling argues just the opposite, suggesting that treating robots with a bit of humanity, more like the way we treat animals, will actually serve us better. From a social, legal, and ethical perspective, she shows that our current ways of thinking don t leave room for the robot technology that is soon to become part of our everyday routines. Robots are likely to supplement rather than replace our own skills and relationships. So if we consider our history of incorporating animals into our work, transportation, military, and even families, we actually have a solid basis for how to contend with this future. A deeply original analysis of our technological future and the ethical dilemmas that await us, The New Breed explains how the treatment of machines can reveal a new understanding of our own history, our own systems, and how we relate not just to nonhumans, but also to one another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oTrGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made History","description":"When Skip Strong, the thirty-two-year-old Captain of the 688-foot oil tanker Cherry Valley received the call, all he knew was that an ocean going tug with five men aboard was in distress off Florida's east coast. Caught in an unusually powerful storm, the tug's engines failed, and as the winds gusted to more than sixty miles per hour and the sea whipped into a frenzy, the tug--and the barge it was towing-- were in danger of being swept ashore. Captain Strong also knew that he would follow the age-old tradition of sea rescue. Coming to the aid of the crew, the tug, and its cargo, he would have to maneuver his ship--laden with 10 million gallons of oil-- in extremely hazardous conditions. One mistake and Strong would be responsible for an ecological disaster on Florida's beaches equal to that of the Exxon Valdez. What Captain Strong didn't know was that the tug was carrying a 150-foot aluminum fuel cell worth upwards of $50 million.

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Set in post-apartheid South Africa, J. M. Coetzee s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. But when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced. Lurie pursues his relationship with the young Melanie whom he describes as having hips  as slim as a twelve-year-old s  obsessively and narcissistically, ignoring, on one occasion, her wish not to have sex. When Melanie and her father lodge a complaint against him, Lurie is brought before an academic committee where he admits he is guilty of all the charges but refuses to express any repentance for his acts. In the furor of the scandal, jeered at by students, threatened by Melanie s boyfriend, ridiculed by his ex-wife, Lurie is forced to resign and flees Cape Town for his daughter Lucy s smallholding in the country. There he struggles to rekindle his relationship with Lucy and to understand the changing relations of blacks and whites in the new South Africa. But when three black strangers appear at their house asking to make a phone call, a harrowing afternoon of violence follows which leaves both of them badly shaken and further estranged from one another. After a brief return to Cape Town, where Lurie discovers his home has also been vandalized, he decides to stay on with his daughter, who is pregnant with the child of one of her attackers. Now thoroughly humiliated, Lurie devotes himself to volunteering at the animal clinic, where he helps put down diseased and unwanted dogs. It is here, Coetzee seems to suggest, that Lurie gains a redeeming sense of compassion absent from his life up to this point. Written with the austere clarity that has made J. M. Coetzee the winner of two Booker Prizes, Disgrace explores the downfall of one man and dramatizes, with unforgettable, at times almost unbearable, vividness the plight of a country caught in the chaotic aftermath of centuries of racial oppression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zVFpDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With a Little Luck","description":"Facing her romantic prospects with skepticism after two disappointing relationships, successful DJ Berry Lambert, who believes bad things occur in threes, expects a rapid dissolution to her next love affair and is surprised by her attraction to an outspoken, commitment-minded rival.

Six rounds later Ali was not only the new world heavyweight boxing champion: He was \\"a new kind of black man\\" who would shortly transform America's racial politics, its popular culture, and its notions of heroism. No one has captured Ali--and the era that he exhilarated and sometimes infuriated--with greater vibrancy, drama, and astuteness than David Remnick, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lenin's Tomb (and editor of The New Yorker). In charting Ali's rise from the gyms of Louisville, Kentucky, to his epochal fights against Liston and Floyd Patterson, Remnick creates a canvas of unparalleled richness. He gives us empathetic portraits of wisecracking sportswriters and bone-breaking mobsters; of the baleful Liston and the haunted Patterson; of an audacious Norman Mailer and an enigmatic Malcolm X. Most of all, King of the World does justice to the speed, grace, courage, humor, and ebullience of one of the greatest athletes and irresistibly dynamic personalities of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The hunters","description":"Captain Cleve Connell has already made a name for himself among pilots when he arrives in Korea during the war there to fly the newly operational F86 fighters against the Soviet MIGs. His goal, like that of every fighter pilot, is to chalk up enough kills to become an ace. But things do not turn out as expected. Mission after mission proves fruitless, and Connell finds his ability and his stomach for combat questioned by his fellow airmen: the brash wing commander, Imil; Captain Robey, an ace whose record is suspect; and finally, Lieutenant Pell, a cocky young pilot with an uncanny amount of skill and luck. Disappointment and fear gradually erode Connell's faith in himself, and his dream of making ace seems to slip out of reach. Then suddenly, one dramatic mission above the Yalu River reveals the depth of his courage and honor. Originally published in 1956, The Hunters was James Salter's first novel. Based on his own experiences as a fighter pilot in the Korean War, it is a classic of wartime fiction. Now revised by the author and back in print on the sixtyfifth anniversary of the Air Force, the story of Cleve Connell's war flies straight into the heart of men's rivalries and fears.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pd0REAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebra (Actualites scientifiques et industrielles)","description":"It is by no means clear what comprises the \\"heart\\" or \\"core\\" of algebra, the part of algebra which every algebraist should know.

Of course, the selection is partly based on personal preferences, and we ask you for your understanding if some selections do not meet your taste (for unknown reasons, we only had problems in the chapter \\"Groups\\" to get enough articles in time).

So the target group consists of anyone interested in algebra, from graduate students to established researchers, including those who want to obtain a quick overview or a better understanding of our selected topics.

Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called The Long Week-End. Now they embarked on this new project,  a handbook for writers of English Prose,  to be called The Reader Over Your Shoulder. The world was in total upheaval. Graves had already fled Majorca three years earlier at the start of the Spanish Civil War. As they labored over their new writing project, Graves and Hodge witnessed the fall of France and the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk. In early September 1940 began the bombing of London by the German Luftwaffe, a concentrated effort to destroy the resolve of the English people. Graves s and Hodge s idea was simple enough: at a time when their whole world was falling apart, the survival of English prose sentences, of writing that was clear, concise, intelligible, had become paramount if hope were going to survive the onslaught. They came up with forty-one principles for writing, the majority devoted to clarity, the remainder to grace of expression. They studied the prose of a wide range of noted authors and leaders, finding much room for improvement. Quoting grammarian and bestselling author Patricia T. O Conner from her new introduction,  With a new war to be won, the kingdom couldn t afford careless, sloppy English. Good communication was critical.  The book they would write would turn out to be one of the most erudite, and at the same time one of the most spontaneous and inspired, ever to take on the challenge of writing well. O Conner in her introduction describes The Reader Over Your Shoulder as nothing less than  the best book on writing ever published.  The present edition restores, for the first time in three-quarters of a century, the original, 1943, text, which in subsequent printings and editions had been shortened by over 150 pages, including much of the heart of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reader+over+your+Shoulder:+A+Handbook+for+Writers+of+English+Prose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las claves de las vanguardias artsticas del siglo XX","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkwkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Las+claves+de+las+vanguardias+artsticas+del+siglo+XX&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comrades in Business: Post-Liberation Politics in South Africa","description":"This taboo-breaking study of the New South Africa was published byTafelberg in South Africa earlier this year, and now, worldwide by International Books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A9QwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Comrades+in+Business:+Post-Liberation+Politics+in+South+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ASPIRIN AGE.","description":"A collection of twenty-two short stories that explore the events that shaped the lives of Americans in the years between the two world wars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m7giAAAAMAAJ&dq=THE+ASPIRIN+AGE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theatrical Juggernaut: The Psyche of the Star","description":" This book may be just the antidote for an actor who has completely lost faith or given up control over his destiny.

CNN s Wolf Blitzer  To make it big, you need the Real Deal. Mr. Mann is the Real Deal.   Jay Conrad Levinson, author of the Guerrilla Marketing series of books This book is unlike any other you will read on the subject of acting. It is not about how to find good headshots, how to perfect a monologue, or how to find an agent, though these subjects are indirectly touched upon. It s about how to succeed in the arts. It's about why 99% of aspiring professional actors fail to even get their foot in the door, and how the other 1% somehow do get their foot in the door... and actually stay there. Once and for all, this book aims to shatter the absurd notion that acting professionally is a privilege for only a select few, and that without a 'break' given by the industry, there is no hope for success. The blame for your failure (and the credit for your success) can only be put on yourself, and not the business. Forget the nay-sayers; wave goodbye to the critics; laugh at the agents who won't respond to you.

Although challenges to Christianity are perennial and have frequently been addressed, they are noticeably more common today and are currently of particular interest among evangelicals. Skeptics of Christianity often ask highly regarded biblical scholar and popular speaker Craig Blomberg how he can believe in a faith that seems so problematic. How can God allow evil and suffering? Isn't the Bible anti-women, anti-gay, and pro-slavery? Isn't the New Testament riddled with contradictions? What about the nature of hell, violence in Scripture, and prayer and predestination? Following the author's successful Can We Still Believe the Bible?, this succinct and readable book focuses on what the New Testament teaches about 10 key reasons people give for not believing in God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=99XIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electric Machinery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t-1IzwEACAAJ&dq=Electric+Machinery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prisoners of the Witchaliks","description":"A freak snow storm makes it possible for adventurous young Helen, and her dog Nora, to cross an otherwise impassable ridge into a land unknown to her friends and family.

Is there a connection between feminine, masculine, lesbian, heterosexual, between desire and liberation? How many ways can the body's sex vary---by chromosomes, hormones, genitals? How many ways can our gender expressions multiply---between home and work, at the computer and when we kiss someone, in our dreams and when we walk down the street? What is our dream of who we want to be? Pratt's stories are part of new theory appearing at the intersections---of the feminism of U.S. women's liberation, the writings of women of color in the U.S. and internationally, the queer ideas of lesbian and gay liberation, and the emerging thought of transgender liberation.

An epic history of the decline of American military leadership from the bestselling author of Fiasco and Churchill and Orwell. While history has been kind to the American generals of World War II Marshall, Eisenhower, Patton, and Bradley it has been less kind to the generals of the wars that followed, such as Koster, Franks, Sanchez, and Petraeus. In The Generals, Thomas E. Ricks sets out to explain why that is. In chronicling the widening gulf between performance and accountability among the top brass of the U.S. military, Ricks tells the stories of great leaders and suspect ones, generals who rose to the occasion and generals who failed themselves and their soldiers. In Ricks s hands, this story resounds with larger meaning: about the transmission of values, about strategic thinking, and about the difference between an organization that learns and one that fails.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MbxvDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Generals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"101 Ways to Beat the Blues","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aXtRPgBQLX4C&dq=101+Ways+to+Beat+the+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Gallant Horses","description":"Illustrated stories of champion racing horses.

There has emerged clearly the idea that physical theories are significantly characterized by their abstract mathematical structure. This is in opposition to the tradi tional opinion that one should look to the specific applications of a theory in orrter to understand it. One might with reason now espouse the view that to understand the deeper character of a theory one must know its abstract structure and understand the significance of that structure, while to understand how a theory might be modified in light of its experimental inadequacies one must be intimately acquainted with how it is applied. Quantum theory itself has gone through a development this century which illustrates strikingly the shifting perspective. From a collection of intuitive physical manoeuvers under Bohr, through a formative stage in which the mathematical framework was bifurcated (between Schrodinger and Heisenberg) to an elegant culmination in von Neumann's Hilbert space formulation, the elementary theory moved, flanked even at this later stage by the ill-understood formalisms for the relativistic version and for the field-theoretic alternative; after that we have a gradual, but constant, elaboration of all these quantal theories as abstract mathematical structures (their point of departure being von Neumann's formalism) until at the present time theoretical work is heavily preoccupied with the manipulation of purely abstract structures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HNtK5Go6g4AC&dq=The+Logico-algebraic+approach+to+quantum+mechanics+(The+University+of+Western+Ontario+series+in+philosophy+of+science+%3B+v.+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby, It's Cold (Robin Miller Mysteries)","description":"As a bitter winter grips New York City, Private Investigator Robin Miller is catapulted on a bone-chilling quest to save a friend's child from a horrifying death.

Financial Times ? New York ? Independent (U.K.) ? Times (U.K.) ? Publishers Weekly ? Library Journal ? Kirkus Reviews ? Booklist ? Globe and Mail Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells taken without her knowledge became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first  immortal  human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta s family did not learn of her  immortality  until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family past and present is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family especially Henrietta s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of Orange","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wVdDtAEACAAJ&dq=The+House+of+Orange&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Switched Local Area Networks","description":"If you re ready to build a large network system, this handy excerpt from Ethernet: The Definitive Guide, Second Edition gets you up to speed on a basic building block: Ethernet switches.

The guiding principle to this synthesis is the tenet that the entirety of our knowledge is encoded by relations, and thus by connections, in neuronal networks of our cerebral cortex. Cognitive networks develop by experience on a base of widely dispersed modular cell assemblies representing elementary sensations and movements. As they develop cognitive networks organize themselves hierarchically by order of complexity or abstraction of their content. Because networks intersect profusely, sharing commong nodes, a neuronal assembly anywhere in the cortex can be part of many networks, and therefore many items of knowledge. All cognitive functions consist of neural transactions within and between cognitive networks. After reviewing the neurobiology and architecture of cortical networks (also named cognits), the author undertakes a systematic study of cortical dynamics in each of the major cognitive functions--perception, memory, attention, language, and intelligence. In this study, he makes use of a large body of evidence from a variety of methodologies, in the brain of the human as well as the nonhuman primate. The outcome of his interdisciplinary endeavor is the emergence of a structural and dynamic order in the cerebral cortex that, though still sketchy and fragmentary, mirrors with remarkable fidelity the order in the human mind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jhtREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lakeland Landscapes (Country)","description":"The English Lake District is one of the most beautiful and unspoilt areas in Britain.

Sixty-five articles provide comprehensive coverage of all the main theorists and approaches.

Narrating Nature brings together various ways of knowing nature from differently situated Maasai and conservation practitioners and scientists into lively debate. It speaks to the growing movement within the academy and beyond on decolonizing knowledge about and relationships with nature, and debates within the social sciences on how to work across epistemologies and ontologies. It also speaks to a growing need within conservation studies to find ways to manage nature with people. This book employs different storytelling practices, including a traditional Maasai oral meeting the enkiguena to decenter conventional scientific ways of communicating about, knowing, and managing nature. Author Mara J. Goldman draws on more than two decades of deep ethnographic and ecological engagements in the semi-arid rangelands of East Africa in landscapes inhabited by pastoral and agropastoral Maasai people and heavily utilized by wildlife. These iconic landscapes have continuously been subjected to boundary drawing practices by outsiders, separating out places for people (villages) from places for nature (protected areas). Narrating Nature follows the resulting boundary crossings that regularly occur of people, wildlife, and knowledge to expose them not as transgressions but as opportunities to complicate the categories themselves and create ontological openings for knowing and being with nature otherwise. Narrating Nature opens up dialogue that counters traditional conservation narratives by providing space for local Maasai inhabitants to share their ways of knowing and being with nature. It moves beyond standard community conservation narratives that see local people as beneficiaries or contributors to conservation, to demonstrate how they are essential knowledgeable members of the conservation landscape itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mVoAEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Nature+Of+Wildlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House Histories: A Guide to Tracing the Genealogy of Your Home","description":"Explains how to establish the history of a house by examining the building style and materials and searching for clues in old documents, and offers suggestions for running a home-based house histories business","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5nTiAAAAMAAJ&dq=House+Histories:+A+Guide+to+Tracing+the+Genealogy+of+Your+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kundalini: The Mother-Power","description":"In route to his own realization, Sri Chinmoy attatined mystery over the kundalini and occult powers.

The various attitudes and patterns of behavior that characterize people who are blind are not inherent in their condition but, rather, are acquired through ordinary processes of social learning. The Making of Blind Men is intended as a systematic and integrated overview of the blindness problem in America. Dr. Scott chronicles which aspects of this problem are being dealt with by organizations for the blind and the effectiveness of this intervention system. He details the potential consequences of blind people becoming clients of blindness agencies by pointing out that many of the attitudes, behavior patterns, and qualities of character that have been assumed to be given to blind people by their condition are, in fact, products of socialization. As the self-concepts of blind men are generated by the same processes of socialization that shape us all, Dr. Scott puts forth the challenge of reforming the organized intervention system by critically evaluating the validity of blindness workers' assumptions about blindness and the blind. It is felt that an enlightened work force can then render the socialization process of the blind into a rational and deliberate force for positive change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gqw0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Today's Hottest Marketplace","description":"While the Foreign Exchange (FOREX) market can be a very profitable place, you must have a firm understanding of how to operate within this environment if you intend on achieving any success.

Scott Fitzgerald's mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby, has come to embody all the glamour and decadence of the Roaring Twenties. Gatsby emerges as if from nowhere, evading questions about his past and throwing dazzling parties sparkling with champagne and jazz at his luxurious Long Island mansion. Nick Carraway, a young man who has moved in next door, is fascinated by his oddly detached neighbor, and by his discovery that Gatsby is motivated by a single-minded quest to regain his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing about the intensity of Gatsby's ambition to reinvent himself. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby's dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result. The Great Gatsby's remarkable staying power, nearly a century after its publication, is owed both to the lyrical freshness of its storytelling and to the way that it illuminates the hollow core of the glittering American dream. Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ax4tEAAAQBAJ&dq=Great+Gatsby+(Everyman)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bay As I See It","description":"A tour guide to the landmarks and interesting sights of San Francisco.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q9tycKW0jlwC&dq=The+Bay+As+I+See+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memento Mori","description":"A group of aging friends realizes that age has not brought wisdom and that they must face death as best they can.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JVH1nQEACAAJ&dq=Memento+Mori&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Folly of Princes","description":"Scotland at the dawn of the 15th century was a wretched spectacle.

It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern thought; it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing, this remarkable book has helped philosophers, writers, speakers, teachers, students, and general readers alike. Mr. Ayers sets up specific tests by which you can easily evaluate statements of ideas. You will also learn how to distinguish ideas that cannot be verified by experience   those expressing religious, moral, or aesthetic experience, those expounding theological or metaphysical doctrine, and those dealing with a priori truth.

It is phenomenal.\\"--Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn't it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent--even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice--the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world's expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave.

Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time? by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit. Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul. At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower. In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.

We are often told that hard work is the key to success. But success isn t about hard work  it s about shortcuts. Shortcuts allow us to solve one problem quickly so that we can tackle an even bigger one. They make us capable of doing great things. And according to Marcus du Sautoy, math is the very art of the shortcut. Thinking Better is a celebration of how math lets us do more with less. Du Sautoy explores how diagramming revolutionized therapy, why calculus is the greatest shortcut ever invented, whether you must really practice for ten thousand hours to become a concert violinist, and why shortcuts give us an advantage over even the most powerful AI. Throughout, we meet artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs who use mathematical shortcuts to change the world. Delightful, illuminating, and above all practical, Thinking Better is for anyone who has wondered why you should waste time climbing the mountain when you could go around it much faster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HR8bEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OoGJPIDVMLkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","description":"An American icon, Joseph Frank  Buster  Keaton is easily acknowledged as one of the greatest filmmakers in early cinema and beyond. His elaborate slapstick made audiences scream with laughter. But, his stone face hid an internal turmoil. In BUSTER KEATON: CUT TO THE CHASE, biographer Marion Meade seamlessly lays out the life and works of this comedy genius who lacked any formal education.  Buster  made his name as a child of vaudeville, thrown around the stage by his father in a cartoon pantomime of very real abuse. The lessons he carried forward from that experience translated into some of the greatest silent films of all time. Keaton wrote, directed, performed, and edited dozens of features and shorts, including his masterpiece, The General. However, those early scars also led to decades of drinking and mistreatment of women. Keaton saw huge successes, Hollywood sex scandals, years of neglect from studios and audiences, and finally a shaky resurrection that assured his place in Hollywood s film canon. Meticulously researched, this book brings together four years of research and hundreds of interviews to paint a nuanced portrait of a compelling artist. No comedy fan or film buff should miss this insider story of the man behind the stone face.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-cIqAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Go Paris (Lets Go City Guides)","description":"Conveniently sized for a pocket, briefcase, or backpack, the redesigned Let's Go Paris Pocket City Guide is an easy-to-use guide contained within a foldout map - a vital resource for residents and tourists alike.

Ever since Perseus cut off her head and presented it to Athena, she has been a woman of many forms: a dangerous female monster that had to be destroyed, an erotic power that could annihilate men, and, thanks to Freud, a woman whose hair was a nest of terrifying penises that signaled castration. She has been immortalized by artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Salvador Dal  and was the emblem of the Jacobins after the French Revolution. Today, she s viewed by feminists as a noble victim of patriarchy and used by Versace in the designer s logo for men s underwear, haute couture, and exotic dinnerware. She even gives her name to a sushi roll on a Disney resort menu. Why does Medusa continue to have this power to transfix us? David Leeming seeks to answer this question in Medusa, a biography of the mythical creature. Searching for the origins of Medusa s myth in cultures that predate ancient Greece, Leeming explores how and why the mythical figure of the gorgon has become one of the most important and enduring ideas in human history. From an oil painting by Caravaggio to Clash of the Titans and Dungeons and Dragons, he delves into the many depictions of Medusa, ultimately revealing that her story is a cultural dream that continues to change and develop with each new era. Asking what the evolution of the Medusa myth discloses about our culture and ourselves, this book paints an illuminating portrait of a woman who has never ceased to enthrall.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vQqIWcgAxhIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern discovery and the Bible","description":"The author has set himself the task of showing that there is no conflict between the assured results of scientific discovery and Bible teaching.

By the summer of 1942 Rommel's German forces were threatening to sweep through the Western Desert and drive on to the Suez Canal, and Britain was in urgent need of military victory. Then, in October, after 12 days of attritional tank battle and artillery bombardment, Montgomery's Eighth Army, with Australians and New Zealanders playing crucial roles in a genuinely international Allied fighting force, broke through the German and Italian lines at El Alamein. It was a turning-point in the war after which, in Churchill's words, \\"we never had a defeat\\". Stephen Bungay's book is as much at home analysing the crucial logistics of keeping desert armies supplied with petrol and tank parts as it is reappraising the combat strategies of Montgomery and Rommel, and ranges widely from the domestic political pressures on Churchill to the aerial siege of Malta, key to the control of the Mediterranean. And in a chapter on \\"The Soldier's War\\", Bungay graphically evokes the phantasmagoric blur of thunderous cannonade and tormenting heat that was the lot of the individual men who actually fought and died in the desert.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9jjLAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","description":"Eighteen science fiction stories deal with love, madness, and death on Mars, Venus, and in space.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-QC3TyfN3zoC&dq=The+Illustrated+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drum Taps (Cameo Classics Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0BPAzgEACAAJ&dq=Drum+Taps+(Cameo+Classics+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring Feelings: Anxiety: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy to Manage Anxiety","description":"Winner of a 2008 Teachers' Choice Award!

How You Can Survive When They're Depressed explores depression from the perspective of those who are closest to the sufferers of this prevalent disorder--spouses, parents, children, and lovers--and gives the successful coping strategies of many people who live with a clinical depressive or manic-depressive and often suffer in silence, believing their own problems have no claim to attention. Depression fallout is the emotional toll on the depressive's family and close friends who are unaware of their own stressful reactions and needs. Sheffield outlines the five stages of depression fallout: confusion, self-doubt, demoralization, anger, and finally, the desire to escape. Many people will find relief in the knowledge that their self-blame, guilt, sadness, and resentment are a natural result of living with a depressed person. Sheffield brings together many real-life examples from the pioneering support group she attends at Beth Israel Medical Center of how people with depression fallout have learned to cope. From setting boundaries to maintaining an outside social life, she gives practical tactics for handling the challenges and emotional stresses on a day-to-day basis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K-9OYhctSCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Criminal Lifestyle: Patterns of Serious Criminal Conduct","description":"What kind of choices does a hardened criminal make?

It also is one of the most fascinating of all animals. For many people, the pronghorn was nearly as much a symbol of the American West as was the bison; for some, it still is. Eliminated from much of its historic range by the early 1900s, this unique North American big game species has experienced a remarkable recovery and now is found throughout the western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. Thirty years in the making, Pronghorn: Ecology and Management contains the most comprehensive information on the behavior, physiology, migration, taxonomy, and management of this extraordinary animal. Full chapters are devoted to distribution, nutrition and food, diseases and parasites, ecosystem management, hunting, and much more. The principal authors--the world's preeminent pronghorn biologists, Bart W. O'Gara and Jim D. Yoakum--conclude with a thorough discussion of the future of pronghorn and their management. With 23 chapters that include contributions by 10 other wildlife professionals and more than 850 illustrations, including original artwork by Edson Fichter and Daniel P.

Sputnik, all of 184 pounds with only a radio transmitter inside its highly polished shell, became the first artificial satellite in space; while it immediately shocked the world, its long-term impact was even greater, for it profoundly changed the shape of the twentieth century. Paul Dickson chronicles the dramatic events and developments leading up to and resulting from Sputnik's launch. Supported by groundbreaking, original research and many declassified documents, Sputnik offers a fascinating profile of the early American and Soviet space programs and a strikingly revised picture of the politics and personalities behind the facade of America's fledgling efforts to get into space. The U.S. public reaction to Sputnik was monumental. In a single weekend, Americans were wrenched out of a mood of national smugness and postwar material comfort. Initial shock at and fear of the Soviets' intentions galvanized the country and swiftly prompted innovative developments that define our world today. Sputnik directly or indirectly influenced nearly every aspect of American life: from an immediate shift toward science in the classroom to the arms race that defined the Cold War, the competition to reach the moon, and the birth of the internet. By shedding new light on a pivotal era, Dickson expands our knowledge of the world we now inhabit and reminds us that the story of Sputnik goes far beyond technology and the beginning of the space age, and that its implications are still being felt today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XODEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plants, Genes, and Crop Biotechnology","description":"This book integrates many fields to help students understand the complexity of the basic science that underlies crop and food production.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UF94McWtLP0C&dq=Plants,+Genes,+and+Crop+Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All About Fibromyalgia: A Guide for Patients and Their Families","description":"Fibromyalgia is a form of chronic neuromuscular pain, a pain-amplification syndrome brought on by abnormal interactions between hormones, the immune system, neurotransmitters, and the autonomic nervous system, that afflicts six million Americans every year. Often misdiagnosed, and widely misunderstood, the majority of patients are turned away from doctors or treated for depression. This guide offers expert advice to sufferers of this painful syndrome and gives them the education they need to get the help they require but rarely get. In their earlier books, Making Sense of Fibromyalgia and All About Fibromyalgia, noted medical writer Janice Wallace and Dr. Daniel Wallace, a leading expert on this disorder, provided comprehensive guides--for both patients and professionals--to this little known and poorly understood syndrome. Now, in Fibromyalgia, the Wallaces provide an inviting and succinct version of the syndrome they have studied, laid out in clear and accessible language. The authors provide a clear, concise explanation of the syndrome and its symptoms, and also outline the recent advances in treatments. Fibromyalgia addresses a desperate need for concise, accessible information on this syndrome and offers reassurance to patients and their families.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ak5nDAAAQBAJ&dq=All+About+Fibromyalgia:+A+Guide+for+Patients+and+Their+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Release Your Potential: Using Your Gifts in a Thriving Womens Ministry","description":"Getting involved in the local church can be an intimidating process for anyone; but women experience this in a unique way.

The Orillia Spirit: Muddling through Canada s first, and hilarious, experiment with daylight savings time, Mayor  Daylight Bill  Frost had it. Creating his own money and dreaming a drainage ditch would become a tourist attraction, Mayor Ben Johnson had it. Taking his town s electric company by force, Mayor J.B. Tudhope had it. Inventing early forms of medicare and the first RVs, dreaming of universities and folk festivals, battling for decades over liquor and rinks, ordinary people had it. Something about the place immortalized in Stephen Leacock s classic Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town has always inspired its people to reach for their dreams. Turn-of-the-twentieth-century leaders coined the phrase  the Orillia Spirit  to describe their drive to make the town a social, moral, and economic leader of Canada. The results have been comic, tragic, and heroic, as shown in this colourful history of Orillia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bo1ODQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Funny Money Game","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xF8sAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Funny+Money+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels of Grace (Continuums Icons)","description":"Annotation.

Nowhere, perhaps, did they echo with more persistence and poignancy than at the place where it happened, the Kent State University campus. For more than ten years the university's name has been a symbol of the Sixties protest movements as the causes of the event were debated, lawsuits embroiled participants and victims, and concerned people struggled for appropriate means for remembrance and commemoration--each issue leading to further, if less violent, arguments, demonstrations and confrontations. The May 4 episode has been recounted many times, in many ways. The events of the succeeding years, particularly as they affected the community in which they happened, are less well documented. As event and as symbol, Kent State/May 4 means many things to many people. This unique collection of essays and personal interviews presents a broad spectrum of these viewpoints in recounting the events of May 4 and those of the aftermath years. The result is a composite history from the perspectives of many of those who lived it, a reflection of the differing ideological stances and life experiences characteristic of that tumultuous era in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xic2lMXkyakC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Australia Fair","description":"\\"Drawing on a lifetime of research and experience, Hugh Stretton makes a case for doing whatever it takes to keep Australia fair.

He defends them against idealist attacks from the subjective idealism of Machism, a philosophical trend, which at Lenin's time was becoming very fashionable, even within the workers' movement. Step by step, layer by layer, quoting at length from the many trendy philosophical and scientific publications of the day, the book exposes idealism in all its guises. The aim was very simple: to bring out in the open the real difference between Marxist dialectical materialism and subjective idealism, which in the last instance always leads to some form of religious world outlook. Analysing the different shades and expressions of Machism internationally, Lenin stressed that \\"in every philosophical question raised by the new physics, we [trace] the struggle between materialism and idealism.\\" And he showed that: \\"Behind the mass of new terminological devices, behind the litter of erudite scholasticism, we invariably discerned two principal alignments, two fundamental trends in the solution of philosophical problems. Whether nature, matter, the physical, the external world should be taken as primary, and consciousness, mind, sensation (experience - as the widespread terminology of our time has it), the psychical, etc., should be regarded as secondary - that is the root question which in fact continues to divide the philosophers into two great camps.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctsXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","description":"Executive Summary.

The lives of the two Clavering children, Hugh and Caddie, have been abruptly upended by the bitter divorce of their parents, British Army colonel Darrell and the formerly solid, dependable Fanny. Their English country home has been abandoned in favor of a London flat, and the fate of their adored pony, Topaz, is in serious question. And it all began the day the internationally renowned movie director, Rob Quillet, came to their small village and stole Fanny s heart. Now Fanny is gone, whisked off to the north of Italy by her famous filmmaker lover, leaving behind the jagged pieces of her broken family. While Hugh, at fourteen, understands the ways of the adult world better than his twelve-year-old sister, he is fiercely protective of stubborn, rebellious Caddie, who refuses to accept the situation or the hollow sympathy of grown-ups. So together they decide to take drastic action. Traveling alone across Europe, the siblings arrive at Quillet s pastoral Italian villa overlooking Lake Garda, determined to do battle with the man responsible for the destruction of their family. There can be no peace until they are victorious and victory will only be achieved when they bring their mother home. A novel that masterfully blends heart, wit, poignancy, and honesty with a breathtaking evocation of the lush Northern Italian countryside, Rumer Godden s The Battle of Villa Fiorita is another unforgettable reading experience from the New York Timesbestselling author of The River and In This House of Brede.

Five new essays examine Ives's relationships to European music and to American music, politics, business, and landscape. J. Peter Burkholder shows Ives as a composer well versed in four distinctive musical traditions who blended them in his mature music. Leon Botstein explores the paradox of how, in the works of Ives and Mahler, musical modernism emerges from profoundly antimodern sensibilities. David Michael Hertz reveals unsuspected parallels between one of Ives's most famous pieces, the Concord Piano Sonata, and the piano sonatas of Liszt and Scriabin. Michael Broyles sheds new light on Ives's political orientation and on his career in the insurance business, and Mark Tucker shows the importance for Ives of his vacations in the Adirondacks and the representation of that landscape in his music. The remainder of the book presents documents that illuminate Ives's personal life. A selection of some sixty letters to and from Ives and his family, edited and annotated by Tom C. Owens, is the first substantial collection of Ives correspondence to be published. Two sections of reviews and longer profiles published during his lifetime highlight the important stages in the reception of Ives's music, from his early works through the premieres of his most important compositions to his elevation as an almost mythic figure with a reputation among some critics as America's greatest composer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sHEDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching physical education for learning","description":"Focusing on physical education for kindergarten through grade 12, this user-friendly text emphasizes teaching strategies, theories, and skills to give students a foundation for designing an effective learning experience.

They are messages about the natural world, about societies past, about this society, and about societies to come. When examined rigorously - not out of any romanticism but only out of our own enlightened self-interest - these messages can be of great practical use to us in this and future years.\\" - Charles Wilkinson, from the Introduction In 1974 Federal Judge George H. Boldt issued one of the most sweeping rulings in the history of the Pacific Northwest, affirming the treaty rights of Northwest tribal fishermen and allocating to them 50 percent of the harvestable catch of salmon and steelhead. Among the Indians testifying in Judge Boldt's courtroom were Nisqually tribal leader Billy Frank, Jr., and his 95-year-old father, whose six acres along the Nisqually River, known as Frank's Landing, had been targeted for years by state game wardens in the so-called Fish Wars. By the 1960s the Landing had become a focal point for the assertion of tribal treaty rights in the Northwest. It also lay at the moral center of the tribal sovereignty movement nationally. The confrontations at the Landing hit the news and caught the conscience of many. Like the schoolhouse steps at Little Rock, or the bridge at Selma, Frank's Landing came to signify a threshold for change, and Billy Frank, Jr., became a leading architect of consensus, a role he continues today as one of the most colorful and accomplished figures in the modern history of the Pacific Northwest. In Messages from Frank's Landing, Charles Wilkinson explores the broad historical, legal, and social context of Indian fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest, providing a dramatic account of the people and issues involved. He draws on his own decades of experience as a lawyer working with Indian people, and focuses throughout on Billy Frank and the river flowing past Frank's Landing. In all aspects of Frank's life as an activist, from legal settlements negotiated over salmon habitats destroyed by hydroelectric plants, to successful negotiations with the U.S. Army for environmental protection of tribal lands, Wilkinson points up the significance of the traditional Indian world view - the powerful and direct legacy of Frank's father, conveyed through generations of Indian people who have crafted a practical working philosophy and a way of life. Drawing on many hours spent talking and laughing with Billy Frank while canoeing the Nisqually watershed, Wilkinson conveys words of respect and responsibility for the earth we inhabit and for the diverse communities the world encompasses. These are the messages from Frank's Landing. Wilkinson brings welcome clarity to complex legal issues, deepening our insight into a turbulent period in the political and environmental history of the Northwest. \\"The Boldt decision profoundly changed natural resource management in the Pacific Northwest. This book clearly builds an historical base to help guide us today. The wisdom and patience of Billy Frank fill virtually every page. It is required reading for anyone interested in salmon preservation.\\" - Governor Daniel J. Evans \\"Charles Wilkinson evokes the character and culture of the Nisqually people as well as their deep love for their land. From Chief Leschi to Billy Frank, we see the long thread of cultural continuity, culminating in modern times with this fight for justice.\\" - Ada Deer (Menominee), University of Wisconsin-Madison Charles Wilkinsonis Moses Lasky Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is the author ofFire on the Plateau: Conflict and Endurance in the American Southwestand numerous other books, including standard texts on Indian and Federal public land law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ex0jeeK3CPwC&dq=Messages+from+Frank%27s+Landing:+A+Story+of+Salmon,+Treaties,+and+the+Indian+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemplations on the Historical Passages of the Old and New Testaments","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UDUJAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boston's immigrants [1790-1880];: A study in acculturation (Atheneum)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CoE5zQEACAAJ&dq=Boston%27s+immigrants+%5B1790-1880%5D%3B:+A+study+in+acculturation+(Atheneum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legend of the Loon (Legend (Sleeping Bear))","description":"In this retelling of an Ojibwe Indian tale, a mother bear loses sight of her two cubs as they all attempt to escape a forest fire by swimming across Lake Michigan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0e8HAAAACAAJ&dq=Legend+of+the+Loon+(Legend+(Sleeping+Bear))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Newbery Award Library: Island of the Blue Dolphins/The Witch of Blackbird Pond/The Sign of the Beaver/One-eyed Cat/Dear Me.

Penguin Books is proud to now be the sole publisher of Oil!, the classic 1927 novel by Upton Sinclair. After writing The Jungle, his scathing indictment of the meatpacking industry, Sinclair turned his sights on the early days of the California oil industry in a highly entertaining story featuring a cavalcade of characters including senators, oil magnets, Hollywood film starlets, and a crusading evangelist. This lively and panoramic book, which was recently cited by David Denby in the New Yorker as being Sinclair s  most readable  novel, is now the inspiration for the Paramount Vantage major motion picture, There Will Be Blood. It is the long-awaited film from Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most admired filmmakers working today whose previous movies, Boogie Nights and Magnolia were both multiple Academy Award nominees. The movie stars Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York, My Left Foot) and Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film in New York and Los Angeles on December 26, 2007 and go nationwide in January. This is the same company responsible for Babel and A Mighty Heart and the current releases, Into the Wild, Margot at the Wedding, and The Kite Runner. As wars rage on in the oil region and as anxiety over natural resources rise, the subject of this book, which celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2007, is more timely than ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=__pLf8XrbzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Questions and Answers on the Eucharist","description":"In this book Giles Dimock answers some the most commonly asked questions about the Eucharist that have been posed to him in his preaching and teaching. He starts off with questions on the Jewish background of Eucharist and then examines the Last Supper and its theology in the light of the Paschal Mystery. Some of the other questions deal with transubstantiation, sacrifice, Real Presence, communion, and intercommunion. Fr. Dimock's answers are both practical and ecumenical. The questions range from the straightforward Why is the Eucharist called Holy Communion, What is Forty Hours, to the more involved What is said about the Eucharist in the Code of Canon Law? Father Dimock places the teaching of the Church on the Eucharist in conciliar and papal documentation. Here is a book, appropriately appearing at the culmination of the Year of the Eucharist, that will satisfy the spiritual as well as theological curiosity of college students and seminarians studying the Eucharist, as well as probing, informed lay people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U7Zjl17vAiEC&dq=101+Questions+and+Answers+on+the+Eucharist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions","description":"Reveals the spiritual and ascetical life of Saint Augustine","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X58IAQAAIAAJ&dq=Confessions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How the Universe was Created and Our Purpose In It","description":"This book provides answers and details about the process of creation that are not available in any other traditions, religions, or areas of science. It offers the oldest rendition of the creation and presents insights into the spiritual purpose of it and what we are really meant to do here. Every culture in the world and most religions have their own descriptions of the creation, and ideas about from where we came and what we should do. Unfortunately, these are often short and generalized versions that lack details. Thus, they are often given no better regard than myths. However, there are descriptions that give more elaborate explanations of how the cosmic creation fully manifested which are found in the ancient Vedic Puranas of India, some of the oldest spiritual writings on the planet. These descriptions provide the details and answers that other versions leave out. Furthermore, these Vedic descriptions often agree, and sometimes disagree, with the modern scientific theories of creation, and offer some factors that science has yet to consider. Now, with this book, we can get a clearer understanding of how this universe appears, what is its real purpose, from where we really came, how we fit into the plan for the universe, and if there is a way out of here. Some of the many topics included are:? Comparisons between other creation legends.? Detailed descriptions of the dawn of creation and how the material energy developed and caused the formation of the cosmos.? What is the primary source of the material and spiritual elements.? Insights into the primal questions of, \\"Who am I? Why am I here? Where have I come from? What is the purpose of this universe and my life?\\" ? An alternative description of the evolutionary development of the various forms of life.? Seeing beyond the temporary nature of the material worlds, and more. This book will provide some of the most profound insights into these questions and topics. It will also give any theist more information and understanding about how the universe is indeed a creation of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bhapuAAACAAJ&dq=How+the+Universe+was+Created+and+Our+Purpose+In+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Packing and Outfitting Field Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RPdHNgAACAAJ&dq=Packing+and+Outfitting+Field+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Orient in Western Art (Art & Architecture)","description":"The oriental motif is a recurring theme in western painting. From the Renaissance with its awakening interest in ancient cultures and art to the 18th century with its Grand Tours and \\"Turkish fashion,\\" the oriental theme has not only documented artists' travels to the East, but has projected the wishes, desires and imagination of the West. From ethnographic etchings to exaggerated displays of the sultans' splendor, this paradox of fact and fantasy culminated in the 19th century with the genre Orientalism. Napoleon's conquest of Egypt, European colonization, and archaeological excavations opened up the region to numerous artists such as Decamps. Delacroix, Fromentin, Ingres, Lear, and Hunt, whose most famous works express oriental imagery.

Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Grant, and Lee still stand as heroic ideals, as stirring to our national memory as were the legendary Achilles and Hector to the world of the ancient Greeks. Within the story of our Iliad one battle stands forth above all others: Gettysburg. Millions visit Gettysburg each year to walk the fields and hills where Joshua Chamberlain made his legendary stand and Pickett went down to a defeat which doomed a nation, but in defeat forever became a symbol of the heroic Lost Cause. As the years passed, and the scars healed, the debate, rather than drifting away has intensified. It is the battle which has become the great \\"what if,\\" of American history and the center of a dreamscape where Confederate banners finally do crown the heights above the town. The year is 1863, and General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia are poised to attack the North and claim the victory that would end the brutal conflict. But Lee's Gettysburg campaign ended in failure, ultimately deciding the outcome of the war. Launching his men into a vast sweeping operation, of which the town of Gettysburg is but one small part of the plan, General Lee, acting as he did at Chancellorsville, Second Manassas, and Antietam, displays the audacity of old. He knows he has but one more good chance to gain ultimate victory, for after two years of war the relentless power of an industrialized north is wearing the South down. Lee's lieutenants and the men in the ranks, imbued with this renewed spirit of the offensive embark on the Gettysburg Campaign that many dream \\"should have been.\\" The soldiers in the line, Yank and Reb, knew as well that this would be the great challenge, the decisive moment that would decided whether a nation would die, or be created, and both sides were ready, willing to lay down their lives for their Cause. An action-packed and painstakingly researched masterwork by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen, Gettysburg stands as the first book in a series to tell the story of how history could have unfolded, how a victory for Lee would have changed the destiny of the nation forever. This is a novel of true heroism and glory in America's most trying hour.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xe6h-FSJ_cAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hand shadows to be thrown upon the wall: A series of novel and amusing figures formed by the hand","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DEQnMwEACAAJ&dq=Hand+shadows+to+be+thrown+upon+the+wall:+A+series+of+novel+and+amusing+figures+formed+by+the+hand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dying Days","description":"The fifth installment of the main Dying Days zombie series!

Today, it is at the heart of hundreds of school and community programs that recognize in all young people the capacity to lead healthy, successful lives. The key, as Benard reports in this synthesis of a decade and more of resiliency research, is the role that families, schools, and communities play in supporting, and not undermining, this biological drive for normal human development. Of special interest is the evidence that resiliency prevails in most cases by far -- even in extreme situations, such as those caused by poverty, troubled families, and violent neighborhoods. An understanding of this developmental wisdom and the supporting research, Benard argues, must be integrated into adults' vision for the youth they work with and communicated to young people themselves. Benard's analysis of how best to incorporate research findings to support young people is both realistic and inspirational. It is an easy-to-read discussion of what the research has found along with descriptions of what application of the research looks like in our most successful efforts to support young people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yFXgGKTfHncC&dq=Resiliency:+What+We+Have+Learned&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5bQ8vQEACAAJ&dq=Too+Wilde+to+Tame&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prentice Hall Grammar and Composition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4I6svgEACAAJ&dq=Prentice+Hall+Grammar+and+Composition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surf Your Biowaves: Use Your Biorhythms to Ensure Greater Success","description":"Helps in calculating personal biograms and use them to improve the way one responds to the opportunities that life has to offer.

The Ritual Process has acquired the status of a small classic since these lectures were first published in 1969. Turner demonstrates how the analysis of ritual behavior and symbolism may be used as a key to understanding social structure and processes. He extends Van Gennep's notion of the \\"liminal phase\\" of rites of passage to a more general level, and applies it to gain understanding of a wide range of social phenomena. Once thought to be the \\"vestigial\\" organs of social conservatism, rituals are now seen as arenas in which social change may emerge and be absorbed into social practice. As Roger Abrahams writes in his foreword to the revised edition: \\"Turner argued from specific field data. His special eloquence resided in his ability to lay open a sub-Saharan African system of belief and practice in terms that took the reader beyond the exotic features of the group among whom he carried out his fieldwork, translating his experience into the terms of contemporary Western perceptions. Reflecting Turner's range of intellectual interests, the book emerged as exceptional and eccentric in many ways: yet it achieved its place within the intellectual world because it so successfully synthesized continental theory with the practices of ethnographic reports.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VywrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visions from San Francisco Bay","description":"Interrelated essays by the Nobel Laureate on his adopted home of California, which Lewis Hyde, writing in The Nation, called \\"remarkable, morally serious and thought-provoking essays, which strive to lay aside the barren categories by which we have understood and judged our state . . .

Experts haven't yet understood what is happening, and they continue to recommend the strategic marketing model. If marketing was an exact science then it may be reduced, with the scientific method, systemically and severely to observable and repeatable events which have precise and recognizable causes. So from these events could be developed one or more algorithm, on the basis of which it would be possible to create an automatic software able to handle scientifically each marketing campaign. Soon humans, advisers, which work strategically and scientifically would be replaced by machines. Thanks to the web's giants today everyone can have access to the most advanced marketing technologies easily and at low prices. This is no longer sufficient, and makes no difference anymore. What makes the difference today are: feelings, stories, experiences, meditation, emotions, irrationality, creativity, intuition... in one word the Magic! Spiritual Marketing is a system that wants go beyond the limits of traditional and strategic marketing choosing ideas and concepts of spiritual origin instead of the strict and at this point ineffective present paradigm.

To students of American frontier history, it is known as the focal point of one of the most interesting, dramatic, and sustained series of conflicts in the records of western warfare. From 1833 to 1875, in a theater of action extending from Kansas to Mexico, the strife was almost uninterrupted. The U.S. Army, Kansas militia, Texas Rangers, and white pioneers and traders were arrayed against the fierce and heroic bands of the Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowa-Apaches. The savage skirmishes with the southwestern Indians before the Civil War provided many army officers with a kind of training that proved indispensable to them in that later, prolonged conflict. When hostilities ceased, Sherman, Sheridan, Dodge, Custer, Grierson, and other commanders again resumed the harsh field of guerrilla warfare against their Indian foes tough, hard fighters. With the inauguration of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy during President Grant s first administration, the hands of the army were tied. The Fort Sill reservation became a place of refuge for the marauding bands that went forth unmolested to raid in Texas, Oklahoma, and Mexico. The toll in human life reached such proportions that the government finally turned the southwestern Indians over to the army for discipline, and a permanent settlement of the bands was achieved by 1875. From extensive research, conversations with both Indian and white eyewitnesses, and his familiarity with Indian life and army affairs, Captain Nye has written an unforgettable account of these stirring times. The delineation of character and the reconstruction of colorful scenes, so often absent in historical writing, are to be found here in abundance. His Indians are made to live again: his scenes of post life could have been written only by an army man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ARNzUdMF4RIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vampire Companion - The Official Guide To Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles","description":"Hundreds of entries discuss various topics related to the Anne Rice series of vampire novels, and include characters, themes, places, and symbolism in the novels","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GwL3NWi9tn4C&dq=The+Vampire+Companion+-+The+Official+Guide+To+Anne+Rice%27s+The+Vampire+Chronicles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man of vision, woman of prayer","description":"A biographical account, this work explores the reality of spiritual warfare, the price of ministry and its effect on family.

Particularly interested in Viola, Miranda, Prospero, Desdemona, Iago, Lear, Cordelia, Hamlet, Horatio, and Ophelia, the poets respond to the sonnets, the comedies, the tragedies, the romances, and, to a lesser degree, Shakespeare the man. In so doing they reveal the aspects of his work most currently captivating to modern writers. Those who cherish Shakespeare's mercurial wit will delight in the rapid shifts, from grief to hilarity, so characteristic of the bard himself. Comic poems about tragedies follow decidedly somber poems about comedies. Single poems contain multiple emotional twists and turns. Some pay homage; most interact directly with the original Shakespearean text. Collectively, they corroborate Ben Jonson's assertion that Shakespeare is \\"not of an age, but for all time.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BBg6zwEACAAJ&dq=In+a+Fine+Frenzy:+Poets+Respond+to+Shakespeare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radicals, Rabbis and Peacemakers: Conversations with Jewish Critics of Israel","description":"Conversations with leading Jewish critics of Israel and Zionism who support the Palestinians' struggle for freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BY_tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Radicals,+Rabbis+and+Peacemakers:+Conversations+with+Jewish+Critics+of+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arion and the Dolphins","description":"Sailing home with a prize of gold won in a contest, Arion faces death at the hands of the crew who covet his treasure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-17hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Arion+and+the+Dolphins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betsy's Little Star","description":"Betsy is scared about going to first grade, but it turns out school is a great place.

Subtly weaving in today s pressing social concerns from poverty in our neighborhoods to human trafficking across the globe Twenty-Two will inspire a greater sense of mission and a passion to live more fully as young women embark on their own remarkable journeys. Allison Trowbridge harnesses the power of story in a series of letters to an imagined young woman wrestling with the questions that arise as she stands on the precipice of adulthood. Never in history has a young woman had so many options before her, yet never has she had less direction or guidance on what to do with them. A woman at the precipice of adulthood often finds herself with more questions than answers, with more disenchantment than direction. How is she supposed to  lean in  to a successful career while also building deeply meaningful relationships? How can she care for the community around her while simultaneously developing a global mindset and changing the world? How can she be all that she is destined to be without feeling paralyzed by the pressure of so many prospects? Allison Trowbridge knows this dilemma well. She remembers stepping into her twenties and wishing for a mentor to guide her through this dizzying season of life. In Twenty-Two, she becomes the mentor she was looking for. Drawing from her own experience and from the wisdom of others, she offers advice and counsel in a series of personal letters to  Ashley,  a fictional college student looking for mentorship from someone one step ahead in life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H05sDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intersecting Lives: Road Maps for Ministry to Young Adults","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKyPNQAACAAJ&dq=Intersecting+Lives:+Road+Maps+for+Ministry+to+Young+Adults&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The French Physician's Boy: A Story of Philadelphia's 1793 Yellow Fever Epidemic","description":"Sixteen-year-old Matthew is not at all happy to start the long ship voyage to North America from his native Dutch-ruled colony of Surinam, but he is not free to control his fate. Either he leaves for Philadelphia with his master or he will be sold at slave auction. Matts owner, Dr. David de Cohen Nassy, a Jewish planter and unofficial physician, bankrupt and depressed, seeks a new start in North America. When he travels there in 1792 he also takes his Negro slave who was born on the now-lost Nassy coffee plantation and knows no family but that of his master. Gradually Matt comes to believe that life in the new world could hold great promise for him, too. Once in Philadelphia, Matts master rises to social and professional success and becomes a naturalized American citizen. Matt, too adapts rapidly to his new life in the city. He meets and befriends Jed, another young slave, who inspires Matt to hope for freedom. Best of all, Matt persuades his master to allow him to learn how to read and write. When the first American hot-air balloon flight is launched from Philadelphia Matt is a proud spectator as he watches his master participate in the event. When Matt overhears his master speaking to a friend about the prevailing anti-slavery movement greatly favored in Philadelphia he believes Dr. Nassy is thinking of liberating him. He is terribly disappointed when this does not happen. Within a year a major yellow fever epidemic breaks out in Philadelphia. The city is in panic and distress. Five thousand people die, one out of every four citizens. Matt becomes a great help his master and his steady companion. He carries the doctors black bag on his medical visits, observes how his master medicates the sick and secretly dreams he too, might become a healer one day. Dr.Nassys West Indian experience with tropical diseases saves the lives of his patients. But the same skill that aids the survival of the sick incurs the enmity of Philadelphias medical establishment whose patients die in droves. In his way Matt tries to support his master and protects him from verbal attacks by the servants of some leading city physicians. Matt visits Bush Hill, the local pest house, with Dr. Nassy. There a fellow West Indian colleague is the chief physician. In the presence of Dr. Nassy he performs several autopsies that confirm to Matts master his medical treatment methods are justified. After the epidemic Matt again hopes that he will finally be emancipated, but his owners financial problems prevent it. The doctor opens an apothecary shop in Philadelphia and needs Matt to help him run it. His masters health is not compatible with the Philadelphia climate. As soon as the French Revolution establishes cherished civil rights in Europe and European colonies, Dr. Nassy decides to return to Surinam and his home in the Jooden Savanna, the Jewish settlement. Before he leaves Philadelphia he takes Matt to the Abolition Society and in a formal ceremony signs the document which will eventually free Matt. En route home, Matt is a proud witness as the Danish government honors Dr. Nassy with an official doctorate for his successful Yellow Fever work in Philadelphia. Although social conditions in eighteen-century Surinam are not sufficiently advanced to allow either a Jew or a black man to attend medical school, Matt manages to practice healing among his own people once he becomes a free man.

As Francine Hirsch reveals in this immersive new history of the trials, a central piece of the story has been routinely omitted from standard accounts: the critical role that the Soviet Union played in making Nuremberg happen in the first place. Hirsch's book reveals how the Soviets shaped the trials--only to be written out of their story as Western allies became bitter Cold War rivals. Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg offers the first full picture of the war trials, illuminating the many ironies brought to bear as the Soviets did their part to bring the Nazis to justice. Everyone knew that Stalin had originally allied with Hitler before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 hung heavy over the courtroom, as did the suspicion among the Western prosecutors and judges that the Soviets had falsified evidence in an attempt to pin one of their own war crimes, the Katyn massacre of Polish officers, on the Nazis. It did not help that key members of the Soviet delegation, including the Soviet judge and chief prosecutor, had played critical roles in Stalin's infamous show trials of the 1930s. For the lead American prosecutor Robert H. Jackson and his colleagues, Soviet participation in the Nuremberg Trials undermined their overall credibility and possibly even the moral righteousness of the Allied victory. Yet Soviet jurists had been the first to conceive of a legal framework that treated war as an international crime. Without it, the IMT would have had no basis for judgment. The Soviets had borne the brunt of the fighting against Germany--enduring the horrors of the Nazi occupation and experiencing almost unimaginable human losses and devastation. There would be no denying their place on the tribunal, nor their determination to make the most of it. Once the trials were set in motion, however, little went as the Soviets had planned. Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg shows how Stalin's efforts to direct the Soviet delegation and to steer the trials from afar backfired, and how Soviet war crimes became exposed in open court. Hirsch's book offers readers both a front-row seat in the courtroom and a behind-the-scenes look at the meetings in which the prosecutors shared secrets and forged alliances. It reveals the shifting relationships among the four countries of the prosecution (the U.S., Great Britain, France, and the USSR), uncovering how and why the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg became a Cold War battleground. In the process Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg offers a new understanding of the trials and a fresh perspective on the post-war movement for human rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ayPdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiffany Table Settings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbvdAAAACAAJ&dq=Tiffany+Table+Settings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counsels from My Heart","description":"This new volume features teachings of one of the most revered masters of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Dudjom Rinpoche (1904-1987).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGJBngEACAAJ&dq=Counsels+from+My+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boomerang Mandate: Returning the Ministry to the People of God","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wArGd3cO7YkC&dq=The+Boomerang+Mandate:+Returning+the+Ministry+to+the+People+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diagnosis in Color: Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 2e (Diagnosis in Colour)","description":"First multi-year cumulation covers six years: 1965-70.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Q9n5-AIdjIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making sense of history: The philosophies of Popper and Collingwood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e84kcgAACAAJ&dq=Making+sense+of+history:+The+philosophies+of+Popper+and+Collingwood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Simmons family, from Moses Simmons, 1st: (Moyses Symonson) ship Fortune, 1621, to and including the eleventh generation in some lines, ... third and fourth generations from Moses 1st","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xo5RAAAAMAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Simmons+family,+from+Moses+Simmons,+1st:+(Moyses+Symonson)+ship+Fortune,+1621,+to+and+including+the+eleventh+generation+in+some+lines,+...+third+and+fourth+generations+from+Moses+1st&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holocaust: A record of the destruction of Jewish life in Europe during the dark years of Nazi rule","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=unp9swEACAAJ&dq=The+Holocaust:+A+record+of+the+destruction+of+Jewish+life+in+Europe+during+the+dark+years+of+Nazi+rule&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woo! the Not-So-Scary Ghost","description":"Tired of being told what to do, a young ghost run aways, but after a scary day, he decides that he is happier at home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7eAJGwAACAAJ&dq=Woo!+the+Not-So-Scary+Ghost&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Bookworms Library Stage 1 Best-seller Pack: Stage 1: 400 Headwords Love or Money?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zaJ_zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Bookworms+Library+Stage+1+Best-seller+Pack:+Stage+1:+400+Headwords+Love+or+Money%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Land of the Great Sophy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lCQKAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Land+of+the+Great+Sophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses","description":"The refusal of a Muslim basketball player to stand for the US national anthem in 1996, and the ensuing Islamophobic outcry, sparked Abou El Fadl (law, U. of California-Los Angeles) to write his historical and philosophical treatise, published in 1997 and subsequently in both English and Arabic.

While that figure may be the Academy's big white lie, the Oscars draw a viewership well into the hundreds of millions--a tremendous audience for what is essentially a television program. But this is no ordinary show. Love it or loathe it, the Oscars are an irresistible spectacle: a gloriously gaudy, glitzy, momentous, and foolish window into the unholy alliance of art and commerce that is the film industry.

In this study of Canada's first 'school' of poets, D.M.R. Bentley combines archival work, including extensive research in periodicals and newspapers, with close readings of the work of Charles G.D. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, William Wilfred Campbell, Duncan Campbell Scott, and Frederick George Scott. Bentley chronicles the formation, reception, national and international successes, and eventual disintegration (after the 1895 'War Among the Poets') of the Confederation Group, whose poetry forever changed the perception and direction of Canadian literature. With the aid of biographical, political, and sociological analyses, Bentley's literary history delineates the group's political, aesthetic, and thematic dispositions and characteristics, and contextualizes them not only within Canadian history and politics, but also within contemporary intellectual and literary currents, including Romantic nationalism, 'Canadianism', and poetic formalism. Bentley casts new light on the poets' commonalities - such as their debt to Young Ireland, their commitment to careful workmanship, and their participation in the American mind-cure movement - as well as on their most accomplished and anthologized poems from 1880 to 1897. In the process, he presents a compelling case for the literary and historical importance of these six men and their poems in light of Canada's cultural and political past, and defends their right to be known as Canada's first poetic fraternity at a time when Canada was striving to achieve literary and national distinction. The Confederation Group of Canadian Poets, 1880-1897 is an erudite and innovative work of literary history and critical interpretation that belongs on the bookshelf of every serious scholar of literary studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xmVkAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chris-In-The-Morning: Love, Life, and the Whole Karmic Enchilada","description":"A collection of the recollections, speculations, dreams and philosophies of Chris Stevens, the character known as Chris-in-the-morning in the television series Northern Exposure.

It is necessary to publish it to avoid the perpetuation of major misunderstandings about the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\"--Yann Richard, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, international experts from Iran, Europe, the United States, and throughout the Middle East assessed the nature of Iraqi aggression against Iran in an international conference in Tehran. Under the pretext of territorial claims, that invasion in 1980 launched a revolution, one that in turn became a conventional war with international dimensions as it extended to the oil-rich Persian Gulf. For scholars and general readers who seek to unravel some of the complexities in the Middle East, this collection analyzes the causes and consequences of the Iran-Iraq war not only from the standpoint of the belligerent parties but from the perspective of Islamic and international law.

The human speech system is in a league of its own in the animal kingdom and its possession dwarfs most other evolutionary achievements. During every second of speech we unconsciously use about 225 distinct muscle actions. To investigate the evolutionary origins of this prodigious ability, Peter MacNeilage draws on work in linguistics, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and animal behavior. He puts forward a neo-Darwinian account of speech as a process of descent in which ancestral vocal capabilities became modified in response to natural selection pressures for more efficient communication. His proposals include the crucial observation that present-day infants learning to produce speech reveal constraints that were acting on our ancestors as they invented new words long ago. This important and original investigation integrates the latest research on modern speech capabilities, their acquisition, and their neurobiology, including the issues surrounding the cerebral hemispheric specialization for speech. Written in a clear style with minimal recourse to jargon the book will interest a wide range of readers in cognitive, neuro-, and evolutionary science, as well as all those seeking to understand the nature and evolution of speech and human communication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BNQUDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Origin+of+Speech&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide for the NATA Board of Certification, Including Entry-Level Athletic Trainer Certification Examination (Book with CD-ROM)","description":"Netter s Sports Medicine, by Christopher C.

By 1139 the Church had intervened, outlawing the use of the crossbow among Christians. With this edict, arms control was born. As Robert L. O'Connell reveals in this vividly written history of weapons in Western culture, that first attempt at an arms control measure characterizes the complex and often paradoxical relationship between men and arms throughout the centuries. In a sweeping narrative that ranges from prehistoric times to the nuclear age, O'Connell demonstrates how social and economic conditions determine the types of weapons and the tactics used in warfare and how, in turn, innovations in weapons technology often undercut social values. He describes, for instance, how the invention of the gun required a redefinition of courage from aggressive ferocity to calmness under fire; and how the machine gun in World War I so overthrew traditional notions of combat that Lord Kitchener exclaimed, \\"This isn't war!\\" The technology unleashed during the Great War radically altered our perceptions of ourselves, as these new weapons made human qualities almost irrelevant in combat. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity itself became subservient to the weapons it had produced. Of Arms and Men brilliantly integrates the evolution of politics, weapons, strategy, and tactics into a coherent narrative, one spiced with striking portraits of men in combat and penetrating insights into why men go to war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Y8CNoQqSywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pitching","description":"Presents an update on objective medical, exercise, andcoaching pitching research, and also provides currentinformation on skills and drills for coaches, players,and parents.

The ascendance of nonrepresentational art in the middle of the twentieth century displaced these venerable skills, especially in academic art circles. Fortunately for aspiring artists today who wish to learn the methods that allowed the Old Masters to achieve the luminous color and subtle tonalities so characteristic of their work, this knowledge has been preserved in hundreds of small traditional painting ateliers that persevered in the old ways in this country and throughout the world. Coming out of this dedicated movement, Portrait Painting Atelier is an essential resource for an art community still recovering from a time when solid instruction in art technique was unavailable in our schools. Of particular value here is a demonstration of the Old Masters  technique of layering paint over a toned-ground surface, a process that builds from the transparent dark areas to the more densely painted lights. This method unifies the entire painting, creating a beautiful glow that illuminates skin tones and softly blends all the color tones. Readers will also find valuable instruction in paint mediums from classic oil-based to alkyd-based, the interactive principles of composition and photograph-based composition, and the anatomy of the human face and the key relationships among its features. Richly illustrated with the work of preeminent masters such as Millet, G ricault, and van Gogh, as well as some of today s leading portrait artists and featuring seven detailed step-by-step portrait demonstrations Portrait Painting Atelier is the first book in many years to so comprehensively cover the concepts and techniques of traditional portraiture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1uvIGhvnjO4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Loved Me/Cassettes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCKmYgEACAAJ&dq=The+Spy+Who+Loved+Me/Cassettes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The legend of the wandering Jew","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5g1FAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"P.S.

In piecing together the judge s shocking past, Kerney discovers the victim s predilection for sexual indiscretions, a history of family betrayal and greed, and a dark marriage that ended mysteriously and violently.

Best Care at Lower Cost explains that inefficiencies, an overwhelming amount of data, and other economic and quality barriers hinder progress in improving health and threaten the nation's economic stability and global competitiveness. According to this report, the knowledge and tools exist to put the health system on the right course to achieve continuous improvement and better quality care at a lower cost. The costs of the system's current inefficiency underscore the urgent need for a systemwide transformation. About 30 percent of health spending in 2009--roughly $750 billion--was wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems. Moreover, inefficiencies cause needless suffering. By one estimate, roughly 75,000 deaths might have been averted in 2005 if every state had delivered care at the quality level of the best performing state. This report states that the way health care providers currently train, practice, and learn new information cannot keep pace with the flood of research discoveries and technological advances. About 75 million Americans have more than one chronic condition, requiring coordination among multiple specialists and therapies, which can increase the potential for miscommunication, misdiagnosis, potentially conflicting interventions, and dangerous drug interactions. Best Care at Lower Cost emphasizes that a better use of data is a critical element of a continuously improving health system, such as mobile technologies and electronic health records that offer significant potential to capture and share health data better. In order for this to occur, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, IT developers, and standard-setting organizations should ensure that these systems are robust and interoperable. Clinicians and care organizations should fully adopt these technologies, and patients should be encouraged to use tools, such as personal health information portals, to actively engage in their care. This book is a call to action that will guide health care providers; administrators; caregivers; policy makers; health professionals; federal, state, and local government agencies; private and public health organizations; and educational institutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GPlhCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Power+Of+Clinical+And+Financial+Metrics:+Achieving+Success+In+Your+Hospital+(American+College+of+Helathcare+Executives+Management+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Egg Dancing","description":"With only a schizophrenic mother and a militantly hostile sister for backup, Hazel Sugden, food-splattered mum and queen of low self-esteem, is palpably unfit to save the future of mankind as we know it.

Resources in this area often prove overspecialized and arcane, and can require highly sophisticated skills in cultural anthropology or Semitic languages just to read the table of contents. Social World of Ancient Israel, 1250-587 BCE offers those interested in learning about the biblical world a more user-friendly framework for viewing the broader picture; at the same time it relies upon the latest methodologies of cultural anthropology and biblical analysis in its presentation. Painting a picture in broad but precise strokes, the authors portray the landscape of ancient Israel in new and exciting colors that expert and student alike will appreciate. Social World of Ancient Israel takes a unique look at the most prominent social institutions of the world of early Israel and the period of the monarchy, and then shows how properly understanding these social institutions is essential for sound biblical interpretation. Immersing the reader into five major areas of daily life in antiquity--politics, economics, diplomacy, law, and education--Matthews and Benjamin explore the ways in which knowing how \\"players\\" function in these institutions, such as \\"father/mother,\\" \\"prophet/wise one,\\" \\"host/stranger,\\" can shape our understanding of earliest Israel. Perhaps most significantly, the book gently exposes the inefficiency of past anthropological models for interpreting the relationships, attitudes and social conventions of earliest Israel. Its corrective insights will enable scholar and student alike to plot new approaches for studying the Hebrew Bible and the ancient people of Israel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pZKqcQAACAAJ&dq=The+Social+World+of+Ancient+Israel:+1250-587+BCE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ravelstein","description":"In time for the centennial of his birth, the Nobel Prize winner s moving final novel A Penguin Classic Deeply insightful, Saul Bellow s moving last novel is a journey through love and memory, an elegy to friendship, and a poignant meditation on death.

In this winner of the Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize for an Especially Notable Book, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor  not only exposes the canard of color-blindness but reveals how structural racism and class oppression are joined at the hip  (Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams). The eruption of mass protests in the wake of the police murders of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City have challenged the impunity with which officers of the law carry out violence against black people and punctured the illusion of a post-racial America. The Black Lives Matter movement has awakened a new generation of activists. In this stirring and insightful analysis, activist and scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor surveys the historical and contemporary ravages of racism and the persistence of structural inequality, such as mass incarceration and black unemployment. In this context, she argues that this new struggle against police violence holds the potential to reignite a broader push for black liberation.  This brilliant book is the best analysis we have of the #BlackLivesMatter moment of the long struggle for freedom in America.

Practicing mathematics teachers will recognize elements of their own work in the story told here. Prospective teachers and teacher educators will find themselves in real mathematics classrooms via detailed vignettes of classroom events and the planning that led to them. Researchers of teaching will discover arguments built from a carefully constructed conceptual framework and rigorous qualitative research methods. Moreover, readers will find a different interpretation of the work of teachers who are wrestling with change. They will find evidence that some of the difficulties that Romagnano and his colleague encountered were not simply problems that could be solved by diligent work. They were, in fact, dilemmas for which these teachers found no clear solutions, only equally-flawed alternative courses of action. To accomplish the goal of teaching real mathematics, they had to manage the dilemmas of change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pPYwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Wrestling+with+Change:+The+Dilemmas+of+Teaching+Real+Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the cherubim","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kfdJAQAAIAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+cherubim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","description":" This is the best autobiography I ve read by a prominent American in I don t know how many years. It is endlessly absorbing and I believe this is because it concerns a man who is looking to find a coherent philosophy that will be tough enough to contain all that is ugly in his person and his experience, yet shall prove sufficiently compassionate to give honest judgment on himself and others. Somehow, the author brings this off. Elia Kazan: A Life has that candor of confession which is possible only when the deepest wounds have healed and honesty can achieve what honesty so rarely arrives at a rich and hearty flavor. By such means, a famous director has written a book that offers the kind of human wealth we find in a major novel.   Norman Mailer In this amazing autobiography, Kazan at seventy-eight brings to the undiluted telling of his story and revelation of himself all the passion, vitality, and truth, the almost outrageous honesty, that have made him so formidable a stage director (A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman, All My Sons, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tea and Sympathy), film director (On the Waterfront, East of Eden, Gentleman s Agreement, Splendor in the Grass, Baby Doll, The Last Tycoon, A Face in the Crowd), and novelist (the number-one best-seller The Arrangement.) Kazan gives us his sense of himself as an outsider (a Greek rug merchant s son born in Turkey, an immigrant s son raised in New York and educated at Williams College). He takes us into the almost accidental sojourn at the Yale Drama School that triggered his commitment to theatre, and his edgy, exciting apprenticeship with the new and astonishing Group Theatre, as stagehand and stage manager and as actor (Waiting for Lefty, Golden Boy) . . . his first nervous and then successful attempts at directing for theatre and movies (The Skin of Our Teeth, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn) . . . his return to New York to co-found the Actors Studio (and his long and ambivalent relationship with Lee Strasberg) . . . his emergence as premier director on both coasts. With his director s eye for the telling scene, Kazan shares the joys and complications of production, his unique insights on acting, directing, and producing. He makes us feel the close presence of the actors, producers, and writers he s worked with James Dean, Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams, Vivien Leigh, Tallulah Bankhead, Sam Spiegel, Darryl Zanuck, Harold Clurman, Arthur Miller, Budd Schulberg, James Baldwin, Clifford Odets, and John Steinbeck among them. He gives us a frank and affectionate portrait of Marilyn Monroe. He talks with startling candor about himself as husband and in the years where he obsessively sought adventure outside marriage as lover. For the first time, he discusses his Communist Party years and his wrenching decision in 1952 to be a cooperative witness before HUAC. He writes about his birth as a writer. The pace and organic drama of his narrative, his grasp of the life and politics of Broadway and Hollywood, the keenness with which he observes the men and women and worlds around him, and, above all, the honest with which he pursues and captures his own essence, make this one of the most fascinating autobiographies of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R7wKgsVUDUYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Il Deserto dei Tartari","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WqAgMwEACAAJ&dq=Il+Deserto+dei+Tartari&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Splinters from an African Log","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pcgBngEACAAJ&dq=Splinters+from+an+African+Log&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Evidence and Discovery: What Every Lawyer Should Know","description":"\\"Pack this one in your beach bag and get ready for nonstop fun.\\" --- Susan Mallery, New York Times bestselling author, on Barefoot in the Sand As a professional gardener, Tessa Galloway can grow anything except the one thing she wants the most - a baby.

High voltage is therefore a relative notion. High Voltage Devices and Circuits in Standard CMOS Technologies is mainly focused on standard CMOS technologies, where high voltage (HV) is defined as any voltage higher than the nominal (low) voltage, i.e. 5V, 3.3V, or even lower. In this standard CMOS environment, IC designers are more and more frequently confronted with HV problems, particularly at the I/O level of the circuit. In the first group of applications, a large range of industrial or consumer circuits either require HV driving capabilities, or are supposed to work in a high-voltage environment. This includes ultrasonic drivers, flat panel displays, robotics, automotive, etc. On the other hand, in the emerging field of integrated microsystems, MEMS actuators mainly make use of electrostatic forces involving voltages in the typical range of 30 to 60V. Last but not least, with the advent of deep sub-micron and/or low-power technologies, the operating voltage tends towards levels ranging from 1V to 2.5V, while the interface needs to be compatible with higher voltages, such as 5V. For all these categories of applications, it is usually preferable to perform most of the signal processing at low voltage, while the resulting output rises to a higher voltage level. Solving this problem requires some special actions at three levels: technology, circuit design and layout. High Voltage Devices and Circuits in Standard CMOS Technologies addresses these topics in a clear and organized way. The theoretical background is supported by practical information and design examples. It is an invaluable reference for researchers and professionals in both the design and device communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hJjuBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quarry's Contract","description":"An urbane but deadly Englishman, Simon Quarry races to stop a vicious band of Italian kidnappers and walks straight into the middle of a bloody terrorist war raging in the international underground","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uzd4WDYLTVQC&dq=Quarry%27s+Contract&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Army Under Pope","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qg1YHGOy-cYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","description":"Offers biographical details about the mystery writer's life, A-to-Z plot summaries of her novels, character listings, and film and television listings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&dq=The+Complete+Christie:+An+Agatha+Christie+Encyclopedia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--French","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SoYXAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Prepare+for+Sat+Ii--French&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Natural Guide to Great Sex: Improve Your Love Life with Nature's Alternatives to HRT and Viagra","description":"The pharmaceutical industry is currently capitalizing on the desires of millions who hope to enhance their sex lives.

The basic reliability concepts are also introduced for those readers who are not familiar with the reliability ideas. Besides the basic models, a new family of models is introduced in the book. This family is flexible enough to describe a variety of different reliability trends. Particular attention is given to the problem of the provision of tools to assist the user in selecting an appropriate model in a particular situation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q_4i0-5KunwC&dq=Software+Reliability+Modelling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"West Meets East - Mies van der Rohe (English and German Edition)","description":"\\"This book uncovers extraordinary parallels between the traditional architecture of China and Japan and the buildings of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

Three Simple Steps is different. Despite stock market crashes, dot-com busts, and the specter of recession, the author started a virtual company from home, using a few thousand dollars of his savings. A few years later, without ever hiring an employee or leaving his home office, he sold it for more than $100 million. As the economy slipped into another free fall, he did this again with a company in a different field. He accomplished this through no particular genius. Rather, he studied the habits of the many successful men and women who preceded him, and developed three simple rules that, if followed diligently, virtually ensure success. Using them first to escape poverty, then to achieve a life of adventures, he finally turned them toward financial independence. Written in a straightforward and no-nonsense style, Three Simple Steps shows you how to take back control of your destiny and reshape your mind for increased creativity, serenity and achievement. While building on the wisdom of great thinkers and accomplished individuals from East and West, Three Simple Steps isn't a new age text or guide to esoteric fulfillment. Rather, it's a practical guide to real-life achievement by a pragmatic businessman who attributes his incredible successes to these very simple ideas. Three Simple Steps is a must-read guide for everyone who wants to achieve more, live better and be happier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0tXe-6k6qM4C&dq=The+Simple+Way+To+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898","description":"Uses diaries, letters, and official documents to depict the lives of nineteenth-century American soldiers, discusses recruitment, training, health, pay, clothing, food, and military justice, and looks at the attitudes of soldiers and officers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6UhLAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Old+Army:+A+Portrait+of+the+American+Army+in+Peacetime,+1784-1898&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life","description":"LOGIC AND CONTEMPORARY RHETORIC: THE USE OF REASON IN EVERYDAY LIFE, 13th Edition, introduces you to sound reasoning using current, relevant, and stimulating examples in a witty and invigorating writing style.

You'll not be able to put it down.' Fearne Cotton As seen on 'Living Wild; How to Change your Life' a two-part prime-time series on Channel 4 and The Great Celebrity Bake Off for SU2C On the precipice of starting her adult life, aged eighteen, Sophie, a rebellious and incorrigible wild child, crashed her car and was instantly paralysed from the chest down. Rushed to hospital, everything she had dreamed for her life was instantly forgotten and her journey to rediscover herself and build a different life began. But being told she would never walk again would come to be the least of her concerns. Over the next eighteen years, as she strived to come to terms with the change in her body, her relationships were put to the test; she has had to learn to cope with the many unexpected and unpredictable setbacks of living with paralysis; she has had to overcome her own and other people's perceptions of disability and explore the limits of her abilities, all whilst searching for love, acceptance, meaning, identity, and purpose. Driving Forwards is a remarkable and powerful memoir, detailing Sophie's life-changing injury, her recovery, and her life since. Strikingly honest, her story is unusual and yet relatable, inspiring us to see how adversity can be channelled into opportunity and how ongoing resilience can ultimately lead to empowerment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAoyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Poems of Amy Lowell","description":"Amy Lowell (1874-1925), American poet and critic, was one of the most influential and best-known writers of her era. Within a thirteen-year period, she produced six volumes of poetry, two volumes of criticism, a two-volume biography of John Keats, and countless articles and reviews that appeared in many popular periodicals. As a herald of the New Poetry, Lowell saw herself and her kind of work as a part of a newly forged, diverse, American people that registered its consciousness in different tonalities but all in a native idiom. She helped build the road leading to the later works of Allen Ginsberg, May Sarton, Sylvia Plath, and beyond. Except for the few poems that invariably appear in American literature anthologies, most of her writings are out of print. This will be the first volume of her work to appear in decades, and the depth, range, and surprising sensuality of her poems will be a revelation. The poetry is organized according to Lowell's characteristic forms, from traditional to experimental. In each section the works appear in chronological order. Section one contains sonnets and other traditional verse forms. The next section covers her translations and adaptations of Chinese and Japanese poetry, whereby she beautifully renders the spirit of these works. Also included here are several of Lowell's own Asian-influenced poems. Lowell's free, or cadenced verse appears in the third part. The last section provides samples of Lowell's polyphonic prose, an ambitious and vigorous art form that employs all of the resources of poetry. The release of The Selected Poems of Amy Lowell will be a major event for readers who have not been able to find a representative sampling of work from this vigorous, courageous poet who gave voice to an erotic, thoroughly American sensibility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DZ6PaIzi84YC&dq=Selected+Poems+of+Amy+Lowell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","description":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners has been carefully developed by an experienced teacher to provide a step-by-step course to Slovene as it is written and spoken today.

Yet, like its pop cultural peers punk and hip hop, it was born of a period of profound social and economic upheaval. In Turn the Beat Around, critic and journalist Peter Shapiro traces the history of disco music and culture. From the outset, disco was essentially a shotgun marriage between a newly out and proud gay sexuality and the first generation of post-civil rights African Americans, all to the serenade of the recently developed synthesizer. Shapiro maps out these converging influences, as well as disco's cultural antecedents in Europe, looks at the history of DJing, explores the mainstream disco craze at it's apex, and details the long shadow cast by disco's performers and devotees on today's musical landscape. One part cultural study, one part urban history, and one part glitter-pop confection, Turn the Beat Around is the most comprehensive study of the Me Generation to date.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hT86CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is the Schoolroom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ef63AAAACAAJ&dq=This+is+the+Schoolroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE RAZOR'S EDGE","description":"Larry Darrell is a young American in search of the absolute.

During these years, he chronicled his experiences, and the result is a diary of unparalleled candor that conveys his alternately hilarious and terrifying teenage existence. Here is Carroll prowling New York City--playing basketball, hustling, stealing, getting high, getting hooked, and searching for something pure. The Basketball Diaries was the basis for the film of the same name starring Leonardo DiCaprio. \\"I met him in 1970, and already he was pretty much universally recognized as the best poet of his generation. . . .

With an unbroken string of bestsellers in almost every country in the world, Robert Ludlum's books have been enjoyed by hundreds of millions of readers, and are widely acknowledged as classics in the field. Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels The Hades Factor and The Cassandra Compact comes the third thrilling novel in the series - The Paris Option. A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular - or DNA - computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed. The scientific community does not expect a workable DNA computer to be developed for years. But suddenly U.S. fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes, and there's no explanation. Utilities across the Western states cease functioning, and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker, although Washington, worried about a panic, assures the public it is. Only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc. Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, Smith uncovers a web of deception that threatens to wreck havoc and forever reshape the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pl9fzBKTscsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","description":"While not exactly a war novel, Sun Tzu's The Art of War is certainly a classic military text.

He tells the intriguing story of St. Thomas who by taking a vow of poverty and joining the Dominicans defied his illustrious, prominent family s ambition for him to have great power in the Church. The battles and Crusades of the 13th century and the ruthlessness of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II play a big part in the story, but it is Thomas of Aquino who dominates this book. De Wohl succeeds notably in portraying the exceptional quality of this man, a fusion of mighty intellect and childlike simplicity. A pupil of St. Albert the Great, the humble Thomas through an intense life of study, writing, prayer, preaching and contemplation ironically rose to become the influential figure of his age, and he later was proclaimed by the Church as the Angelic Doctor. As in all of his novels about great saints of the church, Louis de Wohl weaves an intricate colorful tapestry of love, violence and piety to bring to life a tremendous historical figure and the fascinating period in which he lived. Louis de Wohl was a distinguished and internationally respected Catholic writer whose books on saints have been best-sellers worldwide. Other available titles include Lay Siege to Heaven, Set All Afire and Citadel of God.

In this new volume Supersymmetry and Supergravity has been greatly expanded to include a detailed derivation of the most general coupling of super-symmetric gauge theory to supergravity. The final result is the starting point for phenomenological studies of supersymmetric theories. The book is distinguished by its pedagogical approach to supersymmetry. It develops several topics in advanced field theory as the need arises. It emphasizes the logical coherence of the subject and should appeal to physicists whose interests range from the mathematical to the phenomenological. In praise of the first edition: \\"A beautiful exposition of the original ideas of Wess and Zumino in formulating N = 1 supersymmetry and supergravity theories, couched in the language of superfields introduced by Strathdee and the reviewer....

Wilkinson's enquiry spans from the Apostolic era through to modern times. Variously thought of as remnants of the old church which persisted after the Roman Catholic, or as distinct Christian communities which sprang up spontaneously in various countries and communities, the church in the wilderness is an important - and commonly neglected - part of Christian history. The author thoroughly researched the emergence of these denominations, many of whom predate the Reformation of the Renaissance. Examples of such movements were observed in Europe, Turkey, the wider Middle East, as well as India. For professing a close adherence to the Bible scriptures, as opposed to following the hierarchical doctrines of the Catholic Church, these disparate groups were branded heretics and persecuted. Such periodic persecutions occurred across centuries, and punishments were commonly harsh. Despite this, the Christians who rejected the Catholic doctrines persevered - the spirit and word of the original Bible gospels their guide and authority.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u_iTzQEACAAJ&dq=Truth+triumphant:+The+church+in+the+wilderness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The dark kingdoms: The impact of white civilization on three great African monarchies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QRxzAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+dark+kingdoms:+The+impact+of+white+civilization+on+three+great+African+monarchies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the aerodynamics of flight (NASA SP ; 367)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDX_PAAACAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+the+aerodynamics+of+flight+(NASA+SP+%3B+367)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calling the Shots","description":"Winner, 2018 Donald W.

It is just one recent incident that the medical community blames on the nation s falling vaccination rates. Still, many parents continue to claim that the risks that vaccines pose to their children are far greater than their benefits. Given the research and the unanimity of opinion within the medical community, many ask how such parents who are most likely to be white, college educated, and with a family income over $75,000 could hold such beliefs. For over a decade, Jennifer Reich has been studying the phenomenon of vaccine refusal from the perspectives of parents who distrust vaccines and the corporations that make them, as well as the health care providers and policy makers who see them as essential to ensuring community health. Reich reveals how parents who opt out of vaccinations see their decision: what they fear, what they hope to control, and what they believe is in their child s best interest. Based on interviews with parents who fully reject vaccines as well as those who believe in  slow vax,  or altering the number of and time between vaccinations, the author provides a fascinating account of these parents  points of view. Placing these stories in dialogue with those of pediatricians who see the devastation that can be caused by vaccine-preventable diseases and the policy makers who aim to create healthy communities, Calling the Shots offers a unique opportunity to understand the points of disagreement on what is best for children, communities, and public health, and the ways in which we can bridge these differences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zK84DwAAQBAJ&dq=Calling+the+Shots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"San Francisco Irish 1848-1880","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EQ4ux4RENdgC&dq=San+Francisco+Irish+1848-1880&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the House of the Lord: Inhabiting the Psalms of Lament","description":"What would it mean for us to inhabit the world of the psalmist?

Throughout its eight year life, PM maintained a circulation of 150,000. It crusaded against crass materialism and isolationism, advocated the continuation of New Deal policies, and strove to build anti-fascist alliances. The tabloid also gained its reputation by revolutionizing the use of photography and graphics, breaking an industry boycott by printing daily news of radio programming, focusing on consumer news, and rejecting all paid advertising to avoid compromising its views. Its influence did not die with its last issue, however. In the sixties, PM was seen as a model for several upstart counterculture publications, and many of its stylistic innovations can be found in current newspapers, including the New York Times.

I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. I repopulated Samaria more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my commissioner as governor over them, and I counted them as Assyrians.\\" - Sargon II, Assyrian king In the 8th century BCE, one of the most important provinces within the Assyrian Empire was Samaria. Also known as Israel, Samaria repeatedly rebelled against their Assyrian overlords, but in 722, the Assyrians overran Samaria once and for all, killing countless numbers and sending most of the rest of its inhabitants into forced exile. The events of Samaria's fall were chronicled in the Assyrian annals from the reign of Sargon II and the Old Testament, and although the two sources present the event from different perspectives, they corroborate each other for the most part and together present a reliable account of the situation. The end result was that 30,000 Israelites were forcibly deported from the region, a tactic the Assyrians found so effective that they would continue to use it against other conquered enemies until the fall of their own empire. The Assyrians' forced exile of the Israelites was not the only time such a fate had befallen them, as made clear by Babylonian accounts and the Biblical account of the Exodus out of Egypt, but it was that exile that permanently scattered most of the legendary 12 tribes of Israel, and the fate of the 10 lost tribes has interested people ever since. The patriarchal stories in Genesis explain the following about the origin of the tribes of Israel. The patriarch Jacob, whose name was later changed to Israel (Gen 32:28), was himself the son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham. He had 12 sons who are the eponymous ancestors of the 12 tribes of Israel. Genesis lists the 12 sons according to their mothers. Jacob had five sons with his first wife: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, and Issachar. Leah's maid, Zilpah, bore another two sons to Jacob: Gad and Asher. His second wife, Rachel, also bore only two sons: Joseph and Benjamin; as did her maid, Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali. The simple version of the Ten Lost Tribes is that modern Jewish communities are composed of the descendants of two of these 12 tribes because Cyrus the Great allowed these tribes to return to Judah from their captivity in Babylon. However, the location and fate of the remaining 10 tribes, deported by the Assyrians from the northern kingdom of Israel two centuries earlier, remains a mystery, and it is this mystery that lies at the heart of the search for the Ten Lost Tribes. The Ten Lost Tribes looks at what is known and unknown about the missing tribes of Israel, and speculation as to their fate. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Lost Tribes of Israel like never before, in no time at all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3tbtoQEACAAJ&dq=The+lost+tribes+in+Assyria&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",B,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-d4504c49"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/20.md","filePath":"drive/20.md"}'),J={name:"drive/20.md"},D=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(H)]))}});export{W as __pageData,D as default};
