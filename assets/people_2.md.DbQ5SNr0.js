This book, The Old Man and the Sea, is a very great book. Even though is only one hundred twenty-seven pages, it still fully explains itself. It is a very easy read for sixth through eighth graders. The reason I say eighth graders too is because I am one. But not only they or I can read it, but everyone can. If you are an parent or adult, I recommend it for you to read it to your children. If you are a procrastinator, then a highly recommend it to you for a book report book. It has large words to a certain extent, but if it is a non-heard word, it will tell what is means. In this book Ernest Hemingway uses a lot of figurative language. It was published in 1954, and won a Nobel Prize for Literature. It is one of the best classical novels written by Ernest Hemingway. It describes everything in detail so it is easy for you to picture what it looks like. If you were to read this book you could maybe understand figurative language clearer. This book is basically about a eighty-five year old man that goes out to sea and all different things happen to him while he is out there. Because of what he did it made him famous and everyone respected him for that. I hope that you would enjoy this as much as I did. If you are a Christian, like me, I think will help you to be a Christian because the old man never gave up and always prayed and ask God for help. If you are not a Christian than it still would be a good book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's The Old man and The Sea was an enjoyable book for me to read. I appreciated his simplicity in writing, and his to the point style. At first I was unclear about the purpose of the book and was unfufilled after finishing it, but after thinking about it in depth I began to appreciate the book more and more. Hemingway's simple language and uncomplicated storyline make the reader strive for the deeper meaning. This meaning is found within the symbolism of the story and anlysation of events. Within this simple story about a man who catches a fish are an array of complicated issues and deeper meanings. To me, Hemingway's genius is deeply apparent."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"So much of Hemingway's work paralleled his own life, this story is no different. Santiago the old man losing his ability to fish as he did in youth; Hemingway the aging writer without quite the literary prowess of his earlier years. Yet both of them are tied by the unpopular opinion that they have one 'big one' left in them. As the pages turn and the story unfolds, the reader discovers the poorly kept secret that they were both right. A lyrical story of poignance and import. An elegy for our greatest narrator. Well done."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful! To some it may seem like a simple story about an old man that is determined to catch a fish, but its so much more than that! When I read it for the first time, I felt Santiago's (the old man) pain. Every time that he got hurt or when the sharks were attacking his beautiful fish, I felt the weight of his trials and of his dispair at the end of the book. There is so much great symoblism in this book. It's not a weak book because Hemingway really knew what he was talking about and he definately had something to say about man's struggle with nature and human nature itself. This book is good because it takes hold of your emotions and senses, and makes you feel like you are actually there. I think that that's what makes good literature good."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's simplistic writing is such a refreshing read after stuffy Dickensian-like novels. Not only is The Old Man and the Sea just an all-around fantastic novella, it is also one that creates a sense of understanding and companionship between the reader and the main character, the old man..hence the title. Every single moment of the book was captivating as one feels the mental and physical strain that the old man suffers. By the end, I had to bust out the kleenex because I was bawling so much. Such a beautiful story. I won't spoil it for you, please read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea was an ok book. It's not the best I have ever read but it will do. It has inspiring messages like never giving up because if you belive you can achieve. And I belive that. the main character Santiago belived he can go out and catch a big fish and he did. But it showed that theres something out there always pushing you back from succeding. After he spent all that time at sea and caught the marlin well I'm not going to tell the whole story but its an ok book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read, and its only better when read in spanish. The more you read this book the more that you will appreciate Hemingway and his particular style."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a very simple, exciting and surprising book because of its low vocabulary level and descriptive scenes of a man fighting his bad luck and a huge fish. This review will tell what makes this book such a great edition to any bookshelf.This book is a very exciting and surprising. Truly this book was very shocking as shown on pg. 62 when the great marlin jumped out of the water into the basking sun. The book tells of an thrilling battle between man and fish. Another great event is when the old man is protecting his fish from the Galanos (sharks) because they can smell the raw bloody body hanging into the water. In fact, the book had breath taking events for instance, when the old man sees just how big the fish is and realizes he is going to be in for a fight of a lifetime. These are some of the great events that take place in The Old Man and the Sea.The Old Man and the Sea is a very simple book. Truly this great piece of work could be read by a 5th grader. The author Earnest Hemingway does not use figurative language at all in the book. The book has a very simple story line that is very easy to follow along with. That is what makes the book The Old Man and the Sea so easy to read.This book has a lot of great turn of events some small some big and some gigantic. Earnest Hemingway uses his great talents as a writer to make this book spin every which way. Some of the small turns are for instance, when the old man told his friend the boy that he was not going to eat but he ends up eating. A bigger event is that the old man is a very unlucky fisherman and on the day that he goes out on the sea he catches a nice size tuna before hooking his larger prey. The 2nd biggest turn of events was after the 86 days of no fish the old man catches the biggest marlin Havana Cuba has ever seen.Those are the elements that make Earnest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea such a good book. It's a nice book that is worth reading and something most anyone can enjoy. It has great action and dramatic scenes that will touch your heart and will put you on the edge of your seat wanting more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea ReviewHemmingway uses his character Santiago to show how persistence pays off. Santiago sets his goals on catching the big one, a marlin. He sets out to catch this huge fish, and when he finally does, he is unable to reel it in. After many days of being pulled around the sea, the giant marlin stops and Santiago pulls him in. Knowing that his persistence has paid off, he respects the fish and does everything not to hurt the fish. On his long trek home, Santiago's great catch is mauled by sharks and Santiago realizes even more how precious the marlin was. The book, The Old Man and the Sea was rich in hope and full of thrilling events, making it worth reading.I think the book flowed well and showed good style. I feel the book was good for both its time and style. The book fit its time well, considering how well Hemmingway described the technology and craftsmanship they had. Hemmingway's style was great in describing in detail everything that happened. The book was true to its theme, I thought, in saying that persistence pays off. Santiago proves while catching the marlin that persistence does pay off. Also with everything that's happening to Santiago, he kept working hard to achieve his goals. Hemmingway uses great descriptions in Santiago's problems, to say that persistence pays off.Hemmingway's way of writing brought out the story to make it seem somewhat real. Also his way of writing brought out the effects of the story in a great way. He used great detail, and made sure to accurately describe everything. He used descriptions that set the pace of the story and made sure the reader could picture what was happening. Santiago and the other characters fit the setting and story perfectly, with their actions and personalities. Hemmingway did a good job of coming up with characters that fit the story. He also did a good job of making sure that you knew the characters. Hemmingway made sure that you knew everything about the story in great detail.Hemmingway style of writing was very unique and had a good theme. His way of writing brought out the effects of the story very well. The story brought good thought to the saying \\"persistence pays off.\\" The book The Old Man and the Sea was rich in hope and full of thrilling events, making it worth reading."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Symbolizes between Man versus Nature\\"\\"Persistence: the act or fact of; persisting\\". This is one of the many things that the Man (Manolin) and the Nature (Marlin) share between each other or in other words, symbolize in each other. It's impossible for characters to just become alive. They must have a master or in stories point of view an author. The author of the book The Old Man and the Sea made the story a very intriguing book to read because of the struggles of Man vs. Nature keeps the story exciting with curiosity and interesting topics.The story has a lot of interesting facts and causes solid curiosity. But what facts are shown? What curiosity is given? How do the facts keep the book so interesting?Hemingway had the ability to take the story being so descriptive and making it feel like you were an actual character in the story. The fact that Hemingway has been so affective in writing and also has the capability of making one sentence from a kindergartens point of view into a marvelous story that is comprehensible for all ages.Hemingway keeps the story electrifying and energetic. The way the Marlin and Santiago are persistent keeps the story going. Man versus Nature is one of the key elements to the story. Being that the fish and man are both so persistent keeps the conflict between the two the main best moment in the novel. The book stays dynamic throughout the novel because of the author's potential in detailing his writing. The author's ability to turn a made up story into a well thought out story makes you feel like you're actually in the story, which is an incredible accomplishment. Having the ability to do so makes it interesting. Makes people wonder what else the extraordinary author can do.Relating to this story can be difficult. But with a writer like Hemingway and the ability to make the story more liable and related to life it's possible for all ages to relate to. Hemingway seeks for relationships between the Man and fish. I think this makes it easier for as an audience to relate towards the story. Santiago and the Marlin being persistent make it easy for the audience to relay towards the story.Hemingway's ability to judge the actions of Fish and man make it easy for us to relate. I think this makes it easier for us as an audience to relate towards the story.The author makes the story exciting because he uses clues from the Fishes actions and the Man's actions to make the story cause curiosity. He's causing curiosity from the Fishes and Man's s actions to keep the reader reading. He finds the obedience from the characters, erects them t perfect justification in making the story full of check points and curiosity points.The story keeps fresh and ongoing because of Hemingway's ability to keep the story full with curiosity. He also makes the story easy for the audience to relate to because he is able to judge the actions of the fish and Man.Hemingway's style of writing is unique and influential in many different ways. His ability to take an imaginative story and turn it into a masterpiece is unbelievable. In doing so, this makes me believe that The Fish (Marlin) and The Man (Santiago) share many things and in a way if you look at it in a different perspective.........are brothers!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Perseverance and determination. These are words that describe Santiago, the old man who is down on his luck in the book, The Old Man and the Sea. Santiago and his young friend Manolin haven't had the best of luck lately, but all of that is about to change. Ernest Hemmingway deserved the Pulitzer Prize for his wonderful portrayal of Santiago, the old man who just needed a break. Hemmingway's writing springs to life as this American classic grips the hearts of young readers, sucking them in to this novel with amazing force.The story of the old man and his trying heart is one that churns up raw emotion from readers from all walks of life. The story is that of an old man that has been down on his luck, it has been \\"eighty-five\\" days since the old man last caught a fish (19). Santiago and his young companion Manolin are starting to lose faith in the fish that they had been streaming in, the months before. On the eighty-fifth day Santiago goes out on his own, he finally finds a fish, not just any fish, but the most enormous fish in all the sea. This fish takes him on the journey of his life. Through ups and down, trials and tribulations, Santiago stays with the fish, and learns a lot about himself in the process. He becomes so obsessed with catching this fish that he puts his life on the line. Moreover, \\"Ill kill him, that fish, in all its greatness and its glory\\" as he becomes frustrated after many days at sea. To give away the end of this story would be like robbing Hemmingway of his right to surprise.Gut wrenching thrills and honest heart-tugging emotion are Hemmingway's toys; he plays with this masterpiece, making it a playground for great literature. For instance, \\"They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat\\" (108) Hemmingway wrote. The details are plentiful and make you feel like you are sitting in the boat being attacked by sharks along with Santiago. A young reader could easily fell as though they are a part of Ernest Hemmingway, almost as if they had with them a little piece of Hemmingway's soul, for it was always in his writing. He uses emotion in his writing to help the reader fell the spine jolting excitement and thrills that are displayed so often in Hemmingway's writing. For example, \\"The fish was coming in on his circle now, calm and beautiful looking, with only his great tail moving,\\" (91). The old man is emotional about the great fish; Ernest gets on to his characters making them feel true pain, his pain. This book is a joy to read and I would encourage others to do the same.While I was reading this book I felt as though I was in the sea right along with Santiago, feeling his pain and his happiness. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in great literature. I wholeheartedly thought that this book was a deserving candidate for the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Simplicity. This is the word that describes The Old Man and the Sea, a book with few, but meaningful, words. It is a glowing book because of its unique style that captures the reader's attention.There are many real life situations that help the reader relate to the position that Santiago, the old man, is in. The determination of Santiago when he is fishing is that of mine while learning how to ride a bike. For example, Santiago kills four sharks in order to help save the marlin, as well as his dream to catch this great fish. His struggles with the sharks are like those of everyday life. Along with determination, some readers can also relate to the guilt the old man has for killing the fish. For instance, Santiago is constantly apologizing to the marlin for ruining him. Many people do things that they regret, the way Santiago did. There are numerous relations that the reader can make with the characters in the book.The layout of the book adds to the interest of the reader. First, the story starts out describing the main character, and then tells about the struggles that he has. I feel that it is necessary to learn about the characters in a book before it gets to far down the road. This book has many things in common with other stories, but has originality that &quot;beefs&quot; it up. The rising actions lead to an exhilarating climax that takes the reader to another world. As soon as the sharks start eating the fish, Santiago's hopes and dreams of bringing the marlin in are destroyed. It is heartbreaking when the sharks eat the fish. The plot of the story complements the style of writing Ernest Hemingway uses.The Old Man and the Sea is a book that encourages the reader to pursue their dreams. It creatively adds to the plot of the story and helps the readers relate to what is going on during the book. Read this uplifting story for a great adventure in the sea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was an inspirational and intricate book. Although the book is in depth and very mature, it can be enjoyed by individuals of all ages. While experiencing this Hemmingway masterpiece, I was captured and intoxicated with the vivid images that his description threw into my mind. The Old Man and the Sea was well thought, organized and instilled a sense of understanding unmatched by that of even movies.The Old Man and the Sea was constructed in a way that can only be fully understood by an author of equal quality, but can still be felt by a reader that wants nothing more than a good book. For example Hemmingway has been to Cuba; several times he has also fished there very often. The Old Man and the Sea could have only been such a success with Hemmingway's experience. If the author would have been of no experience the book would lose; enthusiasm, strong voice, excitement and fluency, the book would have been a failure. Also giving the relationship with Monolin and Santiago, and how they couldn't, inspired a sense of longing. The longing that is sensed raises a question; of will that gap of longing be filled. This mere subtle fact of the book proves the books ultimate supremacy. The book is very short and descriptive; it is a good book for a reader that wants nothing else.To read The Old Man and the Sea is to fully experience and be Santiago fishing in the Gulf Stream for a marlin, the first catch in 84 days. For example words like \\"sudden lurch\\", \\"dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to tail\\". Words like these paint images in the mind, crystal clear and as it is pictured it is sensed, felt and experienced. This kind of description lifts the reader in the air and puts them at the setting it is the driving force of the books quality. Also Santiago has spent a great deal of time in his boat, about half his life. Events like these fully explain the characters personality. They let you know how they react to certain events, and what they think about various things. The Old Man and the Sea gives you a chance while at your home or work place, to visit Cuba for a dayThe Old Man and the Sea was well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. The book The Old Man and the Sea was a milestone in American literature, it will for ever change the way I look at reading. Although at a low reading level the book has a mature feel making it a good read to all ages. The Old Man and the Sea is for the reader that desires nothing more than a good book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea deserves every award it has received. Hemmingway uses his originality and personal experiences to create a literary masterpiece. The Old Man and the Sea is a classic tale of fate and determination, yet Hemmingway's style is what makes it so enjoyable to read.The plot provides a suspenseful journey through bad luck and hardships. \\"The Shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.\\" (114) This gives the reader a feeling like they are actually experiencing the same thing as Santiago. This makes it easier to relate with the characters. My favorite part of this intriguing tale was when Santiago came home and proved his skill with the skeleton of an 18 foot marlin. Satisfaction is one of the many feelings that overcome the reader after reading this book. Some feel satisfied, by an old man's dream to end an 86 day record.The author uses his characters in a unique way to express a deeper meaning. Such as, how Santiago and the marlin symbolize each other. The marlin symbolizes Santiago in his will and determination to never give up. The marlin fights through hunger, pain, and his stubbornness to not let go without a fight, which is not unlike Santiago. Yet another symbol is the vulnerability between the attacking sharks and Santiago. Santiago is vulnerable to the harassing fisherman and the sharks are vulnerable to Santiago's beatings. Unlike many authors these days, this book doesn't give you the literal meaning. Instead, Hemmingway makes the reader think and react to the story. This in turn, makes it exciting.I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a heartfelt adventure of an old man against his luck. Hemmingway's style adds to the excitement and drama of this epic tale, by using deep meanings and an unusual plot."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Those who haven't read Hemingway, this novel is a great way to start. It is short but you get an idea of how much Hemingway's novels make you think about life after you finish it. Is it worthwhile to be greedy? What makes a person good and what makes him bad? What is the definition of son and father? etc. You can find all kinds of questions running through the book that makes you think."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's best pieces. This book has been so well written that a fourth grader could read and comprehend this glorious book. The Old Man and the Sea is a fantastic story about an old Cuban fisherman who has years of bad luck and his enormous catch. This basic plot alone can not make a great novel. However, Hemingway found a stimulating way to add detail without overwording his ideas. This is a very important part about his style of writing that i like because of the ability to read a simple plot book without fighting to keep your eyes open. What i like also about Hemingway's writing style is how modern day society still relates to the society in his books. For example, the old man's will to catch the fish: even while the fishing line is cutting his bear hands, has no food to eat, harch weather conditions, and isolation from other people. This can be related to people that are willing to give up spending time going out to study day in and day out for a test so they can go to the best college. I believe what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that he was ok with sleeping in a one-room hut, that he was ok not catching fish in a long time, and that he was ok that people completely disregarded him. The las thin I liked about this book is the way Hemingway switches betwwen reality, the old man's thinking, and the old man's subcontinents. All in all I think this is a great book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's best pieces.

Many will already know the general plot of this story as the heroic struggle of an man past his prime against the elements and tribulations. I think the irony of the story is that the old man was defeated neither by the fish nor by the sharks, just as he was an undefeated arm wrestler in his youth. Still, he was forced to reconsider in his old age that dreaded question. \\"And what beat you, he thought. 'Nothing,' he said alound. 'I went out too far.'\\" Therefore, did the man defeat himself or was it simply Fate that pinned him? In the end, the boy cries, and there are only those African Lions of the dream world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a story about a simple man, with simple ideas, with a simple life, with a simple, elemental encounter with the natural world: he catches a massive marlin that he battles unsuccessfully to bring to market. It is a tale of success in the midst of failure, of quiet stoicism and courage, and refusing to give in to the challenges the world throws at him. Most of all, it is a story about courage.It is an excellent tale of how a man can overcome great tasks and survive terrible tragedies, while still having a will that is not defeated but rather presses on. The great task in this story is catching an extraordinary and noble fish.A story of an elderly fisherman who catches his greatest fish after days of bone-wearying battle only to lose it to sharks.After heading out to sea, he realizes he is in for a greater challenge than expected. The old man, Santiago, encounters a battle with a great creature of nature and the elements. But, it doesn't end there. The struggle to get home after being beaten by the elements is the greatest challenge of them all. The old man shows his endurance and determination by remaining calm in the face of danger.Santiago of Hemmingway is the oldest fictional fighter I have read or heard of to date . That fact makes him at least one of the inspirations to all the writers or real life warriors to follow him ."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of my favorite books.

The author seems to take great strides in telling a fish tale that could symbolize many things in life. This could symbolize man's battle and relationship with nature, man's determination, the shortcoming of men in realizing their dreams, and even the life of Christ. If you want to read a book with many level of symbolism, pick up this book. If you are like me, and you are more interested in a good story, there are many others that I would suggest picking up. If you are into both symbolism and story, pick up some George Orwell or the Bible. I think you will get more out of both."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book because I was doing extra credit for my L.A class.

This book demonstrates good morals, such as determination, perseverance, and believing in yourself. It also showed friendship that was very strong, it almost felt like a children's book.

For most, the story seems uneventful and boring. It may only appeal to those who are either def or blind. Anyone with a normal sense of sight or sound will find this story to be extremely boring and tiring.The plot of the book is too predictable. The exciting events are too few and far between. For example, (one of the main characters) only appears a few times in the book. Manolin isn't even that interesting. Lucky for the rest of us, he only appears a few times throughout the story. In addition to an already boring cast of characters, the old man (whom the book is focused on) is dull, weak and he avoids the potential for exciting events to take place. Also, the setting is not lively enough to fill the imaginations of the unfortunate readers. The time period is one that everyone can be fascinated with, permitting that the interesting highlights of the time period are used to liven the story. The location of the book is wonderful, but Hemingway over explains every little detail about the state of the place. Hemingway is an admired author who tends to forget certain characteristics of the plot, and over indulges other things in the story. The setting of the story is to the whole book, as alcohol is to Hemmingway.The Old Man and the Sea, only appeals to the def and the blind. Those of us with full or partial use of our ears and eyes can plainly sense that this story is uneventful. I especially was bored with the story. It was not an interesting topic. The only people who would be interested in the story are old fishermen. The poor children who are forced into reading this will find it unappealing. The story wasn't filled with action. Even someone who is into the topic will find the story too boring. The interesting events are too few and far between. Someone who has perfect vision or perfect hearing will still find this story boring and uneventful.In conclusion, The Old Man and the Sea is a boring worthless peace of nothing. Only the def and the blind consider it literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea wasn't very enjoyable to read. It seemed more age appropriate for readers around 45 and older. I find that at my age group, which are kids, are probably more into action and long adventures, then a relaxing trip made by an old man. That is usually what older people are into because that is always what they are talking about. I guess it all depends on what kinds of books you are into. I felt that The old Man and the Sea wasn't interesting at all.I found that the book The Old Man and the Sea wasn't an exciting or suspenseful story. For example, the quote, \\"Then came the same delicate pulling touch again,\\"42. Like I said before, not very exciting. Where's the suspense? In addition, \\"An airplane passed over on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish,\\" 71. See boring, sentences like this make the book not very exciting. Even for a long sentence that wasn't very suspenseful. The old Man and the Sea needs to be more suspenseful for the reader.I thought The old Man and the Sea was predictable, in most parts. For example, he said that the longest he has gone without a fish was 85 days, so then he goes on a fishing trip to find a fish. Right there you know he is going to come home with a fish. That makes the book no fun to read because the reader knows what is going to happen so then they don't want to finish. In addition, he fights a really big fish to match up his 85 day dead line. So the reader isn't going to give up because he has to make his 85day limit so he won't be a failure. He also can't give up because he doesn't want to be disappointed in him. All in all The Old Man and the Sea needs to not be so predictable.In conclusion, I found The Old Man and the Sea to be not very exciting or suspenseful. Because of reading this book I saw my friends falling asleep while reading it. To find out which age group fits this book and find it more enjoyable, people can find older age groups, have them read it and see what they say. We already know what the younger people think. Again it all depends on what kinds of books different people are into. Although reading this book makes people expand their horizons and stick with something even though they really don't like it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Earnest Hemmingway received a special award for this piece The Old Man and the Sea. Although his book was boring and slow, the plot of the story was interesting and sometimes even exciting.Even though Earnest Hemmingway has been recognized for some amazingly written books in the past, this book certainly wasn't one of them. Throughout this story Hemmingway's style of writing is very repetitive. He over-used the phrase \\"He said, Santiago said, etc.\\" By using such repetitive words and language the reader could become easily bored and may even get annoyed. They might also lose interest in the story, and maybe in the author. However, there were a few things Hemmingway did well. When the story took a turn and got interesting, I quickly became hooked. I think if Hemmingway's writing style was like this throughout the book, it would have been more interesting and more liked by a larger audience. There for although Hemmingway's style was boring, it was simple and easy to follow.Many people would like this book but mainly the younger kids would prefer it. For instance the language used in this story is simple and easy to follow. I think that younger kids would enjoy reading this book because Hemmingway uses easy to understand language younger kids will become fans of his writing. Hemmingway's style of writing is easier for the younger audience to follow. He doesn't go into deep description and details. I think that younger people would prefer this book over adults. Hemmingway is a simple writer.Just because Hemmingway was awarded a special honor for this book doesn't mean it was great. Throughout the story Hemmingway was very repetitive with his word choice. He also used vague and boring language. I personally didn't enjoy the book because of its boring events, but that doesn't mean other people wouldn't feel differently."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was terrible I had to read it for school which may color my opinion... The man did not shut up about the stupid fish. Hemingway was one of those authors who never got to the point If he was going to write about a sruggle could he write about one in real life. Comparing life and struugle to a fish suggestts serious problems some of you will say it was the struggle with the fish that was important but it wasn't. Joe DiMaggio was a bad code hero because he lived in the characters fantasy. and heros have to be in real life to all of you having to read it for school invest in CLiff Notes if allowed it'll save you the time and annoyance."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"it could be single-handedly responsible for narcolepsy.

It talks about the life of a old man who has been unlucky lately with his captures of fish and who has an apprentice with him that is not allowed to go with him because of his bad luck.

The Old Man and the Sea. New York: Collier Books, 1952, 127.The Old Man and the Sea is an exciting and adventurous book about an old man going on a fishing trip to try to catch the perfect fish. The old man is a professional fisherman who makes a poor living catching fish. So he sets his sail and goes out to sea. The way the old man catches his fish is by holding a long piece of rope with a hook and a piece of bate on the end of it. So while sailing he hooks up a huge Marlin that will make him rich. But the problem is that a group of macho sharks are going after his fish. The old man has to struggle with life threatening situations like starvation, dehydration, and the pain of holding on to the rope that will cut through anything. Will he bring in the fish in time before the sharks tear all of its flesh off? Will he get rich? \\"The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.\\" This book is for readers who like fishing and excitement through the whole book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea was probably one of the best books that I read this year. I would recommend this book to anyone. Although this book is not as fast paced as some other books out today, it still has some very good qualities. One quality that I thought was good as a young person was that it was an easy read. Also the book has less than 150 pages and does not contain a wide range of vocabulary. However the book being short and not containing a wide range of vocabulary doesn't mean you can't learn anything from it. This book contains some very valuable life lessons and philosophy."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is a hero. And the hero has courage.And the hero shows silent courage and dedication to his task. And the task is a great task , and one whose meaning does not end in itself alone, but has greater human significance. An old man is battling a fish . And the fish is greater and stronger than him. And the old man in the battling uses all the wisdom of his experience. And the old man in seeking to catch and bring home the great fish , struggles with all he has. And the old man is destroyed but not defeated .And what he is he teaches to the ' boy' who is his helper who will be a fisherman after him. And will continue to be what he is.The language is simple and clear. The description is clean and light. The story is simple and moving.The parable is also readily understandable. Man at his best struggles with all he is against a Nature, a world , a Cosmos indifferent to him and ultimately stronger than he is. Yet in the manner of the struggle, the grace under pressure, the courage Man reveals himself to have a dignity which is great and uplifting.Hemingway toward the end of his days writes the parable of his own struggle , and of his own ideal conception of Mankind in the Universe. And he does it in such a convincing way so as to enable us the readers to take greater pride and hope in our own humanity."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book has had volumes written about it's subtext, it's reflection of modern society on old world morals, or as a metaphor about the individual versus globilization. This story is simply about a man catching a fish. It is written so well that you can smell the salt air, your skin burns from the unforgiving sun, and you muscles ache with the struggle of pulling in a really big fish. Beautifully written. Hands down my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Even though this is the last book in Hemingway's career, it is probably his most well-known. This is, indeed, one of the books that won him the Nobel prize, an extraordinary thing to win in the literary world.It's a tale about an old man named Santiago who hadn't caught a fish in 80 days. You would think that that would be no big deal, other than money-wise, but the village people have tagged him as unlucky and washed-up, and a boy named Manolin, whom he loved as a son, was not allowed to fish with him any more.One day he sets out to sea in a small skiff, and he hooks a gigantic marlin (kind of like a swordfish, but really very pretty). The marlin drags him far out to sea, and he feels a great connection with the fish. During the time that he's out to sea, he talks to himself and to the sea a great deal, experiences great pain, and just the teeniest bit starts to lose his mind... in the end, he does kill the marlin, but he finds out that the thing is two feet longer than his boat. This is also a really sad time for him because all through the book it talked about his connection with nature; he called the fish his brother.To recap: He's two days out to sea, he just realized that this HUGE fish that he caught has to be TOWED IN to shore, and he's totally spent both mentally and physically. There would have been a little bit of a chance of getting back to shore with his fish, but then... a large Mako shark appears. A bite is taken out of the fish and the blood pours into the water.Poor old Santiago has to watch as shark after shark comes and rips apart his beautiful fish, and when he gets back home, almost the entire thing is gone, except for the tail, the skeleton, and the head. Santiago is battered and bruised, not only from the catching of the fish, but also from trying to fight off the sharks.It works out okay in the end- Manolin gets to fish with the old man again, and the village fishermen have respect for Santiago. The end just makes you so sad-happy (now that's an oxymoron if I ever saw one), though- an American couple sees the skeleton with the head taken off (Manolin got the head) and they think that the fish is a SHARK. But Santiago's alive, and everything's okay.I just gave the bare facts; if you really want to experience the beauty of the text then you have to read it for yourself. :)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Hemingway published THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, it had been sometime since he had last published anything that would stand as being among his best work. Like too many writers, too many years of hard living and very hard drinking had taken its toll. He had tasted success, and perhaps he was no longer as hungry as he had once been. But whatever the circumstances, he managed to resummon his considerable talents for one final masterpiece.The remarkable thing about THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is that it tells a story so simple that a child can appreciate it (I read it to my daughter when she was seven years old, and she loved it--she wanted to know more about this mysterious and obviously great Joe DiMaggio) yet only an adult can fully appreciate. It also represents graphically Hemingway's own philosophy of life, a philosophy that even his own suicide couldn't completely negate. Hemingway was fascinated with Norse mythology, and the imagery of the gods and heroes of Valhalla struggling against an enemy against whom they were destined to fail fascinated him. Like them, he felt that the struggle was everything. The Old Man of the story similarly struggles to win with victory improbable. But in the end, his failure to bring his magnificent blue marlin to market pales beside the courage and fortitude he displays in his struggle.Everything about this simple tale is &quot;just right.&quot; It is the right length for the story, has just the correct number of characters to keep it from feeling too sparse or too cluttered, just the precise, deft language needed to tell the tale. It partakes almost more of the folktale than the modern short novel. And in his depiction of The Old Man, Hemingway has created one of his greatest characters, simultaneously noble, simple, wise, and courageous."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have never been a fan of Ernest Hemingway, but The Old Man and the Sea is a truly classical story.Set in Cuba during the 1960's, an old fisherman named Santiago seeks to catch fish: a feat which he has not accomplished in eighty-four days. Outlasted by successful fishermen with better equipment, Santiago can only hope to catch fish the old-fashioned way with the help of his apprentice, a young boy named Manolin, whom the boy's parents eventually force to work on a different, more successful boat.Santiago sets out to change his 'losing streak.' When a giant marlin takes his bait, he struggles with the great fish for several days until he finally catches it. To his great dismay, sharks that are by Santiago's boat attack the fish's body, and it is completely devoured, leaving only a skeleton.With the skeleton as his only record of the great catch, Santiago returns to Cuba. What will happen to his apprentice, Manolin, as well as Santiago's well being after an apparent defeat by the sharks, is up to the reader to find out.Hemingway conveyed a powerful message in a very short book. This story can be enjoyed by anyone who likes classical books or simply good reading in general."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A short, simple tale of an old Cuban fisherman who decides to try his luck one day against a marlin that exceeds the maximum weight limit for any fish! The marlin puts up a fight, and the old man's astonishing bravery and incredible wisdom allows him to put up a fight. Who wins? Read the book to find out! This is a truly fishy tale that tells of one man's courage and defeat. I would recommend this book to readers around middle school and up. Be warned, though. The big is rather dry, and goes along at a slow pace. But its marvelous descriptions and easy-to-follow plot makes it a book suitable for all readers, even me!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, by Ernest Hemingway, is a short story depicting an aging fisherman's quest against his decreasing health and a powerful force of nature. The old man's quest began following his second longest \\"record\\" of 85 days, when he caught the biggest struggle of his life. Despite the old man's wisdom, due to his many years on and around the ocean, he depended on the resect and love he held for the young boy to pull him through.The book, in my opinion, was enjoyable and absorbing in all aspects. The conflict was easy to relate to because of its clairity and simplicity, yet still contained a strong underlying complexity. My most favorite part of the book was the old man's struggle with the marlin. My least favorite part was in the end, when dispite the old man's many attempts, he had to watch helplessly as his prize got ripped from his grasp.I recommend this book to almost everyone because of it's easy to follow story line, yet complex underlying conflict. This book, in my opinion, is most suitable for an advanced middle school level to college level reader. This book will also suit almost any kind of reader regardless of previous book preferences."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was very surprised at how fast this order was received.

It had good parts, but I felt like it dragged on a little long at parts. Basically it just didn't really keep my interest throughout, which to me, is a major quality of a book. I can't say this is a book everyone will love because I didn't. But I did give it five stars because it is considered a classic and Hemingway is considered one of the best authors of all time. I also noticed that many books I have read before followed the same pattern as this, which to me in its own qualifies a book as a classic. Give it a chance, see if you like it. It may become one of your favorites, you may hate it.

There was nothing that special about the book. I thought that it was kinda of boring. All it talks about is an old man and a little boy going fishing and they don't catch a big fish for a long time.The old man has gone fishing for 84 days without catching a single fish. It is on the 85th day when he finally catches a big fish. The old man goes out by himself and ends up catching a big fish called a Marlin. The old man was surprised that the fish was that big. The tail was a very pale lavender and it also had purple stripes all over its body. The fish kept pulling the old man further out into the ocean and there was nothing the old man could do about it. When he finally caught the fish he had to tie it to the boat because it was so big that it would not fit in the boat. But other fish,sharks start to eat the fish when he starts to bring it in to the shore. All that is left of the fish to prove that he caught a big fish was the skeleton of the big fish he caught. I thought that the book jumped around too much. I really had a hard time following it. I was getting messed up when he would say someone's name. I could never remember whose name was whose. Like the old man's name was Santiago and the little boy's name was Manolin."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man And The Sea was a great book that took me on a long journey through out the struggles of Santiago a Cuban fisherman that has naught had a catch in 84 days. The old man seemed to be very wise and would not give up. The old man had a friend named Manolin. Their friendship stays strong throughout the story.Santiago is a good man and Manolin is forbidden by his parents to work further with Santiago because he is bad luck. Their friendship goes on though and Manolin helps providing Santiago with food clothes and bait. The old man seems to have had a successful past with fishing this is told with his badly scarred hands and many wrinkles. Santiago is optimistic and does not give up on fishing and instead decides to go deeper into the ocean to catch fish.Santiago sets out early in the morning and sets out towards the deep sea to catch tuna. Hemingway describes the ocean with sensory details, telling how the ocean smells as Santiago leaves the land, how the ocean looked filled with see weed and how the fish sounded as they flew out of the water. I had a very good picture in my head of the ocean that Santiago was sailing into. Santiago seems very peaceful and respectful as he waits for the fish to bite, referring to the ocean as a female unlike most fisherman that would think of the ocean as masculine and capable of destruction.The old mans wait is over as he feels a fish nibble on his line. Santiago waits awhile as the fish keeps nibbling. This part of the book was boring because Santiago was just thinking about his friendship with Manolin and Joe Dimaggio. The struggle of catching this Marlin goes on through the night and into the next day. Santiago starts experiencing more problems that made me think he was going to give up. Hunger, sleep deprivation and pain in his hand had all made me think his struggle would soon be over and he would give up on this large fish. Santiago had finally won the battle and had caught the marlin. This made me feel like the struggle was all over but he still had not won.Santiago had started his journey back to land. Many sharks had attempted to eat the fish and the first one was successful in taking much of Santiago's catch. I showed he really wanted this catch because he had tried everything to catch this fish and to defend it against sharks. Santiago was a good man and felt sorry for the fish and was regretting that he had ventured out so far into the ocean. I felt frustrated for Santiago in the end because he was such a hard working old man and had some bad luck."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEAFor me and probably many other people, Ernest Hemmingway brings the thought of a great writer, one who won the Pulitzer Prize for his ability and talent to write stories. However, after reading his short story The Old Man and the Sea I have yet many doubts. The Old Man and the Sea is a simple worded short story that lacks in the ability to captivate its audience.The plot of the story begins with a persistent man, who has one thing on his mind, fish, but in the end the persistence is replaced with defeat. For instance, Santiago had been fishing persistently for eighty-five days without catching a single fish. To me persistence means pushing on towards your goal and not giving up easily, Santiago took this to a new level. It ended up being the persistent attitude that defeated him in the end. Although, Santiago had persistence, many people believed he had bad luck. An example of this is when he came back from an eighty-five day fishing trip without a single fish. Many times during the book it seemed impossible that Santiago has bad luck, but in the end it prevailed. So although Santiago is a persistent man who knows the concept of never giving up, his bad luck catches up top him in the end.This book is not a book that grabs hold of your attention, and leaves every word dripping with excitement. For example, Hemmingway's style is concise and uncluttered but not elaborate. This was not a book I enjoyed, not because it was simple, but because it wasn't exciting. I think someone who enjoys short stories, and the adventures of sea would enjoy this book more then someone like me who likes mysteries. In addition, to not being exciting, it is also choppy. There are many sentences that don't flow, or that don't grab your attention. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who just wants to read a good book. I might recommend it to a person who wants to study a concise, uncluttered, simple worded book. In conclusion, I think this book was written for style and not excitement. It was a simple book, which made it easy to read and understand, but was not a book that captured my attention.After reading The Old Man and the Sea, it made me think why was this man known as a great writer? I also thought about the way Hemmingway described Santiago, and how well he portrayed the life of a fisherman, and all the different struggles that one might go through in order to make a living. I know now why Hemmingway won the Pulitzer Prize. It was because he had an amazing way of describing a life, much like Santiago's and though his books may be simple and not filled with as much excitement as other books, he has the amazing ability of taking someone like a fisherman, and making a story out of their simple, lives somewhat interesting. So even though I most likely would not read this book again, and I most certainty wouldn't recommend it to someone, I still have a great deal of respect for Hemmingway's ability to portray a life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I found the story of Santiago and his quest for final glory enduring and inspiring. Hemingways amazing use of simple language to paint the most vivid and colourful pictures shows why he is considered an all time great. No word is wasted in any of his sentences, with even the word &quot;the&quot; playing a profound role in his ability to make you feel the characters emotion and experiences.Santiago is an old, fading fisherman living in a coastal Cuban fishing town. He is quite poor (in material possesion), but has a richness of character that is recognised by only him and his friend; a young boy.Santiago is down on his luck as he heads out by himslef to break his losing streak. He manages to latch on to an enormous Marlin, far stronger than him, but his experienced fishing skills and his will to survive push him to pursue the fish for many days and many miles out to sea. His struggle and pain are brought to you in a clear, precise way, while his obvious respect for the beauty of the fish is expounded during glimpses of its majestic fight.Hemingway seems to like fishing, as the theme comes into many of his novels. He describes the intricacies in understood detail, creating greater depth to Santiagos struggle. In the end Santiago wins his pursuit of the giant, beautiful fish and starts his journey home. It is here that we begin to feel the most compassion for Santiago as his fight continues; fending off scavenging sharks taking hits from his trophy piece. By the time he hits home (early in the morning) he is exhausted and all that remains is the skeleton of a legend.As I have mentioned, I found this book an inspiring tale of not giving up and pursuing ones glory. I have since reread this book beneath the canopy of palm leaves by the pristine Indian ocean of Western Australia. The white sands and surrounding scenary the perfect place to rediscover Santiagos glory.If you are not into Hemingway, I suggest this as your first. If, like me, you love Hemingway, then it would be obvious to suggest that you read this meaningful tale.

However, I think that a more thought out plot than rowing, fishing, and reeling was in order, especially from an author of Hemmingway's caliber. The story takes place in a fishing village in Cuba and focuses around Santiago, an old man that has not caught a fish in 84 days. He decides one day to go far out to sea in search for &quot;the big fish.&quot; When he finally hooks a marlin,it takes Santiago three days to reel in a fish, proving his determination. However, on his way back to shore, sharks eat the fish which is attatched to the boat. This is a great example of irony, but the message that I got from the book was never give up, and this event shot that out of the water and seemed confusing to me. It was a very detailed book and I would recomed it to college students or older."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After reading several of Hemingway's novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls, A Farewell to Arms, The Sun Also Rises) I was struck with how eloquent, poetic, and to the point 'The Old Man and the Sea' was.It was definately his most beautifully written book that I have read. Using simple words, with few words over two syllables, Hemingway makes us feel as though we are in the skiff with Santiago, the Old Man. There is a short setup where Santiago describes his struggles as of late by going 80 plus days without catching a fish, and how, even with the lack of fish, he goes out day after day in search of another fish.The novel describes Santiago's struggles with a fish, a marlin, that is the largest that Santiago has ever seen. As Santiago struggled to haul in the fish, one can't help but feel sorry for the old man, and cheering that he will land the fish.The novel is capped off by a trademark ending that is indicative of Hemingway. I largely enjoyed the novel, and my one complaint is that I wish that it were longer."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's short novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1953, and undoubtedly played a role in his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. The book tells the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman and of his epic struggle with a gigantic marlin.This is a simple, straightforward story of courage and endurance. For most of the book, the old man is totally alone (aside from the animals he encounters) on his boat. Hemingway fills the book with memorable details about marine life and the fisherman's trade. An interesting touch is the invocation, throughout the book, of U.S. baseball player Joe DiMaggio as an iconic figure.Hemingway's style has been justly celebrated over the decades, and his writing in this book is remarkable. In &quot;The Old Man&quot; he achieves a purity, clarity, and stark beauty that remind me of the poetry of Stephen Crane. This book is an enduring classic, and Hemingway's old man is one of the most memorable characters in American literature. If you like this book, also try &quot;The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor,&quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"10 July, 1999 A.D./2542 B.E. Chiang Mai, Northern ThailandTHE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, Hemingway's greatest work, leads to a reading of THE EPISTLE OF JAMES and to the entire BIBLE. Santiago means St. James in Spanish. Remember, Hemingway had first heard the story of a fisherman's struggle for four days at sea from his good friend Carlos Guiterrez in Cuba in 1934. Hemingway waited sixteen years to write THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA in Dec., 1950-early Feb., 1951. In the years between his first knowledge of the story and his own lyrical rendering of it, Hemingway took Mass in Spanish in Cuba on far more than one occasion. Examine, for instance, the fact that all the characters in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA are named after Catholic saints or Apostles. &quot;La Carta de Santiago&quot; is from the Spanish New Testament; its English translation is &quot;The Epistle of James.&quot; Like THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, &quot;The Epistle of James&quot; focuses on themes of patience in the face of adversity, of enduring life's struggles for the sake of a greater good, and of gaining inner peace. Manolin, the Cuban boy's nickname, is the Spanish nickname for Manuel, a name derived from the prophecy of the Christ child Emmanuel in &quot;The Book of Isaiah&quot; in THE OLD TESTAMENT. Perico is the Spanish nickname for Pedro, which means Peter in English. Peter, of course, is another of Christ's apostles. Intrigues me that Santiago is the name of two vital figures in Christianity, Santiago del Zebedeo/St. James of Zebedee (whom Christ first met as a fisherman) and Christ's brother, Santiago/St. James the Martyr, who was stoned to death in Jerusalem. Martin, the owner of The Terrace bar who is generous to the impoverished Santiago, is also the name of two famous Catholic saints who were extraordiarily helpful to the poor, St. Martin of Tours of France and St. Martin de Poores. St. Martin of Poores is regarded as the patron saint of Afro-Cubans due to his incredibly generosity and sacrifice for African slaves in South America in the 1600s. And from the time he returned from Spain in 1939 to the time he wrote THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA at the Finca Vigia, Hemingway attended Spanish Mass in Cuba. Readings from &quot;La Carta de Santiago&quot;/&quot;The Epistle of James&quot; figure prominently in the Catholic Liturgical Calendar Year B, Ordinary Time(normally, in the September of every B cycle year). Santiago makes his journey for his marlin in September, &quot;the month when the big fish come.&quot; September is hurricane season in Cuba, by the way, meaning Santiago knows he is risking his life. No, it's not too bad that this is Hemingway's shortest novel. In many ways, it is his richest and deepest work, and moreover, truest to his aesthetic. Five stars are not enough! Rock hard and ride free, Cool Papa H.! Hemingway evidences an incredible understanding of Cuban culture in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA as he tells a story of one man's struggle to carry his dream at high sea in the face of death. Ultimately, his journey is spiritual at its core: Santiago's ability to accept the butchering of the marlin by the sharks, and his resolution at the end to continue going out to sea, teach us volumes on how to carry our own dreams in the seas we sail in our time. Santiago's story is timeless as love and endures with all the grace of every wave hitting all the shores of all the beaches of all the world. Reviewer: Mike Tucker"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have, I think, read everything that Hemingway ever had published. As a youngster he was my favorite fiction writer and has remained so, although I have read a great many books in the interim, some by great writers.Ernest Hemingway has had many detractors, but his writing speaks for itself. He needs no other champion.Of all his stories, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is perhaps his best. In it, an old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, fishing by himself, catches a giant, magnificent marlin, after a terrible struggle, and makes it fast to his small boat. On the way home, however, it is eaten by the sharks, leaving only a skeleton.The story is, reputedly, autobiographical. The story itself is the great marlin, and the sharks are the critics, which have dogged Hemingway's declining career, panning such efforts as &quot;Over the River and Into the Trees,&quot; and disparaging him generally as an aging has-been.With &quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; Hemingway proved, to them and himself, that he could still write magnificent prose. For it he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature--a prize at which he had previously scoffed, saying that no one who had ever received it had subsequently written anything worthwhile.Hemingway's literary style--his clipped, unadorned approach--has been often aped but never equaled. He was a true original, and most important; he was a sensitive observer of humanity and its follies. But, never an observer only; he was a participant. &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro,&quot; if not autobiographical at least was based upon his own experience. He knew the people of whom he wrote. He had been a combatant and a journalist and a fisherman and a hunter: a man's man.Like all really notable writers of fiction, he had lived his stories. I suggest that you read his work for yourself, and disregard the slurs of the effete intellectual snobs who slyly claim that he was a latent homosexual, and contrive to belittle his genius. They are like the sharks he portrayed, who would destroy the great prize of his legacy. Heed them not. In spite of his tragic death, he was a peerless writer.&lt;P&lt;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What an incredible story. I read this in less than two hours (it is a novella) and upon completing this simple story, I had a incredibly overwhelming satisfaction toward the ferocity of the human spirit. Yes, this book is all story but the main idea is all spirit. Those that can't see the incredible battle within are not READING the story, just the words. As a simple by-product, this book led directly to Ernest Hemingway's receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954.This story features three main characters: the old man (Santiago), a young boy (Manolin), and the human spirit. Santiago takes on the once-in-a-lifetime catch of a prize marlin which is described and portrayed in a manner to draw out the challenge facing each individual, both physically and emotionally. Santiago hasn't had a catch in 84 days. On day 85, he decides that, no matter what, he'll not return with a catch. Indeed, that was his fate. Santiago experiences physical pain, emotional pain, spiritual pain, and the pain of being alone with the elements. Yet, he continues on, creating hope where there is none. Before this story reaches it conclusion, getting right with life, Santiago decides it is he or the marlin.This story is incredible. It deserves(d) all the critical acclaim received. Once again, those who didn't find this story touching their soul didn't read the story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is the best book of all times!I have this book in many languages and enjoy collecting every edition of it ! here we follow a man who represents us all in a way ,and the fish represents our struggle in life. Our hero in this book is not a King , a prince, a knight or a leader who has all the materialistic powers in the world, but here we meet Santiago who is a very old ,poor cuban fisherman who struggle in life and we follow this simple mans struggle of his in this book . In todays world where everything is about materialism ,one can read this book and understand the simplest and important things in life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Man and The SeaI believe that The Old Man and the Sea is one of the best books I have ever read. I liked it because it is a really interesting and a really well written and described book. This book is about an old man who always went fishing, but he had bad luck for about eighty-four days. His bad luck went away. One day he went fishing and grabbed a marlin, one of the biggest marlins in history. Later his problems started. At first the marlin was so big the marlin was carrying the boat,with the old man inside. The old man spent three days fighting with the marlin, until the third day when the marlin was tired and the old man was able to pull it. When the marlin was one meter away from the boat the old man killed it with a paddleboat. The marlin bled a lot. Later more and more problems occurred.My favorite character was Santiago also called the old man. Santiago is an old man he was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. He was a very generous, nice and very perseverant old man. The Old Man and The Sea mostly takes place in the waters of the Gulf Stream.I believe the author did a very good job with this book. It is a real page-turner. It once kept me reading for an hour: for me that is like a world record.I think that if you would ask anyone how many stars do you give to The Old Man and The Sea I bet every one would say four or five. I am one hundred percent sure I would give it five stars. The books moral is being perseverant, never give up, and if you put your mind to something you will achieve it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in Chinese,and I plan to read it in English again.(Maybe something that I am writting is not good translation from Chinese to English)I think the best way to understand a novel is to read it in its original language.Hemingway is one of my favorite authors.I like his style.&quot;Less is more.&quot;He uses the words that are not hard for me to understand,and they express his thoughts as well as the big words.In The Old Man and the Sea,Hemingway tells us a story about an old fisherman's experience on the sea.The part I like best is after the old man's way home after he finally catches the big fish,but he doesn't have enough strength to protect his victory from the sharks.He is all tried thirsty and hungry.Unfortunately,the sharks eat his fish bit by bit.So when he gets home,the fresh of the fish is gone,only the bone left there.Hemingway uses symbols a lot.For example,the old man's dreams of lions play on the beach represent the old man's youth and power.The old man is a hero that Hemingway creates successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book at one go at a local bookshop. It's bad that I did it but how could one stop reading when one's heart is captured the first instance one lay one's eyes on the first sentence of the book? Pausing will only result in breaking the feel the book gives me and to continue later will not give me back the same feeling. I know that.This book is about an old Cuban fisherman, yes. But to me it is much more than that. It's about how one struggles in life just to live and also at the same time how one could appreciate what one has and treasure the pleasures that one is lucky to be bestowed from time to time. It's also about determination and perseverance, of how one should never let go without a good fight. For those who has been a warrior, this book will ring deep in the heart.The prose that Hemingway employ is extremely simple yet beautiful. Conveying beautiful messages in simple sentences is not easy but in this little novella, one can see ample demonstration on how a master of prose employs it so elegantly. Read it and feel good about it. If you're as unlucky as the old man one day, this book will surely be your best companion as it is as real and as good as it can get."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I, like many, have laboured my way through a number of books that are hailed as modern classics and have been left wondering why they are acclaimed as such. Therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I began reading the tale of Santiago, the ancient Cuban fisherman. Do not be put off by critics eager to impress upon you how they grappled with the religious symbolism and spiritual undercurrent. Instead Hemingway's crisp, clear style will have you loosening your collar as you bake in the hot sun on the Old Man's boat. In this slim volume you share in Santiago's recollections, friendships, joys and his frustration. Despite the brevity of this book, it is a must for anyone who wishes to enjoy one of the ultimate displays of power through the written word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am no fan of The Old Man and the Sea, but it's worth publicising more widely the little-known story of its genesis. The Old Man and the Sea was actually an allegory of Hemingway's doomed attempts at wooing Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn = marlin: geddit?). He saw himself as the &quot;evolved&quot; being of man against the &quot;shark&quot; of his contemporary Arthur Miller who nipped and nipped and was the ultimate victor of her affections."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Pulitzer Prize winning novel about a lonely old Cuban fisherman's went out to the sea, attempt to catch a big fish.The quest however lasted longer than he expected. A touching story which illustrated the meaning of great determination and one should never give up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a great short novel. Hemingway's vividly describes every aspect of the book from the setting to the thoughts of the Old Man. The story begins with the man ending a day of fishing in the gulf off of Cuba. This day was just like the last 84 days for the man, he had not caught a single fish. The man went out the next day with the same intentions as the as the day before and the day before that. He hoped to catch a large marlin that he might find in the deep waters of the gulf. He didn't know that he was to embark on the most significant fishing trip of his life. The main character Santiago is the old man that battles nature. The boy that assists the old man is the only important in the beginning and end of the book and not the climax. The book is short and goes into great detail about the old man's struggle against nature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Before reading this book I was not a reader who looked for deeper meanings of books, but rather tried to take them at face value. This book changed everything! Ernest Hemingway's simple sentences managed to enchant a teenager who rarely cares to read. The enormity of what Hemingway does has been replicated by few in history. THe struggle of the old man against himself makes each of us examine more closley our own existence and helps us face the challenges that each of us are faced with. Hemingway is classic, and I would suggest that one would take the time to read this great work of American art."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Not much to say about such a masterpiece. Simply one of the best books I've ever read and certainly one of my top three favourites. Hemingway was awarded the Novel Prize for Literature and upon reading this one can easily see why. A great read for a lazy Sunday afternoon (not that it isn't important to find other time to read it). A short, simply and excellent read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I actually saw the movie years ago but decided to read the book out of shear curiosity of the legend himself, Earnest Hemingway. The Old Man and the Sea is a classic tale of hardship described in terms that only Hemmingway knows how to do.The book is about an old Cuban fisherman who has had an 84 day streak of bad luck. The old man is respected, but has become a kind of bad luck symbol to the local fisherman of Cuba. The old man fish's day in and day out searching for the one fish that is going to break his unlucky streak and boy does he find it.Positive points: The struggle seems real, as if I was in the boat with him. I got the feeling that man and animal are one and the same, both the old man and the fish were after the same thing, survival. It's a story about beating the odds during the hard times of life (and it demonstrates this well).Negative points: The story is overly simplistic, which makes it extremely easy to read; however, there are some parts of the book that drag on a bit. I found myself thinking, \\"Come on old man, catch the dam fish already.\\"Conclusion: Worth the read, if you have the time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I liked the book Old Man and the Sea. It was interesting, fairly well written, and easy to read. The theme of this book i8s that sometimes you can get caught up in something that may not be good for you, and you don't even realize how much it's affecting you until it is too late. The main character in this book is an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago.He is very stubborn and set in his ways, and he often forgets to eat.The other fishermen look down on him and thoink he is rather eccentric, but his best friend and former fishing partner, a young boy named Manolin, remains loyal to him and often comes to bring him food and support. Santiago views the boy with tenderness, and has no harsh feelings for the other fishermen.Baseball is his favorite thing, and his hero is Joe DiMaggio.During the course of this book, he begins to appreciate his homemore, as well as the boy and the other fishermen. He realizes the importance of having people to help him, and the value of friendship. The climax is when he catches the marlin and brings it home. The conflict is man vs. nature, and it is resolved when he returns."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A fascinating tale of man and his conquest. A rather short book by most standards but packs a powerful punch.If you are looking for the ultimate pocket book, this is it. It will keep your attention.Ever wonder what it would be like to sail alone, read it and find out."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Fantastic book with excellent symbolism, but the small amount of plot development vs. number of pages in the middle of the book seemed to me to be Hemingway fleshing out the novella for his publisher. Or perhaps, with one of the themes of the book being perserverance, Hemingway was deliberately making his readers perservere at the book. From the reviews I've skim-read nobody seems to have mentioned the pessimism that seems to somehow parallel the hope in the book (the sharks killing the Marlin obviously). Don't forget that this was one of Hemingway's last works before he shot himself. Perhaps we are getting a look into the troubled psyche of the great author himself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I just have a brief comment on this so-called &quot;legendary&quot; American novel. It has been a while since i read the fun little book, so it might deserve a second glance. Nonetheless, i'd like to say that in my opinion, one should be able to remain awake during a &quot;good&quot; book. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case with Old Man And the Sea. Though it's symbolic references may be partially interesting, what is the use of a book if it can't even keep you awake or inspired. Simplicity may be able to be used to an advantage in some cases, but i found that in Old Man and the Sea, the attempt was a flailing and defeated one. I won't criticize Hemingway himself because i have yet to read his other novels, but i must say this was a particularly big dissapointment. Authors hitting closer to home to being &quot;legendary&quot; american novels would be Kerouac or even Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The movie and the story has always been one of my favorates.

The fisherman's struggle to bring his greatest catch ever, the shark, in from the sea while it is slowly and painfully bitten and chewed up by the other fish along the way is the metaphor for life's struggles. Every unknown man, trying to achieve something in anonymopus splendor, can relate to it.

This is a decent story of a old man taking on a big fish (a marlin) at sea. Duh. Right?Is the story that interesting? No. However, if you know a little about Hemingway, it seems as if this is almost autobiographical. Not in the normal sense, but that he was talking about himself getting older and not being able to catch the big fish. Maybe this is obvious, I don't know. But when this book came out Hemingway had not had a hit (had not caught a &quot;big one&quot;) for a long time. But it all worked out. Hemingway got a Nobel prize shortly after this. Maybe the old man wasn't so old. This is a ok book. However, if you want something a little more engaging read The Snows of Kilimanjaro(sp?). A shorter and much more entertaining read by Mr. Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea\\"He was an old man who finished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream andhad gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.\\" (9) The Old Man and theSea demonstrates persistence, friendship and kindness. Hemingway used a veryunique style of writing to write this magnificent piece of writing that got him thePulitzer Prize.This story is very easy to follow yet it is also is very meaningful and heartwarming. Through out the book Santiago struggles with himself to catch a fishand his 84 days of bad luck are taking their toll. But Santiago is very persistentand still goes out every day for the love of the sport. Most people would give upafter all the bad luck but not Santiago. Then Santiago hooks a huge marlin andeverything takes a huge turn. Day and night Santiago struggles with the marlinbut thoughts of being the talk of the town keep him fighting. Santiago's innerstrength is what makes this story so compelling. Although the book is short andeasy to comprehend the story is very sentimental.I would recommend this book to so many people, young kids and adults.Above all odds The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize. Hemingway inmy mind is one of the most powerful writers of this time. He usessimple words and sentences to form powerful meanings. In 1954 hewon the Nobel Prize for his powerful style of writing. I feel that he won the NobelPrize for The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway's most well knew and best storyis defiantly The Old Man and the Sea. This story is very compassionate and wellknown and should be read by everyone.To sum up everything Hemingway is by far the best writer of all time andhis famous story The Old Man and the Sea is his best piece of work. I wouldrecommend this book to anyone, young and old."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and the Sea is a very intresting book. Actually it is intresting in the first fifty pages. After that the excitment of him catching a fish, turns into something entirely different. For almost the rest of the entire book, the old man is being dragged along behind the never tiring fish. Frankly, it starts to get boring. Even with the occasional exitement, such as the giant fish jumping from the water, this fator of it seeming to drag on, brings it score down to only a 3."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If he had been able to deal with his desire for men, instead of eating a shotgun (either oblivious to, or beyond caring about, the obvious symbolism of his act), Ernest Hemingway might be celebrating his 100th birthday today, July 21, 1999. While one has to acknowledge that stylistically he was one of the most influential authors of the Century, it seems to me that his literary reputation really rests on Old Man and the Sea and the Nick Adams stories, everything else is just psychosexual, faux macho, posturing. That said, you could do a hell of a lot worse careerwise than produce one of the best novellas and several of the best short stories ever written.The Old Man and the Sea is another one of those texts that you were assigned in 8th or 9th grade, largely as a function of the author's stature and the brevity of the book (see also Of Mice and Men, Orrin's Grade: A+). And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross. Allow me to take a little different tack.I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society (John Kenneth Galbraith)(Grade: F). Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together. We now realize of course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit. Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic unemployed get jobs or lose benefits. How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people? It is quite simply a function of their dependence on materialism. This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they failed to reckon with these forces.Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that, for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding sense of gratification and self worth. Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by it. Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years. It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in high school, and decided to see what I'd think of it now (trying to keep the image of Spencer Tracy out of my head). Well, this is one very bad novel. What happened? The two main characters are so stereotyped and the writing is so 'precious' (almost as though Hemingway had been inhaling some VERY mellow stuff) that it seems as though it were done by a ghostwriter. I've read that the book is a metaphor for the negative responses Hemingway's later work was given by reviewers, hence the old man is Hemingway, and the sharks are the critics, but that doesn't relieve the bad writing of its 'badness.' It seems hard to believe that a writer that could capture so accurately the culture and world views of Spaniards, French, Italians, ex-pat Americans could depict Cubans as though they were cartoon characters, but that's what seems to be the case here. I'm guessing Hemingway was trying something 'experimental.' That's fine. It's fine if the experiment isn't a success. But with the books celebrity comes its use in curricula across the land, and it would be a lot better to introduce students, at least, to the Hemingway of the Nick Adams stories, which are accessible as well, but not to the point of such goofiness. However, I hear that 'A Rose for Emily' is still used in high school and colleges as a Faulkner introduction, so either the same teachers who assign both these 'losers' have no taste or they are getting even for the misery they experienced in grad school."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is so beautiful. Most of Hmeingway's books are &quot;macho&quot; and kind of get boring with all the blood , gore, and masculinity. This story was different.

At the end, even though his fish gets eaten by sharks, he at least knows that he did it, and could do it again. I wonder if the lions he dreams about stand for his hopes and dreams.

If you read, you see that the old man's hands get hurt &amp; bleed, just as if they were nailed to a cross. I think the old man represented Christ. I'm not really sure what exactly the fish was, but as you notice the sharks keep eating the fish away. It now makes much more sense.

The old man and the sea may go down as his best. He was able to portray so many symbols in this story. For example the old man, Santiago was like Christ and his disciple was the little boy. Another symbol is the old man always dreamt about lions in on the coast of Africa, I think this resembled his strength when he was young and able to handle large jobs. The final symbol is the old man and the boy cared about nature. When the marlin was being attacked by the sharks, Santiago kept on apologizing to the fish for going to far out.Some people may not like the book because it is mainly an old man in his boat out at sea battling with a marlin.I really enjoyed this book and I fell that alot of other people would enjoy this book also.

Though I am still undecided, I'm inclined to think he came out triumphant, many of the rave reviews on here making up my mind. Santiago did leave me pondering the barriers I could break if I put only half as much dedication to my goals as hid to his, however the messege well taken, I still had to muster up alot of dedication to get to the last page.

I have read it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times. The writing has such grace and is so refined and perfect that I could not possibly imagine any sentence being rewritten for the better.

I know I will be reading it again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Man and his horizon. That is what the book is about. Hemingway filters out the static and places man oncemore before the questions that have haunted him since creation its self.It is not an easy task to acknowledge the innate lonliness of man. Beauty and grief lie at the heart of this realisation. But only with understanding the truth can one learn to live."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is the first step into the world of Hemingway.

Even though Hemingway wouldn't admit it, this book contains much symbolism.

Yes the toad fish or if you are feeling less regional the oyster toad fish or Opsanus tau if you will. When I was a boy we would visit the Atlantic coast of North Carolina (the Pacific Coast of NC was to far of a drive) and hang with my grandparents. My grandfather would as a rule take us fishing freshwater and then for a week or two we would be on the coast fishing in big blue aka the Atlantic Ocean. My grandfather was not flush with cash so we normally found very creative places to dip a hook.Shrimp and squid was the bait of choice, my grandfather would scoff at my collection of lures and try as I might I always went back to real live dead bait, because the lures never worked and the dead bait would produce. We would use a 2 oz weight with two hooks, drop it into the water and most of the time you could real in two fish! Pin fish, blow fish, croakers, preacher dicks, eels, spot, mullet among others but my favorite was the toad fish! The toad fish is ugly and not good to eat but it was a fighter and the sense of danger you would feel when trying to take it off your hook was addictive, the thing had jaws like a vice and always in the back of my mind I would think \\"what if this thing latched on to my daddy parts\\"?The ocean is about fished out, I cant remember the last time I caught a toad fish ~\` I t makes me sad but then again I don't fish that often if I am on the coast so maybe the sea still has a bounty but its lost to me, I miss the I caught bottom like tug of a toad fish and the adrenaline rush I felt when I would ask my grandfather to help me get it off my hook. The book is a must read and thats all I have to say. Kind Regards JWW"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It took me a few hours to finish. Who knew a great book could be written in so few pages?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"As a reader of many books I would have to say this is one of my favorites. A very well written book that goes through a three day ordeal for a fisherman at sea. Truly the most incredible part of this book is just the word choice that keeps a reader interested in the story. Hemingway, one of the best writers of his time, describes the pain and sufferings of an old fisher man at sea in such an inspiring way just goes to show this mans true brilliance.Its not a book that goes on for hours and hours to describe something small or utterly useless. it's a book that flows from page to page and is very even in description. The way Hemingway uses only a few characters and of course the main character the old man (referred to only a few times by the name Santiago.) Helps him paint a mental picture in the readers mind, of what these people could of looked like.The story revolves around mostly the old man on the sea fishing, but prior to his fishing adventure, Hemingway explores the town which Santiago lives in. A poor Fishing town with a small population in a Spanish speaking country. By adding this part a reader can get a feel for what the life of a character is like before he/she is a quarter of the way into the book.There are a few issues with the book (hence the four out of five grade) which include how the book bounces around and can become a little choppy at times. Also, a reader may become distracted at times from lack of interest or lack of details. Thankfully the two issues just stated do pick them selves up eventually and the book continues rather smoothly."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a beautiful novella about desperation and realization. It's both wonderfully thrilling and touching, often at the same time.The old man is a very interesting character, albeit somewhat eccentric. His long thoughts and speeches to himself are quite captivating, as is his determined nature. Hemingway did an amazing job truly making me feel how the old man felt. When he finally got a hold of the marlin I felt complete joy; when the realization that he was beat sunk in I felt complete despair.In addition to the touching narrative, Hemingway also created a detailed account of a fisherman's life. He showed the harsh time at sea, constantly striving to survive and the demand to succeed. We are also shown the modest and simple life of a fisherman, from the scrimpy meals to the shabby housing.Overall, it was a good read. Although it may have gotten a little slow at times, I recommend you not get frustrated and just keep in mind that you will be rewarded heavily in the end with quite the affecting conclusion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I got this book as a gift from my brother in law in San Fransisco Airport for my birthday.I did not read this book on flight 1. I usually doze off 2. The book seemed to be a like a trivial short story.After I got home after a gruelling 18 hour journey, I opened this book in the middle of the night while fighting jet lag and could not keep the book down for 4 hours. It is captivating and thoroughly enjoyable.The relationship between the old man and the boy is something which has been very well captured. End of the novel, I felt like I should read more of short stories. If you like this book, you will also like books by Ruskin Bond, RK Lakshman and RK Narayan"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Falling into the same category as 90% of the reviewers here, I was first exposed to this book in high school. Even back then (despite the fact that I was forced to read it), it made a huge impression upon me. Over the years, this initial impression has only increased. So much so, that this has become the only book that I read on a yearly basis (and I read a ton of books). The story never gets old. This really is Hemingway at the height of his powers. The prose is simple but very effective. The descriptions are intense and alive. And what appears as a simple story of a poor and unlucky fisherman and his struggle with a mighty fish, is actually a metaphor for the hopeful and hopeless aspects that life dishes out on a daily basis. Symbolism abounds in this book. You've got the classic man versus nature, man facing his own limitations, man being beaten by forces beyond his control right at the moment of his triumph, and, in the end, the regeneration of man's hope and determination... just to name a few. Some people have voiced displeasure because Santiago isn't victorious in the end. He goes through this massive ordeal but ends up with nothing to show for it, in their opinion. But I don't know if I agree with that because sometimes life is about the journey and not the result. Besides, I just get the strong feeling that once he recovers his strength, Santiago will be going back out onto the ocean, continuing to struggle against the odds, and ultimately, continuing to live. And that provides hope for all of us. Simply put, this book is easily my favorite and one of the best books in the history of literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It is a story about a fisherman and his friend who haven't had much luck fishing; in fact they were unsuccessful for over 80 days. But through the determination of the fishers they finally find a Marlin and go on a wild goose chase across the ocean to find it. They overcome obstacles and develop a bond over the simple act of fishing. The men end up proving to other fellow fisherman what a little heart can do, and end up coming back with more than anyone expected. This book is a wonderful example of what you can do if you try and don't give up. Near the end of the book they endure an unfortunate problem. This problem ends up being much better than they expected and take advantage of the situation. When you read this book Ernest Hemingway has a way with words that sucks into the action with immense detail on even the smallest things. The book is separated into 5 \\"chapters\\" or \\"days\\" in this book each one is a section of their journey. It is neat how Ernest does this because it gives you an easy to follow timeline and fits right in with the atmosphere of the book. I think this is a great book that everyone should enjoy because it is mix of action, adventure and drama so it provides most people with a great tale. Even if you don't like the water or fishing, you should still pick up this book for an awesome adventure."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about an old man an his adventures upon the deep blue sea. The old man is a fisherman who susposedly has a ton of bad luck. His name is Santiago and he is very nice to everyone. His luck is so bad too that he hasn't even caught a fish in over 80 days. It is very heart-grabbing then in this sense because you start to feel bad for this guy and you hope that his luck will change shortly and he is able to catch a fish that will make life a lot easier for him. There is also this child who is extremely fond of Santiago bacause of what he has done for him. Santiago taught the child everything that he knew about fishing and the child has used it ever since. It is sad though because the child is not allowed to fish with the old man because of his luck. The child wants to fish with him so much though but he can't because of his parents and also because of the old man. The old man will not let him go fishing with him though because of his parents wishes. I would recommend this to everybody though because of the intense action that happened in the book between the old man and the sea. In fact, the people who should read this first is fishermen who happen to be down on their luck and that need a pick up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway has long-been identified as a remarkable writer, and \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of his best. Only Hemingway can pit three main characters together (the fish, the old man and the sea) and create a tale that is so intriguing it will keep you turning the pages until the very end.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a tale that shows the battle between a man and nature and the friendship between a small boy and an old man.Hemingway creates a story that does not fit within the boundaries of regular stories: the characters have no names, the descriptions and scene changes are very limited and it does not have a victorious ending and yet Hemingway weaves a tale that has stood the tests of time. Reader's will feel the old man's pain, joys, fatigue and despair."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a beautiful little book. It is my first taste of Hemingway and was a pleasing surprise. It is the simple story of an 85 year old fisherman. He has lost his luck, his young helper and his respect. He goes out to sea, alone, and encounters a huge Marlin. The rest of the story is about what happens. The language is economical and clear. The developing relationship between the old man and the great fish is gripping. The ending sends shivers down the spine.It has been said that Ernest Hemingway is at his best with short stories. This is more of a novella but a great example of concise writing. I would not normally be drawn to a story about a man and a fish but am so glad that I did not miss this one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I cry every time I read it. There is a noble sadness to the book that makes u interested every time u read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Though I enjoyed reading this novel, I believe the price is a little high. The story is quite short and I have read better and longer books for less. It is very possible that I didn't fully understand the book, as I am only sixteen years old, but if I had I am sure the price would have been suitable. to sum up what I just wrote, because I hardly understand it myself, the older you are the better this novel will seem to you!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is Hemingway's shortest novel but in my opinion it is also his greatest. The theme of the book is when a man of achievement is seen as over the hill can he rise up to prove his critics wrong ? Santiago, the old man in the novel, is a professional fisherman who was once considered the best in his craft.He goes out every day but for 84 days has not caught a fish. He goes out again in the novel and he hooks a marlin which he says is the biggest fish he has ever seen.The struggle to vanquish the marlin and Santiagos thoughts during the struggle are the heart of the book.The Old Man and the Seais about the quest for excellence and the difficulty of achieving it the even harder job of maintaining it and the realization that humanity in the end must fade away for no one can stay on top forever. If this book were written in the 20s or 30s it would be radically different and not as good Instead, Hemingway gives us a masterpiece that shows much insight of one of mankinds existential questions and contributes greatly to the nations and the worlds literary canon"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever struggled so hard that you would never give up? Well that is what The Old Man and The Sea is all about. The author of the old man and the sea is Ernest Hemingway. He was one of our times best writers, and the old man and the sea is his best book. The Old Man and the Sea takes place in a small town out of Havana Cuba in the 1940's. The significance of the setting is it's in a small town of fisherman so the main economy comes from fish. The main character of The Old Man and The Sea is the old man he is also the protagonist of the book. Other characters in the book are the Boy and the Marlin. The Marlin is the antagonist of the story but the Marlin isn't a very believing antagonist because he isn't bad he is just fighting against the old man. The plot of the story is that the old man hasn't caught a fish in 84 days and he is really hungry. He decides to go out and he isn't coming back until he catches a big one. The old man sails out and twice he thinks he is close to the big fish but he keeps finding little fish. Finally he sees a few birds up on the horizon and he can feel that the big fish is below. He sees the marlin and he sinks down his line hoping the marlin will bite. \\"He bit it!\\" the unfortunate thing is that the old man sailed for 2 days trying to catch the marlin, he never gave up, and he kept trying. Eventually you know he catches it. He is very proud of himself but on the way back from the outing sharks go crazy. They shred the marlin to pieces, the old man tries to stop them but there is just too many. When he gets back to his village he goes straight back to his shack and sleeps.The book was like a really long fable. It didn't have to good of a story line it kind of just kept moving forward. Ernest Hemingway was really descriptive and detailed. Only on e of the greatest authors of our time could've of done this book because he used like 20 pages to explain one small thing. The theme of this story is even if you fail and fail again get back up and make your failures your motivation to try harder. This book leaves the impact that you have to keep trying and even when you win you might sometimes gain wisdom rather than a prize. This book I was really good and it kept you guessing and that is why I would give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book for the first time in high school. Like most other school reading assignments, I read it just to get through it. Recently, my son had to read it for his high school English class. I thought it would be the perfect time for me to read it again. I am so glad I did. What a pleasure it was to go back and reread this classic. Now that I am closer in age to the old man than the boy in the story, I understood the quest for the perfect marlin. Definitely a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was my first purchase from this seller and the book I had ordered arrived within a couple of days of placing the order and in the condition that it was described to be in.

That book you opened when you were sixteen and still remember when your sixty. You may not be able to recall the whole book but parts of it never leave you. For all those that have read Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea the feeling of heartbreak for the old man is universal. From the first page to the last you pull for this simple fisherman. If you've ever had a father who fishes you probably heard a story or two. Hemingway was a master. No story you dad ever told you can compare to what Hemingway put on page with this book. It's a story thats been told a hundred times but never like this. Find this book. Sit on your patio one afternoon and finish it. Then stick it in your library. When you glance up from your couch to look at the books on your wall, you'll smile when you see the spine of The Old Man and the Sea. Thanks Ernest, brilliant afternoon.Old Man and the Sea"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I finally read Old Man and the Sea, for the first time, taking it seriously, after years of ignoring the book and the author, as some boring mainstream pop culture hoopla. My stupid instincts said: Hemingway's stories were over-admired and misogynistic, about baseball and war with no real pizazz or pragmatism for escape; that my life would be better off without them. Boy, was I wrong.Old Man and the Sea is not about an old fisherman trying to catch fish, even though it really is just that too. Explaining the beauty of its decadent meter is like trying to explain how the multicolored facets give luster and depth to a fine diamond, or why the robustness of an aged Port with its subtleties of smoke and asparagus fall so well on the glass and tongue. As an adult there's a beauty in simplicity that makes more sense than when we are younger and more impulsive.Old Man and the Sea is a lesson in the appreciation of rhythm, like in the sounds of cicada approaching and withdrawing intensely while standing in grass near a tall tree'd landscape--in the flawless white powder covered back yard feeling smooth and blinding on the eyes in the morning crawl of a lazy day; in the whisper of an intuitive lover before climax, framing the moment into rapturous memories oft remembered before some nights of rest.In other words: as experience refines the palate, maturity and elegant simplicity are Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea.Here, a few lines that wrecked me into reverently triple reading them:\\"The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were bought alongside.\\"Those very lines had me optimistic in imagining reading them to my future children before bed; they gave me hope for raising progeny in what has felt like a falling apart feeling world; with its poetry in a story about a man and his quest to catch the perfect marlin making the world seem lighter and less intense."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Short but brilliant novel. In my own opinion the muddled mess our education system have made of this book is a shame. If you aren't patient enough for a less than 100 page novel, don't bother picking this book up and misinterpreting its importance. Simple, elegant and filled with Hemingway's genius."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was my second experience with Hemingway, and I loved it. It was vastly different than The Sun Also Rises, which I read just before beginning The Old Man and the Sea.The writing was clear, sharp, and evocative. As perfect as the writing was, it was the story that floored me. I think that what makes the The Old Man and the Sea a classic is that each reader can find some unique reflection of his or her own life in the story. The Old Man undergoes a universal struggle, and we are with him the whole time, rooting for him, but in the back of our minds, knowing that the odds are against him.I recommend it highly. This one is going into my re-read pile."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Phew...........I just finished reading the tale of Santiago, the old man, and I've exhaled for what seems like the first time since starting the book last night. There is likely not much left to be said about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" that you have not read before, but the story is so gripping, so timeless, and so well written that it deserves every ounce of praise from every person who reads it.Hemingway won me over as a young man when I first read \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" and everything in between has been a hit for me, but I never decided to read this until last night, probably because of the diminutive size of the text, but I was gripped from early on. The thing that strikes me the most about Hemingway is the simplicity with which he is able to write, but the depth to the words when you look underneath the surface.The old man, Santiago, embodies so much of what every man longs for--that unwavering faith and belief in their abilities, and that sense of being up for the challenge, no matter how impossible it may seem, but giving it your all regardless of the likely outcome. I found myself, a grown man, with tears in my eyes at points of the book, just begging for things to progress in certain ways, and legitimately trying to breath with the anxiety caused in the final page turns (or Kindle clicks in my case). I do not want to spoil anything for anybody, but there are incredible life lessons about resilience, faith, and courage that every man, woman, and child could benefit from. I do find Hemingway to be a man's man with a man's knack for storytelling, and I doubt that there are many men out there who could read this without offering praise.This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my 1st Hemingway book.It was awesome.

The Old Man and the Sea is the first Hemingway book I ever read - I know, shocking - and it made me realize what I've been missing out on.This is a very simple tale, approximately a 100 pages long, about an old man's journey on the sea. Santiago, the old man, has not caught a big fish in 84 days and has therefore been declared unlucky. In fact, his closest friend and student - only known as \\"boy\\" - was forbidden by his family from fishing with the old man due to his bad luck. However, that did not stop the boy from taking care of the old man each and every day, making sure he goes to sleep, he eats, he reads his paper and so on.On the 85th day, the old man is optimistic that this must be his lucky day. He sets off on his course and is prepared to catch the biggest fish, and he does. However, he does not realize how big this fish actually is, and is not strong enough to drag it overboard and is afraid of cutting the string, therefore he ends up being pulled by the fish far enough into the sea that he could not see the lights of Havana anymore. Throughout this journey, the old man reflects on his life and his physical and mental strengths, and his surroundings. He engages in some of the most interesting conversations with the moon and the birds and most especially the fish. He forms a bond with the fish he had caught, you could almost call it a friendship, in fact several times he would refer to the fish as \\"brother\\". As his body starts to fail him, the fish is also starting to give up the fight. However, the old man is so exhausted to the point of delirium that he eventually stabs the fish to death and pulls it to the side of the boat.On his journey back home, sharks are immediately attracted to the scent of blood and attack the boat in turns trying to have at the fish. The old man fights them off as much as he could with what strength he has left, defending his fish - his friend - with all his might, until he couldn't anymore. By the time he gets to shore, there is nothing left of the fish but its skeleton attached to its head and its tail.It is a short novel, yes, but one that will stay with you for much longer than you could imagine. The story of the old man and his bond with the fish he caught is very profound and very real. At the end, the old man's grief is not because he had nothing to show for his journey, but more like due to the loss of a friend. Something that he thought was so courageous and so beautiful was destroyed in the cruelest of ways.A very touching novel. Hemingway was able to tap into our emotions and delve into many layers of thought and contemplation in just a 100 pages. That is very impressive indeed.Also, I absolutely loved the role of the boy. I loved his dedication and love for the old man, the way he cared for him and nurtured him, how he never let go or gave up. He is a true model of how old people should be treated, and how every child should treat their parents. And as I grow older, I would love to have the strength, and determination and wisdom and optimism of this old man.Truly inspiring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There simply has never been a voice so well suited for a role. Donald Sutherland's reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is going to be one that stands the test of time. Sutherland is simply outstanding. Sutherland has everything, from top to bottom, which is what makes this audiobook a success. He has the flow, the sometimes ragged voice, a voice with power, a tempo that is ideal for this book's reading, and so many intangibles that cannot be expressed, only felt. What he does not convey in words, he conveys in pure aesthetic form, emotively driving the reader, as I imagine that Hemingway intended.Sutherland's performance in this book is so incredible that I will simply say this: Of all the audiobooks I have listened to, there is none better than this. This reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is the gold standard for audiobooks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a little boy and it made me so sad that I cried.

I had never read Hemingway so I was curious to see what the book that made him famous was all about.The story is simple yet deep. Hemingway wrote this short story in a way that you can relate to the character and experience his initial triumph and then the agony of his loss. The characters of Santiago and the boy are laid out so that you can feel the emotional bond between them. It's beyond master and apprentice and to a certain degree even beyond father and son.I did not see the religious allegory in this story. The old man's suffering and struggle in no way resembled Jesus' struggle. Even though the old man does say his hail Mary's he says himself that he is not a really religious man. To me this was the struggle of nature. A hunt among hunters of the same prey. A lesson in life and how it changes with age.Over all I thought this book was OK. I may have to read it again to see what all the fuss was about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I saw this book at the library and thought, \\"Hey, I never read this Hemingway in high school.\\" I remembered liking the other required readings by Hemingway so I picked this up. It was a bit slow, but as Santiago fought with the massive fish, I became consumed in his battle. I cheered for him as he fought days and nights with the fish, through hunger, thirst, and pain. I cheered for through more battles with sharks. Ultimately, I cried for him when the fish was gone.I could not believe that such a simplistic story drew me in like this. Life does not give us what we want materialistically all the time. But if you give it a go and fight honorably for it, you gain something much more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's last novel (and IMO, his best novel) won a Pulitzer Prize, cemented his status as one of America's greatest talents, and was probably the deciding factor in his receiving the Nobel Prize. Very different from my second favorite Hemingway novel, the epicFor Whom the Bell Tolls, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is on the surface a simple tale about a simple man. Santiago's struggle to catch the fish of a lifetime and to get home with his prize makes a superb story on its own, a story that will be enjoyable to readers of any level. One man's tenacity and strength lead to his dominance over nature, followed by his inevitable defeat by nature. In the shallowest sense, it is a short but grand tale of trial, triumph, let-down, and peace, but underneath that, it contains truly powerful lessons and poignant commentary by Hemingway.THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a story about facing life's challenges, and not just facing them, but standing up against all odds, never giving up, following your dreams, and overcoming adversity. The dignity of the poor old Cuban fisherman represents the best of the natural man, living for oneself and refusing to surrender to the seeming inevitability of eventual defeat. No matter your dreams, you can obtain success with hard work and perseverance, but at the same time, that success is often fleeting.While the entirety is enjoyable, my favorite part of the book comes at the very end, as Santiago's fellow fishermen, who had often treated him with pity and disdain, come to realize the magnitude of his success. While not described in detail by Hemingway (see below), you can just picture the marveling attention the legendarily-big blue marlin garners from the Cuban villagers, and the respect the Old Man will receive in the future.The fact that Hemingway is able to present such an impactful and meaningful tale into such a short novel is a testament to the power of this writing. His \\"Iceberg Theory\\" of prose says that if a writer is good enough, he doesn't have to state things that should already be clear to the reader (or something like that). \\"The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water.\\" With so much beneath the surface, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is perhaps the best example of this profound concept.Very highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If only I had read this book as a teenager. Not that I didn't enjoy it now, but as a teenager who was hooked on fishing, what an adventure story it would have been to my young eyes. Of course, I didn't fish in the Atlantic Ocean off the cost of Cuba, as Santiago did in this tale. I fished the streams, ponds, and lakes of the Adirondack Mountains. And yet, I know this yarn would have been spellbinding. It's easy to see why this book, published in 1952, played a big part of Hemingway earning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. During my many years as a radio DJ, I often urged my adult listeners to leave books around the house where a child might pick them up and start the life-long habit of reading. This is just such a book. Now I need to go and get the video."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is probably the best book ever crafted of this length. It is short, but extremely elegant. Hemingway's terse style truly shines through in this book and the imagery is outstanding. The story keeps you as hooked as the fish on the old man's line and you feel the frustrations and triumphs as keenly as he does. Simply beautiful and one of the best examples of why Hemingway is loved so. Well worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a good book and it took place in a tropical island, which was Cuba. It had a good story line and interesting storyline but easy to follow if you paid close attention to what was going on with the old man. The book was about an old man and his problems in life. The sharks stood for the problem, the old man stood for the people, and the marlin stood for the goal in life but it was also about the old man catching a marlin on a little wooden boat with a hand line in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. I think it could have not had a better ending.I recommend that you read this book if you are interested in adventure and fishing. I give this book a 5 star rating"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of Hemingway's best efforts, a short yet moving novel. It's the story of Santiago, an aged subsistence fisherman in Cuba around 1950. The old man plies his trade from a tiny boat, but hasn't caught a fish in months. His near-destitution forces him to lose the assistance of his devoted boy helper, so now he goes out alone. Sure enough, he hooks a giant marlin, one that pulls and fights and drags the old man out to sea. The old man professes love and respect for his catch, but remains determined to kill it. Of course, if he succeeds in that difficult physical struggle, he will need further effort to keep his catch away from sharks. Hemingway aptly describes the fears, hopes, and frustrations the old man feels as he struggles for days to land and bring home his prize catch in that tiny boat.This book led author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) to a Nobel Prize. The author uses crisp and readable prose, and avoids the too-lengthy descriptions that detract from some of his earlier work. This is a powerful story about physical and mental challenge, age, dreams and effort."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a great book that tells a story of an old man and his way of fishing. Our hero in this book is not a King, a prince, a knight or a leader who has all the powers in the world, but instead we have Santiago, who is a very old, poor Cuban fisherman and we follow this simple man's struggle of his in this book. The author Ernest Hemingway uses complex signs and a great story line to draw readers into this story. With these techniques, he shows a story that applies to many overseas. One part of this book that I enjoyed was the old man, Santiago. His character, to me, helped me to become more interested in the story. Earlier in the book, the old man was struggling with a large Marlin (fish). Even with his body beaten and broken, he continued to fight the fish. The old man's strength to fight the fish helped me to understand his way of fishing. This is definitely a good book to read, not only once but many times over. This novel is easy to read, and it would be perfect for anyone that feels like they cannot read a lot of books because the authors make it too difficult. I would also recommend this novel to people who enjoy adventure stories, because this story is one long adventure. I would also recommend this book because Hemingway gives a good message in it everyone should think about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Some say that the grammar in this book is incorrect, but this is purely personal opinion and preference. He tends not to put commas in where they are optional, and this could be part of his writing style and therefore isn't grammatically incorrect, but a stylistic preference. Hemingway never broke the rules: he just bended them a little. Other authors have broken grammatical rules for their own reasons, and a good example of this is Mark Twain with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He purposefully misspells words, uses non-standard slang and makes drastic grammatical errors to portray the character's point of view more accurately. Any review under a three on this book has either false information, personal bias or just plain ignorance on these matters. Some would say there's not enough action, but that isn't the main focus of books in general. A novel is simply a story with plot and characters told from someone's, author's or character's, point of view, and any book lacking in these (a.k.a. action, cheesy romance novels, vampire novels, they're all the same) usually lacks in quality. If you LIKE those kinds of novels, then you're going to hate this one, but if you're looking for something deeper, this is the book for you. Simply put, this is art."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old man. He was once a great fisherman, but no longer. The other fishermen ridicule him, or ignore him. Eighty days without a fish, and the parents of the small boy who helps him, Manolin, have forbidden him to work with Santiago any more. He is unlucky, they say, and the word is echoed around town.But the old fisherman does not mind. He knows that life is difficult, that not everything goes the way you wish it would. On the eighty-fifth day, he sets out into the water, alone, and hooks a great fish. 'Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely', he muses to himself, early on in the battle. For it is a battle. The fish he has caught is strong, has great endurance, and a cunning that Santiago admires.As time passes, he starts to talk to himself more and more. He muses on the strength of the fish, and how they are brothers. He desperately wants to catch it, so that he can return to Havana with some glory and enough money to sit and listen to the 'great DiMaggio' on the radio, in peace. But he also admires the fish, and gradually, he becomes unsure as to whether he has made the right decision in trying so hard to kill it.'Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.'Santiago is an old man, a man who has accepted his weaknesses and failures, but who also knows his strengths. He has a great confidence in his own abilities, but it is a weary, hesitant confidence that is difficult to explain. On the one hand, he knows that he has the capability to capture the fish. He has caught large fish before, and, thanks to the raw fish he has been eating, considers that he has the strength to keep going, for ever if necessary. But he protests and cajoles and pleads at his individual body parts to work, for them not to fail. 'Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went.' He knows he can do it, but, because of his age and the majesty of his 'brother', he is worried that maybe this time, this fish will be the one that got away.Hemingway's writing is sparse and effective. Sentences are short, sharp, and have very little in the way of flowery words or fancy punctuation. The writing suits the story very well, because Santiago is an up and down man himself. What you see is what you get, both in the characters, the setting, and the writing. There is also the interesting effect where, due to the simplicity of the writing and the sparse selection of characters, the story can be interpreted on many levels. On one, it is the story of man struggling and fighting for something that, once achieved, we cannot hold on to. On the other, it is the sadness and inevitability of age. Or the insignificance of the single man in today's group-action world. Or many other interpretations.The ending is sad, beautiful and completely appropriate. Could the novel have ended any other way? Yes, but I argue that if it had, then the message, the electricity, the purpose that Hemingway had been building for the previous 90 pages, this would have been lost with the easy, happy solution. Instead, we have man's failure in success, and Santiago's calm acceptance, and it is inspiring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I haven't read classics since school and decided to take a break from commercial and contemporary fiction to read a few. I'm quite surprised that a story about a fish could have me wrapped up and engaged. This was my first Hemingway book and I enjoyed his simple storytelling style. Because it was straight forward, I was able to get into the old man's dilemma of not having caught a fish in months and then battling with this great marlin, only to have it attacked by sharks. I like that I was able to get into and feel his struggles within his mind and against his body. This was a very engaging classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is a classic tale of man versus nature.

Ernest Hemingway does a great job of telling this story. The story is packed with great meaning and written in a way that I think all ages can understand. His sentences are simple yet they hold such meaning without having to be complicated. A child could read this book and still understand the meaning.When I say that this book has very good meaning I say that with different perspectives of the book in mind. The Old Man, Santiago, has a great respect for many things in his life. The boy who works with him, the sea that provides with food when willing, and the great fish he battles with. He evens finds a place in his heart for those predators after his great fish.The boy who is probably 12 or 13 works with Santiago out on his small skiff. He even helps him when they are not out on the boat. He brings him food, water and the paper so they can discuss baseball from the day before. The boy looks up to him and Santiago respects him for everything he does for him.I especially admired the respect that Santiago has for the sea and the great marlin. Even though he has been cursed with bad luck and hasn't caught a fish for 80 some days, he still believes that he should have respect for the sea, because some day it will be good to him and provide all the fish he needs, which in the end it does but its costs him."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One of the best ever, this is a book full of emotion, from the first page you can feel the Old Man's inspiration and determination. The book is not very long, it is just right, many times during the reading I stoped and imagined him at sea fighting the marlin and then the sharks, the old man talking to himself and remembering better times, when he was young, when he was stronger.The old man finds the strenght to come back victorious even in defeat.This book is a must read for all ages, simply a great short novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemmingway uses a short and refined style to tell a story of an old man and hisperilous journey through the sea. His writing is superb, and clean. The story flows well and is without flaws. The wording and structure of the story is as if it flowed freely from his mind to the paper without error.Hemmingway creates a good feel for the story by being very descriptive. Although, the paragraphs are short and simple, the descriptiveness is superb. Hemmingway uses simple but concise word choice. Because of the simple wording it makes for easy reading. In the same way, he uses words such as, treachery. Because of this, it eliminates useless jargon. And you are able to grasp the meaning of the sentence or paragraph easily because of the descriptive words.Because of all the descriptive writing you are able to fully grasp the story aswell. For instance, \\"the line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water.\\" And \\"Fish... big fish.\\" Because of the descriptiveness you are able to fully understand what Hemmingway is trying to relate, through simple, refined writing. \\"They were strong shoulders, still powerful although very old.\\" Again, this is a good example of Hemmingway's short concise style in this book. As he is describing a part of Santiago's figure, easily, smoothly and in a short amount of words.As you can see, Hemmingway has a writing style unlike any other, and unparalleled by any other. He is undoubtedly one of the best writers in American history. Although he is no longer alive, he still lives on through his classic writing, which will also go on for ages to come. This book is definitely a classic, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the first Hemingway book I have read, and while it was not great I do not regret reading it. I had my doubts about a &quot;fishing story,&quot; but it turned out to be engaging to the end and a very worthwhile read.

I am one for sad and pointed endings, but I really would have preffered a happier ending to this tale."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"For God's sake, this story is a little more than a hundred pages...how can it &quot;drag on?&quot; If the rawness of the story, the depth of the symbolism, or the simplicity of the setting don't grab you, I don't know what will. I guess people's inability to focus for more than ten minutes is a result of this novel's not having commercial breaks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was of two minds reading this book. One, was I should have parceled a few hours to sit down and read this book in one sitting. The other was that I wanted to savor it and let it go on forever.I am not a huge Hemingway fan. For me, this is by far his best. A story of an elderly fisherman who catches his greatest fish after days of bone-wearying battle only to lose it to sharks.One can see so much in the book - winning/losing, catching dreams/losing dreams, dreams not living up to expectations - if one wants to go the literature class route.Or, one can just savor the language and the human angst so wonderfully portrayed. I felt I was in the boat with the old man and when he was talking to himself, he was talking to me. Plainly, a terrific book.One other note. Years ago I listened to this book on tape. Although not as good as reading it (obviously), it is a good book to listen to on tape."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Okay, I'll start by conceding the obvious: 1. The plot is a down-on-his-luck old fisherman hooks a huge marlin, is pulled out to sea before killing it, and loses it to various shark attacks on his return voyage. 2. There's not a lot of action. 3. Yes, the old man talks to his hand (and a bird, and the fish).Personally, I feel that the most compelling aspect of this wonderful novel is the struggle inherent within the old man's task. It's a labor for something he not only wants but needs. It's an uphill climb against a gradient that only gets steeper. He succeeds, but only to lose the prize in the end.Yet, at the end of it all, he is not defeated. He is ready to sleep, to wake, and to do it all again.Call it the triumph of the human spirit when pitted against all odds.I first read this book in the fourth grade, after one of my parents left it laying around the living room. I finished it within three hours.Ever since, I've made it a point to pick it up at least once a year. I'm now 24 years old. And I still find it to be an absolutely captivating novel.-J."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"SantiagoBy CarolineThe book The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is full of adventure, love between an old man and a little boy, determination and struggle. This book is a classic that tells a story about an old Cuban fisherman Santiago. The old man doesn't believe in luck and he doesn't believe he has any even though he has much experience in fishing all his life.One regular day going about his regular routines of getting up early to go fishing he catches a huge fish. This is not a normal fish. To overcome the fish and catch it all by himself in a little skiff he must have great courage. He has to face many hardships. His hands are cut, he becomes tired and hungry but he stays with the fish for days. But this is only the beginning.I liked this book because it has a lot of meaning even though it is a simple, short book. It is a descriptive and enduring story, between man and animal. I enjoyed how the Old Man had so much courage and determination to fight a fish. But also, after he had defeated the fish the old man had to solve the fish from even more problems that came along.Caroline"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you stopped and thought about what exactly it is that you are complaining about maybe you wouldn't be complaining at all. Is it the fact that one of the most complete, most respected pieces of work from one of greatest men to ever pick up a pen is not full of flashing lights, hard hitting bass beats, and hot steamy kisses? Is it the fact that you were made to think, that someone cares about your intelligence enough to wrench you away from your Rogue Spear or your Instant Messeging just long enough to see that people could sit, enthrawled and trapped by their lust for something fourty years before CD-ROMs? If you hated reading The Old Man and the Sea, if it was a torturous task indeed, go deep sea fishing for giant marlin with nothing but the same heroism, heart, and primitive tools your ancestors have been using since the creation of man. What do you plan to do? Do you think billions of people will still know your work and still celebrate your birth almost 40 years after you die? In case the cliff's notes didn't say so, Hemingway is still one of the most celebrated creatures to ever walk. So I hope your little brain doesn't ache so badly after being forced to think and contemplate something farther away than a monitor you would have to go 12 hours without jumping back online to pretend you are doing something important.

Simple words, simple sentences, and metaphors on top of metaphors make for a magnificent experience for you. Seldom has so much complexity been portrayed with such simplicity. What's even more astonishing is how short this novella is. Amazing!Just to let you know how much I love this book, The 2,000 Percent Solution was designed to draw on many of the novel's elements to convey important ideas.Communication is what people have the most trouble with in cooperating with each other.

While Hemingway may have been revolutionary in his day, I find his writing to be excruciatingly long-winded at times. Even as a fisherman, I found myself saying to Hemingway, \\"Catch the fish already!\\"Santiago is a great fisherman that has run into a string of hard luck. This is realistic for all fisherman. Then came the day that Santiago was fishing alone and hooked an enormous fish. Regretably, he could not bring his great catch into the boat. When he finally did catch the fish, sharks kept coming to pick away at his prize. In the end, Santiago only brings the head and bare bones of his great catch to shore.Like much of Hemingway's work, the story is quite depressing in the end.

A definite must-read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Marlin would be a more accurate title, but of course \\"Sea\\" sounds better. In a way you could say it's Moby Dick condensed to just under 80 pages. The word count is 26,610. It's barely a novella. With only two characters, three if you count the marlin, it's more of a stretched out short story.** spoiler alert **A luckless peasant fisherman who's returned from the sea empty handed every day for 84 days sets out, alone this time, to try his luck. He hauls in a monster marlin after a monumental 3-day struggle. But he's gone out too far and sharks allow him to return with little but a skeleton. He risked everything in his heroic battle. He lost the prize but he won something more valuable--his pride and self confidence and the respect and admiration of the boy who loves him.The book is a study in prose style, and I see it as an allegory on the lives of artists. Santiago represents the aging artist, elevated in status to near sainthood through devotion to his work. The marlin symbolizes that work, the awesome result of a lifetime of Herculean effort. The sharks represent the destructive force of critics.Everyone has an opinion, including people who wouldn't know a masterpiece if it bit them in the ass, people who couldn't wield a pen or a paintbrush or a baton if their life depended on it and haven't the slightest concept of the suffering an artist may have gone through to lay bare his most tender feelings for them to blaspheme. And the artist, having invested merely his heart, health, life and soul can only stand by and watch the critics hack away at his creation.The innocent unspoiled and loyal Manolin represents redemption, renewal, unconditional love and Santiago/Hemingway's lost youth, for only the boy within the man, the child inside the artist, has witnessed every moment, thought and movement and can appreciate the full sacrifice and accomplishment. When Santiago repeats: \\"If the boy were here, if the boy were here.\\"Hemingway is lamenting the loss of his own youth and vigor.Here are two paragraphs to illustrate narrative style:Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.\\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,\\" he said. \\"You're holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.\\"The narration is in third-person; so in the first sentence Hemningay announces that we're in the head of the main character, Santiago, sharing his naked thoughts. There are few adjectives and only one adverb, \\"suddenly,\\" used twice. No contractions. No complex sentences. The bare minimum of punctuation. In the dialog, the simple language continues because Santiago is actually talking to himself aloud. And the language is in character for Santiago, an uneducated, simple man. I believe this is one of the secrets to the success of the book. Hemingway's simple and straightforward sentence structure fits perfectly the peasants, Santiago and Manolin.Notice there are no digressions. Prose doesn't get any simpler. It's the complete opposite of Salinger in The Catcher in the Rye, which is a book of digressions. You have to be a mental gymnast to keep with Holden but not Santiago. Nothing gets in the way of the flow of logic. You feel like you are in the head of a peasant because every possible barrier between the reader and the character has been removed. The reader becomes Santiago. You feel his feelings, his pain, his bone-aching fatigue. You think his thoughts, his strategizing, his worrying over weather and tools and food and time.As an aside, the word \\"benevolent\\" leaped off the first page at me. Could this really be a mistake: \\"The brown blotches of thebenevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic seas were on his cheeks\\"? Benevolent means kind. \\"Benign,\\" meaning harmless, is more accurate."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am on a Hemingway kick and this was the only one of his which I simply did not like.

But Hemingway is not rich in words, and when there is little actual action, the story gets a little tame."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I used this as a gift - Service was wonderful. I love this story - a good one for teens if someone can explain it to them"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is short, but very good. It was made into a movie, starring Spencer Tracy, which is also very good. You will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea is about an old man, Santiago, who wants to catch a huge fish. The young boy, Manolin, wants to go along, but Santiago does not feel that he needs to take him along. The Old Man and the Sea is just another ordinary book.This book is not the most exciting book I have ever read, although it does have its moments when it does get exciting. For instance one of the most exciting parts of the book is when Santiago hooks the fish and the fish turns around and pulls Santiago out to sea. I my opinion this is where most of the action takes place. Santiago starts to have trouble reeling in the marlin and I think this is when he wishes the boy was there to help him. Another exciting part of the book is when Santiago pulls the marlin in and the sharks can smell the blood so they come to feed on the marlin. Santiago gets furious and starts killing the sharks by stabbing them over and over. He knows that if he lets them eat the marlin he will lose everything that he worked for. These are the two most exciting parts of the book. This proves that this book is not the most exciting book in the world.This book shows that nothing in life is free and everything has its price. Although Santiago has not caught a fish in 85 days he is still determined to catch the biggest fish ever. Santiago is a very persistent man. I think Manolin knows when Santiago is gone for a long time that he has caught the big one. As soon as Santiago's hand starts getting [cramps] and he hasn't been able to eat for a long time he wishes the boy was there to help him. The boy would be a great asset to Santiago at this time. This shows that Santiago was not thinking about the possibilities that could happen out on the water when he left.This book shows that nothing in life is free and everything has a price. I think this book is an okay book. I still don't see how it could win the Pulitzer surprise though."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Stories that win awards, especially the Pulitzer, usually cause people to have high expectations when reading them. This can lead them to be disappointed in the writings. I believe this is the case with the story: The Old Man and the Sea. The book is very interesting, but it lacks the ability to make the reader empathize and there is an absence of evenly distributed action and excitement. Because of this I don't believe this story deserves the Pulitzer.While reading The Old Man and the Sea, I did not share or experience the suffering that Santiago felt. For example, Santiago felt a large amount of pain, but it was not expressed in a way that the reader could feel it. When the reader can not feel what the protagonist or any other character is feeling, it makes it very hard to connect with the writing. After reading a story where little or no connection is made, I feel empty and unsatisfied with the story. For instance, when Santiago's hand is cramping, all he states is that his hand hurts. The author should have used figurative language to bring the reader in to the story. This would have made the pain seem more real. The Old Man and the Sea provides the reader with some excellent writing, but the emotions are not portrayed with much detail.This story lacks action and excitement to bring the story to life. Fishing is not a very popular event in the current age. And most of the story revolves around Santiago playing the fish. Only a select few that truly enjoy fishing find the story exciting. Furthermore, there is one instance where the author could have brought a pinch of action into the story to liven it up (102-106), however the encounter with the sharks is very brief and short lived. The story needs to have more action spread throughout it's pages. A little bit of excitement, and a tad bit of action, could make this story much more interesting and fun to read.While I was reading this book, I did not feel compelled to turn the pages or continue with the story. I would still recommend reading it because it is shows a young writer, or reader, how to write a realistic piece. I would not recommend this book for a light read, or for entertainment purpose. The Old Man and the Sea is a simplistic story that drives one to think very deeply and comprehend the little things in life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If the reader's looking for an adventurous and suspenseful book, then steer away from Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea! It is very slow and short. It starts off with Santiago saying his 85th day of fishing will bring in the mother of all fish. When he finally catches the Marlin it takes time to bring it in. This book is slow and way to short.Because The Old Man and the Sea is so slow, is causes major boredom. For example, it takes Santiago approximately 50 pages out of the 127 page book to catch the Marlin. I think if it took a shorter time, it would keep the story moving. If there was more action and wasn't so much silly talk, it might keep the reader's eye longer. In addition, Hemingway's style of writing doesn't keep me interested. There are no points where I really feel like I want to keep reading. If there is a difficult scene, it is not clear enough and I get lost. The Old Man and the Sea is slow and takes a long time to show progress.The Old Man and the Sea is shorter than the other books I have read. For example, this particular book is only 127 pages long. I am used to reading 300+ page books. I feel like Hemingway can't even finish the book. In addition, the reader may feel lost with the shortness. Many people can't see how they can finish the book successfully. Readers may feel like they have to read it again to understand it. I know I felt that way. The Old Man and the Sea is so short it can make people feel lost thinking \\"Is there really an ending?\\"The Old Man and the Sea is good but not a well thought out book. It seems to be written in a hurry. It is slow to get to the point and confuses the reader. The book's shortness can leave the reader extremely lost and might even force them to read it again. I would not recommend this book to anyone who cannot understand what they read the first time. It is for more of an experienced reader. I credit anyone who can read this book successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I liked this book because it was a page turner. It kept me HOOKED until the fish was hooked. The struggle between the man and the fish was too drawn out. Pages went on saying the fish dragged him and the fish dragged him for like 30 pages. Otherwise, this book was exellent,and I think everyone who reads it will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a very good book. I like it. It's really adventurous, and the old man is funny in it. I like how he talks. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After finishing this book in a few hours, I had mixed feelings. It was certainly not at all what I had expected from hearing about this book, which was pleasantly suprising. The more I reflected on this book, and as things were pointed out, I found myself truly appreciating Hemingway's genius. This is a very layered novella, which means that anyone can appreciate it. Looking for a mildly exciting high seas adventure? This could be filling, but if thats all you're looking for, find a different book. But, on the next level you have many themes (such as the relationship between man and nature, Christiological symbolism, and sentimental reflection over one's life) in this book that are fascinating, moving, and very well done. Overall, this is a masterfully written, yet mercifully short book (if it had been over 200 pages this book would have been a disaster.) After reading this I definitely plan to read more Hemingway works.[...]."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is the classic tale of a man's struggle against the one obstacle which never seems to take care of itself: the pursuit of happiness. In the novel, we are taken through a three day journey with an old man named Santiago as he tries to capture a fish for the first time in 83 days. The novel shoes excellent symbolism, along with Santiago's struggles with himself, and the fish he has hooked. The Old Man and the Sea is a quick easy read, and although some might not enjoy it, the novel present itself as a classic, and turns out to be close to that."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea got me hooked on reading again after I abandoned books for other less intriguing passtimes. The style with which Hemingway writes is simple; there are no words that are too complicated for even young readers to understand. That the book is so lush with detail and full of emotion despite its simplicity is credit to Hemingway. The Old Man and the Sea captivates not with physical action but with mental and emotional combat.For the first 1/3 of the book the reader is introduced to Santiago, the unlucky fisherman whose only friend is a \\"boy\\" who has jumped ship to fish with a luckier crew of fishermen. As Santiago sets off to find his catch, the reader is fixated, along with Santiago, on finding a fish and changing his luck. The reader sticks by Santiago because he is us: not always perfect, not always lucky, but the better for his dedication to his goals.When Santiago hooks the Marlin the joy is short lived as the reader questions whether this old man has the stamina left for such a battle. When the fish is finally subdued the question is whether Santiago can make it back to land since the fish has towed him so far away. The sharks come and ravage the fish and Santiago returns to port with nothing but bones and a story. Though his catch is destroyed, Santiago is a hero to the other fishermen in the village and he goes on dreaming about the lions on the beach.Santiago's struggle is our struggle: with life, death, faith, loneliness, and the demons within. We identify with Santiago because we struggle with these beasts too. Sometimes they are too big, but the only way to defeat them is to face them. Hemingway created an enduring work of great depth, but it is wrapped up in a nice little package."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Earnest Hemingway was a good book overall. The things I liked about this book was that the whole book was exciting. Basically every part of the story wants to make you continue reading it. The author describes the characters in great detail in this book. In describing the &quot;Old man&quot;, he says, &quot;his eyes were as blue as the sky and his face was as pale as a ghost.Some of the dislikes I had in this book was that for basically the whole story the old man is in the boat. Also, when the old man sees the big fish he keeps trying to catch it for a long time. Another dislike is that the old man almost dies trying to catch the fish. Overall, this book is excellent and I would recommend it to any type of reader."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway was a great book. I liked this book because it had a lot of drama. I also liked it because I was amazed that Ernest could make a good book out of catching a fish.This book was about an old man's desire to catch the biggest fish in the sea. He goes through many obstacles through the story to delay him from possibly catching the fish. His line almost breaks, and he needs to somehow get food for his long journey.I would encourage everybody to read this book. If you like drama and excitement, you will like this book. I would recommend the book for all reader's except for beginners."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Amazingly I did not read this book as an assigned reading in high school... it seems like so many have. But I did read it on my own back then... I loved it then and I love it today! This is a book that stands up each time you read it no matter what stage of life you are in. Other books struck me as moving in my high school years... and then when I re read them 10 years later they were less than satisfying.But Hemingway's little gem always hits the mark. I've read it at least 4 times and it hits me fresh each time.You really get to know who Santiago is through his strong dialogue. What Hemingway says is limited but it says so much! Santiago's feelings are apparent, his hopes and dreams jump out even when it is not written directly by Hemingway.If you read it once... read it again. If you haven't read it read it now... This should be required reading!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have a stranger take than most about this novel. It's the story about a fisherman who basically tries to catch this one really beautiful fish he's been tailing after 80+ days of not catching anything. It is a book you have to read between the lines and understand what is really being said, full of symbolism. However some people say its about Man vs. Man and I say its Man vs. Society... Santiago represents the man and the fish represents the goals of society and whether a man can actual reach them or if it will be destroyed but others out for their own needs. However you interpret it Hemingway won the Pulitzer and Nobel Prize shortly after its publication, though is Nobel was more for his entire body of work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old man who loves to fish. He dreams about catching a large fish and returning to his former days of glory.He goes out one day to fish and catches a large marlin. The long struggle between the man and marlin begins. After a long time at sea, sharks eat most of the marlin. The old man is left with only its carcass and returns to shore.I throughly enjoyed this novel. I felt Hemmingway's personification of the sea was a nice touch that made the book even better. You also couldn't help but like Santiago. His hard work and sacrifice was noble and he kept his humility throughout the book. Well, I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the struggles we all have or will face, and the effort that one put forth to achieve his goal."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book though short was very motivational. It is an excellent tale of how a man can overcome great tasks and survive terrible tragedies, while still having a will that is not defeated but rather presses on. The great task in this story is catching an extraordinary and noble fish. The tragedy however is having that great fish being stolen from Santiago, the fisherman, by hoards of blood lusting sharks. Santiago displays great courage and honor while he gets dragged out to sea by this gigantic fish. So if your looking for a good book to read and don't have a lot of time I recommend The Old Man and the Sea as an exceptional book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought this book was interesting, but slow. I really like Hemingway's style of writing, using short declaritive sentences. I do have one complaint, this book could have been written in about 20 pages. It takes this man 100 pages to catch the 18 foot marlin. I thought the old man was crazy because he had an unusual habit of talking to himself. As I said though it's very slow I had trouble getting into the book. It also lacked a true climax."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the sea is a great book about a man who just lost the swing of things. All over his hands are the scars of fishing wires dug into his skin by enormus fish but none of which are fresh. He hasn't caught a fish in a good long time but there is still a boy who has faith in him. Eventually he does get the swing of things back and it is a great story to see how. I highly recomend this book to anyone who questions the power of faith. Judging from this book i would definetely check out more books from Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is great book about an old fisherman Santiago and his young friend Manolin.

I really enjoyed this book and all the books of Ernest Hemmingway. Recommend Highly!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a great book written by Ernest Hemingway. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and also the Noble Prize in literature in 1954. Santiago an old Cuban fisherman does not have the best of luck and has fished for 84 days straight and has not caught one fish, but on his 85 day his luck seems to all change.Santiago decides to travel out further into the sea then any other fisherman has ever done before to see if he can caught a big fish. He is not out there long till he gets a fish on his line. A marlin is on his line and he has to struggle with it for two days. Till finally the marlin gives up. Now Santiago is lost in sea and does not have enough strength to go back but some how he is able it make it home.However on his way back to land he runs into some troubles cause the marlin is so huge and left a blood trail form when Santiago speared the fish. Sharks are coming up to the boat and are eating part and almost all of the fish that Santiago caught.This was a great book with some long dragged out details that could of being taken out. It shows the struggle between man and nature, and the wiliness of one human and how nothing can drop his sprits. Even when the other fishermen make fun of him for not catching any fish. This is a great book and I do suggest that any high school student should read it. It was is a nice easy read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There's just too much minute fishing detail going on in this story, and not enough of it is interesting. Hemingway writes well here, even though I've never cared for his style, the almost staccato short, declarative sentences. It's certainly more elegant here than in \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" (I've never cared for his dialogue), but we're talking about more than 100 pages about a fishing trip and all the interior monologue that goes with it. There are only two characters in this story, the rest are window dressing, and barely that. The old man (Santiago is his name, it took me a minute to remember it -- that should tell you something) is the central character, the boy (can't even remember his name, Manolo or Manolin, something like that) is the other. But, actually, the fish, a huge 1,800-pound marlin probably has a bigger role than the boy. There's almost no dialogue, it's all the man speaking aloud while he's alone in the boat. Just not that interesting, mainly because it takes so long for the man to really have to fight with the marlin and with his fate. I actually expected to be less interested, having read this in high school a million years ago, but once the old man starts bringing the fish up it gets more interesting.A good place to start if you've never read Hemingway. Quick, easy read. But maybe I need to be an old man to really appreciate the messages here. To me it seemed obvious. I'll have to pick up the Cliff's Notes to see about underlying symbolism, I'm sure there's a lot more to it than just a fish story. Man fights off loneliness and death, becomes a hero despite failure; fish represents death, old age, etc., whatever. But as an entertainment, it's just average. I'm sure \\"Jaws\\" is probably a lot more entertaining, and I know \\"Moby Dick\\" has far more layers of meaning and symbolism. You might consider one of those two instead."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about an old man named Santiago, who has been down on his luck. He has been fishing for 84 days and has not had a catch. On the 85th day, he decides he will fish out farther in sea than any fisherman has ever done before. His has faith that he will make a big catch by going out that far. After being out at sea for some hours he has a bite. For two days he let the marlin (big fish) pull him out farther in to the sea. The marlin finally gives up and Santiago harpoons it in the heart. The blood from the marlin is leaving a mile trail behine the boat. Sharks begin to come and demolish the marlin. Santiago kills off each shark that takes a bite at the marlin but by night fall it is to late to save the marlin. When he returns to his island, he tries to carry the mast out of the water. He falls 5 times the he just leave it on the beach after that. The scene reminds you of when Christ carried the cross and continues to fall because of the weight. Santiago makes it home, and his good friend Manolin is glad to see he's home safe. Manolin tells Santiago he saw the skeleton of the marlin he caught and the size was 18 feet. Santiago would be reconized forever for his catch although he feels he have been defeated."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Well, to start off, I first picked up this book because of the short amount of reading involved and the large print. After the first twenty pages or so I lost interest and the book sat in my room for weeks. After the book was given time to collect dust, my mom later told me that it was my Grandpa's favorite book; he passed away before I was born. So, after hearing that, I had second thoughts about reading this book. I tried to apply myself and really get into the book, but found it to be dull, but it had a good message to it also.The main character, Santiago, has had a streak of bad luck on his fishing skiff. The old man has been fishing with a young boy by the name of Manolin and this boy is later forced away by his parents to a more lucky ship to fish on. The boy is devoted to the old man and comes to visit him early in the morning to help prepare the ship before going off to another boat. The old man goes out for another day of unsuccessful fishing and comes back to see the boy on the docks. The boy brings the old man his coffee, newspaper, and scores of the baseball games from the day. They sit and talk about the old man's baseball hero, Joe DiMaggio, and end the day. The following day, the old man wakes up early and prepares the boat for a big trip out far past the warm waters of the Cuban coast. The spends the day tossing his nets without success in bringing in any fish losing all hope of bringing in a catch worthy of selling in the local marketplace. Right when the old man goes to pull in his nets, he caught the biggest Marlin he has ever seen. He fights with the giant fish for three days and three nights holding the rope with his bare hands giving slack so the fish doesn't pull the boat below water. Finally, the fish admits defeat and the old man is able to bring the fish to the side of the boat. With his hands bloodied and scared, he starts for home. After I finished this book, I have come to see why my Grandpa liked it so much. It depicts the determination that the old man gives in his job even after being unsuccessful for eighty-four days. The will that he has to get up in the morning and keep trying is the point to this story; never give up. When he returns home, he finds the boy there waiting for him, but the old man has nothing to show for his days out at sea but a large skeleton of the Marlin. The boy is impressed by the skeleton of the fish and wants to hear the story of the old man's fight with the fish. They sit and the old man begins to talk about his Marlin and as he continues, more and more people gather to hear the story and walk down to his boat to see the skeleton for themselves. This gives the old man hope after seeing that he can be a great fisherman and can be successful."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Just prior to reading this book, I decided to start reading American 'classics'. This is one of the first books I read. I enjoyed the story, Hemmingway brought me into the story by making feel the disappointment of Santiago.Many of us have dreams, plans, and big futures. What we don't realize is obtaining the dreams is just the beginning. As Santiago said after hooking the big fish (his dream), &quot;Now the work begins.&quot; This was a great account of perseverance, and how obtaining our dreams is secondary to keeping our dreams."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After over 500 reviews, what else can be said. Not much perhaps, but the one thing that struck me about this book was Hemingway's grasp of the natural world. Of course, Hemingway was addicted to the outdoorsman's life - but his narrative and descriptions show such incredible attention. Not only to detail, but more importantly to the details that count. This old man is in tune with nature's brutality and beauty, and his thoughts - which are really Hemingway's - are a guide to life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An old man spent eighty-five days to catch a large marlin fish, while other people spent only a few days to fish tons. Though he sleeps in a single room hut and he couldn&iexcl;t catch a fish, moreover he has been isolated by other people and he has been experiencing tough luck to survival, he will always have the endurance to live his life. Though the condition has been negative, he still thinks positively and can cope with the stress with confidence. He finally caught a marlin that was eighteen feet long on the eighty-fifth day, yet the bloody smell of the dead marlin attracted ferocious sharks, and unfortunately the marlin became a meatless skeleton when the old man finally got home.Hemingway had use the way of switching between reality and the old man&iexcl;s thought to show a person&iexcl;s psychological world. The old man kept on being challenged with difficulties and attacks from the brutal sharks. He suffered to fight against super natural force of nature and non-stop frustration and setbacks, but his confidence has always been there whatsoever and he always harbors hope in mind.The old man is a symbol of man&iexcl;s indomitable spirit. The spacious ocean gives a sense of an endless feeling of loneliness, distance, and hopelessness. Hemingway wrote this short novel in a simple style that a primary student can understand in terms of language, however he communicated his perspective regarding the meaning of life in depth.Though life is tough, just like how the old man fought against the gigantic marlin that was larger than the boat, we should always try our best to face the obstacles and find a way to solve the problems instead of escaping away from the difficulties. This refers to the old man in the book where he did not give up fighting to catch the marlin for the sake of survival. The old man seemed to be defeated when the marlin is eaten all up by the sharks, however he had made a success for he had fought against packs of sharks, and people had learned the spirit of dauntlessness from the old man."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Can you imagine being stuck in the middle of the ocean for 84 days with nothingto eat but raw dolphin and flying fish? Consider fighting a battle with a marlin thatweighed more than 1,500 lbs. and measured up to 18 ft in length. Now you can with thisaward winning novel by Ernest Hemingway.The novel The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a wonderful book.It takes place in a small fisher village on the Gulf Stream. Santiago is a very kind,thoughtful, loving, generous old man; an old man alone in a skiff fighting a greatmarlin with a harpoon, a club and his life. He has some unwelcome company also. I'll trynot to give away what the company was but it sure loved the way the great marlin tasted,and possibly the way Santiago tasted as well.The book is wonderful no doubt but has some poorly written spots. The book iswonderful but what are the chances that a man could survive for 84 days. Other than thatthis novel is full of characteristics like hope when he was near to his home, andendurance when he was stuck in the ocean and all hope was almost lost."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is really good and very adventurous.

The old man is lonely and keeps trying to fish but doesn't catch any. It's like that old saying, if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything, but this old man failed. Only a depressed person would like it"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After finishing this book, I can't help but feeling that someone pulled a big joke on me. This story is be considered a classic? Why? It's boring, futile and utterly unbelievable, to the point where I am still picking up the bits and pieces of my shattered willing suspense of disbelief.First of all, there's a marlin bigger than the dingy it's pulling around. Yeah, right. A fish that size would need to be cut off quickly before it sounds and drags the fisherman into the deep with it--although the line would likely snap first anyway.At one point we get a detailed description of how the fisherman catches a dolphin on one of the other lines, and prepares to eat it by slicing it open and cleaning out its ... gills? First, am I really to believe he manages to catch a dolphin with a line and bait? Second, dolphins are mammals, and they breathe through lungs, not gills. Hemingway even keeps calling the dolphin a \\"fish\\", a blunder of monstrous proportions.The scene with the dolphin also brings me to my biggest problem with this story: the egregious display of immense cruelty against animals. The old man drags the dolphin into his boat and unceremoniously bashes its skull in. And then of course there's the poor marlin, which gets gruesomely tortured for days before the old man finally skewers it with a harpoon. For crying out loud, old man, just cut it loose already! For most of the story I wished the old man would simply croak, or fall out of the boat to drown, so the marlin would finally be freed from its ordeal.The anticlimactic ending doesn't help either. What does it all amount to? Did the marlin's excruciating suffering and the dolphin's brutal death serve a purpose? Nope. Not even in the slightest. The marlin carcass gets devoured by sharks before the old man can reach his home port. Of course, he could have decided to cut the carcass loose so he and the sharks could share the sea in peace. Instead, the old man decides to kill a few sharks with savage fervor, mostly by poking their eyes out with a knife tied to his oar. Lovely.I am baffled that there are reviewers who actually praise this man's love for life around him, considering how he hacks and slashes his way through the story, leaving blood, guts and cut off body parts all over the place. He's not a caring or brave soul, but a stupid old fart with a sadistic streak, and it's a shame the sharks didn't get to end his worthless existence.The only thing I can say in this story's defense is that it's not as badly written as, for example, \\"A Farewell To Arms\\". The prose is terse, but Hemingway does not go out of his way to bash all the flavor out of it, although I still find it lacking punch and imagination."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"So boring, just awful. Is Hemingway a good writer? Really? This is the only book I've read by Hemingway, it's got numerous tense problems, typos and dull repetitions, dialogue about baseball that goes on and on and on. It reads as though Hemingway got very drunk one night and started writing on a tangent (Which I've since been told is something that he did often). I wouldn't mind if I could find some significance or a point in it, at least a relevant point, but there isn't one, nothing that can't be summed up in a sentence, or perhaps a two or three page story. All I can imagine is that the legacy of the book is one of those stupid 'word of mouth' things, where some reviewers and teachers said it was marvelous, so everybody else agreed due to fear of going against the crowd. It's boring and very dull to read. I've read much longer books in a much shorter period of time, because it's just ... so ... boring. When it was finished I was so angry and disappointed that I nearly threw the book at the wall (Which I might have done if I wasn't on a plane.) It felt like a severe waste of life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An old man and his friend are fisherman. Without any luck for so long, Santiago catches a fish. He likes to be alone and talks to himself. I wound not recommend this book to anyone. It is very boring. The part I hated the most was when he was out to sea. I am not finished with this book, but my mind probably want change about it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Despite being tightly composed in the stripped-back, High WASP style for which he is renowned, Ernest Hemingway's novella, 'The Old Man and the Sea' (1952) remains an essentially sentimental story of little actual substance.The simple plot conveys how Santiago, an elderly, somewhat isolated Cuban fisherman, goes to sea alone in a small boat, vaguely hoping for a one last spectacular catch to justify his past to himself and glorify his reputation throughout his community. He successfully hooks, struggles with, and harpoons a magnificent eighteen-foot marlin over the course of a long day, but slowly loses its carcass to marauding sharks while returning to shore. During the capture and after, Santiago has doubts about the wisdom of killing the animal, with whom he identifies.Once at sea, with the exception of a hurricane, the faux-sensitive Santiago predictably encounters every problem imaginable, from hunger and exhaustion to cramps in his hands, a fact which lends a pronounced and unintentional note of parody to the text.Nor is 'The Old Man and the Sea' particularly dramatic, stirring, or evocative, and the relationship between Santiago and his admiring young friend, Manolin, frequently borders on the maudlin. While Hemingway probably had every intention of portraying the impoverished Cuban fishing community with dignity, the text is often as patronizing as it is respectful.Some readers may find themselves howling with derisive laughter when Santiago and Manolin discuss baseball via such unintentionally hilarious sentances as \\"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland\\" and that which follows it, \\"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago.\\"Passages such as that in which the fisherman recalls his participation in a twenty-four hour arm wrestling match are unconvincing on every level, and the old man's philosophical attempts to come to terms with life, aging, and mortality simply don't ring as deeply as Hemingway probably believed.Best taken as a topical meditation on human existence, 'The Old Man and the Sea' is a competent but pedestrian work with little to convey beyond the literal and very modest story it tells."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I rebelled against my honors English reading list in high school. As a result, I'm not well versed in the American \\"classic\\" novels. You know, the stuff that practically everyone has read or had an assignment on at some point in their academic careers. In an effort to familiarize myself with America's prize fiction, I obtained a list of all the past Pulitzer Prize winning novels and decided I'd slowly get up to speed on the classics. Well, perhaps I'll have to start with the most recent novels and work my way backward (thanks for the suggestion Amanda!) because this early Pulitzer winner did not interest this reader at all. Although a short piece, I struggled to get to the middle of the book, then just gave up. I found neither the story nor the characters interesting. The writing seems uninspired and remote. After reading half the book I'd like to think that I would have developed some sense of closeness and/or fondness for the story/characters but it didn't happen.If novels are a reflection of the time in which they are written, then this sterilized 1950's publication is well suited for the period. I fail to see the literary merit in this novel. If you can pick this book up for under two dollars (as I did) give it try. It's not worth its retail value."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is terrible. It has no main point, confusing, irritating, and stupid. Don't read this weird book, trust me. Ernest doesn't deseve a nobel prize. Listen to me OK?! What is this book, it is so crazy and I wont even call it a book. This book is nothing!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is no mistaking the vast religious symbols in &quot; The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. First the book starts out with a fisherman teaching a boy basic values and good behavior.Then Santiago (the &quot;old man&quot;) goes out and upon catching the fish slashes his hands, symbolizing the nails jesus encountered, the cuts on his back that symbolized the whipping Jesus endured, and the horrible headache that hit the heat struck old man during the fight, that symbolized the crown of thorns that Jesus was forced to wear during the crucifiction. Also at the very end of the book, when he gets back home, he ends up carrying the mast of his vessel up to his hut on his shoulder and falling several times to rest. Nothing more than that summerization can give a better paralization of Christ carrying the cross on his horid journey and falling three times. Even though Hemingway would never admit to any of this as religious symbolism, anybody can easily see the many examples of it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea, a novel wrote by Ernest Hemingway. It was about an old Cuban Fisherman who catches the biggest fish, he had ever seen, or caught. He struggles with the fish for three long days. Although he caught the fish, He feels he lost the battle. Utilizing the symbols of the lions, DiMaggio, and Santiago, Hemingway depicts the old man as transcendent.The Lions, the first symbol, relates to the youth of Santiago. As the old man sleeps, he dreams about the lions. &quot;He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences . . . he only dreamed of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk(25).&quot; The lions make Santiago feel young and rejuvenated. Without the lions, Santiago probably would not have the strength to wake up in the morning, non the less catch a gigantic marlin. As the fish continued and the chase dragged on, Santiago grows tired. &quot; I wish he'd sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the only thing left(66)?&quot;DiMaggio represents a cause or a purpose for Santiago to continue. Santiago feels that DiMaggio judges him and will be either proud or disappointed. &quot; But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly . . . (68)&quot;. Santiago wonders if he should stay with the fish, or give in and quit. &quot;Do you believe that the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I have stayed with you(68)?&quot;The final symbol characterizes Santiago as a Christ Symbol. During Santiago's Journey he wonders if the villagers are good enough to eat the fish. &quot; How many people will eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him...(75)&quot; The first part of the Christ Symbol, is the sin. The villagers committed a sin by being lazy, and letting Santiago do all of the work. Sacrifice, the second part of a Christ symbol, occurred when Santiago risked his life in going out into the deep water.&quot; \`Ay, he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood(107).&quot; When Santiago screamed, he relaxed that he had created the sacrifice. He knows that what he did was beyond his call of duty. The third and final part of a Christ Symbol is the rebirth. After Santiago returned to the village, he and the boy talked.&quot;'You must get well fast for there is much to learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?' \`Plenty', the old man said(126).&quot; The old man has been reborn therefore making him a Christ Symbol.Using these symbols Hemingway pictured Santiago as Victorious. The effect of the lions and DiMaggio work hand in hand. The lions give Santiago youth and DiMaggio gives him."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is one of the finest books I have ever read. Every year, I revisit my well worn copy and renew an old and dear friendship.This story of the honorable struggle between man and nature are highlighted here in the battle between the &quot;old man&quot; and a magnificent sail fish. As the sturggle continues over many miles and into the night, these two giants of the sea battle with, ulitmately the death of one. But, as this battle between the two ends, another battle begins in an alogory of the man's battle against the ravages of age. A battle, though bravely fought, cannot be won but accepted. But even in the loss of this battle, the ultimate beauty and accomplishment of the life cannot be destroyed. Honor in life and honor in death. By far and away, this is the finest and most thoughtful of all Hemingway's works and will hold the readers attention from the first page to the last.And, on a desert island, the fishing tips could be pretty handy."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is more than a tale about a man and a boy. It's about the opposites, the yin and yang that control and engross everything in the daily world.It's the black and white of typical poetry.On its surface, The Old Man and the Sea is about the relationship between an old man, Santiago, and a young boy, Manolin, both fishermen. The old man used to fish with the boy - the boy may in fact have been doing the majority of the work - but because of a string of bad luck, the boy's parents made him fish with a more fortunate person. The boy's allegiance, however, is still with the old man.Eventually, the story turns into the tale of Santiago's struggle against the greatest of competitors, an unbelievably large fish, one which he eventually learns to admire and love.In the end, it's still the boy's love and respect that help nurse the old man back to normalcy.Whether it's the struggle between life and death, human versus beast, old versus young, or day and night, The Old Man and the Sea is a powerful story that can easily relate to any difficulty in everyday life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Review of The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway was driven to create a book which exhibits the skills developed by him as a writer. Through time his books were published. Some were to the liking of readers while others weren't. After years of struggle came his magnum opus. The Old Man and the Sea was published and read by millions. It was created by Ernest Hemingway using his abundant knowledge and experience to prove himself as an author!Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece comes to life as he understands the literary elements of his story! For example, Hemingway knows the Cuban and fishing culture very well. He occasionally uses Spanish words to emphasize an emotion, such as dentuso to insult a shark. Hemingway also uses correct fishing terms. Instead of referring to the small boat, he calls it the skiff. In addition to his cultural knowledge, Ernest Hemingway gives his characters realistic personalities. Throughout the story, both Santiago and Manolin experience a variety of human emotions. Each character is imperfect, like any real life person. Santiago suffers from bad luck and loneliness, while Manolin is heart struck by the old man's condition. While succeeding in keeping his story realistic, Ernest Hemingway uses his experience in writing to arouse the reader's attention!The Old Man and the Sea is a perfect example of how experienced Ernest Hemingway is in writing. For example, his word choice gives life to his characters. When describing Santiago's appearance he goes in depth in detail by using appropriate similes and metaphors. When describing an oncoming shark, the words he chooses to use delivers a feeling of suspense to the reader. Also, Hemingway shows off his ability to create a smooth flowing story. He can fit a large amount of information and detail into a single sentence without it sounding rambled. Other sentences are only three words but still succeed in getting the point across. Because of his style, Hemingway can intoxicate the reader with a chosen feeling!In The Old Man and the Sea, all of Ernest Hemingway's skills were thrown together to earn himself a Pulitzer Prize. I was inspired not by the story itself but by the quality of his unique style of writing. In my opinion, Hemingway's career as an author was an immense success because of this book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are people who will tell you that the sharks in The Old Man and the Sea represent literary critics who wrote unfavorable reviews about Hemmingway's work or tell you that Santiago is a metaphor for Christ and that there are clues to this throughout the novel.These people need to give their heads a shake.The Old Man and the Sea is a straightforward novel about the pride and honor that a man feels when he faces a worthy opponent with integrity. To me, this isn't a man against nature novel, but rather a novel about how man is one with nature.This is a simple but powerful story about the strength of the human spirit. Hemmingway's strong, sparse prose is effective, making this compelling novel a genuine classic.There's no reason to read between the lines. This novel is exactly what it appears to be - the story of an old man and the sea. It doesn't need to be anything more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A short but powerful story, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" tells the story of an aged fisherman and his interminable endurance and strength in his pursuit of a prized fish. The \\"old man\\", Santiago, shows all the strength and determination of a true hero, although he is defeated in the end by ravenous sharks. Yet, there is glory even in defeat.Santiago is portrayed as a near Christ-like figure, although he is not a devout Christian, himself. Through the pain and bleeding, Santiago endures as the hours turn into days in his pursuit of an enormous marlin. And even though he eventually wins the fight with the marlin, his worthy opponent, he is betrayed in the end by sharks. Yet, he perseveres through it all. Although there is nothing left of his fish but the carcass, one can't help feel triumph for the old man's endurance and sacrifice for pursuit of the marlin.Hemingway portrays death as a natural occurrence that is inevitable. Although Santiago feels regret for having to kill the marlin, he knows that in the natural order the fish must die. He considers himself a worthy opponent to befall the mighty marlin, whom he greatly respects. Yet, he does not fret over his adversary and considers him a brother. Through their death struggle, Santiago and the marlin develop an intimacy of the soul and a special kinship. Santiago wishes no harm to the marlin, yet he knows that he must ultimately take its life.In the end, it is Santiago's pride that brings about his downfall, as well as the marlin's. If it wasn't for his immense pride, he would not have ventured so far from shore, and he would have never caught the marlin. If the marlin did not brazenly swim so far from its comrades, it would not have been caught by Santiago. Immense pride compels Santiago to fight for days, although he knows that the marlin is immense and almost too large for his small skiff. Yet, Santiago will not give up hope and he eventually succeeds in subduing the marlin.Overall, this novel provides a quick, but potent tale about man's endurance and struggle. This may be a relatively simple tale, but Hemingway delivers an entertaining, yet though-provoking story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's Nobel Prize winning novella (1954) seems starkly simple at first glance: an old Cuban fisherman pits his mind and his body against the sea--in the form of a huge marlin first, then battling vicious predators. Returning to shore several days later, he sinks in both physical and emotional exhaustion onto the beach--with only an 18-foot carcass to show for his grueling ordeal. Man catches Fish; Man Loses fish. Such a plot analysis would prove a pathetic tale--but I suspect that the author intended more than a skeletal storyline.In this small book Hemingway has captured the essence of a man who is truly born to catch game fish--a man who recognizes his place in the chain of Life. Hours--even days--alone at sea provide ample time to consider luck, sin and the mysterious maritime fraternity. Santiago's iron will and prodigious strength are tested to the limits of human endurance. Perhaps the ending is neither pathetic nor even tragic, as one theme may be to respect Nature's right to be itself and man's obligation to fit in with the great plan. Can man evolve morally enough to recogize his non-human Brothers--wherever they live? A short, intense read with seeminlgy little action, but plenty of mental dialogue and psychological growth, as a fisherman comes of age in his old age."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemmingway's book The Old Man and the Sea has a very good message and can be read by many people of all ages and reading levels. This book is inspirational and uplifting, however it is boring. Although this book is slow and repetitive, the story has an inspiring and uplifting message.Throughout the book The Old Man and the Sea, there were many parts I liked and some I disliked. A part of the book I disliked was when the sharks came and started eating the marlin Santiago caught. To me this was heartbreaking and somewhat painful to read because I felt bad for Santiago. My favorite part was when Manolin wants to fish and help Santiago, even though his parents don't allow him to. It was neat to see Manolin care for the old man and his fishing as much as he did. The part most inspiring to me was when Manolin believed in Santiago even though he was unlucky. There were many parts of this story that were both uplifting and devastating.People of all ages would like this book but mainly those who like slow, simple, uneventful books. For example, the word choice Hemmingway uses is quite simple. I like this because it makes the book flow better and doesn't make you think too hard about the words. This is also good because little kids can read and understand what is being said. I would recommend this book because it has more than words but also a good message. The message is uplifting and inspirational with all the struggles Santiago overcomes. I think by having a good message more people will read it and be touched. This book is great for people of all ages and reading levels.Hemmingway's book was very touching and inspirational to me. It gave me a sense of hope when reading.

Books that could stop my heart for a second, make sweat on my hand or surround my mind with saddness and pain, books like mysteries or dectective books. This book was really not my style.

It took me about 2 1/2 hours total to read it. Yet his person vs. nature is very interesting. I dont know why this book is so popular still today, but it is a pretty good book.

It sets him apart from the majority of modern writers as a brilliant story teller. It is also commendable for its mood and subtlety.The novel is almost exclusively about the isolated life and thoughts of an old fisherman who unexpectedly finds himself pursuing the largest catch of his life. As the old man hooks his prey and follows it out to sea for several days, it becomes evident that his motive centers more around personal challenge and a kind of silent (dare we say &quot;existential&quot;) heroism than commercial gain or notoriety. His recollections, thoughts and struggle have a peace and momentary savagery that is totally in keeping with the rhythm of the sea.I grew up on the ocean and spent a significant portion of my life living on boats. Speaking from my own experiences I can say that Hemmingway &quot;got it&quot; in this book. He captured the mood, rhythm and isolation of a sailor's thoughts with impeccable realism.Many of Hemingway's novels do not convey mood as successfully as this one. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; never fully convinces the reader of the desperate courage or its characters because the dialog is too canned. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; begins with one of the greatest openings of any Twentieth Century novel and then dissolves into unremarkable turmoil and argument. Even &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; seems a little too self-conscious of the image it attempts to portray. But &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is flawless in its ability to draw us into its mood."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my second favorite Hemingway book. The first being For Whom the Bell Tolls. However, this classic is timeless and crafty in that, its written just right. It's a book about life an its certain aspects that I will not mention to save the story for those of you that haven't read it. If you read the book and only notice the fish, then you've missed the point.

His life is devoted to being a fisherman, and the book takes place mostly at sea. The Old Man dosen't have a name and is descibed as a strong person with the dedication and the will to hold on to a fish that he hooked that swims farther out to sea.This book has a lot of detail and builds pictures of the ocean's surroundings not only above the sea, but under the sea.

If this were a fable then I would say that the moral would be about loyalty, from begging to end. The boy shows so much loyalty towards the old man by helping every morning before they go out on their own separate boats. When they come in for the evening the boy waited on the old man and fixed him supper even though everyone in the town thinks it unlucky to be around the old man.

Only Hemingway could write this book in a way that keeps it simple yet is very descriptive. It is my favorite book mostly because it is about fishing but also because of the deep meanings and allegories it has. Deep meanings about how he struggled and fought the fish for days after not catching anything for 84 days, is in a way related to Hemingway at the time. He had been in a slump with bad writing for a long time then came out of the slump as Santiago in the book had. This is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was in my opinion and good book, but with a few exceptions. When I was first assigned to read this book for English class I immediatly procrastinated when I would yet to begin reading this book. Days passed, then weeks, and I still had not even glanced at the book. After a few weeks I finally decided to look at the book. I read about ten pages and immediately found myself bored with the book. I out the book away and didn't retreave it until later. I was sitting home one weekend watching TV when I came across a movie that looked familiar. After watching about twenty minutes of this movie I realized that it was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. I was very taken back when I continued watching the movie. I really liked it and best of all I found it easier to understand. After the three hour movie I was very surprised about how much I like the story. But I was even more surprised when I kept thinking in my head about the story and wanted to read the book. I immediatly ran to my backpack and got the book. I read the whole thing in about 1 hour and enjoyed it greatly. I apprecited it alot more too. I espechially like it because the story was indeed well told and focussed on so many other things than I thought it did. One part in the book that I liked alot was when the old man talked about his days when he was younger and how he had spent so many long hours, and sometimes days giving everything he had just to win a simple arm wrestling match. But, everytime he was able to earn a victory. I also liked how Ernest Hemingway captured the moment just right. E.H. featured many places and scenes in the book and did not always ficus what was important but really set the mood and tone for the events that were about to, or yet to happen in the book. Another thing I must mention that I liked was that the old man had so much respect in the book. I just loved this story so much and how it captured everything so well. I think it was really well written and even though it took me awhile to discover the true meaning in this book and can honestly say that I am pleased and happy that I gave the book and chance. In a way I can refer myself to the book, alot of people in the book did not really want to give the old man a chance, and didn't think he would ever catch a fish again but the old man proved them wrong and only the people who had true respect for the old man understood that he would always succeed. This is what I did, I gave the book a chance and myself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I always enjoy reading Hemingway's book The Old Man and the Sea. It is a great book because it can be read on so many levels. There is the adventure of the catch, but it is more. It is a great example of love and sharing between two people, Santiago and the boy. It also brings back memories of the Native American ethic of loving your environment. Santiago loves the sea. He cares about its creatures even as he is attempting to land the fish. He feels the same way about the sky, wind and sun. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves classic literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I love this book. I read it for the first time in seventh grade and have read it 4 times since. I love it even though it may be boring to some people. The imagery is great and the story, even better."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was one of the best classics that I ever had to read for an English class. When our teacher first told us that we were to go buy it, I was very reluctant. I didn't want to read a stupid book about fishing, I can't stand to fish! However, I took a trek to the store and brought it home and wow! I couldn't put it down. I was finished with the story in two days. I found that Hemingway's style of writing was fascinating to me and the way he described things made them come alive. When he would talk about Santiago, I was able to envision him standing in front of me and he used great figures of speech. For instance, one of my favorite lines in the book was, &quot;his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish...but none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.&quot; I was glad I read this book, it taught me a lot about life and materialism and made me realize just what you can achieve for yourself if you put your mind to it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;This is a book just about fishing&quot;. Many people think this is what The Old Man and The Sea is about, but it more than just fishing. It is about the struggle of a man, Santiago, to catch his fish, and his perseverance through all odds. He is an old man, but he is determined, and he never gives up on reaching his goal. Even though there are a good sixty or so pages of Santiago being dragged by the fish, the pages pass quickly due to Hemingways great writing style. This book at first glance may appear boring, but if you get to discuss it with a book club or classmates, you will discover that it is a great book with multiple hidden meanings that are fun to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"To be completely honest, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is not a book I particularly cared for. I thought that too much time was taken to describe the fishing trip. I thought that the overall idea had a very powerful underlying meaning, but I feel he wrote about it the wrong way. The struggles Santiago had to undergo were very important aspects in this book, but they were too drawn out and that often caused me to lose interest in the novel. So, in conclusion, I liked the idea of self-respect in the face of defeat and being a true hero, but the book was uninteresting and far too lengthy in many of the passages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea had some really interesting thoughts in it that made me think about hero's in a new way. The story of Santiago's struggles and how he returned with no physical rewards or prizes, seemed very relatable, very realistic. I really admired the old fisher, amazed at what he endured, and sympathetic to his fate. It would have been romantic if he had returned with his marlin, and the story had ended happily. However, just like you learn from struggles in life, I learned a lot more from the struggles in the book. The thing that I liked the most about the book was that Hemingway challenged most people's view (at least in the western world) of a hero. I liked that he showed in this story that the superficial and worldly prizes aren't necessary to make a human being worthy of admiration. Also, just like the tourist's at the end didn't understand what the fisherman had gone through, most people don't recognize the true hero's that are alive now, but not to let that discourage you. Though the story was sad, I really enjoyed it. It made me think that maybe, even though though I might not become wealthy or beautiful or famous, that I still might attain true worth through obstacles that I face and overcome, by my character, not my prizes."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Over the last few months, I had the pleasure of reading Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. I found the book extremely easy, fast reading, and interesting. The constant struggles of Santiago were particularly interesting in the way it was described. Not only could you get the sense of what he was feeling, but also you felt as if you were in the boat alongside him. Where others may find his time at sea drawn out and uninteresting, I thought it only added to the fascinating complex and personality of the book itself. Even though I am a strict science fiction reader, I found that this book captured my attention and kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A Boring BookErnest Hemmingway has a very unique writing style. He has bland word choice and his stories move slowly, it almost seems like he is trying to make the reader fall asleep. These descriptions of his writing are shown quite a bit in The Old Man and The Sea. The Old Man and The Sea is a boring book!Bland word choice fills the pages of The Old Man and The Sea. For example, \\"Eat them good now and then there is the tuna.\\" Hemmingway lacks the words to catch the reader's attention. This causes the reader to get tired of the story and drift into other thoughts. For instance, \\"But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\\" That sentence is filled with clutter. Hemmingway made that sentence complicated. Simplifying the sentence would make it easier to understand. If Hemmingway used less clutter in the book the number of pages would be cut in half.The Old Man and The Sea is a highly predictable book. The Old Man and The Sea lets the reader always see what is going to happen next in the book. In addition, \\"The shark was not an accident.\\" Throughout the entire story the readers have a sense that what is happening to Santiago is too good to be true. Don't watch the biography of Ernest Hemmingway before reading The Old Man and The Sea. The show gives away the ending of the story. That is no loss because there was no suspense in the book anyway. When you already know the ending of a story it ruins the rest of the book.To sum it all up, \\"The old Man was dreaming about the lions.\\" The ending was the same as what happened early in the book. Hemmingway's writing style in The Old Man and The Sea was very predictable and contained bland word choice and clutter. The Old Man and The Sea was a very boring book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In my opinion, this book is just flat out boring, but i can see why it won an award.

No highlighting, markings or anything, so I am very appreciative. Would do business again if need be."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"...Page after page of predictable events leave much to be desired by a reader. When a book wins the Pulitzer Prize, I would expect it to be more detailed and interesting. When I sit down to read a book, I want it to be something that catches my eye, not something that bores me to death from the minute that I begin. The Old Man and the Sea, written by Ernest Hemmingway, is an uncaptivating story lacking details and excitement.With an ongoing plot of persistence Santiago faces his unexpected fate. For example, Santiago, who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-five days, is confident and keeps trying. Santiago's fish seems to never come. He never gives up, knowing it will work out in the end. When he finally gets his fish, there seems to be a barrier keeping him from his prize. Furthermore, Santiago's fate of persistence does not turn out how he planned. He expects to bring in this glorious fish, but little does he know that fate is trying to stop him. Through the obstacles he faces, he finds that life isn't always how it is expected to be. Santiago's persistence kept the book going, with the same lack of detail in everything that happened.Through Santiago's persistence I can relate this story to my life, though I found it dull and boring. For instance, no matter what happened to Santiago, he stayed positive and persistent. There have been many times I have needed to be persistent to go on. Even if in the end it doesn't turn out how you want it to and you feel as though you have failed. I, like Santiago, have found it is better to have failed trying then to just give up. Moreover, I found the story to be boring and definitely not a page turner. I was not looking forward to reading it, for the simple reason it didn't keep me interested. It seemed like the same events kept occurring and that I have read it before. The lack of details made it hard for me to stay hooked on each moment in this book. Even with relating this book to my life, I still dreaded what was to come next.The Old Man and the Sea is the first, and the last book that I plan to read by Ernest Hemmingway. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a book that would put them to sleep. Going through the book, only anticipating the end is not what I see as excitement. This book just leads to disappointment toward an award winning author with every page that is turned."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I asked my classmates when I was in school to select the Hobbit as a reading assignment instead, but they insisted on The Old Man and the Sea because it was a few pages shorter and they were just a lazy bunch of semi-literates. I normally like the classics, whether 20th Century classics or Shakespear, Wilde, Dickens, Shelly, Lord Byron and so on. No one has to force me to read books by those authors. That is why I was surprised that I hated so much a book by such a highly regarded author, such as Hemmingway. The characters were just boring. I didn't care for teh old man or the kid. It seems that nothing really happens in the book. You could skip the entire middle part of it and end up with pretty much the same story. By the way, this is the only Hemmingway story that I have read so maybe he has some other better stuff. This book has, however, put me off him and I don't expect to pick up another by him for the foreseable future, unless I get a really good recommendation."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I must've (literally) fallen asleep at least five times before making it through the first 50 pages... the beginning is hard to get into, and basically a total drag... once you get past that, however, it gets more interesting (although, by that time, you're halfway through the book). The end is incredibly disappointing, but has a lot of meaning to it. The entire book is filled with hidden meanings and allusions, but some are hard to catch.

I never put this book down once.

Yes, it can be read on the story level, but if you do only that you're missing the point. I truly believe that Hemingway meant this to be a sort of fable.The plot is nothing much: Santiago is an old fisherman who has had no luck recently. He is shunned by his village and even the small boy who is supposed to accompany him is taken away. He's completely alone when he decides to go out into the Gulf.When he does land a fish, it is the struggle of his life. While he has the fish online we're privy to his inner thoughts, and most of all, his conflicts. He wants to catch the fish and puts up the fight of his life, but the fish is also fighting and part of Santiago respects this, and part of him wants the fish to win.The story on a much deeper level is about two things in my mind: Man's struggle with his environment, and man's struggle with himself. The conflict of emotions within Santiago are in a way even more heartbreaking than those between himself and the village that has so shunned him, for the conflict within a person is all his--all that one person's problems.Some have seen Santiago as a Christ-like figure, and I suppose this is possible, but if you want to take it to that level you're probably carrying it further than Hemingway meant, though we can't know that for sure.I like Hemingway's books, but some of them seem colorless at times. This one, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" seems timeless and is the best thing he ever produced. It IS a classic in so many senses. I don't think anyone realized that this book would stand the test of time when it first appeared. Now it is everywhere and has been read by almost everyone.A short easy read, there's more packed into this novel than most bestsellers today. I would suggest that anyone who hasn't read any Hemingway start with this book. His greatest work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a book about Santiago, an old fisherman living in a coastal fishing town. He is a poor man, but with a richness of character that is recognised and admired by his friend, a young boy named Manolin. Manolin has much faith in Santiago, which is mentioned on page 12. \\"He hasn't much faith.\\" \\"No.\\" the old man said. \\"But we have. Haven't we?\\" \\"Yes,\\" the boy said. Santiagois down on his luck, he hasn't had a catch in 84 days, and on the 85th day Santiago decides that he will not return home without a catch, to break his losing streak. On the 85th day, alone in the boat, he manages to hook an enormous marlin, the biggest fish he's ever seen in all his life. The fish is larger and stronger than Santiago. Santiago's experienced fishing skills and his will to catch and survive push him to pursue the fish for many days, and many miles out to sea. Santiago loves this fish, he respects it for its beauty, its size, and its power. Pg. 49, \\"Then he began to pity the great fish he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.\\" Still Santiago must demonstrate his own power over the fish, for the sake of his pride. After an incredible and exhausting fight, the fish is his. He must now get it back to shore. After killing the fish, he ties the fish to the skiff. The marlin fish he catches is as big as the struggle he has yet to face after his catch. And so his next battle begins. Sharks appear and start to feed on the defenseless carcass of the marin fish. Santiago tries to defend the great fish, he tries to defend its beauty, its dignity, as well as his own triumph over the fish. He tries to defend his prize, his joy, and make it back to shore. Read to find out the conclusion to The Old Man and The Sea. Hemingway's language is simple and profound and he touches us, enabling us to feel Santiago's emotionts, experiences and struggles. His sentences are full of detail but at the same time are very clear. The author delves into the mind of the old man, and we experience the pain and suffering that Santiago endures through trying to catch his fish. There are four reocurring themes that the author presents in The Old Man and The Sea. The first theme that Hemingway presents is the idea that you shouldn't keep wishing you would have this thing or that, do what you can with what you have. \\" I wish I had a stone for the knife,\\" the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. \\"I should have brought a stone.\\" You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.\\" The next theme Hemingway presents is the idea that something is too good to be true, or that something is so good that you must be dreaming. Pg 97, \\"He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream.\\" Then he mentions, \\" Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. Another of Hemingways many themes is the idea that man is not to be defeated. In this story, full awareness of defeat is contrasted with an unwillingness to be destroyed. Pg. 101, \\" But man is not made for defeat,\\" he said. \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" One of the most important and most reocurring themes in this story is the power struggle between man and nature or what we call man vs. nature. On page 66, the old man is talking about how he will show the fish what man can endure, he says, \\"Although it is injust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.\\" The old man also shows respect for nature,and calls the fish his brother. The old man says, \\"It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.\\" I highly recommend this book. It is a sad but extremely beautiful book. I enjoyed reading about Santiago and his struggle with catching the big fish. It reminds me of the struggles we face in our daily life. This book is about the human spirit and the struggles we face in our lives with ourselves and nature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It was a very good read.

Now if asked if I can beat up someone I tell them yes and how long it would take. At the top of the list I am going to place the Incredible Hulk, I ran the numbers and it would take me 4 hours to beat him up.1. Incredible Hulk : 4 hours of good old fashion street fighting, but in the end I would exhaust him and be declared the winner.2. Evangeline Lilly : 3 days . Not really a fight but I would sure be spent after the engagement.3. 300lb Giant Lobster: 2 days in his environment 2 minutes in mine.4.

I wold then take the two by the scruff of their necks and drop them in a huge aquarium with a giant 2 lb.

Then comes web cam and a reality blog of Stallon and Cruise living together in a prehistoric land with a giant lobster.

Often, critics look upon this work as a reflection of the author's rugged individualism, but there is a tragic aspect that clearly makes this work a representative piece of the Modernist era--a period of time from the early to the middle of the twentieth century, where, among other things, was a real fear that the world's classical values were disappearing. To me, this is apparent in the relationship between Manolin and Santiago, Santiago's pathetic quest for the eighteen-foot marlin, and the encroachment of a commercial world apparent through the tourists.What first strikes my sensibilities is the integral relationship between the apprentice, Manolin, and his master, Santiago, who, according to society's standards, can be considered a cast away as a result of the death of his wife, his financial hardship, his weak physical condition, and, increasingly, his declining performance as a fisherman. Clearly, he is in the last stages of his life and can only function with the assistance of Manolin, who increasingly has begun to venture off into his own sphere as, one might suspect, a successful commercial fisherman. And yet, Manolin is the son we fathers would all want: his loyalty, his respect of his elders, his willingness to learn the ways of the past, and, most importantly, his humility in the face of his own superiority. Living in Katy, I still witness these relationships, but increasingly they can be found only in movies or in books such as Hemingway's.Hemingway also aptly points out the fleeting ancestral values through Santiago's pathetic quest for the king of fishes. This journey displays Santiago's cunning and physical prowess as a fisherman and reinforces his commitment to Manolin, but clearly, as Santiago leaves the familiar to venture out into unfamiliar waters, he must battle not only the marlin itself that is dragging him out to sea but also the sharks that naturally want their pound of flesh for his sin. At the top of Santiago's mind is Manolin, of course, but his deeper motivation is to prove himself worthy of the battle, and, in the process be rewarded with the riches accompanied with selling the flesh of the marlin, his revered brother. In a not so subtle way Hemingway, I believe, sends the subtle message that Santiago's flaw is what many modern men do today: going to extremes to earn wealth from the world and admiration from society, especially of those closest to them. Santiago may have accomplished his ultimate goal, but he is merely left with a skeleton that reminds him of his tragic error.The other aspect of this novella that is striking are the tourists. The tourists really could almost be any of us, especially in that last scene where one spots the discarded skeleton of the marlin heaped in trash pile. \\"What is that?\\" the tourist asks. Although the waiter gives a literal and wrong response, Hemingway's answer is clear: it's the values of a bygone era expressed through the interplay of Manolin and Santiago heaped upon the trash pile of history. All may not be bleak. Manolin rushes to aid Santiago by providing him food and comfort, but one has to wonder if the younger generation will be as kind and generous as Manolin. That fear may be answered in the final line when, in a dream, we learn what is at the top of Santiago's mind: the Lions of Africa, symbols of his glorious youth that will live only as long as the deteriorating old man.As many have demonstrated, Hemingway's genius is to take the every day and pack it with symbolic values in the most terse language. The Old Man and the Sea is not an exception. One part fishing story, one part allegory, and the final part social commentary, this story is truly rewarding for those patient enough to unravel the layers of the story's onion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"Be detailed and specific.

There is nothing like it in American fiction; it says a great deal about man and his relationship with the rest of the world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" remains a literary staple for students learning about literature -- and American literature in particular. I read this book many years ago and just re-read Ernest Hemingway's best-known work.This novella offers different things, and different perspectives, at different times. Put another way, \\"The Old Man and Sea\\" might read as an entertaining fish story to a young student and then offer an insightful metaphor for life for an adult.One of the interesting metaphors that I found on my most recent read of this novella is that of the sea for perspective. Hemingway writes of the different levels, or layers, in the sea through the eyes of Santiago, the protagonist. There are different fish, and different challenges, across different layers of the sea. One can look down through the water and see different things based on how deeply one looks.Given the widespread popularity and critical acclaim for this novella, it is no real surprise that it is an entertaining and enjoyable (and quick) read. I encourage all readers to examine this book at different times in life. It takes a short time to read and the payback is more than worth the investment of time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The number of morally upright lessons this story elucidates is stunning. Determination, fortitude, and a dogged perseverance are the hallmarks of this work. This book jolts you at your core. Everyone should read, and enjoy this work. It is sadly ironic that the lessons given to us by the author somehow departed him, and he chose to give up the fight and commit suicide."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"By far one of his greats works.

The Old Man's desire to catch the fish was displayed throughout the entirety of the novel. I enjoyed the climax of his catching of the fish, though I believe the joy of the story was ruined when the sharks ate his well deserved fish. I will say that the characters' traits are very well portrayed and the Old Man, especially, touches the heart. Altogether, its a good short read, but I cannot recommend it to someone who enjoyes a fast-paced action book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemmingway's book,&quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; is a riveting tale about an aging fisherman's battle against growing old. The book is packed &quot;to the gills,&quot; with symbolism comparable to daily life, daily struggles and events.Santiago (the old man) hooks a marlin that is gargantuan, an enormous creature, worth an immeasurable lot when contrasted with his extreme poverty. Him and the fish do battle. Santiago spends the book finding himself, fighting himself in his mind, warring over failure and the impossibility of letting that happen.I think this book, as a whole represents following one's dreams. Despite the looks of the onlookers, to follow through with it even if you don't end up with any results, its about how much you've grown getting there. An excellent book. I recommend it for any age group, for the younger readers the fascinating imagery is enough to satiate there imagainist fancies and for adults Hemmingway's novella over growing old, and the symbolism there of is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my husband and he loved it. He's not into the mindless reading material available today, preferring to bend his mind around the classics.

For 84 days, the old man Santiago hasn&iexcl;t been able to catch a thing. But bad luck and others&iexcl; lack of faith in him, with the exception of his former apprentice, don&iexcl;t stop Santiago, who remembers his greatest catch back in 1985 and decides that things will improve greatly on the 85th day. He sails his skiff far into the Gulf Stream and that is where he feels the great marlin attach. Santiago tries to reel the marlin in, but it&iexcl;s too strong and so he hangs on and lets the marlin pull him across the open sea. For three days, Santiago hangs on to the line, despite cuts, pains, and no sleep. During this time, Santiago talks to himself to keep his mind fresh, and has discovered a deep bond with this huge fish, the catch of his life. &iexcl;Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought, but are they worthy? &iexcl;He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth.The punishment of the hook, the punishment of hunger and not comprehending his adversary is everything&iexcl;&iexcl; Finally on the third day, Santiago manages to pull the marlin close enough to kill it with his harpoon. But as Santiago turns back for his island, sharks sense the marlin&iexcl;s blood and attack the skiff. Santiago defends them both as best as he can, but new pods of sharks are always arriving. In the end, the marlin is so badly mutilated that santiago realizes that he has ruined them both by going too far and forcing the marlin&iexcl;s defeat. Santiago makes it back home, without any great catch, but a blissful dream of lions on a golden beach in Africa."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am not enthusiastic about this book but I respect it and I understand why it is considered a classic. The Nobel Prize for literature is more of a lifetime achievement award even though this book was specifically cited as follows: \\"For his powerful, style-forming mastery of the art of modern narration, as most recently evinced in 'The Old Man and the Sea.'\\"The book tells the story that is so familiar that I won't bother to repeat its details here. The original true story which Hemingway described in a journalism piece available in \\"Byline: Ernest Hemingway\\" was a brief account of a Cuban fisherman who hooked an enormous billfish in his little boat and got pulled out into the open ocean. The fish is attacked and partly devoured by sharks. A large fishing boat rescues the unnamed fisherman; he is delirious, having gone for days without food or water. The fish is brought back to the dock in Cuba: there's a picture of the huge and still formidable half eaten fish hanging by the tail.Hemingway fictionalized this story almost two decades later to make it a symbolic parable about man's struggle against nature and against his own frailty. The old man, Santiago, holds on by sheer willpower, at one point he says to the fish, let me kill you or you can kill me, I don't care which.In addition to speaking to the fish and to the sharks that attack at the end of his voyage, Santiago also spends time talking to his injured left hand, an obvious reference to the looming Communist revolution in Cuba. The fish and the old man Santiago represent the huddled masses of Cuba yearning to breathe free. The sharks that attack represent, variously, worldwide mercantile Capitalism, jingoistic American gunboat diplomacy and the oppressive authoritarian Bautista regime under which poor Santiago is starving to death. Santiago is able to beat down attacks by the first two but the last succeeds in picking clean the marlin's carcass. Thus, Hemingway shows that Cuban revolution had not yet developed sufficient strength in 1952 to overcome the brutal Bautista dictatorship."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An Original StoryDo you know what makes a great story well I think I do. I believe that The Old Man and the Sea is a great original story. I will tell my thinking about a great story.The Old Man and the Sea shows how life experience can make a great story.For example Ernest Hemingway was a great fisherman; I know this from watching his biography. I like the way Ernest uses the intelligence of his own life in his story The Old Man and the Sea. I like this story very much; it is one of the best I have ever read. In the same way, other authors use bits of information from their lives. I do not like books or stories that I can't learn anything from it. I like to find information on the person or what they do. Therefore the style of writing in The Old Man and the Sea is the kind of writing that catches my attention the most.In this story Ernest Hemingway uses voice very well. For instance Ernest didn't use voice in conversations with characters talking to other characters very often, he made up little blurts of speaking. I like Ernest's way of including a lot of voice without using vary many characters. Santiago talks to a bird that lands on the skiff that show Ernest's originality and how he uses voice. Likewise Ernest Hemingway's use of voice contributes to his overall story The Old Man and the Sea. I say this because Ernest used the exact right amount of voice in this story. When making a story I find that using original voice might make the story much better. All in all I say that voice was used very well in this story.Using personal experience, originality, and great voice all contribute to a great story. This kind of writing is good for any kind of reading. This book is the second best I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I agree that children who hate reading and doing book reports should not post their reviews on Amazon, because the kids are going to hate reading it anyway since it is an assignment. As an 18 year old book lover, I thought I would give this book a try. Nobody forced me to read it, I read it for my own enjoyment. I just did not find this book interesting. I kept thinking..Santiago, let that fish go and row back to shore. Was it really worth all that trouble? I gave this book two stars because the book had one or two genuine moments in it that inspired me, but I did not care for the story as a whole. The book left me disappointed, so I started reading &quot;A Brave New World&quot;. It is a much better book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think this book is not for young people to read. It will become a borring book for them.

I recognized the metaphors about life, but I didn't care because the story just wasn't engaging. Eat raw dolphin, pee over the side of the boat, pull the fish. Rinse and repeat.I thought maybe re-reading it as an adult might change my perspective, but no. It's still boring. I didn't even finish it this time. I don't care what deeper message the story contains, I'm not going to read it if I have to fight to stay awake.

I read this many years ago as a child and have returned to it and have come away profoundly affected.This time for me.....The book brought a sense of peace - an appreciation for the indomitable spirit of a man who refuses to give in to self-pity - who accepts that the simple life often delivers more richness than that cluttered with possessions and fraught relationships.The Sea plays a major part - representing life and eternity. Here we have a little old man - on a fragile boat gliding across this powerful monolith - subject to the whims of powers outside of his control.And isn't that just like our lives?But he embraces this with courage, acceptance and love. His indomitable spirit refuses to give in even when he catches an enormous fish and then loses it - he treats it all the same: gain and loss - two imposters.It's more than a story of a man catching a fish. It really is. And if you view it just like that then disappointment will follow.It is an allegory of life and we must be grateful for this insightful and magical account. The writing is sparse and simple without embelishment or exaggeration and this adds to the temperate effect."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was extremely well written.

I love novels of colors and flavors, novels with variety and awkward sentences. The Old Man and the Sea would certainly get an 800 on the SAT II, but, well, Shakespeare would've barely gotten the 200 for his name. Still not comprehending? Once upon a time, in all of our lives, we have had to take a course titled &quot;grammar.&quot; If you enjoy simple sentences that get the point across quickly and bluntly, this book will by far exceed your greatest expectations. Hemingway is for the impatient readers. However, if you, like myself, love writing that is more poetic than 8th-grade-english-class, I would highly recommend reading a brief summary of the book and getting on with life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I being a 14 year old girl found this book very boring because it is about a fisherman catching a big fish. It also had no chapters so it just kept going on and on."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book The Old Man and the Sea is a dramatic, devestating, exciting, detailed book. Hemingway's short novel is of an old man named Santiago who goes out on a small fishing boat in hopes of finding the biggest fish. His hopes get very high on his 85th day of fising. The first 40 days a little boy was with him but after 40 days his parents didn't want him away with the old man anymore. To tell you anymore about the book would ruin Hemingway's purpose for writing it. To read the book yourself order it right now. It is definately a &quot;can't put it down for anything&quot; classic. I suggest that you get this book in your hot little hands as soon as possible so you can read it as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea was a good book all in all. Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is very detailed, you would know that if you read some of his other books.The book starts off talking about the old man named Santiago, and how he hasn't cought a fish in 84-days, but one day when he goes out to fish, he ends up catching a giant marlin that starts dragging him out to sea.

Santiago loves this fish, respects its beauty, its size, its power, but still must demonstrate his own power, mainly for the sake of his pride. When he catches the fish, ties it to the skiff, and hauls it back to shore, frenzied sharks begin to feed on the now defenseless carcass. Santiago acts in the great marlin's defense, protecting its beauty, its dignity, as well as his own triumph over the mammoth beast. He needs to be the sole destroyer of this fish. Yet the marlin is still decimated by the relentless sharks, and Santiago feels he must blame himself for the fish's demise. Santiago's bitter struggle to reel in the mammoth prize is told simply and eloquently in a style that forever bears the Hemingway stamp."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a true classic. It is the story of down-on-his-look Cuban fisherman who is the fight of life against a giant marlin. What is great about this book is that it tells exactly what the old man is thinking. This makes the story all the more real as we learn that the old man is thinking about the arm-wrestling he won in Mexico or wondering if Joe Dimaggio's bone-spurs are more painful than his rope-burn. The old man makes a great hero as he does not give up under any circumstance and he treats the the marlin he is trying to catch not as just another fish but as brother."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"By far one of the most profoundly beautiful pieces of American literature ever written. Hemingway's simple language makes Santiago's fight with the marlin all the more spectacular. The scene at the end when Santiago walks home brings tears to the eyes because of its simple beauty.

In spite of these staggering odds he persists putting forth a valiant effort and succeeds only to lose. Santiago loses the battle with the sharks and his prize Marlin, but he gains victory for himself beacause he is aware that he fought well and he has the courage to try again."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After reading this book, I was left with the the feeling of knowledge and chasing you dream till you catch it. The story is about the meaning of life for a man who one day, after never catching anything for many days, catches the biggest fish in the sea. The fish, like all great fish, puts up a great fight but in the end of the second day finally kisses the blue ocean goodbye. The main point, I think, is a metaphor; we always want what we can't get and when we do get it, we never have it for long.

IMHO, TOMatS works best as fishing adventure and is slightly hokey as an existential allegory. Nonetheless, this won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1953, maybe in recognition of Hem's many outstanding stories. Still, I think he produced more impressive work inThe Sun Also Rises,A Farewell to Arms, andFor Whom the Bell Tolls.With 766 Amazon.com reviews, I'm sure there's nothing left unsaid about this pretty-good story. But... this does show Hem's debt to his boyhood hero Theodore Roosevelt, who was an outdoorsman advocating for the strenuous life when Hem was growing up in Oak Park. In fact, TOMatS is most alive when Hemingway writes concretely about male adventure, as did Ted when he was on safari in British East Africa in 1909.\\"The night was clear, the stars shone brightly, and in the west the young moon hung just above the line of tall tree-tops. Fires were speedily kindled and the men sat around them, feasting and singing in a strange minor tone until late in the night.

On the 85th day, Santiago sets out determined that this is the day he will end his unlucky streak.He has decided that in order to catch something, he must sail out farther than usual, go beyond the \\"safe zone\\" with all the other fishermen near the shore.When Santiago feels a tremendous tug at his line, he knows that this is it. This is what he has been waiting for. This is the big catch.The fish, a marlin, proves to be bigger than anything the old fisherman has ever handled. It challenges Santiago's strength, courage and endurance. For days he hangs on, his fishing line cutting deep into his hands and back. But he will not give up the fight. The marlin pulls him farther and farther from his home, from all mankind. It is just him, the marlin, and the open sea. Finally, the fish gives up and the old man wins the battle.But the war is not over yet. On the journey home the old man's boat sails into shark-infested waters. Ironically, Santiago now has to protect the marlin he just killed.This story is about a man's place not against, but within nature. Out at sea, all alone, he develops a relationship with the marlin and the sharks, and we come to understand that perhaps man is not always the superior species.

This answered my question -- my reading experience of the book had been unexpectedly dry. An old Cuban fisherman Santiago, who dreams of lions on the shores of Africa, sets out sailing for his biggest challenge/catch. While the solitary narration of Santiago vividly reconstructed the challenge, and most of all revealed his own life-like character, I could not help but expect for more from this famed novella. Yes, it made me ponder over life, but shouldn't there be more to it?In all justice, the book must have been great in earlier years. Deducing from the words of praise above, I surmise that the novella had been a victim of its own success. For how would it be possible for a reader to be impressed by its style when all contemporary works are influenced by it?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hello, my name is Billy Blanks and i am a high school senior.

Old Man and the Sea is a great book for anyone who loves a great story or in my case just loves fishing. It is the best book ever, and i think everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"... Isn't it great to be swept away into the thrill of the adventure in a story? I love that too, but that's not the experience I had when reading The Old Man and the Sea. Even this story's title lacks excitement! But the title really says it all. It's about an old man ... on the sea. I was expecting a little more from a book that won an award. It's not what I had anticipated. I was hoping to feel the sensation of the open sea snatch me away from the real world and drop me into a wet wonderland, but instead I ended up being taken to the land of slumber. The Old Man and the Sea needs more action.From reading this book, I have come to find that The Old Man and the Sea has no point. For instance, half the book's dialogue is Santiago, the main character, talking to himself or the fish. A one sided conversation is like talking to a wall or in this case, it's talking to a fish. Conversations are interesting because people get to express their opinions; it's boring to read about an old man rambling on about his problems. What makes a story exciting is the adventure the main character has. Additionally, while having those \`' fish conversations'' Santiago is just sitting in a boat. While he bobs up and down on the waves like a log on the sea, not much action is taking place. This book lacks the intensity that is essential to keep readers hooked.Because I did not see the point of this story, I was not satisfied with The Old Man and the Sea. There is no stimulation when reading this book. The thrill of a book is like frosting on a cake, it's what makes it so good! For example, when I got to the middle of the story, I almost fell asleep! Additionally, I never felt a connection with any of the characters. It's important to know the characters to understand how they feel in different situations. If the readers can't make a connection then it's like being excluded from a group.I wouldn't recommend this book to any one who likes to actually stay awake when reading. This book was very bland and boring. The reason for reading is to experience things you can't otherwise do in your own life. People know what it's like to be board. The Old Man and the Sea just isn't anything new."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Agonizing. This describes my emotions while reading Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Although it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, it reeks with dreadful writing. The protagonist is Santiago, an old, unlucky fisherman. After suffering through over 80 days without a catch, he captures the largest fish on record. It becomes a great struggle to make it home with the fish and his life. A simple story it is, but not nearly as simple as Santiago's character. Not to mention the dreadful manner in which the book was written. The Old Man and the Sea is a plain book, especially with the old man as the main character.Hemmingway didn't invent any complex characters; nor did he create an original one. Most men have several attributes and flaws that make them who they are, but this isn't evident in the Hemmingway tale. For instance, Santiago spends the majority of his time fishing and he does this near flawlessly. A character needs to be more complex. No man is perfect and no man spends all of his time doing one thing. Likewise, Ernest Hemmingway was a fisherman himself. He didn't produce his own unique character. He only borrowed some aspects of his own life and threw them upon Santiago. Therefore, Santiago is a basic version of Hemmingway. His writing demonstrates the same simplicity.The so-called style of The Old Man and the Sea is merely a poor model of exceptional literature. Through the words of Hemmingway, I am left uninspired and my imagination is not satisfied. For example, a sentence from his book reads, \\"It is strange\\" (84). Believe it or not, this is an entire sentence from the book. Reading this is like staring at a blank wall. There is no creativity present and it leaves a person feeling like the wall...empty. On top of that lackluster sentence, the book uses little figurative language. All decent works are coated with artistic similes, metaphors, hyperboles, and personifications. In Hemmingway's novel, finding such writing is like looking for Waldo in a sea of red and white stripes. All in all, nothing inventive was used when composing The Old Man and the Sea.One would expect a Pulitzer Prize winning story to be a fascinating account, bursting with creativity. However, The Old Man and the Sea is better suited as an inadequate example of literature. Considering a horrible lead character and the dull manner of the book, Hemmingway does not deserve such a great honor for such a bad book. On the next visit to the library, make sure The Old Man and the Sea is as far away as possible."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The review of The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemmingway is a great author but he is a little slow. He used his characters quite a bit, almost too much; it made the book drag on and on and on. But he also showed his emotions very well, you could tell that he had experienced fishing before. The Old Man and the Sea is a vivid yet boring book that has a good story.I didn't like this book because of how Hemmingway had Santiago talk so much, and the book had no action. For example, the entire book was Santiago talking to himself, this kept me from getting into the book. If he explained more about the conflict or added action, the book could have been a great one. I don't think Hemmingway could have written a more boring story. In addition, there was no action up until the end, before it's just Santiago speaking to himself. If Hemmingway had a good rising action in this book it could have been a more exciting book because you anticipate the ending. It also seemed like Santiago kept repeating the same exact schedule making me want to put the book down. Because the book was fairly boring not too many people would get into the book and know what they read 5 minutes ago.Hemmingway also used a lot of detail making you feel inside the book along with a lot of info. For instance, every fact Santiago states Hemmingway gave you a descriptive and good explanation to it. I think this may have helped the book out by creating a good picture in your head. Along with giving you a lot of information so you can predict what will happen next. Additionally, Hemmingway made you feel you could feel what Santiago feels. With all of the detail and descriptive wording it gave you a touch of emotion and a feeling that Santiago may be feeling. Also Ernest let you know he knew what he was talking about by giving you so much information. For these reasons I would recommend this book to adults and not children.If Hemmingway didn't use Santiago as a source of speaking so much this book could have been great. Because he did and I wouldn't recommend this book to many people except for adults. Though, I did like how he showed his emotions through his writing making the reader feel involved. All in all this entire book isn't for kids and it isn't for someone who wants action or a good story to pump them up, it's for someone who is very emotional and likes slow stories."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaAn old man goes on an exciting adventure of catching a marlin. The book, The Old Man and the Sea had a good plot but didn't have any good details to keep you interested in the story. I found myself dozing off while trying to read this book. Hemingway does do a good job at connecting the main character (Santiago) to himself.Overall the book is a good story but lacking in interesting details which would have made the book a lot better.Hemingway's writing style is good for adults and old people, but most kids would not find this book enjoyable. However, he uses simple words to make his book easy to read (about a 6th grade reading level). It also seems like hes got massive run on sentences that go on forever. His word choice is boring and puts me to sleep, for example: When Santiago attacks the sharks; he should have referred to them as something like blood-thirsty beast like mutants, instead of the plain boring \\"sharks.\\" On the on the other hand, story has a good plot and his story is sort of based upon his own life. The character Santiago is similar to Ernest Hemingway in that their both old fishermen and have similar personality traits. Santiago is faced with his biggest enemy, \\"bad luck\\" (which reflects upon his own life) and that he must over come it by catching a giant marlin in order to feel that he has succeeded in his goal. book is nothing without exciting details.The plot in the book starts out where Santiago is in a fishing slump and is desperate for a big fish. Although, he has bad luck, Santiago is determined to catch a giant marlin in the struggle between man vs. fate. Santiago is very persistent in pursuing his goal but has mental problems. Since he has no friends he talks to the sea. He faces many hardships when at sea like the ferocious sharks which almost kill him. In addition, Santiago finds and hooks a giant marlin but it is very strong andputs up a good fight. Since he has problems, Santiago talks to fish and I even think he became friends with the marlin as he was struggling to capture it. Santiago did not have to go on a possible suicidal mission to catch a dumb fish. Throughout this book, Hemingway had great ideas but no interesting details to add which made this boringAnd hard to read.If I were to rate this book out of 10 it would get a 2. It may be a good book for old people who like boring books, but I hated this book. It is trash, I don't know how this book won the Pulitzer Prize. Going on a fishing trip to catch a big fish, just doesn't catch my interest. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 30."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Old man and the sea; a Pulitzer prize winning story about an old fisherman named Santiago, a large fish named Fish, and a four-day struggle that ended badly. Sounds romantic doesn't it? Well, not to me. Maybe it's because I'm a high school junior. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. But I did not think this story good enough to be even considered for the Pulitzer let alone win the prize.Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is boring, tedious, and repetitive. And this story was no exception. From beginning to end it was one depressing trial to another. When Santiago was not in some type of pain (emotional as well as physical) such as when he got a rope burn when the fish got a sudden burst of speed. he was remembering some type of almost surreal memories that might have added to the story if they had anything to do with it. This shows that hemmingway's style of writing may have reflected his life. In an A&E; documentary about his life we were shown that he had several wives. I believe that the fish symbolized the wives that he lost by the plain fact that Santiago struggled for so long and when he caught the fish he only lost it to sharks.The four day struggle between the old man and the old fish was hard for both of them, but when the sharks came was harder on the fish. Ripping the very flesh off his cold, dead, lifeless carcass until the fish was nothing but a skeleton. I find that while I do feel sorry for Santiago who fished for eighty-four days straight without caching any fish, and then struggled for another four days with one fish only to loose it to sharks in the end, I am the most sympathetic towards the fish. The Fish was just living at the bottom of the sea when he got hooked after trying to find a bite to eat. If I were the fish I would have taken him into the Bermuda triangle or something like that, not just dragging him around until I died in vain.So, I would not read this book if I had a choice. But, since I don't, I would say that this book is perfect if I was living in the time of the story. But since I am not I feel that I should warn this reader that this book is a perfect flop."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you are an average Joe looking for a good book to read, this is not for you. I found this book to be repetitive and everything is always linked to something else. It seems to drag on with descriptions and may seem as if it could be written in a few pages. If you are the a literature junky, the type that cannot get enough symbolism and loves to sit around and analyze stories trying to find a hidden meaning this book will delight you, but if you want a book with suspense, mystery and a decent ending stay away."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" should be changed to \\"The Old Man and the Snore.\\" This book doesn't even deserve 1 star. Symbolism is flowing faster than a faucet in this book, so be prepared. Read this book when you are wide-awake, as you may fall asleep when the Old Man is talking to himself, when he is alone at sea. Again, this is another book I do not understand why is required reading in high school, as I got nothing out of it but a good nap. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea ReviewUnclear and confusing. These words describe The Old Man and the Sea. It is about an old man, Santiago, who likes to fish. He hasn't caught a fish in 84 days and is very disappointed. He goes out to sea and hooks a Marlin, but runs into trouble. This book uses unfamiliar words and it leaves you lost.The Old Man and the Sea is unclear in the writing. For example, \\"Bad luck to your mother\\" is just one of the fragments Ernest Hemingway uses. Fragments leave the reader with an incomplete thought. An author should know not to use fragments in their writing. Authors should also know not to use unfamiliar words. For instance, Hemingway uses the Spanish word \\"Galanas\\". He doesn't give a definition or any clue of what the word might mean. A well written book shouldn't use undefined or unusual words. His writing was unclear, but the whole story was puzzling.The overall book was confusing. For example, the ending leaves the reader lost. I wasn't able to tell what the protagonist was felling. It left the reader hanging there. In addition, The Old Man and the Sea has no adventure. I don't enjoy fishing or reading about it. Catching a fish doesn't catch my attention! The entire book was confusing and boring.The Old Man and the Sea was unclear and confusing. It left the reader lost or -with an incomplete thought.

So- unless you can't get yourself to sleep at night- DONT READ THIS BORING BOOK!..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book that I read was the Old Man and the Sea. This book is a novel written by Ernest Hemingway.The conflict is the old man struggling with the fish, the climax is sharks eat the fish, and it is resolved when the man gets home.The major character in this book was the old man. His name was Santiago. He was an old, weathered fisherman who was skinny and not very attractive to look at. He was always very determined and very strong. He never gave up hope and he always saw the good in things. He didn't have many friends; in fact, he only had one- the boy. Others thought that he was a stupid old man because he usually didn't catch anything and he was very poor. Over the course of the novel, he changes in the way that he realizes that people aren't always lucky, and that sometimes you just can't win.The theme of this book was that you will get defeated, but don't give up hope.I personally didn't care for this book. It was very boring and uneventful. It did, however, make me feel some emotion- I felt very sorry for the fisherman- so it did get me into the book in that way. Other than that, thought, I did not like this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book is based on one fishing trip in the middle of nowhere with an old man and a giant marlin. The only inspiring thing about this book is the old man's ability to stay strong enough to capture the marlin. Other than that, this book was so, so boring. First of all, why didn't they just summarize those three days with a couple of pages. Instead, I was forced to read an endless amount of pages that seemed to get longer about him catching and losing his prize fish/trophy. What's the point? He was already poor, and now he's lost one of the most important things to happen to him. It was a lost phenomenon. I would have cryed and jumped off the boat if I had been the odl man. That's how depressing this book is. You can't help but feel sympathetic when you read this book. This book doesn't teach any morals or writing skills; it teaches us to avoid reading anything by Hemingway. Even though Hemingway was praised for this novella, I question &quot;what is true literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"i had to read this for english class a few years back...yuck. this was probably one of the most boring, simple books i've ever read...i realize hemingway writes very simply but jeez....here's the plot...this old man goes out into the sea with a dinky little boat....he fishes...and fishes...and fishes...and fishes...then some sharks come..he fights them..they come again...and again...and eat what he has caught...and then....here's the climax...he goes home...Zzzzzzzz"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever watched anyone fish? Pretty boring, isn't it? Well, just imagine how much more boring it would be to read about somebody else fishing. That should give you a sense of how mind-numbing an experience it is to read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; I am not ignorant of its deep religious symbolism. It is certainly a profound story, but it also happens to be a very dull one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Out of the mind of an author so famed and prestigious comes the story of a fisherman who goes out to catch fish. That's all this story contains within its pages, in the literal sense. A man who hasn't caught fish in a long time goes out to catch fish and then comes home.But what's even worse than the long stretches of endless detail and description and the old man talking to himself and to his left hand and to the sea and to a fish and to the dolphin and te tuna is the overpowering sense of symbolism. We are taught that the man is a symbol for Jesus Christ and that the Sea is God and that &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is a parallel story to that of Jesus. In the end, Santiago (the main character) hauls his mast up the hill in likeness to Christ bearing the Cross. It almost seems as if Hemingway wrote this book specifically to call to mind the story of Jesus. But I don't remember the story of Jesus ever being this boring, this drawn-out, and this underhandedly self-righteous.This book is definitely not an adventure book, and that's fine, people often look for a book that is not action packed and filled with good/bad warring against each other. But this book barely even qualifies for a thought provoking novella. It is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The sea is an empty and foreboding area. When left alone in its presence, it consumes the soul and destroys the mind. In the story The Old Man and the Sea, Santiago learns of this when he boats out into its depths. This intriguing tail is an enjoyable and exciting read.I enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea. Even though the book was assigned to me as a class, I did enjoy it. This was well written and easy to understand and thus enjoyable. I like reading good books as long as the style is to my liking. Hemmingway, like many other great people in history, was slightly crazy when he wrote his master-piece which makes it all the more enjoyable. I think that Hemmingway's state shows through Santiago in a few ways, giving it more voice. Style, language, and structure add to this story significantly, making the story easy to read and understand. Overall the story was very enjoyable. Hemmingway makes his story as pleasurable as possible for the selected age group.The Old Man and the Sea, along with being enjoyable is also exciting. Because it has many turns in the story it makes the reader not get bored. When Santiago hooked the Marlin it seemed to be the climax but the book continued on and that changed. Every time Santiago's World calms down another corner is turned and a new surprise is uncovered. In fact is an exciting and intriguing story that keeps the reader on their seat. I found this book very unpredictable. Rats aren't included in the book at all, but it is still an exciting story. From the beginning, The Old Man and the Sea, twists and turns till the end of the story.All in all The Old Man and the Sea is an exciting and enjoyable novel. Hemmingway has an unbeatable style that is compared to his situation is amazing. The way Hemmingway weaves himself into his story in great. This is a great book that holds the story of Hemmingway in its pages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea was an incredibly inspirational story because Santiago gave it his all and never gave up. He set himself a goal at the very beginning, worked hard at achieving it, and over all, didn't give in to the trouble that awaited him. That is pure inspiration.The old man was an inspiration because always gave everything 100% and never gave up, even when the times got rough, he stayed strong. For example, many people thought he was very unlucky. Even though the townspeople would say things like that to bring Santiago down, sometimes it made him want to try even harder. Also when the old man was to prove them wrong they all had to show him respect. He tried to do something that not very many people thought he could do. For example, even though not too many people believed in him, Santiago's friend Manolin was there to help him through his hard times. In addition, the old man went for his dream because it was what he believed in doing. He wanted to do the right thing, and he can do anything he says as long as he believed in himself and didn't care what the others thought. The Old Man and The Sea was very inspirational because Santiago never gave up; even when people would make fun of him and tell him he couldn't do it. He always tried his hardest. That leads me to believe that the old man was an amazing role model and was extremely strong.When things got hard, Santiago didn't talk negative, he always thought positive and just thought he'd try harder next time around. For example, when he caught the fish, he held on, and just kept going on with the trip, he didn't just let the fish go. On the other hand, the old man did all that was possible to stay alive and comfortable while he was working. Santiago didn't ever have any money because he was considered \\"unlucky.\\" When he didn't ever have any money, he was alone at times, and thought that was the end, he still worked really hard to stay alive, and turned to the good things in life. For example, without his young friend Manolin there to help him by bringing food, the poor old man had a good chance of dying, but still he tried his hardest to stay alive and well. Likewise, even though Santiago has other things to work at, he always plans on paying the things that come first. In conclusion, when he was having a hard time on the land, and in the water, the old man always gave the situation his all, and always thought positive.I enjoyed this book because it showed terrific inspiration. The way Santiago set himself a goal, and was his own person. Both Manolin and Santiago showed extreme maturity in everything they achieved. They also showed themselves worthy of a good fisherman. The Old Man and The Sea was a great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book The Old Man and the Sea made me want to fall a sleep in some parts, but in other parts it was action packed and made me want to keep reading. This book was confusing in the middle, but the ending made up for it. In this book Santiago goes on a 3-4 day fishing trip, trying to change his luck. This book had me confused because the main character Santiago went on the fishing trip alone and was always talking to himself, and I didn't know he was talking to himself until half way through the book.This novel had good drama and action. The drama part was weird because fishermen were making fun of Santiago because he didn't catch a fish in eighty five days. The fishermen told him that \\"he probably wouldn't catch another fish for the rest of his life\\". The biggest part of drama was at the end of the book. I can't say the ending or it will give away a good story that everyone has to read themselves.Ernest Hemmingway is descriptive in his writing, he writes as if he were describing him self, but he's actually describing his life stories. When Hemmingway writes about action he writes in detail and it get a clear picture in your head as your reading. When he had to fight the shark he described the shark in detail. Also when he was using a boat oar as a weapon he described it the exact same way as it was in my head. In other words Hemmingway doesn't leave anything out in his writing. I would want other people to read this book because it's a really short book and it's easy to follow. This book only gets confusing for one chapter and then I caught on quick. In the ending of the book Hemmingway started to write like a tearjerker, but I can't give away a good ending.All in all I thought The Old Man and the Sea was a good book, even though it got confusing for a chapter. I request this book for younger readers because it has easy vocabulary and it will take three days to finish it if younger readers read thirty minutes a day for three days. Hemmingway didn't leave out anything in the book it seemed like. The reason why Hemmingway gave good description in this book is because it actually happened to him in real life, it's not like he made it up. I give all the credit to Hemmingway as an author; he makes me check out his other books he wrote about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaHe was an old man that fished alone in the skiff and was very unlucky with fish since he hadn't caught a fish in the past eighty four days. The fisherman, Santiago, struggled all throughout the story with his many different problems, such as his problem of not being able to catch a fish. The novel The Old Man and the Sea is about a struggle with a man verses himself.This story is very compelling and meaningful in many ways. For example, it was very compelling when Santiago would not give up on catching this huge marlin because Santiago's pride was at risk. The struggle between the two made the plot more interesting and entertaining for the reader. Most people would have given up pretty quickly when trying to catch one the biggest marlins in the Cuban Sea, but Santiago had enough pride to keep going. I have great respect for Santiago for not giving up when it looked like there was no way to succeed for him. But his persistent was one of his greatest qualities. Another example of how this story is meaningful was Santiago and the boy Manolin's friendship. If Santiago never had a friendship that strong with someone he wouldn't have had the will power to fight that marlin. Manolin is the reason why Santiago would not give up, because Manolin believed in him and Santiago didn't want to let the boy down. Santiago and Manolin's friendship is the most meaningful thing in this novel. Although the story is short and easy to read it is also very overwhelming.I would recommend this book to all readers of all ages, because everyone can enjoy this story. Above all odds The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. I think Hemingway's writing in The Old Man and the Sea was one of the best stories I've ever read in a long time. His writing carries meaningful things, such as the way he writes about how Santiago and Manolin have a friendship that no one can break and the way Santiago felt while he was battling the huge marlin. No book I've read carries so much meaning. In 1954 Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for his powerful and meaningful writing. Although Hemingway wrote many great novels, I feel that The Old Man and the Sea was the main novel that got him the Nobel Prize. The Old Man and the Sea had to be one of the best novels ever written by any author throughout history. He deserved the Nobel Prize earlier than he got it, but with out this novel the Nobel Prize would have been out of his grasps so the critics think. This novel is a very compassionate story and should be read by ever single person out there.To sum up, this story is about struggle, and is one the best pieces of work I've ever read. Any critic or reader that doesn't like this novel or says it is a bad story has no taste in novels. In my mind this story was Hemingway's best work throughout his entire career as an author."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThe Old Man and the Sea is a beautifully written story about an old Fisherman's 3 day struggle with a giant Marlin. It is a great example of Ernest Hemmingway's great passion and talent of writing. After reading this book I am glad that I read it.The Old Man and the Sea is a very good read. Ernest Hemmingway has a very unique writing style that appeals to me personally and to other fans of Hemmingway. His style makes his books interesting with descriptive and interesting words that keep your attention and make you think. He uses phrases like \\"strong full blooded fish,\\" and Santiago refers to the fish as \\"his brother.\\" His words and sentences make his characters and their conflicts seem more interesting even if the event itself is not. After reading this book you can see how much of his time and effort goes into each paragraph to make it perfect. In this book, the scenes with the sharks and the fish Hemmingway keeps your attention throughout the whole thing. His actions sequences are very eventful and exciting. Ernest Hemmingway's style is so unique that you cannot tell who would win the shark battle, and it makes the reader want to read farther. This great book for a specific audience and if a reader is in it, they will like this book.The Old Man and The Sea is suited for a specific audience. Only a specific reader would enjoy reading this book. Hemmingway inserts hidden meanings and strong morals. I would recommend this book to somebody who likes who likes a fairly easy book to read but likes to be challenged with hidden meanings. Also this book has strong morals such as \\"never give up\\" like Santiago never did, even though it didn't exactly pay off. I would also recommend this book to someone to likes a good moral or just someone who has just read other Hemmingway's and enjoyed them. I personally enjoy hidden meanings, morals, descriptive words and just plain good writing, so I suggest that this book is a good one to pick up for anyone.I strongly believe this was a good book and a great read. Ernest Hemmingway was clearly a great writer maybe that is why he won the Pulitzer Prize for this book.

Moreover, Spanish-like English is also used with or without warning: Call a fish &quot;he&quot;; the sea is &quot;she&quot; for those who love her, and &quot;he&quot; for those who see him as a rival.A dictionary might not be useful because some words are spelled as they are said colloquially, like &quot;salao&quot; for &quot;salado&quot; (unlucky).Get no frights, and be no bored.

It is a story of the nobility of life,yes again, the famous &quot;grace under pressure&quot;. Just thinking about it you can imagine being alone on a small fishing boat out there plugging away, catching the great fish, and then losing him to the carnivores beneath the surface.

Regarded, rightfully, as a classic, Hemingway's story has also been heavily criticised for its obvious parallels with biblical events and also for being overly-autobiographical. Of course, it's easy to pick apart any work of art. I cannot bring myself to criticise the book on any level as I enjoyed it so much. I realised early in the book that Hemingway had written alot of his own personality (and then-personal circumstances) into the lead character, Santiago, an old fisherman who longs to catch that one big fish before it is too late. What makes the story so wonderful is the way Hemingway involves the reader in Santiago's struggle. Rarely have I felt so excited while reading a book - the author makes the reader feel as if it is they who are in the small boat, dragged out to sea by a huge marlin, and eager to return home safe with the prize catch. I would recommend this book to children, as an easy to read adventure, and to adults as a multi-faceted, must-read classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the Seaby Ernest HemingwaySometimes people take for granted how closely we're connected to nature; In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" by ernest Hemingway, a titanic struggle reveals the humanity in nature and the nature in man. \\"The Old man and the Sea\\" is the story of an old fisherman who is down on his luck. He goes out on what is interpreted as his last quest for a fish and the end of his bad luck. Far out at sea and all alone, he lands a great fish larger than his skiff. The rest of the story is the hopeless struggle between the old man, sharks , the great fish, and the sea.Hemingway uses the motif that the old fisherman and the great fish are the same or parallel each other. Hemingway gives examples by comparing the two during the struggle back to land. Neither the old man nor the fish give up. The two characters parallel each other through the book one above in the skiff, and one below in the deep sea. By examining beginning and the ending situations of the old man and the fish, readers see the similarities in the two characters and their lives."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is just one example of what an extrodinary writer Ernest Hemingway was.

I remember at that time, not being a lit major, I pounced on an opportunity to speak with a lit professor who had his office filled with Hemingway memorabilia and had done his Phd. on Hemingway. It made me wish I had been a lit major. Symbolism is too often lost on me. I had just finished reading the Old Man and the Sea the first time, and this professor says, \\"You know it is all about Christ, He was marrying a Catholic at the time and reexamining his thoughts on Christianity.\\"Like I said, symbolism is lost on me most of the time, but when I'm looking for it, I can sometimes see it. This read through with my son was fun. I liked picking up how the boy, he wouldn't say it, but he had lost faith, much like Peter. How this fish redeems the old man with his death that takes him 3 days out to sea. Ichthus always make good Christ figures. I suppose I could read more into it than all that, and ruin the story.

This book is a short tale and an easy read. Hemingway describes the fishing master Santiago and his colossal battle with a giant marlin in vivid detail. Hemingway writes this story in such a way where you can imagine the sights of the ocean with great accuracy.Santiago is a veteran fisherman who is well past his physical prime and on a long streak of bad luck. He has a boy who is his friend, but the boy was ordered by his parents to leave the old master and get on a ship with better luck. Santiago is forced to go on a fishing trip on his own. He hooks a giant marlin and had an epic fight with the fish for close to three days.Santiago may be an old man, but he has fierce determination to haul in the catch of a lifetime. Hemingway describes the stress on every sinew during the long reeling in process. Santiago wins the victory, but is unable to fit the eighteen foot fish in his boat. The sharks come after the fish and slowly eat away at its flesh. Santiago tried with all his might to fight off the sharks. He clubbed several of them. The fight was in vain and Santiago returned with just the head and a skeleton remaining.Hemingway has great character development in the book. He presents Santiago as a simple man with a lot of pride in his profession. Santiago is from the pre-Castro island of Cuba. He loves baseball, especially Yankees great Joe DiMaggio. Hemingway gives a running commentary of Santiago's inner dialogue. This is a brialliant literary strategy and a key highlight of the book.I thought this was a terrific book. The descriptions of the setting were exquisite. The inner dialogue was compelling. The old man fought against all odds to maintain his dignity and pride. He respected his rival the fish and the battles fought between man and animal were shown to be part of the same circle of life. Santiago inspired his young friend with his valor. This shows that a man can have a great legacy, even in a failed endeavor. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in Spanish before. It is wonderful. Hemingway is my favorite writer of all times. The book is amazing, it came here fast... Better than expected..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The author makes you feel that you are there in the boat, feeling every move and emotion of the old fisherman. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway delivered his last masterpiece with this book, a cultural phenomenon when first published in the early '50s: in an unprecedented move, Life Magazine published the novella in its entirety,recognizing that Hemingway, the most influential writer of 20th century American literature and then a world-wide celebrity, had delivered a long-awaited masterful story. The Life magazine edition sold more than 5 million copies in a week so this book reached tens of millions of people within days - not many authors can achieve that! And that's before becoming a much beloved story translated into scores of languages. It is fair to say that this book, which won the Pullitzer Prize, reignited the interest and respect for Hemingway as a serious writer and might have been the decisive factor for his Nobel Prize award.It is so disappointing when people say that story is boring and has too much simbolism... if you have experience fishing or sailing or simply appreciating the sea and nature, then the book offers a marvellous account of man AND nature (not man vs. nature). As for the simbolism, don't dwell too much on it. Hemingway himself said that the book is about \\"an old man, a boy, a fish and the sea\\", but if the story is told well enough (as it is on this book) it can mean so much more.And the story is indeed so much more, in no small part because of the inherent goodness of the old man. That's how I enjoy and interpret the book: it is a straightforward tale of an old man embracing the struggles and rewards of life with courage, dignity and still full of the human spirit. Santiago is one of the most dignified characters in Literature, and I have to say he is my favorite and a bit of a personal hero... the old fisherman strives to be the best he can be and do the best he can do... he does not complain of his living in poverty, do not blame others for anything. His spirit is big, generous, undefeated. While other Hemingway heroes might have disappointed some people by way of too much machismo, Santiago keeps all the best traits of courage, resilience and non-nonsense survivalism, while displaying more maturity and humility - perhaps reflecting the middle-age wisdom of the author (then is his fifties).Hemingway story-telling skills are at his best here. I am a big fan of his style, particularly in the short-story format, but here he is astounding all the way. yeah, the prose is deceptively simple at first, but if you pay attention we can see the craft of a master. The opening sentence alone is formidable and could only be delivered by a master of the short-story format. Ihe last sentence is also wonderful and pure Hemingway- simple but infinitely deep, and in this story hopeful and bitter-sweet.In between, Hemingway writes with uncanny power,in such a way that you can fully experience what the character is going through: first you see what the old man does, from mundane tasks and spadework to the excitement of the deep-sea hunt and the exhausting struggle, and in the process you start to think the way Santiago thinks and finally you are feeling the way he feels. It is magical if you only give it a try. Granted, it is easier to immerse into this story if you are familiar with the ways of fishing and the ocean, but in any case, when Santiago is alone in the boat looking at the sea creatures or at the night-sky... I guess the recognition of the infinite solitude of human condition, mitigated by the bonding with the life and the world around us, that is truly universal.I am so glad that such a sweet, simple, timeless story became the classic that it is. You have to try this one too!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is a tremendous writer. I feel like I am with the characters when I read his novels. When the old man feels sick eating raw dolphin. When the old man cramps in his left arm. And the utter disappointment the old man feels at the end. I wish the end could have turned out differently, but it is like the old man knew, he never should have gone out as far as he did. He was a master at what he did. The old man knew exactly how much he had, and how much the fish would give. He knew how to survive on the ocean in a small boat without food for multiple days. This was a great story, and I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This short novella earned Ernest Hemingway the Pulitzer prize in 1953. Having seen the movie, starring Spencer Tracy, and thus being familiar with the story, the book lacked the suspense that would have been present had I been introduced to the story for the first time. However, the writing is sublime and the philosophy suffusing the story is transcendent. The imagery is stunning. This is Hemingway at his very best.In reading several of his renowned full length novels, I was of the opinion that they could have been condensed into tighter stories. Conversely, I've found many of his short stories too abbreviated. It is in the longer short story/novella genre that Hemingway is most effective, in my opinion.As the title suggests, this is, at its core, the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman and his battle, not just with the sea, or the monster fish he is seeking, but with the obstacles and challenges of day to day existence. The old man faces each challenge resolutely and unflinchingly. He does what he has to do, because \\"that is what a man does.\\" Hopelessness and sure defeat are not met with resignation, but instead with renewed strength and effort to the limits of his worn out body.The only other human character of consequence is a young boy, a former apprentice of the fisherman, who has been forced to leave the old man and join the boat of \\"luckier\\", more productive fisherman. He doesn't abandon the old man, however, but instead takes care of the old man.This novella is at times sad and inspirational. It can be read in 2-3 hours. I struggle with how to rate works such as this, given their brevity, but in the genre of short story/novella, this is clearly one of the best of its kind, easily deserving of five stars. If you haven't seen the movie, or heard the story, you will be blown away."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One September day an elderly man and lifelong fisherman named Santiago heads out alone before first light into the Gulf Stream in a sixteen foot skiff in hopes of breaking his streak of bad luck, \\"he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.\\" His constant companion, Manolin, a boy who had fished with him since he was only five years old, was absent, sent off with another fisherman after day forty of the fishing dry spell at the insistence of his parents, \\"The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\\" Around noon that same day, he hooks the big one (an eighteen foot long, 1,500 pound swordfish), and spends the next couple of days (three all told) trying to take and keep control of it. Unfortunately, a Mako and a pair of shovel nosed sharks have other plans for his catch.The Old Man and the Sea is a small but wonderful tale about a perseverant man and a mammoth marlin. Other good fish stories: Moby Dick by Herman Melville, The Devil's Teeth by Susan Casey, and Swimmy by Leo Lionni."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm bound to love this story. It's about big game fishing, marlin, sharks and a proud old man...and...it was written by Ernest Hemingway, a man who lived, or tried to live, by the \\"words he wrote.\\"The story is so powerful that it is a shame that it has wound up as a staple of High School and University literature classes. Books should be for those who enjoy them, not those who are required to read them. I also think it a shame that instructors who have never felt the strike of a great fish or the despair one feels when the line parts or the fish breaks the line should be the ones attempting to interpret this tale. Usually they read too much...and too little...into the story.The truth is that Hemingway was a depressive and a fatalist. He was the one who wrote, \\"All true stories end in death\\" and \\"The Old Man..\\" is death in the form of total defeat. There is no glory for the old man. He is whipped by the sea, the marlin and sharks just as the old man, Hemingway, was ultimately defeated by life. He had predicted it in most of his stories, \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber\\"; \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"; \\"The Snows of Kilamanjaro\\"; \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" and, to a very real extent, in his non-fiction stories: \\"The Green Hills of Africa\\" and \\"Death in the Afternoon.\\" I wonder what Hemingway was thinking when he loaded his shotgun...?Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is without question one of the best short stories ever written. Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman whose luck has apparently run out. For some time, he has been unable to catch anything. The story begins with him talking with a young boy about his lack of success and major league baseball. Due to Santiago's lack of success, the boy's father has forbidden him from going with Santiago. Santiago then takes his boat out alone and after some time, catches a huge marlin.The fish battles for hours, taking Santiago far away from land. His skills as a fisherman allow him to finally kill the marlin and it is the largest he has ever seen. It is too big to place in the boat, so he is forced to lash it to the side where it remains in the water. This attracts sharks and even though he battles them, killing several, they eat all the meat and he is left with the skeleton. Santiago arrives back at port and everyone marvels at the size of the skeleton and appreciates his accomplishment.What makes this story exceptional is the descriptions of Santiago's thoughts as he fishes, battles the fish after the strike and then the sharks. He knows the battle with the sharks is hopeless, yet he never gives up. The story of struggle, attempts to make a living doing what you know and succeeding through failure is a timeless one, in this case told by a master."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I've read it three times, and as I age, I find more truth, pain, and life than I had previously.

This is one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. The richness of Hemingway's writing style has no equal. This is one novella that I will read again and again.Santiago is an old fisherman in a fishing village in Cuba. Santiago has gone 85 days without catching a fish and he sets sail to the deep waters to try and land a large fish."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The title of my review could apply equally to Santiago, the hero of THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, and to Hemingway himself when he wrote it. After giving the world such brilliant works as THE SUN ALSO RISES in 1926, A FAREWELL TO ARMS in 1929 and FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, Hemingway seemed to run out of intellectual steam but, alas, not out of a desire to write, producing mediocre works that really were below him.Yet what a comeback. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, which came out in 1952, is Hemingway's best work and led directly to his receiving the Nobel Prize. The strength of the story, as is true for many great works, is its simplicity.Santiago may be past his prime, but a man, as Hemingway states in the book, can only be destroyed, not defeated. And Santiago has no intention of being defeated by the swordfish on the other end of his fishing pole, no matter how far away from his native Cuba the fight may take him.The fish, however, is not Santiago's biggest fight. That fight is with himself. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is the story of a man's fight against his own old age and the fear he might have of not having the grit still in him. He is still young enough in spirit to lock horns in the toughest battle of his fishing career, even though the eventual prize, the swordfish, is minimal, indeed skeletal by the time things are done. Of course, this makes the book open for interpretation. Despite Santiago's victory over the fish, man's prize, his life and what he stands for, is only temporary. Any victory is pyrrhic against the tides of time.Hemingway's works after THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA may have been of the same lackluster quality as those in the middle stages of his career. Few are the authors in which one must separate such good wheat from chaff. Fortunately, the test of time has made the separating easier for the rest of us and this book withstands that test."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This a great book for Advanced ESL students to read and comprehend. The book introduces students to Hemmingway ( great american writer) as well as initiate thoughtful discussions around tenacity and dreams."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Now I know why he is so admired, great writing skills all about catching one fish. Amazing"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hate even trying to use the term \\"review\\" when in regard to a literary classic. I'm not reviewing it -- not passing judgment and critique, but rather lending my own comments on what I thought of the book. So in this case,\\"commentary\\" is likely the better choice.Frankly, I love Hemingway. I love this style, his approach, and this is one of the best true \\"classics\\" that I've read. It's his phrasing and sentences that I've always liked -- the short, abrupt, near-drone is soothing, after a time. The Old Man and the Sea, like some of the other short works I've read by the author, takes a bit of time to settle into. When I'm half-expecting extravagant style and dialogue and vocabulary, the simplicity is calming. Hemingway is a literal writer, and his realism is starkly penetrating.The main character -- Santiago -- is realistic, honorable. One can't pin the title of the \\"hero\\" of the novel to him -- he's anything but that. But he is the protagonist, alongside his marlin co-protagonist and foe. Brief insights into his life prove interesting and expand the character. He's likeable, and Hemingway's clarity provides us with a good mental picture of him.All in all, there's nothing whatsoever to complain about in the novel. If you haven't read it, just go read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book takes place in Cuba between and old man and his young apprentice. The book is a very simple book to read and can be read in one quick sitting. Part of Hemingway's brilliance was his ability to make prose, both interesting and very simple to read. You get the feeling that it was written much in the same way that Mr. Hemingway would speak, without any unnecessary convoluted words that are often used to \\"refine\\" the story and give the work an intellectual aspect. After reading about Hemingway's life I got the feeling that the old man could have easily been him drunk and old, living life on his own terms, although it has been written that the story was inspired by an old Cuban fisherman that he knew. The respect the boy had for the old man in the book is indicative of another era where admiration and respect for the old was commonplace. This book won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"No one ever said, or should have said, that Hemingway was not a master writer on the theme of the basic struggle for existence with honor. The short classic Old Man and the Sea is an almost unbearably taut distillation of that tension. It is extremely hard to realize how much work is necessary in order to sustain a dramatic physical encounter between a man and a fish over 5 pages never mind 100 pages. But an aging Hemingway, pulling on some inner reserve, like the old man in his tussle with the fish pulls it off. Unfortunately the old man does not make it at least not with his fervently desired marlin. But that is beside the point of the story. Today's audience probably has a very different conception of personal honor and courage than Hemingway's. This stripped down tale of a man as he struggles with his inner demons, however, everyone can relate to. That is probably where its power comes from."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think the best comparison to Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" would be Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\". They're short, quick classics, but deserving of the name. However, be aware that the two books, aside from being of very different styles, are entirely different.While \\"TOMATS\\" was my first Hemingway, after having read a few others, I find that the style here is different. First, most of Hemingway's works (or the major ones) are about war. In a sense, \\"TOMATS\\" is about a private war - a private struggle. Hard work leads to good rewards... right?Well, not here. That's what makes this interesting. Plotwise, it's a good thing this book is short. As is, some parts are drawn out and repetitive. Even so, it's a quick read. You can finish this book in a very short amount of time and still remember the basics afterwards. Even now, anyone who read the book years ago can say: big fish, struggle, no gain. It's not complicated, but it's still Hemingway.And we've reached another roadblock. Hemingway. Some love him, some hate him with a passion. If you like his style and his writings, I doubt you'll be disappointed. And even if you are one of those people who hate him, you'll find that this is very different from his other works. It's a nice book, a good read, but it is, after all, still him, meaning that you MAY like it, even if you disliked his other works.Like all Hemingway books, \\"TOMATS\\" is complicated. It's confusing. But EVERYONE should read it. Even if it's not required reading in school, it can lead to a whole range of other classics, or just a whole range of Hemingway books, some of which are very good. So like Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", you have a thin book here that says a lot with just a few words.In other words: You may like it. You may not. But you're going to read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Greetings,The Old Man and The Sea is a book that should inspire each one of us.

While I still think that \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is his finest work in novels (at this point, any way), this book goes beyond a mere novel.On the surface, the story is rather simplistic. An old man, well past his prime, takes to the sea by himself after 84 days of unsucessful fishing. He is determined to catch a fish, something, anything. He does in fact catch a large fish. He comes home. But there is so much more to take away - a triumph of mind and spirit. To be faced with potential defeat, the idea of simply giving up and no one else being the wiser, and how to be true to oneself. How to maintain hope in the midst of despair. How to fight the good fight when the odds are against you. And how to maintain a good attitude when all you can say is, \\"I did all that I could do.\\"For a small book, it packs a lot of punch. And Hemingway, in his usual style, is somehow able to place the reader in the boat with the old man to fully experience what is happening. I doubt the same impact would have been made had I read this book at a younger age. I probably would have found fault with the old man or found the story simply boring. In that, I find it bothersome that schools select this book to introduce young readers to Hemingway (though it's probably done because it is a shorter work). I think this story would work for older readers who have had to face adversity in their lives. It does strike a chord."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Wonderful book. Hemmingways best.

At this I am a failure. I just think it is a great adventure! The story of the old Cuban alone in the ocean, battling, landing, and ultimately losing to sharks the biggest fish he has ever encountered, is magnificent. I found myself mentally in the boat with him, and endured his selfsame agony as sharks first decimated, and then destroyed, his remarkable catch.

I personally don't enjoy fishing that much so this book did not hold my interest for very long. The story was far too tragged out when the author starts talking about his battle of the fish. Again, if you are a fisherman this will hold your interest to the final page. For me, however, this book was a bit boring. The part I did like about the book was when the sharks ate the fish that Santiago had fought so hard to catch. The description about the big, white Mako eating the fish caught my interest. Hemingway describes the head and the jaws of the fish very well. If I had written the book I would have not written so much about Santiago catching the fish. Instead I would have written more about the sharks and Santiago fighting for the fish. There are some parts of the book I would have understood better had I been a fisherman myself. The book was easy to read because the beginning about Santiago not catching a fish for 60 days and the end when the shark eats the fish that Santiago caught are the reasons that make this book good. If you mix the good with the bad you get an ok story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was great. From Santiago's conversation with his hand (the hand didn't talk) from the shark attacks this book is great!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have mixed feelings about the book &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. I feel it has an interesting description of a man catching a fish, but it's hard to believe Ernest Hemmingway could write an entire book about one topic - fishing! If this book was not required for me to read for my English class, I would not have read it. To read Ernest Hemmingway's books, you have to &quot;read into&quot; everything, which was challenging at times. For people like me, who do not fish and do not love the hobby, it was hard to keep reading the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"True, Hemingway is a classic writer of the time (even though I don't agree with his ethical or otherwise standards of living), but I think that this book could have been summed up in about a total of about 10 pages. Even though it gives many lessons in symbolism, it was reallly quite boring, and I don't see why we had to read it. The book was really quite boring on the whole, even though it is a classic of the time, I don't think that I would reccomend it to anyone as a fun book to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; by Ernest Hemingway was an overall good book. I would not want to read this book in my free time, because it isn't very exciting, but considering it's a book I had to read for school, it's not too bad. The only drawback of it is that it is too lengthy. The same thing could have been written in half as many words and portrayed the same idea. Because the book drags on for a long time about the same idea, it starts to lose the readers interest. If it were shortened by about 50-70 pages, it would be a lot better book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's last (good) book is far better than &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Forget Jake Barnes, Lady Brett, and all the booze they guzzle. Leave behind Robert Cohn with his mistress who &quot;led him quite a life.&quot; Start reading about a man, a fish, and a boy, and how the man deals with the fish, the boy, and the long life he has lived. The &quot;Hemingway style&quot; of short, declarative sentences works much much better in describing Santiago's thoughts and the lovely world of the sea than it does in &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; which is essentially a failed excursion into F. Scott Fitzgerald's territory."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Never in my life has a book been able to portray such detail using a such a simplistic style of writing. Hemingway writes in such a way that you feel you are on the skiff with Santiago as he is struggle with this great fish...his brother. The 127 pages in this book and the hour that it took to read it made me ponder my own tumultuous life experiences and how they made me grow as a person. Kudos Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Top Notch! This is a story about a man, a boy, and a fish. Hemingway was at the peak of his powers when he wrote this brutally tender tale. Epic struggles are the theme here. Man against Nature, and more poignantly Man against Himself. Hemingway gracefully explores the deep emotions Santiago has towards the fish and the boy. If you fail to become misty-eyed at some point during this yarn, you are a tin-man. I like to read this on an annual basis. It is my very favorite story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is about an old man's determination to catch a fish. In the story of the old man and the sea, a man shows that he can do what he sets out to do. The story shows his strong will and struggle against the weather, fatigue, pain and other elements that he encountered while at sea.In the story, Santiago said, &quot;A man can be destroyed, not defeated.&quot; I really like this statement. I think it is true. He faught to the end. Even when the sharks attacked his fish, he didn't give up. He still tried to protect the fish. He uses every method that he can think of not to be defeated by his enemy.The old man called the sea &quot;la mar&quot; which is masculine. He liked fishing and baseball. What I like about the old man is his dream. He always dreams about a lion. It's in a beautiful gold sea in Africa. I say I like it because not very many people dream about such beautiful places.In the end, the old man did catch the fish and made it back to his village. However, his physical conditionwas nearly distroyed. With his determination, he proved to the people of the village, the boy and himself that he was able to accomplish his dream in &quot;La mar.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"No matter what happens to you right now while reading this book review, you will always have your memories. Memories of when you were younger, strived for more, were stronger and more talented. Even at a very old age, one can think back and \\"live off his past\\". The prevailing message in The Old Man and The Sea by Ernest Hemmingway that is true now and forever is that a man can keep his faith in tomorrow by remembering yesterday.The lion in Santiago's (the old man's) dream was an example of how a man has fond memories from his previous years. In my opinion, the lion was a symbol of Santiago himself as he used to be. A lion possesses the same characteristics as a good fisherman like Santiago, and more so how Santiago was when he was young. Both a lion and a good fisherman must be strong and courageous. Santiago also displays feeling of affection and connection when he says on page twenty-five,\\"He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish... He only dreamed of places now and of lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them just as he loved the boy.\\" The lions remind Santiago of his current weakness as well as his previous strength. He sees how he was compared to how he is which depresses him but it also helps him keep faith for tomorrow.The boy that was once Santiago's helper symbolizes the faith in tomorrow that Santiago has. The boy used to go out with Santiago to sea everyday and helped him until they lost all luck and didn't catch any fish for months and months. The boy was forced to leave Santiago and help another fisherman. Throughout the novel, the boy had a spark of inspiration for Santiago and always had hope. Even though Santiago and the boy's father constantly recommended the boy not to go out with Santiago, he always wanted to. Even at the end when Santiago returns from his battle for the Marlin, the boy attempts to take care of the old man, convinced that everything will be alright. Santiago's dreams about the lions and the boy that once helped Santiago are both examples of how The Old Man and The Sea demonstrates the importance of memories and the strive for happiness in tomorrow. The reader is made sure to differentiate and assimilate between the two key examples on page twenty five when it states, \\"...He loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy.\\"Overall, this very figurative and inspirational novel was a pleasure to read because of it's simplicity and relaxed tone. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes in symbolism and that things happen for a reason."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by: Ernest HemingwayErnest Hemingway's novel, The Old Man and the Sea, is the classic struggle of man against nature, where a single man has to fight against a great marlin, the sea, and the hot sun. Santiago, the main character, is an old fisherman who lives in Cuba. He has been without a catch for eighty-four days, but as William J. Handy once said, &quot;To be defeated in the business of fishing is not to be a defeated man.&quot; The old man is depicted as a pathetic figure in his external appearances, but Hemingway describes his spirit through his eyes. &quot;Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.&quot;(p.2) Hemingway obviously believes the old saying: The eyes are the windows to the soul. His characterization in this book is far better than any other novel I have ever read. I like it so much because Hemingway uses extensive descriptions that let you picture the old man and get to know him on a personal level. He lets you into the old man's mind and you get to study his thoughts. This is only one of the many qualities that make The Old Man and the Sea such an astounding novel. Hemingway perfectly ties his theme into this story through the basic plot and the mood. This story is not only about man versus nature but it is also about the love and respect man should have for nature. In this book Santiago states, &quot;Fish, I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.&quot;(p.28) This is a reoccurring theme in this phenomenal novel that Hemingway believes should be taken to the heart. The plot of this novel is perfectly executed and makes your mind wanting to know what will unravel next. In the beginning the old man sets sail with his skiff on the eighty-fifth day of catching nothing, but this time he knows this will be the day he would catch a great fish. On his way out to sea, Santiago thinks of his days of youth and his essence of being back then; and he realizes that his essence of being hasn't changed but only his outward appearance. While he continues to ponder his life, he hooks the enormous fish. Immediately the focus switches and the battle begins. Now it is a contest of endurance, will, and spirit. The old man &quot;tried not to think but only to endure.&quot;(p.23) Jackson J. Benson said that Ernest Hemingway has &quot;perhaps the best ear that has ever been brought to the creation of English prose.&quot; In The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway uses a wonderfully descriptive style that causes the reader to hang on to every word and always wanting to read more. This is very unique that he can write with such details and still keep it from getting boring or dull. One thing that makes Ernest Hemingway's writing so admired is the fact that even with all the details and imagery he puts into his writing he is still able to hold the reader's focus. Although his sentences are full of detail in this book, Hemingway still keeps them clear and simple. The simplicity of these sentences are like human thoughts in the sense that they are short but meaningful. One excerpt from The Old Man and the Sea clearly illustrates this: &quot;They are good,&quot; he said. &quot;They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish.&quot;(25) This book is simple yet thought provoking, and for these reasons it can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I loved it and I think you will feel the same way about this Nobel Prize winning novel. The Old Man and the Sea is a marvelous piece of writing by Ernest Hemingway that will remain an American Classic forever."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA successfully reinstated Earnest Hemingway into literature after about a ten year absence, and what books he did have had little critical acclaim. He returns to his classic themes, the Hemingway Code (endure against all odds, conflicts being man against himself and man against nature) brilliantly enacted by an old Cuban Fisherman named Santiago. Actually, it is closer to a novella than a novel, short though still packing a powerful message of not giving up, which is the central theme is almost anything Hemingway wrote. A similar scene, if I remember correctly, also finds its way into ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, a posthumously published work wherein a boy fights for hours bring in a shark in the Gulf Stream, where this book is set.The story to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is simple enough. A fisherman named Santiago goes out in a little boat, attempting to bring in a giant marlin. The fisherman must go out, beyond the circle that is normally accepted, and travel in grounds (in this case waters) to a new place that would challenge his skills. The same theme is touched on in the short story &quot;Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, about the leopard who was high on the mountain, out of his usual bounds. He must endure the pain, must endure everything to get that giant marlin. The book, as noted in the amazon.com review, the gun element is eliminated from this, for the fisherman Santiago has to much age to deal with that. As Hemingway deftly weaves, in his vintage style of stripped and bare stye of prose writing, a spell that will leave you entranced. Ultimately, however, the story may end in what others view as tragedy, but to me this furthers Hemingway's maturity. Earlier, his life was one of big game hunting (&quot;Short Happy Life of Frances McComber&quot;, &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot;), and Hemingway's own need to bring down game and receive glory marvelously does not find itself in here. One thing that is notable is the movie follows this book to the tea, with the changing of only ONE WORD, which in itself probably resulted from a mistake.The quote about that anyone receiving the Nobel prize didn't write anything worthwhile, in this case, was true.. It is because of this work that got him the Nobel Prize, which is given as a whole for the body of work, just not a particular book. However, because of the 10 year absence, this book brought Hemingway back to the attention of the public - also the attention of the Nobel people."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a simple tale, but not one told by anidiot. I first read it when I was 12-years-old and can't say it is anovel I want to return to, just as I don't particularly want to return to Steinbeck's The Red Pony. But I would maintain that it is a wonderful introduction to Hemingway for a young reader. I believe that papa had his best period of production in the twenties and thirties, (Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms). He also wrote his better short stories during that time (The Snows of Kilimanjaro, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber [sic?]), but one can't dismiss this work entirely. The Old Man and the Sea reminds me of a Neruda poem, simple on the surface, yet reflecting larger themes. I'm sure you were all taught about microcosm vs. macrocosm in high-school English class, right? Well this is an example of the former, similar in some respects to Camus and Sartre and other existentialists. Santiago's struggle is similar to Camus' depiction in the Myth of Sysiphus. The old fisherman's struggle with his marlin is similar to Sysiphus' eternally rolling that stone uphill in Hades. It's something he is compelled to do by his very fibre and is thus comepletely resigned to. Yet choice is also involved, and thus we have an existentialist novel, produced from the simplest of stories. Ne-c'est-pas? We tend to dismiss this tale as a simplistic allegory, but should remember that this came out at the time when Sartre and Camus were producing their most important work. I don't think Hemingway was out-of-touch with the French literary movement of which he had always tried to remain a part."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a wonderful book that tells a story of an old man and his art of fishing. The author Earnest Hemingway uses intricate symbolism and a great story line to draw readers into this story. With these techniques he protraies a livable story that applies to many abroad./One aspect of this book I enjoyed was the old man, Santiago. His character, to me, helped me to become involved in the story. Earlier in the book , the old man was struggling with a large Marlin. Even with his body beaten and broken, he continued to fight the fish. The old man's strength and persistence helped me to appreciate his art of fishing./This is definitely a good book to read, not only once but many times over. It is a story that truly was one of Hemingway's greatest novels. Within it is contained beautiful writing and a meaning close to life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I notice that a lot of the bad reviews for TOMATS come from young people, a fact which reminds me that I hated this book when I was young. Indeed this book is rather boring if you don't catch the subtleties of the story, and I don't think a lot of young people do or can catch them.I think teachers teach TOMATS in school for two reasons. One, it is short and uses simple words that all kids can read. Two, it employs the elemental conflicts of Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Himself and, to an extent, Man vs. Man (in this case, the village society), which are all pretty easy to explain. In other words, I think teachers teach this book to kids because it is easy to teach.But it is only ostensibly easy for kids to read. It is a story for adults. It is not an easy story, its plot is not overt, and it is not even really a fish story. It is a subtle story of the relationship between the old man and the boy, which relationship I think only some high school kids will be able to grasp fully. It would be most easily understood, I suspect, by adults with children.I urge younger readers who hate the book to put a reminder on their iPhones to read TOMATS again when they are 25 (the age at which I read it the second time) or even at 30 years old. At that point it will take them 2 hours to read, and they may discover a completely different book.Anyway, I think it's an excellent book, as others have expressed better than I could."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My Grandpa Ben and I used to go fishing in the lake? canal? pond? in my grandparent's old condo neighborhood. I wasn't some great fisherman (caught my finger on a hook at least once) but it's a fun experience and a great memory I have of my grandfather and I from when I was younger before he passed away.So to help with my A-Z Book Challenge, I picked up The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway. It's a short read and was written in the 1950&#8242;s, taking place in Cuba. I had no idea it was so \\"modern\\" for classic literature. I mean, Hemingway's characters were discussing the Yankees baseball team and Joe DiMaggio.Anyway, The Old Man and the Sea is a book about an older man who is having bad luck catching fish, but in general he's a great fisherman. One day after a long streak of no fish, he goes out alone, only to hook an enormous catch.But will he be able to make it back to shore with the fish? And will he make it alive?This book was good, but seems to be right in the middle for me. I thought the ending fell a little flat. And the whole time I was reading, there were these little shark-killing episodes that had me thinking. . . oh no, Allison @ The Book Wheel would not like this (since she's like a crazy anti-hurting-sharks person).My overall thoughts? If you need a short classic to read, this is a decent one. I wasn't thrilled, but mainly because the ending was a little too short for me.Tell me about your fishing experience!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Some people think of Ernest Hemingway as an outstanding writer of great imagination and creativity. But I think the exact opposite. I find his writing very dull and confusing. That's why I am simply puzzled at knowing that this book won the Pulitzer Prize.Fishing is not what most people would like to read about, even though that is the plot of the book. The main character, Santiago, is considered an unlucky fisherman. His Salaoness (is what they call it) has made him not catch a fish for 84 straight days! He does not want to live life like that so he decides to set out on a journey. A journey that he will never forget and never give up on. That's why this brings me to something that I can relate to. Persistence is the main key word here. Santiago doesn't give up when he can't catch a fish. I can relate to that on many ways because I am also a very persistent person! If I give up at something I will regret it for a very long time!Speaking of regretting, I regret reading this book! It wasn't a book that I enjoyed. Its dullness really made it hard to concentrate. It was hard to follow and confusing to read. I feel that the author should have made the plot more exciting and have some more adventure in it. That's why I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has a lower level of reading. I would say that a person from the ages of 14 or above would do well reading this. It uses larger words which would make it a little hard for younger readers to comprehend.The book The Old Man and the Sea was a very unusual book. It was many mysteries that you will have to find out when you read it. I am sure that anyone interested in this topic would enjoy it a lot! So get on your marks, get set, and read!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea Book ReviewZZZZ....That was the sound I heard when my class read the book, The Old Man and the Sea. I found it to be boring and not suspenseful. Also, I think Ernest Hemingway intended his book for older readers and I feel the ending needs something more. All in all I did not like The Old Man and the Sea.The book was not interesting and suspense is much needed. For example, \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\\" (40) This quote and many others like it made me yawn uncontrollably. Interesting books don't make readers yawn. In addition to being boring it didn't leave me wanting more. For instance, \\"It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.\\" (32) Where is the suspense? All stories need suspense to keep the reader involved. A good book is a book a reader doesn't want to put down. Therefore the book is not one I would recommend to others.The Old Man and the Sea was intended for older audiences and the ending needs to have some changes. For example, Santiago is at sea and then BAM he is home again, the end. The ending needs more content and it ought to explain what happens after Santiago returns. It leaves the reader wondering and lost. Also, the tone of this book wasn't written for junior high students to read. The book is sophisticated and most teenagers today are not into such sophisticated writing. I being a teenage reader makes me of all people understand this. In conclusion, most teenagers are not interested in this book and the ending needs to have some changes made.Even though Ernest Hemingway is one of the great American writers of all time this book is not one of his best. I found The Old Man and the Sea to be boring, without suspense, written for an older audience, and the ending needs to be different. In my opinion I didn't like The Old Man and the Sea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea Book reviewThe Old Man and the Sea, to me the mention of its name makes me want to fall asleep. In my own opinion The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway was a book that lacks suspense and voice from the author. For example \\"He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water (pg64). This piece of writhing doesn't keep my attention and I don't feel the need to keep reading to see what happens in the story.The material is to general and the author's voice barely comes through in his writing. For instance \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep\\" (pg40) sentences seem to go on forever and they still do not show a strong voice from the author. The reader can't tell who is writing because the author's style isn't shown in his work.I believe that even though Hemingway was a great author of his time this particular piece of writhing is not up to his usual high standards that the average reader comes to expect. All in all I found the book to general and I think it needs more good details and voice from the author."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Boring ... Repetitive ... Predictable ... These are just a few words that describe Ernest Hemmingway's novel, The Old Man and the Sea. With each turn of the page, the book worsens. The plot of the book is solid, yet it is lacking the details, originality, and emotion to be a great story.The Old Man and the Sea is just a dull tale of man vs. fate. For example, Santiago is very persistent in fishing, yet he does not catch a fish in 87 days. No matter how hard Santiago tries, he can't catch a fish. There is an obstacle in his way that he cannot overcome - fate. Furthermore, fate also stands in Santiago's way when he finally catches the fish of his dreams. After he catches the fish, problems arise that are out of his control. Even though Santiago might have deserved this fish, fate took it away from him. There are two major themes in this book - fate and luck, neither which are very kind to Santiago.With a predictable ending and dull dialogue, The Old Man and the Sea is painful to read. For instance, the ending of the book is not only predictable, but so are the pages that lead up to it. I found myself in agony as I turned each page for I knew it would be the same repetitive dialogue. As I neared the ending, I knew what was going to happen and didn't feel a need to finish the book. In addition to the predictable ending, this book is also painful to read because of the short, choppy sentences that dominate most of the story. With this writing style that Ernest Hemmingway models, I do not see how it is possible for anyone to like this book. I would not recommend The Old Man and the Sea to anyone. This book should not have won any awards. It's too short, too simple, and just too boring.The Old Man and the Sea is not a quality read. The only thing this book is good for is for English classes to read. I haven't read any other works of Hemmingway, and I don't plan to. I lost all interest in his writing while reading this book. The Old Man and the Sea was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found this book whilst browsing through a library looking for a suitable book to introduce me to Ernest Hemingway. I could not have chosen a better book to get me started. The book, whilst short in length, creates stunning imagery and a real sense of exitement and adventure. To follow the tale of the old fisherman and his duel with a massive marlin give the reader a real insight into the Old Man's predicament. The story's style makes the reader feel as though he too his sitting on the small boat with the Old Man. I would thoroughly recommend this book to any person wishing to expose themselves to one of the greatest American writers of all time. A tale that any man worth his salt would not want to miss."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Yes, this book has lots of symbolizm. Yes it has universal themes.

The guy sits in a boat in the middle of the ocean for a hundred pages trying to get a fish. If you love fish or just happen to love any book you read, then you'll love this book. However, I, personally, was not fanscinated. Had the book not been required for my Honors English class summer reading list, I wouldn't have finished it. I gave this books two stars because I realize it had deeper meanings and so forth, plus, thankfully, Hemingway spared us and kept the book fairly short (as opposed to some boring books that are 400 pages) but on a surface level it was an unbearably drawn out book about a fish."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a great story about an old fisherman that tries to capture a huge marlin on the coast of Havana, Cuba.

When he fails, he takes it as a loss and continues blindly through an endless cycle of pain, loss, and weakness.Read the book if you want to look deeper into the meaning of the story, but if you want to read it for the action you'll be disappointed at the slow speed the plot drags along."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemmingway's masterpiece is very well written wiht good plot.

And while it is full of symbolism that a person may not catch in the first read, it still wasn't worth it. I'm not a person that hates reading books, in fact, I enjoy it, but when I read this one, it was a struggle to continue reading. I did not find it too enjoyable, and I doubt if any people who do not enjoy reading/fishing/symbolism are going to really want to pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Okay, so I was forced, by way of caring about my grades at the point, into reading this book for freshman HS English class. Ten years and some 3,500 showers later, I still can't get the stink of this fish off me. I promise you, I still have fits when I see it on bookstore shelves. The only redeeming quality about this book is Unca Ernie's name on the cover (although, being in the middle of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; at the moment, I'm not sure that qualifies as redeeming, at that). Sure, it's different, it's simple, it's simply brimming over with symbolism. But in my opinion, this is the sort of symbolism writers use when they don't really have anything to say. Yeah, Jesus, the cross, whatever-- we know the story, thanks. You can only read so much about how the moon is the brother of the fish and the lion is the brother of the man and the lion is also the brother of the moon and therefore the man is the brother of the fish and therefore Donnie Osmond is the brother of Marie Osmond before you want to stick your head through a plate glass window and slice your jugular open on a shard. As a matter of fact, I have a suspicion that shame over writing this book is the reason Hemingway killed himself. I speak three languages, and none of them have negative words strong enough for how I feel about this book. Would I be writing a review ten years after the fact if I didn't have strong feelings? As a last note, I do not tell friends to avoid this book, I encourage them to read it (but just checking it out at the library, don't give the sods anymore money!), because the utter badness of this book truly has to be experienced to be believed."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book with great expectations. Hemingway has been billed as &quot;one of the greatest writers of the 20th century&quot;! I figured it must be good, to have so much publicity. I was wrong.The book starts out in Havana, where a poor old man lives. He fishes for a living and has not caught a fish in a while. He knows that he is near the end of his life. He knows a boy who comes over often, but can't fish with him anymore. The old man decides to embark on a fishing trip.Once this happens, the pages drag on. And on. The grammar is supposed to be &quot;cutting edge&quot; and &quot;of powerful simplicity,&quot; but it's really just incorrect. Call me a stickler, but in the end it's plain annoying.After a hundred pages of time at sea (with not one interesting page), the man returns with no fish. Oh, what great writing? No, just a boring &quot;novella.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway, in my opinion, is very over-rated. I know he's one of the greats but I'm just not fond of his style. He gets pretentiously romanticized in such films as City of Angels but I simply don't like him. I am sorry, I just don't. His writing style is harsh and obsessed with physical strengths and pretty much macho 'I must prove I'm a man Grrrrr! Fear my manliness!' content.I don't really feel the depth to his writing that others claim to feel and see. I can find it in Victor Hugo, Dickens, Wilde, and many others but not here, not with Hemingway...I am an avid reader and book collector. I love literature in general. I love books. I have always loved books but when I was tenth grade back in 1996 or so (I'm twenty eight now) my literature class was made to read The Old Man and the Sea. In my opinion this is the one book to choose if you WANT to make a book lover lose interest in books.Imagine, if you will, spending your entire teenagehood trying to tell other teeangers that books are wonderful. They take you on adventures and you meet fascinating characters who do incredible things. And then you're handed this book.An old man goes out on a boat and struggles with a really large fish for several days just to prove himself to himself. It's dull and tedious. To me it felt like self-justified egotism and an inferiority complex manifested in a story of a man proving his manliness by catching a large fish. It bored me.To me it felt as if Hemingway was insecure with his sense of being a masculine being, of being someone with purpose. He seemed that he always had to prove his own worth to himself and people had to prove their worth to him and it's reflected in his writing.I was told that Hemingway killed himself because he knew he was developing arthritis in his hands, this seems to reflect what I suspected of his personality already, a deep-seeded insecurity, self-consciousness and doubt of self-worth that he thought that he was of no worth to the world if his hands didn't function properly for his writing. He died in an era where recording your voice or dictating your story to someone else was fully possible. To me his suicide just proved the insecurity I noticed reflected in his 'Prove yoruself' droning prose that is The Old Man and the Sea. Yes, it's sad that he did that to himself but at the same time it showed the mindset that I disagree with and noticed in The Old Man and The Sea.I know there will be many who disagree with me but I do not like Hemingway's writing style. It reminds me of Jack London and I am not really a fan of Jack London either. Though I love stories about wolves, Jack London's knowledge of wolf behaviour is questionable at best. He didn't even realize wolves could bark or that they mate for life! And London's writing has that same macho 'prove your manliness' quality to it that makes the writing feel harsh and at certain points surprisingly shallow and insecure.The Old Man and the Sea personifies for me everything young readers usually resent about classic literature. It was unrelatable, anti-climatic, long winded, and all-together-lacking. I felt no sympathy for the hero. I didn't understand why he felt he had to catch the fish in order to be satisfied with who he was. And the lack of other characters, interaction, external antagonists or antagonism (aside from the fish) made it dull. I say this as someone who loves the intricacy of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and the wit of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. I do NOT like Hemingway.I think schools make a big mistake in picking this novel for literature classes for young readers. It doesn't inspire interest in reading. I may cause students to lose interest in reading instead. It's the complete opposite of what's required to inspire young minds eager for adventure, drama and fantasy.I like good characterization and social interaction in my stories. I like tangible antagonists and more than two settings, I like my stories to have a littlle... more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hate fish this book was written about fish. This was torture to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It would be easy to think that \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is boring, and you would be right. The book tries to portray some good themes, but lacks enthusiasm and a page turning plot. Most of the plot is predictable and lacking of life like characters. This book is one of the worst I have ever read.The story has some good themes, such as survival and persistence, but needs work on the plot and the tone. The plot was basic, following a strict pattern that would be expected of lesser authors. There were hardly any twists in the plot to excite the reader. This is due to the poor foreshadowing, \\"he hadn't caught a fish in 85 days...\\" the entire story was predictable. The only turn in the plot came at the end near what might have been considered the climax, when the sharks played a big role in the ending. There is a very monotone feeling about the book. None of the characters show much emotion. Even for a senile old man, he should have at least shown some emotion at being dragged out to sea. During the entire story, there was no sense of urgency. The story seemed more focused on delivering the message then telling a colorful story. In general, \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" needed more work on developing emotional characters and creating a plot that would keep the reader interested.Ernest Hemingway didn't seem to put any research into his story. Some of the actions aren't very realistic. Holding onto a 17 foot fish in a dingy is not possible. I have gone fishing for large fish before, and fighting a four foot fish for an hour can make even the strongest man give up. There is no way a decrepit old man could keep a 17 foot marlin on his line for even 15 minutes. He would be pulled into the water. The whole tone wasn't very realistic. The only time there is any enthusiasm in the story is when the sharks attack the fish. Sharks the size described would be able to put a hole in the side of the book. A person could get more action fishing on a lake. This book lacks in realism and anyone who has gone deep sea fishing can easily see that.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a quick read but not even worth the time. If you're just after themes, this book might appeal to you, but if you want anything more, look elsewhere. Anyone who has signed on for a charter boat can tell Hemingway didn't put much thought into the technicalities of the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway apes \\"Moby Dick,\\" recasting Ahab as a \\"black sheep\\" shaman who constantly yearns for his overly emotional boy slave and has self-destructive tendencies he takes out on his loved ones and those who seek to possess said loved ones. Everything is emptiness, like brainpans fried away, ornaments without luster.At least Idaho Spud keeps his aimless ramblings brief, unlike the constipated \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" in which Papa Longstocking trained a spotlight on the mundanity of social hour at the writers guild."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought this book was pointless and had no meaning to it. All its about is some guy who goes out on a boat and chases a fish around for three days. When he finally returns home he doesnt even have any of the fish left because they got eaten by sharks on the way home. I dont reccomend this book unless you have a book report and want to read a short book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Are you thinking about reading The Old Man and the Sea? Stop, right now. The Old Man and the Sea is at best very bad due to the poor plot, minor action, and boring characters.The plot was boring and actionless. For example, only two things really happen throughout this whole book. The Old Man is completely insane, all through the book he talks to his hand trying to make it uncramp and if that is not crazy I don't know what is. Now the second thing that happens is the shark attack. When it attacks it is the most exciting part in the book, but if I was to say how good the scene was I would have to say only mediocre at best. Also throughout the book it is all one setting. I don't know about you but sitting through a whole book with just the ocean for a setting is boring. To say the least he could have improved on the plot and setting a lot.As for the characters in this book, Oh, excuse me character as to that he was quite dull and not to bright either. For instance, the Old Man is always thinking about baseball and fishing and how he thinks everyone will think he is crazy nothing else. Being very one-sided like that the Old Man makes for a bad main character. The Old Man could have been made handsome, like myself, so he didn't have to be smart. He is also very simple minded he says he was put on earth to fish and nothing else. I myself would prefer a more multi faceted person. And if not that at least have more than one character. So the Old Man and the Seas lack of characters and the dullness and the simplicity of the character he does have does not help the book at all.So in conclusion, it's a very bad book and if the previous paragraphs did not prove it go ahead and read it, I don't care if you suffer. Also keep this in mind If I were to rate this on a scale of 1to 1000 One thousand being the best I would give it a one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are many books out in the world that have been awarded for excellence. The Old Man and the Sea sadly was sung to the high heavens as Hemmingway's best work ever. I don't believe I would want to read his other books if that is the case. With a writing style so boring, The Old Man and the Sea isn't deserving of the Pulitzer Prize or even positive praise.The plot of the story aggresses slowly with predictable outcomes. For instance the \\"action\\" in the book happens so rarely and slowly. The day spent on the skiff is prolonged so much that it seems like weeks. Since it takes so long for the events to take place, the reader loses interest. In addition to the slow action the event, if noticeable, are foreshadowed well before. Because the main events take so long to happen, they are hard to notice due to the reader's boredom. If the reader has managed to stay conscious, they are able to predict the outcome of each predicament, making the story even duller. The Old Man and the Sea does not deserve an award of any kind. The events are slow and the outcomes predictable. That makes for dull reading and an uninterested reader.I refuse to recommend this book unless it is changed to satisfy most readers. Because the book needs to be changed, it won't be interesting until it is. .... The whole story, especially the ending, needs to be changed to make me read this book again. However, a small group of people might enjoy this book if it were recommended to them. People with extremely creative imaginations could actually find this book amusing. The only other person to enjoy it is a critic who was blackmailed a large sum on money to put in a good word. .... The Old Man and the Sea doe not deserve the award and especially any praise. I'd rather be stuck looking at teen magazines the read that book ever again.The Old Man and the Sea, as I've been saying so much, dose not deserve any praise at all. Its lack of action and content is unbearable. I do not recommend Hemmingway's \\"best book ever\\" at all and I'm sure many people support my decision. The Old Man and the Sea can be translated into, Boring Depth of Nothingness."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found The Old Man and The Sea very boring. It lacks any real plot.

True, many people say that there is a deeper meaning to it. I, for one, happen to enjoy books with a deeper meaning, but this book does not have one. Everything is just what it appears to be.

The man character, a peasant fisherman, is written as simple, old-fashioned, and quaintly charming in an adroit manner that is neither stupid nor cliched.His battles with the sea seem very realistic. The story is basically a parable, man vs. the world. The old man is happy, he has led a good life, and he has found a struggle worth giving his life up for: perhaps the biggest fish ever caught.Unlike other ethnocentric Hemingway works, Hemingway shows a more deft sensitivity here, even deigning to give the fish a soul, if you can believe such a thing.Check this one out. It's short, and definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway invented a terse style using King James biblical cadences with an awful lot of and's and very few commas in his rhythmic sentences. Certainly no semicolons, God forbid. The shorter the word, the better. The more ordinary, the more often in common usage, the better--but sprinkled here and there we find a highbrow word thrown in as if for spice. In The Old Man and the Sea, which is a short story posing as a novel, Hemingway offers an example of the Sisyphean heroic tale.Each day for eternity Sisyphus rolls a heavy ball up a hill and at the end of each day the ball comes rolling down again. Albert Camus famously said that one imagines that Sisyphus was happy. The old man of Hemingway's story embodies the karma of the Sisyphean hero in that most days throughout his long life he has gone to the ocean to fish. And each day he comes home, and then the next day he goes out again. The forces he is up against, the sea itself, the leviathan monsters of the deep, the unpredictable weather, the seasons of dearth and plenty in unpredictable fashion--all of these things and more, including the wiles of women who are influenced by the moon, all of these things are like the ball and the force of gravity that Sisyphus labors against.And for what? And to what avail? It is the struggle itself that is the glory and the purpose and the reason for being. So saith Hemingway in the way he meticulously details the laborious struggle of man versus fish: of the old man, not as strong as he once was, not as full of the desire that once burned in his soul, not as keen in discernment or vision, yet still a man with a man's pride and a man's duty; and the primordial fish, the great marlin, powerful and beautiful, full of great dignity, smarting now, suffering now with a hook in its mouth.Who will win? Will the marlin break the line or will the crafty old man lead out just enough to keep him hooked, and then as the fish tires, slowly gain a little line, inch by inch?Some great or seemingly great event may define a man's life. Here it is the off chance of hooking an especially huge marlin, and with diminished strength, bring him in for all to see, that defines the old man's life. It is good that it comes late when for most the highlight of life was long ago. It is good that the effort nearly kills him, and it is especially good that there was much doubt about the outcome.This is the heroic or machismo view of this celebrated novel. Since this was first published in 1952 its reputation has waned, or not so much waned as become something seen from another direction. Instead of the heroic old man and the gallant marlin we see a kind of anthropomorphic delusion in which a hook of steel and a large brain torture a huge, dim-witted creature to death. Instead of an epic struggle we see one predator taking advantage of another. Instead of heroism we see a kind of tedious Darwinian incident made into something akin to a Greek myth.And so it is with Hemingway himself. Now seen as incorrigibly sexist and as more of a stylist than a writer of substance, Hemingway is no longer revered in the English departments of our great universities. Instead he is remembered for shooting defenseless animals in Africa and imagining that such activities made him a man. Instead of being one of America's greatest writers, he is now recalled as a good short story writer whose stylish mannerisms eventually grate on our sensibilities. From being a great artist he has fallen to being a minor one, from being a best selling writer, the literary lion of his time, Hemingway is now remember as the man who blew his brains out because, as he is quoted as saying (in anticipation of course), something like, \\"I could no longer make love good.\\" Too bad he lived before the age of Viagra.Note the psychologically correct use of the adjective \\"good\\" instead of the grammatically required but artificial adverb \\"well.\\" Hemingway, like Mark Twain, made a point of not being a slave to grammar.Regardless of the rise and fall of his reputation and even regardless of the lack of political correctness of his writings, it is nonetheless the case that The Old Man and the Sea is a striking piece of work, sentimental to a fault, simplistic in philosophy and even shopworn in theme, yet still it is a book that must be read if only to add to our understanding of the progression of popular American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to Mark Twain through James T. Farrell and John O'Hara to Larry McMurtry and Stephen King.The Old Man and the Sea is in a sense a story best experienced young, which is one of the reasons it is on the high school curriculum. It is striking and totally fulfilling the first time it is read. Read it a second time and the mannerisms and the mock heroics begin to be discerned. Read it a third time and it becomes tedious. If read a fourth time the temptation is toward parody and burlesque."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"While on vacation last month I let a friend borrow this book. I had brought it with me to read and had so many others to choose from I decided to let her dig in while I read elsewhere. When she handed the book back to me I asked her what she thought. Her response was the quote in my review title. She looked at me and said \\"it's just a story\\" and at first I wasn't sure if that was a good or a bad thing.Then I read the book, and I understood what she meant.\`The Old Man and the Sea' is a very direct and literal story. There are no colorful details; no deep elaborations. Instead, the book (if one can call it that) gets right to the point. While many find a more philosophical and meaningful depth to this classic tale, I found the dryness a tad overwhelming and the overall effect to be rather stagnant. Yes, \`The Old Man and the Sea' is told in such a way that it loses impact. For me, it was just a story. It was the equivalent of sitting around the campfire and listening to your grandfather tell you, in an excruciatingly bland monotone, the story of that one fish he desperately tried to bring home.The story told is that of an old Cuban fisherman who ventures off for a fishing trip, catches himself a prize marlin and then battles with it, and the elements, in an attempt to prove his worth (to himself and doubters) by bringing it home. It is a simple story that could have used some life, but it just lays there and in the end failed to move me much at all. When I explained this to another friend they simply said, \\"well, I found it very \`Hemingway'\\" and then they shrugged and said \\"so, what you just said\\". In other words; apparently this dryness was his style. I haven't read other Hemingway, so I can't comment, but I'm not entirely sure I'm going to.You win some, you lose some.This lauded classic was lost on me, but this is solely my opinion and so isn't to be taken as the majority vote, since I seem to be highly outnumbered."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Today I sat down and read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway. This was my first book by Hemingway, and I hated it. I plan on reading \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" and \\"Farewell to Arms,\\" but if this book is a sign of things to come, I cringe thinking how I may waste precious time better spent on better books. This book was so wordy for such a nothing story. I know for many I've just become a heretic but this book is dreadfully boring. I had rather high expectations about this piece, as a good friend of mine has talked it up. I was sorely disappointed.Not having read Hemingway, I had an uninformed reverence for his writings; he's been mystified to a great degree. \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is relentless in its repetition, and I never felt an affinity toward either of the two characters - the old man and the young boy (for whom the old man seems to have an inappropriate affection toward).There are several types of authors: those who are great at coming up with stories, those who are great at describing situations, and those who can do both. I will admit that Hemingway is good at describing but with this book he failed, in my opinion, to come up with a good story; it was quotidian at best. Authors like Tolkien, G. Martin, King, and Rowling are great at creating stories that captivate us but their writing styles are arguably pedestrian. Hemingway feels like a skillful musician who can play with great proficiency but listening to one of his songs is repetitious and unmemorable. I should suspend complete judgment until I've read several of this other works but as of now I would gravitate toward Gore Vidal when he said, \\"he's a show off....He's a publicist and should be selling automobiles on the corner....He's a fat little girl who should be in the typist pool. I'm changing his sex for him because I think he'd be happier. He is more like a vain little girl.\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is no doubt that Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is an incredible novella that everyone who loves great literature ought to own. My low score here has nothing to do with Hemingway - it has to do with the audio version spoken by Donald Sutherland. I've listened to literally hundreds of audiobooks (my job both forces me and allows me to do so) - so to see this gem filled me with anticipation! Hemingway's brilliant tale of an old man suffering for relevance against time and mortality read by such an actor as Sutherland ought to have been outstanding - but Sutherland's performance is so lacking in passion or even creativity that I took to the time out to write my thoughts here for any who are looking to purchase the audio version. Don't do it - it'll break your heart. Leave Sutherland on the stage and away from the studio - he has not the ability or the willingness to tell a story, especially one as this, like it should be. He drones on - monotone and listless, without differentiation between characters or even between dialogue and description. It's three hours of somnambulistic regurgitation of a classic.

How many times have you been able to escape? Well, in this hectic world The Old Man and the Sea is the perfect book just for that. It's a very slow paced book that's an easy read if you just want to relax. It gives a deeper look on life...inquisitive, open minded. This is great if you don't want just any ole' slow book, if you want one with new looks and meaning.Sometimes it's hard to get away. This book makes it easy with its reality and the sense of sympathy it creates. The main character (the old man) is a man that you can really connect with. Although there's pity you can't help but to admire him. He is also a very curious man who feels like he's on top of the world. The sad truth is the world as ripped, such an honorable man, off.The story is of a simple fisherman in the nation of Cuba. His whole life is fishing although he doesn't make much money because of his supposed bad luck. He once apprenticed a boy but the parents had him practice with fisherman of good luck. He has always had a deep relationship with the man and has never given up on him. He considers fishing more than commerce or as a sport, as do the other fisherman. He has a deeper love and understanding of the sea and its wildlife.Well, day the fisherman goes out fishing like any other day. At first there is no success but...later he hooks the biggest fish in is life, probably ever. But he only hooks not catches it, the fish pulls the boat out farther to sea and begins an interesting journey for the old man. He lets it pull him hoping to tire it out. After the fish jumps once he realizes the full size of this fish. He uses much strength and nobility for a courageous battle between the god of fish. The question is...is that enough? Can the old man take on one of the biggest monsters of the sea? Find out by reading it!All in all it's a great book. It has more layers than can be counted. It seems deeper than the sea itself.

The fish is a symbol of a sought after prize, the sea is a symbol for life itself and the frustrated old man has gone out too far (there's much, much more, but I don't want to give the story away). It actually can be interpreted many different ways, and because of this it's like piecing together a different puzzle each time you read it.I have read this interesting story many times in my life (I've just finished reading it again), and I always find new ways to interpret it, and new ways to enjoy it. It's only 120+ pages, so it's a book that can be read without a great deal of labor. Hemingway's vivid imagery of the ocean and early 1950s Cuba is fascinating, and the simple, honest, and humble lives of Santiago and his devoted young friend, Manolin, are refreshing and heartwarming. The Old Man And The Sea is a book that I have read for years, and one that I will continue to read for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Are all of Ernest Hemingway's books following For Whom the Bell Tolls that bad? No, and The Old Man and the Sea justifies that answer. This is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, who has not caught any fish for eighty-four days and is seen by the other fishermen as unlucky. Even the boy that often fishes with him, Manolin, is not allowed to do so anymore by his father's authority, but still helps him out when he is not fishing. The old man goes out onto the Gulf Stream to make some catches and eventually has an arduous struggle with a large marlin. I am not going to give off any big spoilers (for now at least) in this introduction, but I will say one thing: this is a story about how life can reek of misfortunes but in the end, make prosperity.Hemingway's novels do not just happen as any ordinary fiction based on some random idea, but rather they are inspired by his real-life experiences. What is The Old Man and the Sea based off of? It is based off two things: his time living in Cuba in 1940 and his favorite past experiences: sailing and fishing. The old man, Santiago, is believed to be based off of Cuban fisherman, Gregorio Fuentes. As another fact, The Old Man and the Sea - Santiago's story - was previously intended for a bigger project of Hemingway's: \\"The Sea Book.\\"Hemingway has a very unique way of fleshing out the book's situations with words. For most of the book, the old man is out at sea, alone with nobody to talk to, but does that mean he does not talk at all? No, it does not. Often at times, he will talk to himself, usually talking to his own appendages almost as if they had their own degree of sentience. For example, he would say to his arm, \\"How do you feel, hand?\\" (Hemingway 58) when it felt pain and then say, \\"I'll eat some more for you\\" (59) when he eats some of his recently caught fish to replenish his arms strength for bigger, upcoming catches. He also talks to the fish he has caught or is going to catch, whether they are dead or alive. He communicates with the marlin in his vicious struggle as if it were a sapient creature.*Warning! Spoilers Ahead!*Even after the monstrous fish is caught, he still communicates with it, and forms a spiritual bond with his prize. This is evident during the shark attack, which may have been another great battle for the old man, but results in the loss of most of the marlin's edible parts. He feels that he has failed to protect the fish, which was like a brother to him.*Spoilers end here*The Old Man and the Sea is a book I would recommend for anyone that usually has poor reading comprehension skills, like me for instance. In fact, I would recommend it for just about anyone. This book is fairly short but interesting enough to keep you engaged, though if you are reading this for school, you may be compelled to take day-to-day breaks with it. Also, this book is not divided into chapters; it is just one chapter the length of the whole book, so it might be a little hard to know when the best time to take a break is. If you think books of this size are just for pre-high school kids, I would say you are bit too judgmental. As they say not to judge a book by its cover, I should also say not to judge a book by its size. If you just started reading this novel, I will say it should take less than a week if you are not too break-heavy. As this is Hemingway's last major novel, Hemingway's literary career sure did end successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One line says it all: \\"It is he that has the hook in his mouth...\\"But the question remains, after all these years, \\"Who has hooked whom?\\" Does the old man have the fish or does the fish have the old man?Yes, in our grown and mature understanding, we now understand that the Old Man has hooked the fish and the great fish has hooked the Old Man. They need each other. Like much of life, most of life really, there is a \\"Yin/Yang\\" effect,two opposing forces that combine to make us who we are and what we are.No matter how many times you have read it, it is always worth reading again..and again, and again...One suggestion: To really enjoy reading it, for the first time or for the umpteenth time, read it by the ocean or on the ocean, with the sights, sounds and aromas of the the sea, all around you. Still, after all these years, a moving experience. Perhaps more moving as we age.An often overlooked, but the saddest, most touching line of the book: \\"Did they look for me...\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is a fisherman who had not caught a fish in 84 days. He lives in a small village in Cuba. He fished with a young boy named Manolin. Manolin helps take care of Santiago. He gets his coffee in the morning a and helps him on the fishing boat. Manolin's father does not allow him to go out fishing with the old man after not catching anything after 40 days .The men in the village think he is unlucky. The boy is sad and thinks Santiago will be lucky again. Most of the story takes place out at sea while Santiago is fishing.When he leaves the shore he says to himself I will catch a big fish. He hooks a large fish on this day and the struggle between him and the fish begin. He is alone and is missing his young friend. He is multi tasking alot. He needs too keep the line taught for the fish he has to catch fish for food, and he has to sleep without letting go of the line. He is tiered and his hands are cut from holding the line. During the 3 days the fish brings him out further to sea and Santiago begins to wonder about the fish and would Joe DiMaggio be proud of the struggle with the fish.He talks alot about himself to the fish . He talks alot about he wished the boy was there to help him bring it in. When sees how big the marlin is he realizes he will need all his strenght to bring it in. He will finally get the respect he deserves in the village. When he brings it back sharks start to eat part of the Marlin and Santigo has to beat the sharks and kill them before it takes all the marlin. He uses an oar with a knife attached to it to kill the second shark attacks because the spear he had broke. He feels a since of winning over the sharks deaths.When he arrives back at the village it is late and he is exhausted. With what little energy he has he leaves the skiff with the marlin still attached and he carries the mast on his shoulders. He falls many times but finally gets home and sleeps until morning. When Manolin wakes him,, the village is talking about the fish and it is the largest any one has caught. This makes him a being a hero in the village.Manolin is very proud and wants to go back out with him.This book is very interesting if you have time to read the book carefully and can read between the lines. Hemmingway has the reader really find the meanings in the book. It s not just a man who is out tring to catch a fish its aabout pride and faith and luck.A.L."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I expect many people to hate this book, as it seems to be a hopeless story about nothing in particular, and that is fine. If this book was ever included on Oprah's list, it should not have been. It is far too subtle, profound, and simple to ever be applauded by the pop-lit audience.That being said,The Old Man and the Sea is my favorite book of all time. I am a fisherman and a very frequent denizen of Hemingway's beloved Gulf of Mexico, so perhaps I am biased, but for me, it really does not get better than this."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Like many people I read this book in high school. I liked it better than many of the things I was forced to read, but now, decades later, I pick it up again...and discover that it truly is a masterpiece.The best indication of that comes from scanning the reviews below. Some people see a myriad religious symbols. Others give it an existential interpretation. Some see defeat; others see triumph. Some see an allegory of Hemingway's life. Others see no allegory at all, but rather, a simple tale of a man doing his job with honor and respect. All from a single, short book. Hemingway's genius is that he wrote a story capable of so many interpretations: a story that speaks to readers more on their own terms than his.So what do I see? Well, again, that reflects who I am. As a Christian, I see the Christian symbols. The old man, Santiago, is clearly a Christ figure. He even has disciples-or (in Hemingway's typical spare manner, *a* disciple (the boy). Even his name, which translates to English as \\"Saint James\\" reinforces this. But Hemingway leaves it to the reader to decide on whose behalf he suffers, and why. But I am also a marathoner and Ironman triathlete. So, of course, I see something in this book cast in my own mold: a man who endures-who accepts pain as the inevitable cost of pursuing his goal.The bottom line; whatever your background, I suspect that you'll find something to resonate with in this book. That's what makes it a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book from head to tail, awe-inspired. A simple story about an old Cuban fisherman who rages against the sea and the creatures that live in it. What appealled the most was his persistence, purity at heart and patience in the face of adversity. Santiago's 84th. The marlin that will prove his luck and triumph. The sharks that ravage his possession. His sorrow and tiredness of life itself. Yet persistent courage that brings him home, to his bed. A haunting last line.Hemingway's autobiography in metaphor. A kind of soliloquy that is simple yet profound."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is simply a a joy to read. The language is simple and clear, and yet it evokes extremely powerful images. I think the Old Man in the Sea is not Hemingway's best or most important book, but I do think it contains only what was good about his writing, and nothing that was bad. To me, despite its length, it is biblical in scope and vision, painful, meaningful, and very sad. The old man's return to his home after the sharks have eaten his marlin is one of the greatly tragic moments in all of literature. Be sure to read this beautiful novella over and over."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What makes a book enjoyable to read to its audience? Readers vary in taste. For instance, after reading Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, students in my class have different opinions about it. Personally I didn't find it very entertaining. I also believe that there is something in this book for all types of audiences. The Old Man and the Sea is a pleasing book but it lacks greatness.It has characters that the readers can relate to. I can relate to Santiago, the main character, because I often find myself to be unlucky at many things and if the reader tends to be lucky, then they can't really relate to this book. For example, in the book Santiago is an unlucky fisherman who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-four days. I can't relate to Santiago because I have never gone fishing and I know nothing about it. To most people a fishing adventure doesn't sound all that appealing. In addition to being an unlucky fisherman, Santiago goes on a fishing adventure. I am sure that a fisherman would enjoy reading about a fishing adventure. Loosing interest in The Old Man and the Sea isn't hard if the reader finds that they can relate to some of the characters.The Old Man and the Sea is targeted to entertain a certain audience. Most people who read this book I assume are not fishermen. I get lost and confused while reading The Old Man and the Sea. For example, most characters in the book are somehow connected to fisherman; sharks, fish, or fisherman. When I read about how Santiago is a fisherman, I suddenly didn't want to read the book. In addition to Santiago being a fisherman, he has been fishing most of his life. Now I'm surprised that Santiago is still a fisherman after all those years and becoming unlucky. Luck and fishing is what this book focuses on and if readers like that then they will surely like The Old Man and the Sea.Ernest Hemingway has a unique style of writing and it is very good. The Old Man and the Sea is one book that Ernest Hemingway wrote with his unique style. While reading this book I got lost repeatedly and had to reread a few parts. Some people enjoyed reading it. Whether readers like The Old Man and the Sea depend on their characteristics. People wont know if the like it or not until they read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Stevie LaBareMarch 11, 2002Period. 4All time classicThe Old Man and the sea is an all time classic. ThisNovel has a powerful style that appeals to many. This bookis a straightforward story about an old man and hisstruggles. I think this story moves slowly but demonstrateshow a good novel is written.Hemingway's style is easy to read and understand. Hedoesn't use words that overcomplicate the situation. Forexample he could have used long words that make the storysound more professional. Instead he used the least amountof words he could to get the point across and paint a vividpicture in the readers mind. Not only was his word choicegreat but he had a way to keep my attention throughout thewhole book. Through the whole thing I was always thinking oh my gosh what is going to happen next. Hemingway has language that is not cluttered and yet still exciting.I am not the only one who thinks The Old Man and The Sea is a good book. Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953, for his outstanding writing skills. He is also known as the voice of the \\"lost generation.\\" Ernest Hemingway has a way to catch your attention and hold it till the end. Not only does he capture your attention but he also sets this book as a role model. His struggle with the marlin shows people to \\"never give up.\\" He shows bravery in all he does. It gives people hope that they can accomplish anything.The Old Man and the Sea is a great book. It is a perfect example of literature. This all time classic will be remembered for ever, it gives an example of what a perfect novel is."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaIn the book The Old Man and the Sea had some very boring moments, but some of those moments were well made up for. It was written creatively but was very bland to myself as a reader. In The Old Man and the Sea it talks about Santiago&#65533;s struggles with his luck, and with his own will power.The creativity of the book while Santiago was on land with the boy was very dull. For example, &#65533;They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry.&#65533; Santiago and Manolin only spent time worrying about fishing and they never shared their feelings about anything else that interested them besides baseball. They showed their care for each other in all their fishing needs. For instance, &#65533;He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa&#65533;&#65533; Santiago is always fantasizing of the better times and not facing reality. When he was facing reality he didn&#65533;t know how to handle it so he talked with himself for days until he had caught a fish he had been fighting for and slowly headed towards home. Within this book there is a hidden meaning behind the actions of Santiago but the way it was expressed made the book boring.In Hemingway&#65533;s writing he uses simple words that have a lot of meaning. For example,&#65533; &#65533; behaviour&#65533;&#65533; is what Santiago teaches to Manolin. These words are used throughout the book, which make it very boring, and very confusing. If the words were more intriguing, then the reader would be more interested in the book. For instance, &#65533;congregated&#65533;. The typical reader for this book isn&#65533;t going to know what congregated means. I think that if you&#65533;re unable to understand the words in the text then you won&#65533;t be able to understand the moral of the story either. All this put together really made the book hard to comprehend.In the end of it all, with given evidence, it was proved that this book has no true connection and feeling with the reader because of lack of comprehension. This book would have been much greater if the words were more exciting and more about Santiago&#65533;s and Manolin&#65533;s life, instead of with his luck throughout more than three-fourths of the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and SymbolismErnest Hemingway wrote The Old Man and the Sea and because one of the greatest writers of his time, because of his ability to appeal to the greater minds of America. For this book he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954. Most people know how great the book is, but only because of his awards for it. The book left some readers confused, because you have to understand the knowledge of great writing to know how great the book is.Hemingway is a brilliant writer, but the writings of The Old Man and The Sea are not for everyone. First of all, the average attention span of a person is 30 seconds. Some found The Old Man and the Sea to be too slow and drawn out to read. But as with most classic books, the more you read on, the more entranced you become. Secondly, Hemingway doesn't use much, if any clutter in The Old Man and The Sea. Simplicity is the key, clutter is useless jargon and it has no purpose but to make the writer look smart. Thankfully Hemingway knew the basics of good writing and ends up making it simple enough for everyone to read. Probably the most complicated word in the book is \`phosphoresant' (47) and given the context clues even complex sounding words are understandable. In the word choice sense, the book can be for everyone, because it's easy to read, but the content of the book is not something that appeals to everyone.The book had an unusual choice of main character resolution, and way of symbolism. For example, Santiago himself says, \\"I am a strange old man...\\" (14) Santiago may seem to have more faults that qualities, but it is the endearing quality of his persistence that makes the reader so intrigued by him. Santiago is stubborn and foolish, but like everyone all he wants in life is to be happy. Also in the end, Santiago dreams of lions and places he had once been, symbolizing dreams he still has for himself. The resolution for Santiago is out of the ordinary for a book of that time, because people were still rebuilding form the depression of the 1930s. Most books of that time were to make the reader forget about their own real life troubles. An uncommon ending gives the story what it needs to symbolize life and be realistic at the same time.The greater the age among readers, the higher percentage of people you will find that enjoyed The Old Man and The Sea. This is because, with growing age, comes a growing sense of reality, and how life around us really is. The book leaves the reader wondering about what happened in the rest of Santiago's life. It leaves the reader wondering if that if Hemingway hadn't died, maybe he would have one day written a sequel. Like this book, life is better left unfinished at the end of the chapter. Hemingway didn't write a fairy tale, he wrote something that people can relate to, and that's what makes him a great writer."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is not a good book. As an interested reader, I came to this book with an open mind and high hopes. But what I got from it was a meaningless lecture on the basic plot of the story.Although Earnest Hemmingway is a brilliant man, this particular story is dull and unimaginative. While reading this book, I often found myself wandering from Hemmingway's words. His tale lacks the adventuresome qualities that usually spark my interest, and shows little enthusiasm in his writing. He relates the entire story to his own experiences, therefore the reader feels lost in his reflection of his life. In fact, Hemmingway's inspiration to this story was that he lived in Key West and was a humble fisherman, much like Santiago. Most readers can relate in no way to his idea of a good story. Especially when they don't know the terms of fishing, which Hemmingway so repetitively uses. I would have enjoyed the book more if I had shared the same interests and experiences as Earnest Hemmingway. My opinion on the book is simply based on my lack of interest, knowledge and experience with this topic.I would not recommend this book to readers my age or younger. Though the book contains a somewhat interesting plot, Hemmingway's style does not serve the topic well. His paragraphs seem to repeat themselves constantly, and the seemingly endless story unfolds slower than glue. He drains the energy from every sentence. This type of book probably appeals to older or more patient people. Hemmingway's writing is brief, factual and organized. He eliminates all clutter, including his imagination. By doing this, the reader becomes bored and uninterested. As a result, the book is not recommended by other readers, so no one reads it anymore.Though he is an honorable writer, Earnest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea is hardly an honorable accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"FishingSpending four days at sea can be very boring; reading about it can be even worse. When I read The Old Man and the Sea I wasn't just completely bored I was also very confused and the story was unclear. The book The Old Man and the Sea is about an old man Santiago who is out at sea to catch a big fish. He hasn't caught a single fish in 84 days and he thinks today is the day. The young boy Manolin is Santiago's friend who he has known since he was five. They use to fish together but Manolin's parents said he had to go to a lucky boat. As the story gets going Santiago hooks a fish and struggles to keep it. Finally the fish jumps and he kills it. The plot was all right but it just didn't keep your interest.Fishing, fishing, and more fishing, that is all The Old Man and the Sea is about. It doesn't keep your interest at all. For example, it rambles on and on about nothing when Santiago is talking. If the story didn't ramble on about a couple things the book would be more interesting and easier to read. It seems like Ernest Hemingway didn't have anything else to say when he keeps rambling on! Besides, the story is to slow to make you want to read more. The main point of writing a book is to make people want to read it. Well, this book does none of that. Not only do you not want to finish The Old Man and the Sea you want to throw it away while you're at it. When the reader is finished with this book they will ask themselves one question, why did I read this book? If the book isn't interesting there is no need to read it.The worst parts of The Old Man and the Sea are the beginning and the end. For instance, the reader doesn't get any information about Santiago except he is old, poor, and friends with a young boy Manolin. If the reader knew how he became poor or how he became friends with Manolin the story may make more sense. Not knowing about the beginning of Santiago's fishing makes you wonder how he even became a fisherman. In addition, the ending makes you wonder even more than the beginning does. The ending just stops, you have a little bit of an ending but you don't know what else happens. It just leaves you clueless, you don't know what happens. In the book The Old Man and the Sea the two most important parts are missing, the beginning and the end.The Old Man and the Sea is very confusing, unclear, and boring. It isn't interesting and the beginning and end are practically missing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who hates fishing or anyone who gets confused very easily because that is exactly what The Old Man and the Sea is about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My Old Man and the Sea ReviewI have read a lot of books over my many years on this earth, ranging from See Spot run to Hemingway's book The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway has been said to be one the greatest American writers of his time. I don't agree with this statement because I found parts of his book could have been simplified and excitement should have been added.I found the book The Old man and The Sea to be very dull. It lacked excitement and suspense that would make a teenager reader enjoy the book. The excitement level stayed low though out the whole book. It was quite light and any moment how the sun would rise (pg 32.) Many times I found myself falling asleep. This is just one boring quote out of a whole book of them.\\" The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by him until he woke (pg 123.)\\" This sentence isn't interesting. I have a hard time finding the point all in all I would say Ernest Hemingway didn't make this book very exciting.Excitement is a lot easier to get across to a reader when you simplify your sentences. Simplifying is a big part of a book, shorter in some cases is better. \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with line going straight down into the water that was a mile deep (pg40.)\\" I found this quote to be extremely too long to keep my attention. It needs to be simplified. \\"He had rigged his harpoon long before and it coil of light rope was in a found basket and the end was made fast to the bit in the bow (pg87.)\\" Looking at this sentence and seeing how the words where placed, my attention starts to dwindle. Many sentences like this one make the reader tied. I think this story could have been shortened and more attraction packed.As a result I have found Hemingway's book The Old Man and The Sea to not be a book I want to remember nor recommend to anyone to read under the age of 50. Many times in while reading this book I believe that it was a last desperate attempt to produce a final best seller. He may have sold a lot of books in the time that this book was released but I think now being the twenty-first century his book would flopped."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever caught an eighteen foot fish, that weighs over three-quarters of a ton?

Boy, was he wrong!This book is a very well written piece. There is so much mening and emotion in such a short amount of pages. There is only 127pages! This book doesnt take long to read, but when you're through, you feel a deep sense of sorrow for the old man.The Old Man and The Sea has lots of information on fishing.(obviously)And strangely enough, it also has a little bit about baseball. From the dialogue in the book, one would probably think it \\"occured\\" sometime around the beginning of the twentieth cetury, in Cuba.This novel would be best read if the audience was a young adult, that likes interesting stories about pretty much anything,and is looking for an adventure.Ernest Hemmingway,the author of this wonderful story did a very good job on this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A True Classic.

The Old Man and the Sea was actually an allegory of Hemingway's doomed attempts at wooing Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn = marlin: geddit?). He saw himself as the &quot;evolved&quot; being of man against the &quot;shark&quot; of his contemporary Arthur Miller who nipped and nipped and was the ultimate victor of her affections."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Aside from a few short stories, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is the first Hemingway book that I have read. Of course, I am familiar with his persona, and the idea of the \\"Hemingway man,\\" and was well aware as his stature as one of the greatest writers of modern times. But I had never read his books.Wow. I mean, really. Wow. With \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" it is so easy to see why Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize, and why he deserves all of his accolades. This short novel is fierce, full of vibrant energy and humanity, all the while being a slave to the realities of finite power, of the inability to struggle against something greater than yourself. Of course, this is the standard \\"man against nature\\" story, but it is told with such craft that even cliches ring true.Santiago is a fully-realized character. His strength of will is all that holds together his failing body. The great marlin that he struggles with is like a true fish, lacking personality or anthropomorphism, but just a powerful beast that does not want to die. There is no Moby Dick animosity, and the fish is under the water for the majority of the struggle. All of it, the sharks, the flying fish, the small boat and the ocean, each is what it is, lacking metaphor and saying that life itself is enough. No need to wax poetic.I never knew a story a little over 120 pages could pack such a punch."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I feel compelled to write a few words for Hemingway here after reading some of the negative reviews here. It seems that many of the people got bored of the book because there are no sucessive excitements throughout the story; and many just thought that this was merely one of the many books which has murmurred throughout on a boring theme---fishing.But I think some of the commentators here have missed some important points. Firstly, Santiago is an Old Man as well as an experienced fisherman. It will be quite absurd to expect such an old experienced fisherman to become over-excited and hyper-sensitive because of some petty wounds or expected struggles with the fish. And as we all know one of the most important quality of a fisherman is to stay calm whether one has been waiting in idle for many hours or one is trying desperately to deal with a struggling fish. I think it is just unjust to expect Santiago to behave in a way that a younger college boy would do to make fun of himself and cheer up the audience in a Hollywood comedy. Anyway, you would not really expect to read some exaggerated sensational treatment of the theme by Hemingway, hear Santiago screaming because a few bloods came out of his slightly hurt right hand, or whine helplessly because the big fish was chopped off bit by bit by the sharks, would you?Furthermore, some remarked that, despite whatever they have said negatively, they were still inspired by the theme, that if you persist on pursuing something, even if others think you are unlucky as well as incapable to achieve that, at the end of the day you will achieve that very goal. But in my opinion that is not the real inspiration of the story; the true inspiration comes from the dramatic plot towards the end that the big fish was eventually totally torn off and eaten by the sharks when Santiago finally came back to the shore. And I think this is where this story of Hemingway has distinguished itself from many of the other petty attempts by others to encapsulate the same theme. The message is that even if one has won something for a while, one may not be able to hold it for long and soon it will reduce to nothing. But one should not be discouraged by that. For the highest virtue and courage lies in doing something purely for something's sake instead of for its other rewards. Even if one fails to achieve something at the end, the very process that one has ever tried and persisted till the last minute alone is enough to justify one's effort. It is this 'attitude of a true man' that has driven us to build up what we refer to as the human civilization. And it is also this attitude that has embodied some of the most admirable elements of humanity.The crying of the boy also showed that Santiago did not achieve nothing; at least he has inspired a boy, who was obviously much more 'valuable', if one wants to speak in this way, than the big fish. So, by changing one's perspective, one can see that Santiago's 87 days attempt was not futile at all; it has brought about a heart as passionate and courageous as his in his younger friend. Material treasures will not last, and it will have to go anyway when one moves his leg into the grave; But spiritual transformation can endure, and be spread from one to another and yet another, as through Hemingway's account of it, eternally from generation to generations to come."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Hemingway wrote THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, he was no longer the writer he had been twenty years earlier. His talent was declining, he had over the past ten years written far more bad books than good ones, and was very much the worse for wear from the hard life he had lived. But somehow, he managed at this late stage in his life to produced one final masterpiece, and one of his very finest novels.The story is one of Hemingway's simplest. All of his books are simple on the surface. THE SUN ALSO RISES is very simply told, but it contains a wealth of psychological and interpersonal complexity beneath the simple narrative. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is truly simple, a story about a simple man, with simple ideas, with a simple life, with a simple, elemental encounter with the natural world: he catches a massive marlin that he battles unsuccessfully to bring to market. It is a tale of success in the midst of failure, of quiet stoicism and courage, and refusing to give in to the challenges the world throws at him. Most of all, it is a story about courage.The tale that is told is so clearly told that a very young child can understand it. It is so marvelously told that an adult can marvel over it. When my daughter was six, I read this to her, and he loved it (even developing a child's fascination with Joe DiMaggio).Although the Nobel Prize is given to a writer for his or her work as a whole, and not just one book, it may well be that without this book Hemingway would not have won the Prize. His best work had appeared in the 1920s, and much of his work of the 1930s and virtually all of his work in the 1940s had been far, far below the quality of the early short stories, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, and THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA was his great comeback, and it is quite likely that it was the book that made the difference in his being chosen as the recipient of the award."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"While many claim that Spencer Tracy's portrayal of Santiago in the film of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" was the actor's finest performance, Hemingway deemed him to be totally unsuited for the role. Be that as it may, whether on film, in print or as an audio edition, the story stands as of the author's finest.First published in a 1952 issue of Life magazine, the tale received almost immediate praise. Thus, while the author had originally intended it to be part of a larger work he then decided to publish it as a stand alone book. Some surmise that his inspiration for Santiago was Gregorio Fuentes, a Cuban fisherman hired by Hemingway to look after his boat. Others are equally adamant that Santiago represents everyman. Whatever the case, it is a rousing story undimmed by time.Santiago, as many remember, is an unlucky fisherman - he has not had a nibble in 84 days. His luck is so poor that the parents of his young apprentice, Manolin, have forbidden the boy to accompany Santiago and instructed him to fish with someone else.Telling Manolin that he will go farther out than he has before, where he will surely catch a fish, Santiago goes alone. He luck does indeed change and a fish takes his bait that he is sure is a marlin. An epic struggle begins.If you have not read this Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning story , listen to it and discover wheat happens to Santiago and the enormous creature that he comes to respect enough to call \\"brother.\\"Hearing this landmark tale by Hemingway is pleasure in itself. Enjoyment is more than doubled when the narrator is acclaimed film, stage, and television actor Donald Sutherland. His voice is low, resonant; his diction distinct. He reads with sympathy and superb timing, especially when the huge fish first tugs at Santiago's line.More than highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"call me a throwback, but this slender novel contains more wisdom than entire libraries of self-help books. hemingway tells the story of an old cuban fisherman on his most memorable trip with characteristic simplicity. the man's respect for the fish, courage and inner battle are a fitting finale to hemingway's career. there is more here about character and what life is about than a thousand self-help books.i listened to the audio version and donald sutherland's performance is the best reading i've heard."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a triumph of the bare necessities. The old man goes far out to sea in a flimsy wooden boat, fishing with only a hook, line and bait. Alone, he manages to catch a thousand-pound, eighteen-foot marlin. A life and death struggle ensues as the old man works the fish for days trying to bring it in, but his struggle has only begun as he has to battle the sharks in order to keep his prize.Like the old man in his story, Hemingway uses only the bare necessities. This is a textbook example of how to write a short story--not one wasted word. The conflict of man versus nature is a timeless one, but Hemingway's is a classic because he does so much with so little.Could a story like this one be written today? And if it were, would any publishing house print it? What--no sex, no violence, no angry young men showing how tough they are by threatening and swearing at one another, no liberal idealists purveying an underlying political message, no sorcerers, magic or monsters. Where's the entertainment in that?The beauty of The Old Man and the Sea is its pure and simple realism. No fluff, no filler material, no publisher's formula fiction, just a timeless classic told by a master of the short story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. In this book, \\"The old man and the sea\\", he writes about a lonely old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, that goes out fishing, desperate to catch a big fish. A fisherman's crusade for final glory.Santiago, the fisherman, is poor and his only friend is a young boy. The young boy used to be his fishing-buddy, but as the luck left Santiago, the boy's father asked the boy to go out fishing in someone else's boat.We enter the story as Santiago has gone 84 days fishing without catching any fish. On the 85th day, alone in the boat, he manages to hook a huge Marlin, the biggest he's ever seen. A fish that is much stronger than himself. Santiago's effort and suffering are brought to us in such a way only Hemingway could do. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever. We follow Santiago's fight with the huge Merlin, and his return to town after days of fighting, catching the fish. What happens on his way home is just heartbreaking... He succeeds, but only to lose it in the end.Hemingway writes in such a way that you feel the pain of the fisherman struggle yourself, and you can nothing do but to love the old fisherman. \\"The old man and the sea\\" is a moving story, of a man with great persistence, and with a message to never give up. Very highly recommended!(If you like this book, I suggest you read Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" too...)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am giving this book a 3 stars, but I consider this on the more \\"positive\\" side of the 3 then the negative. I believe that \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" is not one of Hemingway's best works, however there are many aspects of this novel and themes covered that make this a significant novel. I teach this novel and find many students complaining about the lack of action. This book's main point, or moral, is the theme of struggling against the obstacles in life. What many do not realize is that much of the book is symbolic, with characters (Santiago, Manolin, the fish) representing allegorical figures of society. It might help to first look online for some reviews of this novel before plunging into the book if you are unsure about giving this novel a try. As usual, Hemingway uses simple structure in his narration. However, the book's structure is like this for a reason, and there are variable changes in structure and point of view as you read. The bottom line is that a reader might want to know a little about the symbolism and themes presented before beginning reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is perhaps one of Ernest Hemingway's finest achievements. Here you will find the lean descriptive prose that made him one of the finest writer's of the twentieth century.It tells the story of a fisherman who is down on his luck, but whose spirit is strong as the tropical winds that have tanned his skin and the sun that has made weak his eyes. He is devoted to the sea and knows all of its wildness and subtle moods. He goes out alone one day without his sidekick boy companion, because the boy's family has forbidden him to help his teacher for he has bad luck.He hooks a Marlin, a huge mythical Marlin, the kind that fishermen only dream of catching. And the fish drags him out deeper and deeper into the ocean, farther than he's ever traveled. The battle is fierce and his hands are even bloodied as he ties himself to the rope and the fish in a struggle that is somehow symbolic of man's eternal quest to gain control over natural forces.I would say more, however, Hemingway has done such a fine job that I suggest you read and read this wonderful tale. The ending is of course classic Hemingway. And it was for this book that Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" was almost instantly recognized as a classic when it was published in 1952...and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature not long after its publication. Part of this was due to a near panic on the part of the Nobel Prize committee in 1953 after seeing headlines flashed around the world that Hemingway was near death from two separate plane crashes on his safari in Africa- and not wanting to fail to recognize the literary genius who had produced several memorable works. Hemingway also won the Pulitzer Prize around the same time.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" shows an older, wiser Hemingway...and it was somewhat of a surprise to many people when they read it. Readers had been used to stories of barroom brawls...fistfights along the waterfront...battling determined enemies who wanted to kill him....yet this story- a novella- tells of an old fisherman who tries for many days to catch a fish to feed himself....and he has gone weeks without catching anything to bring home....The story is apocryphal and supposedly based on a true account of a Cuban fisherman (Hemingway was living in Cuba at the time) who went out to sea and finally caught a huge fish...but by the time he made it back to shore, the fish had been ravaged by sharks and nearly destroyed...The fish of the news accounts would apparently have been one of the largest sailfish on record- if it had survived intact...Hemingway was intrigued by this account and determined to make the story his own....Hemingway allows us to see through the old man's eyes....sense his emotions...feel the pain in his hands as he tugs on the fishing line that cuts through his well-worn fingers...The old man senses a camaraderie with the huge fish he has just killed...and loves it even though he has taken its life away...Hemingway understood that fight...he had been through it many times...and survived to tell his stories...and this one allows us to sense what is within the mind of the fisherman...and in Hemingway's mind as he enters his later years....The story describes both the outer landscape of the boat on the open ocean...and the fight for the huge sailfish....but also the inner landscape within his mind...truly Hemingway's mind as he faces perhaps his last good fight....The old man knew he had one good fight left in him...so did Hemingway....they both won...as we gain insight into what it means to struggle...to fight against long odds....and succeed....only to be beaten at the last moment....\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" brings us a new awareness not only of age...and what it means to struggle...but also tells us that we are all in the same struggle...against the grim reaper who will come for all of us someday...and despite our efforts...will win the last fight...However, Hemingway knew that the only way to truly win in life was to create something of value...something that would stand the test of time...and he succeeded with this great work...-by Gene PisasaleAuthor of \\"Vineyard Days\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought the Old Man and the Sea wasn't very good. I thought the beginning was good and captured my attention, but as the book went on it got very dull. When he was following the fish the imagery was good, but it was boring. I also didn't get the comparison to God. I really don't think that it was intentional of Hemmingway to have Santiago to appear as a Christ-like figure. I think that people just read into the book to far. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I only read it because it was required for my English class."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman, has the battle of his life with a ferocious marlin in the book, The Old Man and the Sea. He is a very poor man and is very unlucky with fishing but with the help of the little boy, Manolin, he gets through the days of his life. Santiago's adventure with the giant fish begins eighty five days after his last catch. The Old Man and the Sea is an appealing and an enjoyable book because Ernest Hemingway is an excellent writer.The events and actions of this book create interest for the readers. For example, Santiago was not angry with the other fishermen when they made fun of him. He is a good man and is so wise that being made fun of does not bother him. A good protagonist is always a good character to read about. Moreover, the characters and their actions can be related to real life situations. For instance, the old man ignores all the laughing made by the younger fishermen because he cannot catch any fish. This is like a student dealing with bullies and humiliation at school. These are some points that Ernest Hemingway made to arouse interest to readers.Hemingway has a very unique writing style. For example, in the book it says, \\"Most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars.\\" He has a very soothing way of writing. This is also easy enough for kids to understand. Also, Hemingway does not use clutter in his sentences which makes him different from the rest. For instance, he writes sentences like, \\"Only I have no luck anymore;\\" which is very direct. Many writers tend to use clutter to sound professional or important. Hemingway's style and voice is calming and intense in all the right places.I think The Old Man and the Sea is a great book to read. My favorite part of the book was the climax when Santiago defeats the antagonist. If I could change something in this book, I would change some of the rising action so it is more gripping. I would recommend this book to adults and teenagers. Although a grade school student could read and understand this book, they would not value the moral of the story. Hemingway's original style and the characters in this book make it an interesting and wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Review is on the manufacturing of the book, not on the content - one of Hemingway's classics.

Ernest Hemingway.This book is a classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Well, I have never read a book by Hemingway before, although I have heard quite a lot about him, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I ended up with was a pretty obvious and boring story about, (big surprise) and old man and the sea.A fisherman named Santiago (though his name is mentioned only about 3 times) has had 84 days of bad luck. He hasn't caught anything and the boy who helps him has had to leave because he needed a more profitable job. So Santiago decides to fish out deeper than he usually does. He hooks a really big fish, which begins pulling him out to sea.It keeps pulling him for 2 days before they finally battle it out, and Santiago kills the fish. He manages to lash it to his little boat and begins rowing for shore. However, before he gets very far, sharks start coming to feed on the carcass of the fish. Santiago fights them off for a while, but eventually nothing is left of the fish but a skeleton. He makes it back to land in the middle of the night and crawls home to bed, bruised, battered and defeated. The next day the boy takes care of him and the rest of the town marvels at the gigantic skeleton. At the end, nothing really changed.So the story (and this is a 117 page book) has very little to it. I didn't like the writing at all. It was too spare, it reminded me of the fish's skeleton AFTER the sharks ate it! Instead of describing stuff, he'd just state it blankly and without any emotion or eloquence. Instead of describing how or why the boy loved the man, he just says \\" The boy loved the old man.\\" How interesting is that? This was a short and easy read, but it totally bored me. It was a struggle to finish it.I think he was trying to prove a point about how desperate and determined the old man was, and how even though he succeeded, it all came to nothing. Three days later, after his big adventure, nothing had changed at all. However, this book didn't reach me at all. Too bad, I had hoped I would enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and The Sea Book ReviewThe book, Old Man and The Sea, is about a fisherman named Santiago, Who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-five days. When he comes upon the biggest marlin he has ever faced. Who will pull who in? Hemingway's book is good, but it is repetitive with boring topics, and needs to summarize. As a result it made the book slow moving.Hemingway's way of writing slowed the book's movement down. For example, Hemmingway goes on about topics that don't entice the reader. Using topics that bore the reader doesn't move the story along, does it? Topics are important to readers and using boring and unwanted topics push readers away. In addition, the way Hemingway wrote of people talking, \\"the old man said\\", is to repetitive and thus slowing the story down. \\"The old man said\\" is ok if the writer uses other more descriptive words for the character's dialogue. Repetitiveness and boring topics are only half of what makes the story slow moving.Hemingway spends too much time on topics that don't concern the story. For example, Hemingway spends takes forty-five pages on Santiago catching the same fish. There is no need to use forty-five pages to catch one fish. Who needs to know all the little details of what goes on in Santiago's head? In addition, he also took eight pages for Santiago to climb up to his shack, fall asleep, and then Mandolin to get him coffee. I could write that in at the most four pages, and deliver the same information. Eight pages are too much for what had happened. Summarizing is something Hemingway needs to learn.Hemingway's book is good, don't get me wrong, but it is too slow. He takes too long to write something so simple. From what I read of Santiago, he needs to see a shrink (Santiago). Hemingway is a good writer, but still needs some work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Molly JonesEnglish, DelgadoMarch 11,2002The Old Man and the SeaThe Old man and the Sea was a very adventurous and exciting novel. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and also the Noble Prize in literature in 1954. I'd say that this is Ernest Hemingway's greatest novel yet. There are also many amazing features that await hungry readers. Hemingway's style for The Old Man and the Sea has very desirable qualities.His writing style and choice of words are remarkably incredible. For example, \\"He had come from the deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea\\" (100). I have never read something so edging in my life. His choice of words and sentence style is so amazingly unspeakable. For instance, \\"The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorous floating off and drifted slowly astern\\" (79).This describes exactly what is happening and he uses specific words to explain it more. Some authors say the same words redundantly which leaves the reader bored and miserable, but not Hemingway. Hemingway's style in unforgettable and exciting with loads of detail and well fitted word choices.With some of the characters they are either alike or different (which makes it rather intriguing). For example, \\"The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck\\" (9). His description for the characters is breathless. He makes sure that everyone knows exactly what they look like and how they act. For instance, \\"It racked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and purple stripes that banded him\\" (90). This describes what he saw as the fish swam below the surface of the water. It gives an incredible amount of detail with his own touches of vision. No one has ever described characters like Ernest Hemingway, it's like he knows everything about them, like he already knew them in life.Ernest Hemingway is very talented in writing action packed novels. His word choices are extremely well thought out which makes it very interesting. I know that I have enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea and hope to read more of his novels before my life reaches an end."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hated the book &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; It was about the way old fishermen used to fish marlin and it tells of an old fisherman that hooks a huge one and is pulled out to sea by it after it gives up he brings it in with sharks eating it as he goes.

The thought, the very thought of someone desiring to catch and eat the flesh of a fish - disgusting! How fish smell! How they remind one of the dried up, dirty, infected, genetalia of a sixty-three year old woman who still likes to partake in the carnal act but refuses to wash afterwards and lets the old, dried up, caked on semen dry until it smells as rancid as the fish the old man himself desires to catch.A heck of a fish tale I must say.

What takes place is a magnificent story of obsession, pursuit, success and heart break. I think this book is a metaphor for man's obsession with reaching a goal. It also shows how illusory and transient such goals can be, but how we strive for them nevertheless...as Hemingway was an avid fisherman, it's also a terrific description of what it's like to try to catch the big one.

An unabashed allegory of a tale. Santiago, the old man, a fisherman, has gone weeks without landing a fish. Which would not be so bad, we feel, except that it means the young boy he has been fishing with has been prohibited from going out with him any longer. He must be too old, or too unlucky, or something, to go so long without a fish. In any case, the boy's father forbids him to go fishing with Santiago again -- which is a terrible blow, as the old man is tired and lonely and loves the boy like a son. He understands (and would probably have done the same if he was the boy's father), but still, it's a great blow to him, and to the boy as well, who loves Santiago perhaps better than his own father. After all, it was Santiago who taught him to fish in the first place.In any case, Santiago goes out alone into the wide sea once again, neither fully hoping nor totally emptied of hope, but just waiting to see what the ocean will give him this time, or what it will withhold. He wonders if he could still handle a big fish if he got one; and he thinks he probably could, because he knows all the tricks.He gets a bite, finally a bite, but is curious about the behavior of the fish. It's a big one, he knows, but how it fights him! As if it is not merely big, but intelligent as well. It holds the line, then begins to drag the old man well out to sea. An epic game of patience ensues, pitting the old man's strength (how much does he possess at this late stage?) against the fish's, which turns out to be a Marlin, fully 18 feet long.The battle lasts all day, a night, another day, another night, and part of another day. Eventually, Santiago manages to kill the great beast, but on his lengthy journey back to land, the sharks that inhabit that part of the sea eat most of it. Of course, the old man fights them off as best he can, but it's a pointless exercise: there's too many, and it's too long a journey back to the mainland.By the time he reaches his beach, it's dark again and the Marlin has been reduced to a fleshless carcass, rendering all the old man's work pointless, right?Or was it? The boy has been waiting for him, for one, very worried. And he is awestruck when he sees the size of the catch (even though no money can come of it now). And even the other fishermen, who long ago had written off the old man as definitely finished, must revise their estimates of his abilities when they see it. No one has ever gone out in such a small craft and returned with such a large catch, or they can't remember if it did happen before. And it took days, an enterprise most of them cannot even conceive of. And the old man held out to the last.The symbolism of the story (concerning man's obsession with getting and gaining and ryet eturning home with essentially nothing) hardly need be gone over again. It's quite simply one of life's most painful lessons. We go out to gather all our lives, only to have it taken away from us piecemeal before we can benefit from it.All of which has been written about before, so no real surprise. I will only mention the special touches instead that make this one of my favorite books by Hemingway. The tenderness of the protagonist, his gentle love of the boy, for example. Or how he doesn't dream of anything anymore but the lions he saw playing like kittens years before. How he respects the fish even as he kills it, but kills it nonetheless, and then is sorry to have done it, and even sorrier when the sharks eat it -- but not for himself, but only because such a great fish died for no end after all. He's a kind, selfless soul, not like the typical hard-hearted Hemingway character. One of his fondest fantasies is to go fishing with Joe Dimaggio, that's the kind of hero he is. That's allSo, great tale, only too short, too short."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"You don't have to love fishing to enjoy this read.

Hear it symphonically accompany the climb of a man toward a stunning achievement, then falter for an instant, rise again for a moment, but then collapse, never again to recover the great heights once so briefly achieved.But it continues in muted form, heroically playing to completion, and then dies, the man's greatness and courage unacknowledged, except by being inscribed in the adaggio.Santiago, the old man who makes his living from the sea, leads a life that parallels the adaggio. He takes to the sea on an uneventful day in pursuit of a peasant's meager living. Unexpectedly he does battle with a huge marlin, perhaps the biggest ever. The struggle lasts for days, painfully exhausting nearly all his resources, but he triumphs. Or so it seems. But his fisherman's glory, even his material sustenance, is stolen by sharks, feeding off his work, destroying his victory, leaving him with little but a skeleton of his success.Tourists wonder at the stripped carcass, never guessing the heroic struggle that brought it to shore, or the noble effort that rendered the marlin tractable, only to have it stolen.The old man worries about the great Dimaggio. Is he still hobbled and unable to play because of bone spurs in his heel? The old man accepts his own misfortune and painfully exhausting stuggle as just the sort of near miss that comes with the life of a peasant fisherman. The great Dimaggio sits on the bench, nursing his bone spurs, making a fortune for dramatized idleness.Today, the great Dimaggio, who never endured the struggles and disappointments that the old man accepted as routine, is remembered best for his brief, failed marriage to a movie star past her prime, his sartorial elegance, and his rich man's dignity. The old man is not remembered at all. There is no hall of fame for peasants.There is, however, Samuel Barber's adaggio. The old man's nobility and everyday heroism is inscribed in its rise, fall, and denoument."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is one of my favorite \\"time past\\" authors. His great insight and the delivery of it in simple sentences is unmatched by any other author. \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of Hemingway's better known works, though it was written in a form of a novella. It is that much more important that this book won a Pulitzer Prize and helped Hemingway win the Nobel Prize in literature.Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman who is down on his luck. Eighty four days without a catch, with a previous personal record of eighty seven. Santiago is not giving up though, even when the boy who helps him fish tells him that his parents will no longer allow him to fish with Santiago. The old man takes it in stride and on the eighty fifth day takes to the sea, alone.Soon Santiago gets a bite, and a bite so strong that the fish can only be a large one. Catching a glimpse of it, the old man sees that the fish is indeed a magnificent marlin of the size that the old fisherman had never seen before. Immediately approximating the marlin's weight, Santiago realizes how much he can earn from the sale of the fish. But the marlin is strong and refuses to give in easily, taking Santiago farther and farther away into the sea, until there is no land.Santiago and the marlin are caught in a battle of persistence, a battle that drives Santiago almost to the point of breaking. Having gone so far, the old fisherman can not give up, as he gains respect for the strong and brave fish. The battle must end soon, as both the man and the fish are running out of food and out of strength, and Santiago is relieved when he sees the marlin behave in a capitulating manner, circling around Santiago's skiff.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is truly a classic, a book that is written in a very simple language. Very simple characters and a simple plot reveal a complicated life dilemma of survival, courage, respect and pride. Santiago, originally driven by the need to survive, becomes driven by pride, causing careless behavior that creates the need for survival yet again. And Santiago's win turns into a loss, making one wonder if the price of pride is really worth the end result.Hemingway is typically calm in this novella as he reveals Santiago's thought processes and the events that directly influence these processes, while at the same time revealing a different side of the fisherman, his past and all that led him to the marlin and the fight with things that are larger than himself. Santiago puts up with all the blows and pains, accepting them as they come along as a part of life, not realizing that he himself largely caused those pains. This is indeed the case with most of us, and Hemingway only pointed this fact out in his usual leisurely manner.All in all, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a refreshing classic, maybe a bit short and sometimes too simple or haphazard, especially in Santiago's repetitive thought processes and dreams. Nonetheless, this is a novel that makes the reader think about the message that Hemingway invariably leaves in all his works.

Here, we see a novel of scarcely more than 100 pages tell a truly touching tale with absolute clarity.\\"The Old Man and and the Sea\\" was first published in 1952 and was the key to Ernest Hemingway being awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for literature. It is the simple tale of a very old Cuban fisherman who has not had a large catch in 84 days. He is deemed as being beyond the task by the people of his village. No one seems to have any faith in him except the boy, Manolin. The boy never loses his faith. He adores the old man and is bursting with emotion when the old man returns from the sea with the remains of a huge marlin. He is both proud of the old man while also being desperately sorry that the fish had been eaten by sharks. Indeed, it is the attack on the fish by the sharks where one feels so sad for the old man. He has been at sea for days and single handedly brings the fish to his boat only to see his prize snatched from him by remorseless sharks.Many authors should take lessons from Hemingway in general and this book in particular. Simplicity of tale and frugality of structure are the keys to the book. Sentences are simple and words direct without being needlessly flowering. This is truly the work of a genius. Indeed, Hemingway wrote many books in his time but none match this peerless effort."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read The Old Man and the Sea when I was in high school in the mid 1970s, and at the time it made a considerable impression on me. I was a typical teenager, easily bored and more interested in sports than reading, but the book nevertheless managed to penetrate my youthful indifference. Perhaps it was Hemingway's direct prose style, perhaps the story itself. I don't know, but I enjoyed it enough to devour it in one sitting and feel hungry for more when I'd finished. That was unusual.Since then I've read it several times, and on every reading I get something new from it. Its few pages contain so much wisdom, there is always something that I can relate to my own situation at the time of reading. How many books can claim to do that?I've read other Hemingway works since, and have enjoyed them all, but there is something magical about The Old Man and the Sea. It has the glow of myth that elevates some tales above the rest.Hemingway's style is both simple and complex. His sentences are sometimes short, almost abbreviated, and at other times long and convoluted. But they always work. Try reading him aloud, and see just how skilfully his prose is constructed.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of the best books ever written, both in the human depth and in style, and many writers today still could learn from it.I bought the copy for my grandson."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"(My review contains a major spoiler)When Santiago, the old fisherman, finally decides to try his luck far away from the shore, he probably did'nt realise he would meet his destiny both as a fisherman and a human being. As a human being because after all his troubles he comes home empty handed, a fate most of us humans will find at the end of our life, we will ask if this is all we have done.But it seems to me that the story has a second meaning. When a huge sword-fish takes the bait an epic battle starts between the two. The fish swims away, forcing the old man to taut the cord for almost two days. During this moments one could ask who's the hunter and who's the hunted.In my point of view it's this duality that makes the story a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Immediately, you are swept away by the story's innate tension that rages in Santiago's blood, you are in the sand, sweating, tired, exhausted, depleted. You long to extend your hand, you yearn to set him free, but he could only know true freedom in his death. He is a spent man, having giving his years to the sea, and having let a young boy adore him, look up to him as his hero. That's who Santiago was, not the miserable old man scolded by a loving but relentless relative who means well.Anthony Quinn's rendition of Santiago, (the old man) was a rare treat in the 1990 movie, ringing true to Hemingway's legendary style. Even Joe DiMaggio makes an appearance in the lazy hours of fishermen.Ernest Hemingway is one of our great American legends. The Old Man and the Sea is far more than a simplistic view of an old man who fishes in the sea--it is a parable; it is man's struggle against himself; it is the plight of humanity in which a man finds himself; it is the underpinning of a wretched, old soul who thinks he was defeated back on the beach; it is an allegory of a boy who looks out to the ocean and an old man for his salvation. What a magnificent American tale!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman. In the book He has the battle of his life with a ferocious marlin. He is a very poor man and he has not had much luck with fishing in the past 84 days but with the help of a little boy named Manolin, he gets through the tough days of his life. His adventure with the giant fish begins eighty-five days after his last catch. The Old Man and the Sea is an appealing and an enjoyable book because Ernest Hemingway is an excellent writer.The events and actions of this novel catch the attention of the reader as soon as they start the book. For example, Santiago was not angry with the other fishermen when they made fun of him. He is a good man and is so wise that being made fun of does not bother him. He is a good protagonist and a good character to read about. It helps to teach us to not let the little things bother us as much. The characters and their actions when dealing with controversy can be related to real life situations. For instance, the old man ignores all the laughing of the younger fishermen because he cannot catch any fish. This is like a student dealing with bullies and humiliation at school. These are some points that Ernest Hemingway made to interest to readers.I think The Old Man and the Sea is a great book to read. My favorite part of the book was the climax when Santiago defeats the fish or the antagonist. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes a good book. Because it is an easy read and has valuable life lessons that people can apply to every day life. Hemingway's original style and the characters in this book make it a very good book to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; nearly three years ago as part of a Meaning of Religion course, and for good reason. The depth of the writing and meaning in this book, in the midst of a simple writing style truly makes this book a masterpiece. Although I'm not willing to say it's a book that will make you believe in God, it's certainly a book that will make you think about the possibility. It's a truly beautiful and wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"From the start to the end I really enjoyed this book. This is because of Hemmingway's writing style. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the way he wrote this book. It doesn't really have any challenging words or phrases that make the book tough to read. Im am usually turned away from those type of books. But this book is different. It really makes you feel like you are with the Old Man through his adventures with the Marlin dragging him. There is a lot of emotion running throughout this book. The brotherly love the Old Man and the boy share with each other and the pride and determination the Old Man has throughout his journey in the sea. It really sent the message to me to never give up in anything I do. That is why I am giving this book a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"awesome, I usually hate Hemingway. I read this back in high school. It took on a new meaning for me now visiting and fishing Cuba and Key west. It's more like a short story that a book so for the right price pick it up and read it. You won't be able to put it down"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think that Old Man and the Sea had a decent idea and made it into an interesting story. The way that he would say crazy things made me think, what in the world, but then it followed the crazy thoughts up with him knowing that he said or thought something crazy. His imagination ran wild though. He would talk to the fish and the sea. That allowed me to stay with him by allowing my imagination to picture where he was and the scene. The author did a good job keeping me interested. I like the book, and it's the first novel I've read this year that kept me interested."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Santiago battles with the huge marlin he is fighting for his very existence and at the same time trying to give meaning and value to his life. Santiago represents all of us and he ultimately will win because he is willing to give the maximum effort.It is not possible to ask more of Santiago. Although he may become temporarily discouraged, Santiago is quick to revive and rejoin the struggle.I recommend this book because it is both uplifting and it deserves to be included in the ranks of great American literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In our modern world, Man does not survive by bread alone; he also feels compelled to &quot;survive&quot; by meeting self-imposed expectations within a personal construct. (&quot;I Am a Fisherman&quot;.) With age, Santiago feels his grip slipping, and begins to question the merit of his own worth. So he squeezes every ounce of determination from his aching body to wrest one last triumph that affirms the meaning of his life before he withdraws with Honor.A classic story of Man versus Nature and Man at One with Nature, Hemingway's words demand to be read aloud to appreciate their astounding beauty. For its prose alone, this is a five-star classic truly worthy of The Pulitzer.&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is also one of those works that translates extremely well to the screen: view the original film with Spencer Tracy and revel in that late, great actor's flawless soliloquy, set against gorgeous whitecaps at evening in riveting black and white.This is a must-read, and a must-view."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you only read one Ernest Hemingway novel, this has to be it. You can get no better picture of how he turns such simplicity into such sheer brilliance. I hate him, why is he so good and I'm not??? This is a nail biting adventure, very symbolic. Small and insignificant man going after that elusive prize he has been striving for his entire life. Who cares that sharks ate away everything but the tail and the head. It's like an orgasm. You work and you work, you build and you build and then the moment comes. Who cares how good it was getting there, the climax felt great. And that is what this is all about. You read it so fast because it's so short, then you read it again. You tell yourself that you weren't convinced he could do this and so excitingly. Then you read it again and your dreams come true, he wins. You're just so damn happy that he can go back home and go to bed, lying there, baked from the sun and exhausted, unrelenting in the face of the most trying of adversity. This is the ultimate story of triumph. Why oh why did you have to leave is Ernest?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man &amp; The Sea is arguablely Hemingway's best book, not only considered a classic for both fans and literature. In my private opinion, this a really good effort, which focus more on [principal character] Santiago's thoughts and feelings, a fisherman whose bad luck has reached 84 days without any catch. Thus, he is surprised when hooks a fish of an extraordinary size and weight. The book basically goes off on this, speaking of his thoughts, the old times, his beloved gone wife, and his feelings about his &quot;disciple&quot; Manolim. The book also covers many reflections to be brought up, not despising the fact that offers a rich, fortified vocabulary.However, I would not give five stars, for it isn't an outstanding achievement, nor give it three or lower classification. Four stars for a classic who may inspire people to write five stars books or reach five stars knowledge."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am not a Buddhist nor do I claim to be, but the notion of living simply and honestly is my goal in life. I bought this book in a effort to read some of the modern classics that I had either read as a child or missed out on. This story floored me. At points brought me to tears. Hemmingway's use of the language is mesmerizing. One man's struggle with old age, the elements, fatigue, self doubt. His triumph in a days old battle, only to be confronted with new struggles and failures. His respect for the fish is next to worship and soon turns to apologetic sorrow. In modern society we can only imagine this type of stuggle. Only possibly in war do we possess this type of mutual respect and reckless passion.Much more than the required reading I remembered."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a short good read. Having only read two Hemingway books I can say it is superior to The Sun Also Rises. I read The Sun Also Rises first and was worried that Hemingway was overrated but this book helped give me reason to continue to other Hemingway works."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book by Ernest Hemingway is amazing. This man has the ability to write a story while painting a picture with the scenes, and keeping the heart of a poet. Yet the entire time he does this while never allowing the reader to forget the author is male. It is a great book. In fact I recommend anything by this man."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I really enjoyed the movie (1990) with Anthony Quinn as Santiago. So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book it seemed a bit repetitive. The old man kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life.The Old Man and the Sea ~ Anthony Quinn"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After winning the Pulitzer in 1953, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA received special recognition in the citation that accompanied Ernest Hemingway's 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature. And the Panel recognized \\"[Hemingway's] powerful, style-forming mastery art of narration\\" that has captured men and women's imaginations for several generations.\\"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eight-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky...It made the boy sad come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like a flag of permanent defeat.The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color of the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\\"Santiago was born a fisherman and simply loved to fish. He happily awakens from his dreams of lions on a beautiful African beach each day with the hope that on this eight-fifth day he will get a fish. He rows out before the sun starts to rise above his beloved sea. As the sun breaks over the horizon he decides to go far out, farther than he should without the boy. He sees the bird circling and knows where to get his elusive fish. And his sticks slightly quiver. A fish at last! Now the battle between the old man and the fish begins. \\"Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\\"He's coming up,\\" he said. \\"Come on hand. Please come on.The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out...He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength not what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish he had ever seen and bigger than he ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.\\"On the third day Santiago finally wins the battle, but not before he has suffered. His hands are torn, his back and legs roil in pain, and he is suffering sun sickness. But he has endured to achieve his personal best. But the sharks finally defeat him. He rows into his home harbour with a gigantic skeleton. only the great Marlin's tail is intact. The boy weeps for the old man. But Santiago never complains that he is now 87 days without a fish. He did his job and his personal best was not good enough. He goes home and sleeps dreaming of lions. He will get up the next morning and he and the boy will go out together and fish. He knows life's bitterness and sweetness: strength of character, endurance, and the importance in defeat. He did his best to bring the Marlin to Market, though his best wasn't good enough on the 87th day. Perhaps the 88th day his best will be enough. And tonight, I will sleep dreaming of lions frolicking in the sand on an African beach."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have finished reading this book for Lit. class.

One day, when Santiago went out to sea, he sees a large fish. After finally managing to capture it and succeeding, he tries to drag it home.

The book starts off as the old man (Santiago), had already went out fishing at sea for 84 days, and he was ready to go on his 85th day the next morning. He woke up that morning, and him and a boy he was friends with got everything ready, and he set off into the sea. Later that day he caught a small fish, but this wasn't what he was aiming for, he was after much larger fish. Even later that day he felt his line being pulled, and he soon set the hook on a marlin well over 10 feet long. He battled this fish for a long time, about a day and a half, and he grew very tired, and weak from not having much to eat. He liked to talk to himself at sea, and he thought that most people would think he was crazy for this, but he didn't care. Eventually he wrestles the fish to the boat and stabs it with his spear and ropes it to the boat. He begins his journey back toward shore, and he encounters more than 5 sharks while he is trying to get the fish back, and each shark he encounters takes a large bite out of his prize fish. He makes several weapons to try to fight off the sharks, and they work at first, but eventually break. He gets the fish back to shore about 3 days after he first set out, and can barely even walk to his shack, he finally makes it after falling down several times, and he just falls asleep for a really long time. The other townspeople are astonished by the fish in the morning, and wish to congratulate him, but he is far too weak to talk to anyone, and they do what the man wishes with the remainder of the fish. And the man falls back asleep, and dreams, and the book ends. Overall I thought this book deserved a 4 out of 5 because it was entertaining, but did lack some interesting points at times. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to be entertained, and whoever likes survival type books."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What makes Michael Jordan and Tiger Wood exceed their hype in what they do is in the grace they do it with. They don't necessarily make it look easy but you see the result of hardwork and you say this fellow has done a good job. Hemingway's not an exception. Writing the way he has and the simplicity of it all completely belies the decades of honing a talent encapsulated in genius.To think that The Old Man and The Sea is a \\"simple\\" book would be wrong. This story is a snapshot of life in many dimensions: a vessel on which you float, arching of the Sun along the hours of time, a desire to persist in achieving a goal, living with the consequences of our actions, and actions not within our control all make up the strings of life waiting to be strummed."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Quote: \\"There are a few issues with the book (hence the four out of five grade) which include how the book bounces around and can become a little choppy at times.\\" - reviewer belowFirst of all, I'd like to remind those who aren't familiar with Hemingway - hey,choppy is his style! His simple prose was what made him stand out, and it was very beautiful and powerful.Anyway, I was very impressed with this classic. I had it on my bookshelf for a long time, and I finally got to it. I found myself feeling very in love with the old man, and thought the relationship with the boy was so tender and profound. The way he constantly thought of him during his battle out at sea was so sad because at that point in his life he really needed that boy's friendship.The lovely descriptions of the sea and its life really makes the reader see it all, and you feel the pain and burdens of the old man as well. This one is truly a simple and short story with an abundance of symbolic meaning. I urge those who have not read the book yet to look for certain things that I found interesting.First, Santiago's dreams about lions playing on an African beach. Then the wonderful, calm, relationship he has with nature and how he sees it as a \\"brother,\\" and deeply respects it.Also, discover the amazing gift that the Marlin fish gives to Santiago, the old man. Santiago leaves in one state, goes through triumphs and trials at sea, and returns differently.Finally, the reaching old age is a different state of mind, and Hemingway describes bittersweet human feelings of life in it's December, and also captures them beautifully in Santiago's pensative character."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you only read one Hemingway work--and that is not meant to disparage either you, or Hemingway--this should be it.

I believe he's one of those authors that you either hate or love. I am happy that I am, like many, one who adores him.The book itself is a philosophy of sorts. It doesn't entirely have a plot, therefore it doesn't entirely have a purpose. Then again, I consider book to be about moral and not about man. The way this moral is portrayed is helpful and perfect.As for the characters, there is little to say. The central characters are the old man and the fish. Each had admiring qualities that I am constantly searching for in characters. The old man's spirit and determination was what truly helped get through this book. He was entertaining and his speechs eloquent. Though the fish wasn't really a character, I found myself sympathizing and empathasizing with the creature. The author poured passion into such simple characters making them out to be complex.It was fascinating to read this book. It kept interest and I didn't want to put it down.

Thankyou for sending it in great condition, and making sure it got to my house promptly. God bless you!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm working my way through the list of Pulitzer Prize winners and this title is on both that list and the BELF list. A double hitter!Four Stars:Can't say that I \\"like\\" Hemingway but few writers can match his imagery. That specific talent soars in this book.Well, in this novella. I was surprised by how short it was when I first picked it up.Santiago, a very old man in a fishing village has earned respect over his long life but he has been unsuccessful in bringing in fish for a very long time. He has a young protogee, Manolo, who is very fond of him. Manolo's family has made him leave Santiago's skiff work though because they wanted Manolo to actually get some fish. Manolo is very considerate of Santiago and, while obeying his family, manages to ensure that Santiago has food and is kept as warm as such proverty-stricken conditions allow.One day, Santiago, alone in his skiff, decided to go further out on the sea to look for fish especially when he detected a large bird diving in a specific area - a sign that fish should be close. Hemingway's prose is gripping that describes this decision and the rowing and care for the lines as Santiago worked his way further out. A long wait and continual checking on the lines finally gives an indication that the decision was a correct one. One line is grabbed by what must be a huge fish, Santiago thinks. The fish is so large that he actually towed Santiago's skiff out further to sea. For three days and three nights, Santiago's skiff is towed but refuses to give up. Santiago must manage the lines, literally, with his bare hands (and his back.) That is the equipment used at the time - no automated assistance available in this time period. He is convinced the fish will tire and that will enable Santiago to capture him. Santiago, as opposed to Ahab, considers this great beast to be his brother. He regrets the need to kill him but believes that \\"his brother\\" understands the things in life and that he will provide nourishment to many people. The physical pain and injury that Santiago experiences and how he manages those obstacles was inspiring. Santiago felt proud of himself.Santiago captured my heart with his humility and endurance. He is said, at the beginning of the story, to understand that he is humble in nature and doesn't question that. That humility is tested when after succeeding in capturing a fish of almost historically unmet size and weight, he has to fight off the sharks that want to take his prize. He loses that fight. He wonders if he really was happy about the catch because it would feed so many people or did pride, for once in his life, make him take chances that were so outrageous.A true pyrrhic victory.I was so impressed by how Hemingway wrote both the struggle with the fish and against the marauding sharks. I was so gripped by Santiago's discussions with himself about how he would handle his injuries so that he could continue to work toward capturing the fish and, again, defeating the sharks. I was so moved by how he kept wishing \\"the boy\\" was with him.Without being heavy-handed with symbolism, Hemingway still makes the points of being reborn (3 days and 3 nights); that maturity of age and the energy of youth having equally valid strengths; that, on occasion, simply knowing that you won will just have to be enough.The spoils of war are sometimes spoiled.Enchanting read.DL"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I love Hemingway, and this is one of my favorites of his works.

Brimming with Hemingway's brilliant symbols, this short novel is a must read.After reading it, I couldn't help but feel that the fish represented Hemingway's writing. Reading it gave me the feeling that after the critical failure of his last novel, Hemingway felt as the old man: Tired, alone, but struggling with his art. The sharks seem to vividly recapture the vicious criticisms shot at Hemingway from all sides following his most recent defeat.By the time the old man(and Hemingway) reach shore, there is nothing left but a few tales for the villagers. It is telling that Hemingway never wrote another novel after this one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I remember reading other Hemingway works when I was in school, and I also remember feeling truly satisfied after I read the last pages of those books. I felt as if I had just learned something of value, and believe it or not, those lessons have stayed with me through the years. Somehow, I missed out on reading The Old Man And The Sea, or else I read it and don't remember doing so (which could very well be), so I recently bought it and I read it in about three sittings. Again, Hemingway didn't disappoint me. Santiago, the main character, reminded me of a few friends and family members, who are on the downside of...let's say fifty ;-), and who are not ready to throw in the towel and fade away into oblivion just yet, despite the unbeatable odds against them. I actually felt as if I was sitting out there in the boat with poor old Santiago, or better yet, I felt like I was the man himself, which is a little tricky since I'm a woman. Hemingway has a truly unique style of writing, which defies a lot of the \\"rules\\", but he knows how to tell a tale and he knows how to get into the brains and minds of his characters. If you've never read Hemingway, perhaps it's time. God rest his blessed soul.Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Read this book in high school and was thoroughly bored by it, but reading it again as an adult I have a better appreciation for it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm not the biggest Hemingway fan in the world, but I like this book. I first read it in high school, just like millions of kids still do every year. The Old Man and the Sea is an American classic, and for some pretty good reasons. It signified the author's return to greatness, it shows an old man who is full of both resolve and wry humor, and lastly it is a moving story told in very simple, straightforward language.I can appreciate what this novella is about. You take a guy down on his luck and send him on a journey of unearthly demands. How does he react? Santiago could have given up and quit any time he wanted - before or after his catch - so it is interesting to see what drives a man onward. Hemingway thought that Santiago's qualities were what was important in a man; he makes a good case for them here. Compassion, perserverance and a sense of order to life all come into play. Santiago respects the fish, and that is what makes this story most memorable.I don't know whether this was symbolic of Hemingway's own struggle with the literary critics of his time, nor do I think that this is his best . But I think the Old Man and the Sea should be read...in all ages. Perhaps it is fitting that a book like this is told in such simple language. Like the ocean itself, great things lurk just below the surface for those who wish to look."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature, Hemingway is also renowned for books such as \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (1929) and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1940). But his classic 1952 Pulitzer Prize winning novella \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of his most accessible works. It recounts the battle of an old Cuban fisherman against the sea, during a fishing expedition filled with triumph and tragedy. After 84 fruitless days of fishing, Santiago finally hooks a huge 18 foot marlin which he battles for three days of personal suffering, only to lose his prize catch to sharks on his way to shore.Although the plot can be summed up in just one sentence, Hemingway excels in creating a rich atmosphere in describing the old man's battle against nature and against himself. \\"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?\\" By primarily referring to the protagonist as \\"the old man\\" instead of using his personal name Santiago, Hemingway emphasizes the human struggle, and touches on important themes about triumph in tragedy and human courage in struggle (although perhaps Hemingway gives too much credence to human pride as a motivation). In the beginning, the old man's sail is characterized as \\"the flag of permanent defeat.\\" But despite losing his catch, there is a note of triumph at the end: \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" The young boy Manolin, the baseballer DiMaggio, and the lions of Santiago's youth all represent images of youth and strength that sustain the old man on his road of suffering toward this triumph.The writing style is terse, easy-to-read, yet the resulting picture is tremendously powerful and beautiful in its simplicity. While a child can read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", only adults will truly appreciate the symbolism of the sea in representing human trials, and Santiago's struggle in overcoming them. Some see Christ-like symbolism in Santiago's bleeding hands, and in the final journey of the defeated but triumphant old man carrying his mast up the hill, representing a spiritual triumph of a new life and resurrected respect for the old man attained through physical suffering and defeat. Certainly Santiago is explicitly identified with Christ when he makes \\"just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the woods.\\" Others have interpreted the novella autobiographically after the failure of Hemingway's 1950 novel \\"Across the River and Into the Trees,\\" with the sharks representing Hemingway's critics.In short, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a relatively quick and easy read, yet leaves you with a sense of depth that most modern fiction lacks. As a companion that can help increase appreciation for the book, check out the 1958 movie version starring Spencer Tracy, which sticks closely to the book and features lengthy quotations as part of the narrative. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea does not tell simplistic tales of obvious adventure, it paints beautiful worlds with words that tell of an old man who battles internally against himself and externally against the harsh violence of nature-- and ultimately wins in the end.

Ironically it won him the Pulitzer in 1950, which Faulkner had yet to win, and surely helped in his 1954 Nobel.Now go back and read it again, and see what the story is really about, and don't forget to think who those sharks represent, just by writing a review, you may be one of them."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am 17 and have read too many books. This remains after all the best piece I've ever read.It's true when people say the read is not entertaining or surprising. It's not meant to be either. It was written to mean something deep about life and the struggle that it is.Hemingway more than any other author understands passion and love, that life was what Helen Keller said, &quot;A great adventure or nothing at all.&quot; and that great experiences lead inevitably to great pain and glory. That we almost never succeed the way we want but can still be glad with our efforts is a harder lesson to learn but is also demonstrated brilliantly in this work.If you look for a fun read, or enjoy easily digested fiction, this is NOT a book you should buy.For those of you who want something greater and deeper in thought than what our spiritually tranquilizing entertainment can provide, read this."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm not a big Hemingway fan, but I actually enjoyed this because his usual bland machismo is tempered here by a sense of reflection and, at times melancholy. It's pretty heavy handed (oh, the futility of old age!) but it's also just more thoughtful than the other books of his I've read, the prose a bit more pensive. At the same time, its still Hemingway and it has a very boisterous, adventurous quality to it. It's just fun to be out on the sea on a beautiful day, even if mother nature does give you that final, romantic smack down. The writing has an almost technical feeling at times, especially the beautiful descriptions of fish and sharks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway is not a famous author for nothing. I just enjoyed the prose, and the bond between the Young man and the Old man. But I found the old man's defeat a bit too unfair and sad."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I ordered this book for my American Literature class. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. It was exactly what I needed. Great price too!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Quite frankly Hemingway is one of my favorite American 20th century authors. His clarity of writing style had a profound influence on the teaching of American writing throughout the century and cured Americans of the verbosity and opaqueness of British English. Unfortunately, Hemingway was a man in the fullest sense of the meaning in his age and he has suffered for this with the rise of multiculturalism in the teaching curriculum. The trend is not wrong but it is tragic that students will often not be exposed to such a great writer.Hemingway is also damned for his lack of experimentation both in his narrative style and his lack of sexuality. Obviously, the contention that he was not experimental is false because he crafted the American writing style and wrote many great American novels, precious gems populated by male characters who operated with \\"grace under fire\\". As to his lack of sexual content Hemingway wanted to be successful and followed the advice of Gertrude Stein and kept the smut out of his work with various mechanisms and narrative arrangement. However, his work is filled with romance and passion appropriate to American mainstream sensibilities of the early 20th century. But Hemingway also wrote the great Cubic novel with Henry Miller: \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"/\\"Tropic of Cancer\\". The two works intersect in the middle when the two primary characters meet in a cafe - Miller broke and starving, Hemingway paying his tab. Hemingway's character is sexless, Miller's debauched in the demimonde of interwar Paris. Hemingway would be a famous and successful writer in America while Miller's work would be banned in the States until the 60s by which time Hemingway was dead by his own hand. Together the Cubic novel captures the reality of Paris for Americans between the two world wars and has fired an ongoing love of the city and French culture among some Americans to this day.But it was \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" that solidified Hemingway's career with Pulitzer and Nobel prizes in literature. This is due to the fact that like Melville before him this \\"fishing story\\" is simply so much more. It is a story of Man's struggle with life and is no better illustrated than by the following quote from the book:\\"\`Ay,&#8242; he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\\"In this short passage Hemingway captures the agony of the fisherman, the dangers of the workingman, and the Passion of Christ. It is pure brilliance and one of the great moments in American literature.Read it and, if possible, read it in one setting. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's simple but powerful language and striaight forward sentance structure are alone enough to justify this story's place in the best segment of American literature.However, Hemingway more than manages to put you in the old fisherman's mind and later, in his exhausted body in this story of an elderly, unlucky, fisherman who finally hooks the fish of his lifetime, only to lose it after a valiant struggle with sharks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Great story from the greatest of storytellers I highly recommended reading for all.

Hemingway treated their character like anonymous by not using their proper names. It has effects such as appearing to be a fairy tale, abstracting or symbolizing characters, and focusing on his current thinking and acts. The author especially seemed to want to focus on his character present being.The old man is written as the figure, which barely balance the erosion of the sea with inner aging. The old mans features are aged, patient, being wounded. In his experience endurance had similar meaning of victory. It is showed by the arm wrestling scene (p.69-71).The fish might be a symbol of the sea, nature, luck, absurdity, life, death, shadow of the old man. I feel the last one is rather good, because I dont remember the scene of the old mans shadow reflected on the surface of the sea. Ordinary it is natural there is that kind of scene.Also, the environment is a big component of this story. The environment suggests and allures characters into a new feeling. For example, His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises(13). In this case, the environment is the breeze. It made the old man relax and refresh, so the old man brought himself into new feelings. In addition, the environment in the old mans memory is wholly crystallized. For example, in the arm wrestling scene, There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and at the negros face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees every four sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negros hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands an forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched(69). It has a symmetrical structure. I feel as if it expressed the bars shape itself: from the wall bettors lean through the wrestlers, referees, to the other wall. It is circular and closed structure. It is highly crystallized, and I feel also that is because this scene has already been taken in the old mans memory and cherished for long time by him. The environment in this story has very important role. I think it is as if it was one of the main characters."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"From what people have told me, this book has given them chills when reading it.

I do not want to spoil it for those who have not read it.This is a story about determination, struggle, love, and hate for the different fish of the sea.

He lets the fish pull him out of sight of land during an epic struggle which lasts for three days. Santiago eventually loses most of the marlin to attacking sharks. He returns to his village with only the skeleton and the head of the fish attached to his small boat.THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a book which can be read and read again later in life with new insights. There is much to see in Santiago's battle with the fish and also in his mentoring relationship with Manolin.One of the biggest pleasures for me in reading this book is in the enjoyment I receive from savoring the unique writing style of Hemingway.

Excellent intro to Hemingway for those looking to put a foot in the door to either his works or other classics."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was my first venture into the work of Hemmingway, I really enjoyed the read. I was instantly drawn into the story of the old man, and his fishing boat, and his struggle against a worthy adversary, a once in a lifetime fish. The crux of the story relies on this lonely, small, withered old man, using the last power and energy he has in his tired frame to catch one last fish. This fish happens to be the biggest fish he has ever seen. The fight goes on day and night until the old man finally lands the fish, but it is so large he cannot put it in the boat and has to drag it behind him. Once he sails his boat back to warmer waters, the sharks set in, and he tries to fend them off with an oar. All the time the catch of his lifetime, the end to his streak of much time without catching any fish, is dragging behind being torn apart by these atangonistic sharks. The outcome, you will have to read for yourself, but this book is a classic, and worth reading. Once you start to read it, you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"read this book again and you may appreciate it more now than when you read it for the first time in grade school...Hemingway tried a daring thing and succeeded in many ways. He wrote a beautiful story with few characters and little dialogue, focusing on the old theme of the struggle of the human spirit. The critics' claims that it contains heavy-handed symbolism (the shark represents the critics that berated H's earlier works) are hogwash...The simple, stilted speech of Santiago and the boy seems to me to be Hemingway's attempt to capture Cuban speach patterns in English. Rather than having them speak English as we would expect, he had them speak as if he were listening to them speak Spanish and translating it to himself word for word into English, thus strengthening their simple, uneducated, working-class characters.This also leads to the major negative element of the book - the characters are not well-rounded. They are all simple working-class Cubans, either friends of Santiago or not. Hemingway loved Cuba, but I'm not sure he respected Cubans as full human beings."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book because I had to, and I thought it was O.K. The story was very action packed and it was a cool book for boys to read. I thought the old man was very courageous and it made me think that when I'm old I want to be like that. Although this book was written many year ago, I think it shows that even though you are old you can still do things. It also taught me that no matter what other people think about you, you should still believe in yourself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"And if you DON'T like Hemingway, you'll like this little gem regardless! Maybe you read it (or the Cliff notes), but give it a re-read and savor its sweet and not-so-esoteric message.

Santiago was going on eighty-four days without a good catch, returning to the dock empty handed again and again. Santiago's apprentice, Manolin was forced by his parents to find another boat to shadow because the old man's bad luck would soon rub off onto their son. When the old man gains enough energy to make a big day out to the sea, he finds himself encountered with a big marlin, one that he couldn't possibly carry back to shore on his own. But, as it is said, the elders always know. The turning point in this novel comes when the old man comes encounter with the nibbling on his lines and soon finds he has finally received a bite. In my opinion, I think that Ernest Hemingway is a very talented and experienced writer, his style of writing is simple, but complex all at once. His choices of words are very elaborate, but his story line is very basic and simple. I really am enjoying Hemingway's writings, but I could see why some would not.

This book was assigned to me, and I am now wondering why. Literature should have direction and goals it aims to accomplish when people read it. This is a randomly composed book about some old guy who goes fishing. Maybe if this book was set over the mans lifetime, and it described the trials and tribulations of his fishing as he ages, then it might be good. But the whole book was about one fishing trip.

I am writing to give what I think is a more accurate symbolism of the themes in the novel. I have read, for instance, that the old man represented Jesus-Christ, or God himself, and one of the most convincing reviews sees the book as a story in which the old man, i.e. God, lonely and full of years, but his eyes still young, as the text says, sails the sea of creation in search of the deep self of man. When he hooks the fish, it is with the intention of bestowing on him all the love which he had in store for him since the origin of the world. But the author of this review goes a great length to make sure this God is not misunderstood as a cruel, man-killing God! For the old man does indeed kill the fish, beautiful as he is. And there is no allusion in this review to the passage where the old man wonders whether this killing might not be a sin. Now, would God wonder that? In fact, we may see the old man as Man, and the fish as Christ. The first Christians had adopted the cryptic word &quot;Ichtus&quot;, which in Greek means fish, to represent Christ, because of the fact that its letters, in Greek, are the letters which begin each word of the sentence &quot;Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour&quot;. This in itself would not be a sufficient element to interpret the story, but also bear in mind that the old man's name is Santiago, or Saint James, one of the apostles, whose letter in the New Testament urges christians to show their faith not just in words but in deeds. The old man therefore represents man stuggling with God, who injures him, just as Jacob had fought with God's angel at the Yabbok and had hurt him after the fight. And Jacob, like the old man, had been victorious. The fish is Jesus caught by man, accepting to be caught by man, accepting to be killed by man, beautiful though he is. The old man is here in the position of all men who have killed God on the cross (the wood of the boat, on which the fish is tied), and it is natural that he should ask himself the question of transgression: hasn't he &quot;gone too far&quot; in fishing such a fish? The answer is no, for out of the evil of death springs the good of the eucharist: the sharks represent men nourished by the body of Christ, men both evil and good, for the kingdom is given to all. One can also see a sort of vision of the resurrection of the &quot;fish-Christ&quot; in its last jump out of the water, the word &quot;rose&quot; being used by Hemingway in that beautiful passage, in which the fish shows all its glory. (But naturally it is before the death of the real fish here.) One of the commentators rightly saw everyman carrying his cross when the old man goes back home, carrying his mast to the shed, while the skeletton of the fish is still (as it will ever be) tied to the wood as a memorial of his capture by men. The last ironical- but profoundly telling - trait comes when some tourists, seeing the skeletton of the swordfish, confuse it with that of a shark:God has really become one of us."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I do admit that the book was a little slow. I don't recommend it for those with low attention spans. But if you do read on, after about 1/3 of the book, it get really good and you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is not in my mind Hemingway's best work but it is the one story that I feel he felt the most for while writing. Hemingway lived life on his terms and he paid in many ways for that lifestyle. The old fisherman to me represents Hemingway's lifelong struggle to write clearly and simply. The story has a lot of heart in its depiction of an old man's struggle to never give up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorites. Up there with 'Of Mice and Men'. Nothing better than to have such a complete story at a length that you can read in a day.Perhaps my most remembered aspect of this book comes not from its text, but from a quote Hemingway wrote when addressing a critic who praised all the symbolism in the story: &quot;There isn't any symbolism. The sea is the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The sharks are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is sh*t. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know.&quot;Is there symbolism in this book? According to Hemingway, no. But one can't help but see it when one reads it. And perhaps Hemingway had different intentions when he scolded the critic. Either way, this is a great work of art. The reader can decide for themselves if Hemingway indeed did have an hidden agenda."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; although, not one of the finest books I have ever read, it is an exceptional and gritty discription of one mans (a Cuban fisherman) struggle with nature and himself. The battle rages in a hostile environment against a fish (marlin) doing only what it does best, survive. Not suprisingly, and unlucky for the fish, man finally reigns supreme, only to be bested by another fish, a shark which eats the marlin. With only the skelton remaining, the Cuban fisherman returns home to brag of his win. Man has survived for centuries because of his ability to struggle against unsurmountable odds and win.The same is still true today, regardless of the battle ground. The stock market, football, space travel, or taking the kids to the grocery, the goal is the same, to survive.When reading, see it as a reflection of your life and maybe you might have a better perspective on your place in the food chain."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"this book is a wonderfully written book which catches the reader's minds and does not let go until the end. another great book by hemingway which should not be avoided. filled with symbolizism the old man is representing Jesus Christ.

I had to read it for a class, so I'm not thinking very highly of it now. Santigo is a wonderful old man and Manolin, the boy, is a great character also. This book was one of the most dissapointing books that I have read in my classes, and I feel bad becase of it. I didn't want to tell you how horrid it was, but it is a waste of time, and Hemingway didn't do himself justice with this peice of literature"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In The Old Man and The Sea, Hemingway succeeded in giving a simple depiction of our communal struggle that is called life. We may fail or succeed in tasks that we attempt, but it is the trying that makes the individual who he/she is. The marvel of a book that is less than 200 pages and that has only two real characters (three if you count the fish) is not lost on any generation of reader that picks this book up. The language is simple, as was always Hemingway's style, and yet so artful that the reader feels it is him/her in the novel and not some stranger. Only Hemingway could have gotten all this into the scant number of pages we see here. Anyone that is fooled into believing that the simple words make for a simple work are just too ignorant to see what is really there. This is a must read for any pleasure reader"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I gave this book, The Old Man and the Sea by Earnest Hemmingway, four stars because I thought it was a pretty good book for us to read in school. At first I thought it might have been boring because it is all about one man and 3 days of his life trying to catch a fish, but it was very intense and exciting mostly the whole book. Hemmingway did an excellent job making a fishing trip exciting. His writing was extremely detailed throughout the whole book which made it very easy to read. He shows this when he is describing the old man in the beginning of the book and says \\"The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea where on his cheeks\\" (9-10).Not only was the description very detailed, the characters were developed very well. I really liked how there was only two main characters in this book because that is all he needed to get the message across to his readers. He shows how developed the characters are when the boy, Manolin, say to Santiago \\"You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything\\" (126). This shows what the boy's relationship with the old man is like; they are close and really respect each other. He also showed the character development of Santiago when he says \\"I can do it as long as he can...\\", the he he is talking about is the marlin shark that he is trying to reel in (53). He is showing how devoted he really is to what he does for a living and how he feels about life in general.Originally I thought that the plot was going to be kind-of boring because it was just about one fishing trip over three days but it ended up being very exciting. I really enjoyed this book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted to read a well written, exciting, short book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's classic novels or novella or story, whatever you want to call it. Many consider it to be his finest work (it played a big part in his winning of the Nobel Prize). I put it with his finest work, like A Farewell to Arms, though his best work is found in The Complete Short Stories, The Sun Also Rises, and The Garden of Eden.The novella carries a tone of depression and tiredness and a feeling of religiousity. Many have pointed out the Christ-image of the story, and make no mistake, it is there. The story divides itself into three parts of the narrative. Before he goes to sea, the battle with the fish (which is the bulk of the narrative) and the fight with the sharks--where much of the Christ symbolism kicks in. The novella is written in the type of prose we have come to associate with Hemingway: that of the tough, terse declarative prose. This is truly a classic.What I wish most about this novella is that it was included in The Complete Short Stories, where it truly belongs. With the greats. To truly appreciate it read it as the ending of The Complete Short Stories."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a short parable about the food chain. I read an amazonian editorial review which baldly stated that the old man is \\"triumphant as the other fishermen marvel at the size of the skeleton.\\" Perhaps this reviewer read a different book ... there is absolutely no \\"triumph\\" or any other strain of hubris in the old man's character. Only a strong resolve and bucketloads of humility. The old man is not even around when the fishermen and tourists are \\"marvelling\\" - he's in his shack, in bed, recuperating. Maybe this reviewer never even read the book. Just up to the bit where it starts to get boring, after the old man actually hooks the fish, and then figured on a good Hollywood ending. Fair enough. Actually reading a book is a hindrance to writing a good review. Check out my only other amazonian review, on \\"Recollections of a Bleeding Heart\\" and see what I mean. Never even read it. Good review though, don't you think? Sure, no one has yet voted that they found my review helpful. I would be very hurt if anyone did. Bleeding utilitarians. If you want to read something helpful, read the instruction manual for your dvd player or something. Don't waste time reading reviews by mark coddington.But I did actually read Hemingway's novella. Sort of felt obliged. You know, when books start to reproach you each time you glance at them? I've got a 614 page biography of Arthur Miller on the bookshelf in front of me, with Arthur's face on the spine looking at me through those crazy black minimalist glasses (they never really caught on, did they?) and he knows that I'm never going get around to reading \\"Timebends\\" in this lifetime, and he's staring at me with reproach.Back to the parable. This old guy hasn't caught a fish for yonks. Everyone thinks he's bad luck, except the boy. One day he goes out deep, hooks himself one big effoff fish. Too big to fit in the boat, he straps it alongside and by the time he brings it in, sharks have picked it clean.I mean, there you have it. Its not about spoils going to the victor. Its not about overcoming great challenges against all odds, then rubbing your detractors' noses in it. Just because The Old Man and the Sea is written by an American, doesn't mean it's about winning.The book's 127 pages long. After the old man hooks the fish, he takes 83 pages to bring the creature in. 83 pages of Hemingway's unrelenting and unembellished prose. Think of the most uncomfortable chair you've ever sat on. Now pick a number between one and ten. Imagine sitting on that chair for that many hours. It will start to give you some idea of what reading this book is like, particularly if you are an empathetic type like me. The cuts on the old man's hands from the line - ow! Now, multiply this number of hours by nine. If you get a two-digit number, add those numbers together, otherwise stick with what you got. Now subtract five. Just do it! (Oops, I think I've broken copyright laws. Ignore that last sentence). Next, count along that number of letters in the alphabet and think of a country starting with the letter you came to. Take the second letter of that country's name and think of the first animal that comes into your head. Got it? Now when you've finished reading this review, I'll tell you what animal that was. And I'll bet you right now that you didn't think of a fish or an old man.) Okay, do we have a deal? But I digress. The idea of the animal kingdom provides one key to understanding this tale. Firstly, the old man constantly dreams of lions on the beach in Africa. Why? What do lions represent? I do not profess to be proficient in, or interested in, psychoanalytic approaches to literature. But the lions must represent something important to the old man, or why would Hemingway waste his valuable - sorry, useful - time by writing about it? Secondly, the old man (his name is Santiago, by the way, but is seldom referred to as anything other than \\"he\\" or \\"the old man\\", so I'll follow Ernest's lead) continually refers to the fish he has hooked as his \\"brother\\". During the old man's three day fishing marathon, he eats raw fish, as he has no other sustenance, which further emphasizes this \\"brotherhood\\". Hemingway is asking, where does man stand in relation to the animal? Then he goes a long way toward answering it: \\"I am only better than him though trickery and he meant me no harm.\\" And: \\"But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\\"The old man is alone, locked in a battle with both himself and the fish. Yet he identifies with the fish; he feels sorry for it: \\"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish.\\" The fish's name is Alberto, but is only ever referred to as \\"fish\\" by Hemingway. In a struggle to come to terms with his own life and imminent death, the old man talks aloud to himself, asking questions both simple and profound. Death is a central motif in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", but not one I'm much interested in.Perhaps looking for motifs, and pondering their significance, is to read too much into a book. Maybe this one is just a story about an old man who catches a big fish. Here's an interesting question. Do Jehovah's Witnesses read all books in their literal sense, or only the Bible? Hmm. Furthermore, are there any good customer reviews of the Bible on Amazon? I'm off to have a look. Oh - before I go, I must keep my part of the deal. Was it an elephant?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This powerful book defined the essence of Hemmingway's style, and captures his prose at it's best.Life is a struggle. Our measure in life is how we face up to this struggle, despite our imperfections. In the end, it is our strength and courage in adversity that matters more than the outcome. This is what I got out of the Old Man and the Sea.On the surface it is about the story of the fish that almost got away, and the struggle to bring it to shore. By another author, and with weaker prose, the book would have been a non-event. Brought to life by Hemingway, the book is a compact masterpiece, bringing you into the boat and struggle with the Old Man himself.It is tough to judge what makes a book Nobelworthy. I certainly find most in that genre unapproachable. This book did speak to me, and I encourage you to let it speak to you. In terms of impact, it stylistically encouraged those books beyond it to be tighter in style and impact. The allegorical style was most recently copied in the Life of Pi."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, a story by Ernest Hemingway, its value as a novel is debatable. Some loathe the novel for its dryness and others praise the novel for its simplistic beauty. I believe that Hemingway's novel is a work of genius. Its carefully crafted plot and tragic ending leave the reader feeling as if they had actually witnessed the ordeal, and wishing that in some way they could help the main character, Santiago, who had been wronged by fate.The Old Man and the Sea keeps a very interesting plot while incorporating the theme of blue into the details and mood. The story includes characters with simplistic motives, but realistic emotions as they cope with the lasting pain of one single character. This character is Santiago, an elderly Cuban fisherman. He's luckless, meaning his attempts to catch fish are futile, but he still carries hope. His only friend, a young boy named Manolin, soaks in his pain, making the story look bluer then Santiago's old, deep blue eyes. The melancholy story is all about \\"man verses fate\\", as Santiago continues to fail because of his lack of good fortune. Reading this, one has to relate to Santiago, because everyone has their anticlimactic moments. Normally people like to read about victories and glory but this story seems to have a gravitational effect on readers.Hemingway's unique writing style is part of this interesting gravitational effect. While in the beginning one may have a dislike of Hemingway's writing because of its word repetition and *simplicity, but after awhile one takes a strange liking to it. It's because of the emotional bond between the audience and Santiago that hooks the reader to the story. One becomes obsessed with the image of Santiago succeeding, which mockingly dances ahead. It's not the writing that attracts readers; it's the plot that fits perfectly with the style.I recommend this book to all people who enjoy a classic, because The Old Man and the Sea is definitely a fantastic and original book. Though everything about the story seems simplistic at first glance, it is actually the simplicity that makes it a story that I encourage all readers to finish. The well crafted novel is a work of genius that well deserved its Pulitzer Prize if not much more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a short little book primarily about optimism and never giving up. In a nutshell, an Old Man who hasn't caught a fish for many moons suddenly has snared himself a fine piece of fish that isn't going to be brought in easily. Lots of insomnia, bloody and cramping hands, letting line in and out, and beating off sharks who want to claim the fish as their own.I did find the language, lack of plot, aimlessness, and general lack of substance to be a disappointment (I guess we're never to admit that about a &quot;classic&quot;, but I'm honest), hence the 3 stars; however, a few things DID impress me, such as how the old man never gave up no matter how bad the outlook, how he maintained a sense of survival - a sort of one-foot-in-front-of-the-next attitude, and how he always corrected his negative self-talk. Even in the end of the book, despite disappointment, the man had a peaceful existence. He wasn't dismayed. He simply went to sleep. These qualities in and of themselves make the book a definite worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is actually the first Hemingway book that I have ever read. I enjoyed reading about the killer sharks, and the main character, who seemed to be more unlucky than I am. Though the book does not give names, until the end, it does not bother me because during this book there is no need for names. It is a simple old fisherman verses a 1 and 1/2 ton marlin who drags him out to sea.The story begins with the Old man and the &quot;boy&quot;, whom helps hiim fish. The old man has been very unlucky, in fishing, lately and decides that since he has gone for 84 days without catching a simgle fish he will go out and try one last time, which ends up to be the best time of his life. After he cannot see the lights of his city anymore he gets this huge grab, but what he doesn't realize is that the grab is almost 2 tons. I admit that this story is boring at times mainly because he is alone and he talks to himself, maybe that is why it is so short. It really does pick up after he finally kills that marlin. That is where sharks come and feed of the fish. Though I would like to say more, it would ruin the end of the book.I think that if you read a lot of books where the main character goes nuts by being alone with himsel, and not being prepared, this is the book for you. Though if you get woozy from reading about half eaten fish or eating fish raw, you should probably stay away. I know I enjoyed this book, and I didn't even know what the tools he used to kill the fish were called. But don't take my word for it read it yourself and see how a classic, noble peice winning book effecs you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Anyone who denies that Hemingway was a genius is probably either 1) a fool or 2) a dilettante intellectual trying to impress you.This story is about the incredible impact work has on human beings.

This edition of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; does not do that, however. I would, though, suggest to people who are considering the idea of experiencing this work for the first time that you read the book instead. Reading the book tends to wring out more emotion, which only makes this classic better. If you want to listen to it, however, and you want to choose the right version, for goodness sake, choose an unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is Ernest Hemingway at his simplest, and most powerful, as a story teller. The sentences are short. The meaning is clear. The cadence of the prose advances your sense of what is happening.An old man goes out fishing alone from Cuba and hooks the fish of a lifetime. This fish could make a lifetime of disappointments and setbacks all worth while.After an incredible and exhausting fight, the fish is his. Now all he has to do is get it back to shore. Then the struggle really begins!The Old Man and the Sea lets us see our own lives more clearly, by experiencing the challenge to and empathizing with the fisherman in this classic tale of man versus nature and man versus himself that explores the true nature of human nobility. What does life mean? What is striving for? From what do we gain our dignity?Anyone who thinks that he who dies with the most toys wins will can learn a great deal from this story.Even if the story was not so compelling and universal in its appeal and themes, the book is worth the trip just for the writing. Simple words combine into simple sentences that build into metaphors that pile on top of metaphors in order to make for a magnificent vista and experience for you. Seldom has so much complexity been portrayed with such simplicity. What's even more astonishing is how short this novella is. Amazing!Just to let you know how much I love this book, I often use the techniques and concepts in The Old Man and the Sea in my own writing. Miscommunication is what people have the most trouble with in cooperating with each other. Any time you run into that stall, think about how Hemingway would have solved the problem. Tell a story like this one that makes the point you want to share. Then tell the story again and again. Thirty times or more, and everyone will begin to get it. When your listeners start telling the story thirty times to others, you have made an important first step.Read this book, reread this book, learn from it each time, and enjoy ... enjoy ... enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is Hemingway's finest work.This is the dream he sought as a young writer toachieve--to create an entire work in prose thatreads as poetry--and he nailed it here, completely.Viva Hemingway!A profound sense of acceptance rocks in Hemingway'sepic story of Santiago's journey at sea--a sense ofacceptance found in few of Hemingway's other works of art.There are profound connections in this magnificent novel(outside of America, this book is often referred to as a novel)to Buddhism, Sufi Islam, and Christianity.And Hemingway, who once said, \\"The sea is my religion,\\"touches a spiritual chord here that re-affirms one ofhis maxims: Man can be defeated but not destroyed.In Afghanistan, the lieutenants in the field are keenon Hemingway, so I will quote one of them,First Lieutenant Eric Schwirian, a 2007 graduateof Drexel University and a solid US Army infantryofficer (Ranger & Airborne qualified):\\"Hemingway never cheats, he gets the hook in you and brother, you stay hooked.

A classical novella, The Old Man and the Sea, displays emotional sentiment virtually throughout the story. This is a heroic story that is perfectly written and that is filled with perseverance, pride and friendship. This novella mostly takes action at the sea.Santiago, the old Cuban man, goes for eighty-four days without catching a fish. His buddy, Manolin, strongly believes in the old man that he can catch a fish. Manolin has been deprived of going with the old man who has worst luck. The two of them like to talk about baseball in their conversation. Santiago's favorite baseball player is the great DiMaggio.On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago goes sailing far beyond the island's shallow coastal waters and ventures into the Gulf Stream. Like always, whenever he throws the line that has the bait fixed to it, a fish would eat whatever is attached to that line and rapidly move away. The following is a battle which tests the old man's skill to suffer to the limit. It was as if perseverance was in the man's blood. At noon, this particular marlin catches on the line and actually moves the skiff along. The strange man points out that the fish was two feet longer than the skiff. During some time, when the line was steady hard, Santiago's left hand got cramped. He disgustingly looks at his hand and asks it how it is doing after eating fish that he caught earlier.While weariness hit him, he remembers the time when he and an African American went one day and one night arm wrestling. By remembering this event, he gave himself confidence. At daylight, the old man defeated the African American and became known as \\"The Champion.\\" This memory effectively shows that the old man has sustained before and can still endure the encounter with the enormous fish.During the whole story, the old man wishes that the boy was with him to see this magnificent fish. He has only three things that are his brothers, his two hands and the fish. He greatly admires this marlin but at the end, he pities the great fish that he had hooked. On the third day of the struggle, the fish circles around the boat which means exhaustion. This was the time for the old man to strike into the fish.Hemingway effectively shows his objective by describing an old man against society (the fish and the sea). Frankly, this simple book is mostly about fishing, friendship, and endurance. I strongly encourage anyone who enjoys to fish to read this novella. Its suspenseful climax really lures the reader to finish the book. I liked this book because of the structure on how it is written and its simplistic wording.If you would like to read more book reviews, please visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When I first read The Old man and the Sea, I was probably too young to realize its significance. I didn't enjoy it. The second time however, it was much better. Hemingway is an excellent writer, and Santiago is an extremely well-developed character. In short, this book is a piece of literature that shines like a beacon among lesser works. I highly reccomend reading it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One aspect unnoticed in the modern, industrial world, is that many jobs that are now done by man and machine used to be done by man himself, with maybe the aid of some hand-made tools. As such, this book is a good portrayal of this type of economic transition. Santiago, a very old fisherman, goes a very long time without catching any fish. His competitors pass him by with improved technology and machines. One day, Santiago heads out to sea with the promise that he will not return until he catches a fish. He finally does catch one, but the catch is eaten by sharks before it is pulled on board. This book is short and easy to read, and portrays very well the plight of those who make their life from the land, or sea, and what happens to their livelihoods when technology and progress pass them by, and nature refuses her help."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway had the skills of an anthropologist. Theodor Adorno wrote of the characteristics of late art. This work is a good example of late art.After forty days and no fish, the old man, Santiago, lost the services of his boy companion. Nevertheless, the boy, Manolin, brought him food for his supper, rice, black beans, fried banana.The old man had three fishing lines. He straightened them. Then he felt the pull. Imagine, fishless for days, the old man was being pulled by a large fish. During the night two porpoises kept the old man company. Santiago told the fish he would stay with him until he was dead.A cramp is humiliating when one is alone. The hands of the old man were cramping from the work of holding onto the fish. The old man had to make his plans in accordance with the fish's plans. Santiago noted the fish was two feet longer than the skiff. Later he estimated the fish weighed one thousand five hundred pounds.The old man and the boy had been in the habit of talking about baseball. Out on the water alone Santiago thought about the baseball leagues. He thought the great fish was his friend. He felt sorry for the fish because he had had nothing to eat for two days and two nights. The old man felt his lack of sleep was dangerous. He hooked a dolphin. It was not good to eat raw. The old man killed the fish with his harpoon line. Next he had the slave work of cutting up the fish and hauling the fish to do.A Mako shark swam on the same course as the great fish and the skiff. The old man killed the shark. The shark, dead, sank with the harpoon and the forty pounds of fish it had taken. Other sharks attacked the fish until the fish was a skeleton when Santiago arrived at the harbor. The old man, Santiago, was joined by the boy, Manolin, who told him he would not leave him again, whatever his family commanded. Manolin said the two would fish together."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought that it was a very good book. The only reason I did not like the book was because the boys parents did not let the boy go. In the first couple of pages I did not get it but after a while it got clear to me.

Santiago has such bad luck that he hasn't even caught a fish in over 80 days. There was a boy he had helping him for a while, but due to the conditions, the old man must go out on his own. So for 80 days, the old man has not caught a fish, until finally he spots a huge Marlin. He uses a make-shift fishing line to hook the Marlin. He struggles with it and it pulls him out to sea. The problem is that his fish is swimming right into a school of sharks that could rip the marlin off of the hook and consume it for themselves, destroying the old man's hopes and dreams. Santiago, has to struggle with starvation, and dehydration as he fights for his life going after this fish. Will Santiago ever reel in his fish?, or will the sharks ruin his chances of making his life a little easier? You will have to read the book to find out. I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This story is an adventure story that happens to end tragically, but it is more than that. It is also written in a deceivingly simple style, but the novel itself is as near perfection as any. On a deeper level the book is a fable of the unconquerable spirit of man, and it is also a religious parable that utilizes Christian symbols and metaphors. The book has only two characters - Santiago, a Cuban fisherman and Manolin, a young Cuban boy devoted to Santiago. Hemingway's realism is very strong in this book, and his pragmatic view of life comes through loud and clear. It's not a very long book, but it is a masterpiece. I also saw Spencer Tracy in the film adaptation of this book, and I thought that movie captured the essence of Hemingway's genius."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture","review":"Before I read The Trouble with Nature, I thought there was some evidence for a gay gene. I also thought that gender differences were \\"hardwired\\" in our basic biology and had their origins in human evolution. This engaging, myth-busting book shows what's wrong with these (and other) widespread ideas.High Points: I enjoyed the lively analysis of how biology gets (mis)used and (mis)understood in popular culture (TV, newspapers) -- and I especially learned from the section on anthropology, which shows that \\"human nature\\" comes in many varieties."},{"Title":"What's Happening To My Child: A Guide For Parents' Of Hair Pullers","review":"My daughter has trich and I searched for a book to help me deal with this. This book sounded like the best because it is written by a women with trich who is a mother of a child with trich. It sounded perfect. I paid for overnight shipping because I was frantic over the bald spots that were now forming on my beautiful girl's head. The day it arrived I read it cover to cover and have never been more frustrated! The beginning is very good. It gives an overview of trich. That's great, although I already knew most of that from doing online research. However, it is a great introduction for those who have yet to do the research. I kept waiting for a chapter on tips and techniques that help. There was a lot of talk about self esteem and compassionate parenting. In fact, the majority of the book talked about it. That's all fine and great...we should all be parenting that way...but it doesn't get my daughter's hand off of her head! I FINALLY get to where it sounds like the author is going to give advice, and her advice is to get a copy of someone else's book which has great tips on getting your child to stop pulling! WHAT??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I just paid 15 bucks for a book and another 15 for shipping only to be told to buy SOMEONE ELSE'S BOOK!!! What a rip-off. If I ever met the author I would ask for my money back.

This book is simple to read and understand and provides something those other books don't: In depth perspective from a trich survivor who also has kids with the disorder. It really helped me to understand how trich feels for my daughter and provided some great insights into parenting a child with trich. Cheryn Salazar mentions her own Chrisitanity once or twice, but I did not feel that she was pushing this as a solution as one reviewer did. This book does not get into detail about meds and behavioral therapy but it gave me great insight into what it feels like to have this disorder and I have not yet found that in any other book/article. I also think this would be a great book to give to friends/family members to help them understand trich in a comprehensive yet simple manner."},{"Title":"What's Happening To My Child: A Guide For Parents' Of Hair Pullers","review":"Cheryn writes this book from her heart. Having suffered from trichotillomania herself as a child and as an adult, and as a parent of a child with trich, she writes with passion, compassion, and first hand knowledge of what it is like to have this disorder. Having suffered in silence for years, she understands the isolation it can cause. And then to have her own children come up with the same disorder, she understands a parent's fears and frustrations. Written from the heart, this book is a must-read for any parent with a child suffering from trichotillomania, and good reading for anybody who either has, or know somebody who has trichotillomania."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"Most of these stories feature Poirot, but two, including the title story, are Parker Pyne stories not included in _Parker Pyne Investigates_. One Marple story and one story not affiliated with a series character are also included. Where a story has appeared elsewhere under an alternate title, the original title used in this book is given first.All of the Poirot stories have been adapted for TV with David Suchet. \\"In a Glass Darkly\\" was adapted separately as an episode of \\"Agatha Christie's Hour\\".\\"The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest\\"(also appears in somewhat altered form elsewhere as \\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest\\") (January, 1932) - The only Hastings-narrated story in this batch. The murderer apparently must have killed the victim during a party, hid his corpse in the chest, and calmly kept up appearances by dancing and playing poker without suspicious behaviour...\\"In a Glass Darkly\\" (1934) Supernatural tale, rather than a regular mystery; if you like it, try _The Golden Ball and Other Stories_. The unnamed narrator first visited Badgeworthy, the old home of his friends Neil and Alan Carslake, just before WWI. Even the Carslakes don't know the details of its ghost story. Then Narrator sees the reflection of a pretty girl being strangled by a man in another room - but there is no other room behind him, and the couple he saw are both alive and well: Sylvia Carslake and her fiance.\\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\" (June, 1935) - Amelia Barrowby, an elderly spinster, had written to engage Poirot in an undisclosed family matter, mentioning that she wished to avoid police investigation and scandal but not providing details. Poirot receives no reply, and learning of her death, sends a follow-up letter to Miss Barrowby's address to account for his showing up in person.\\"Problem at Sea (January, 1936, a.k.a. \\"Poirot and the Crime in Cabin 66\\", \\"The Quickness of the Hand\\") - Poirot took the sea route to Alexandria on this, his first trip to Egypt. He's recovered enough from seasickness to take an interest in his fellow-passengers, especially one distinguished-looking man; for some reason, nothing his wife says or does seems to annoy him.Colonel Clapperton isn't a 'real' colonel; according to rumor, he was a music-hall performer who wound up in Lady Carrington's hospital twenty years ago in WWI, married her, and used her influence to get his colonelcy and a soft job. (He slips at one point and displays a few card tricks, explaining why he won't play bridge.) She's jealous, so it's unusual when she lets him go ashore in Alexandria without her, although typical of her high-handedness that she wouldn't let him into the cabin for a guidebook. But when he returned, she was dead in the locked cabin; apparently armed robbery.\\"Problem at Pollensa Bay\\" (1936) - Seeing Mrs. Chester and her son Basil as fellow guests in Majorca, Pyne reacts like a hunted animal when he sees her looking worried and reading an English newspaper. (So many people he meets abroad have read his advertisement and messed up his holidays - see _Parker Pyne Investigates_). Alas, someone gives him away. Mrs. Chester has had Basil tied to her apron strings, and engages Pyne with an eye toward detaching Basil from his unsuitable fiancee Betty.Pyne's business, though, is making people happy, rather than necessarily doing what they *say* they want, so he checks out Betty and Basil with some interesting compatibility tests, as well as imparting some wisdom to Mrs. Chester about how nobody's life can be ruined except by themselves, with particular reference to her *own* life. Then Basil gets involved with a REALLY exotic girl, and Pyne gets still more instructions.\\"Yellow Iris\\" a.k.a. \\"Hercule Poirot and the Sixth Chair\\" (January, 1937) - The stage setting strongly resembles that of the Colonel Race novel _Remembered Death_, but this is not the same story, so don't be fooled into thinking you know who did it or why based on the similarity.\\"The Dream\\", a.k.a. \\"The Three Strange Points\\" (1937) - Poirot is summoned to the home of eccentric millionaire Benedict Farley, who has a trophy wife and a daughter he's pressuring to marry money rather than the man she wants. Upon arriving at Farley's home, Poirot notices several things that don't make sense (see if you can spot all the 'what's wrong with this picture' items), even before hearing the problem. The client (having rejected the opinions of several doctors on the subject) has had a recurring dream of shooting himself when he isn't suicidal, and fears that somebody may be engaged in an elaborate scheme to kill him. Naturally, when he's found shot dead soon after Poirot's visit, Poirot gets involved in the investigation.\\"Miss Marple Tells a Story\\" (1939) Locked-room mystery. Unfortunately, Jane Marple is narrating this story *to Raymond West* and his wife, so she begins by laying on the fluffy-headed aunt pose, but eventually lets her narrative smooth out. Old Mr. Petherick, her solicitor, brought along another client, Mr. Rhodes, to consult her. Rhodes expected to be arrested for the murder of his wife, and his trial counsel is only concerned with gettng a reasonable doubt in court. Petherick, however, doesn't think this is the best approach, and comes to his old friend to try to work out what actually happened. Mr. Rhodes appears to be the only person with both motive and opportunity, and while his trial counsel plans to suggest Mrs. Rhodes committed suicide, neither Rhodes nor Petherick believes that will work, and Petherick doesn't believe Rhodes is guilty.\\"The Regatta Mystery\\" (1939) - Locked-room theft. Diamond merchant Isaac Pointz carries 'the Morning Star' as a lucky piece, and Eve Leathern, the 15-year-old daughter of a business acquaintance, casually challenges him that she could swipe it without getting caught. Alas, apparently somebody else figured out her perfect hiding place. Evan Llewellyn, Pointz's secretary, engages Parker Pyne to clear it up, since he's a prime suspect."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"THE REGATTA MYSTERY is a thoroughly satisfying collection of short stories by Agatha Christie, featuring her famous detectives M.

The tales either center around crimes or murder, and a few feature some supernatural elements, or seem to at least. \\"The Regatta Mystery\\" is a fast-paced read that offers readers some challenges, but not enough.One of the standout stories in the collection is \\"The Mystery of the Bagdad Chest\\" in which the body of a man is discovered inside a chest the morning after a party had been held in the same room. As he suspected his wife of having an affair with the man throwing the party, plenty of people have motive for murder, but only Hercule Poirot can discover the true culprit. Another Poirot standout is \\"The Dream\\", in which an odd and reclusive millionaire has a recurring dream in which he commits suicide. He calls in Poirot to help him figure out what to do, but Poirot is stumped. When the man turns up dead in exactly the same fashion in which he dreamed, Poirot knows that it was not suicide, but murder. Parker Pyne deals with cases of unhappiness - helping a mother prevent her son from marrying a young woman she dislikes and clearing a likely suspect of a jewel theft, while Miss Jane Marple relates a story that stumped the police about an innocent husband who is certainly going to be charged with his wife's murder.Many stories feature Christie's trademark twists in plotting, however, several are also predictable and easy to solve. Yet that does not detract from one's ability to enjoy them or to appreciate the genius behind them, especially since a few stories are truly mind boggling. Those are ones that only a genius like Hercule Poirot could figure out and that the queen of mystery could write."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"I love Hercule Poirot! He is the most complex detective. Everyone else is utterly baffled and M. Poirot has everything figured out in his &quot;little grey cells&quot;, and who could forget about Miss Marple? She is the queen of mystery and Hercule Poirot is the king! If these two were to work together then no evil mastermind could win. Miss Marple is as great as Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax.

I loved when Mr. Parker Pyne found who stole the diamond. He is ranked with Agatha Christie's most demanding detectives in this book and he deserves it! Of course, Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, the most demanding detectives, are up to their usual perfection, solving murders and other such things.The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories is well worth the cost."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"This is a collection of some very short mystery stories. They are generally murder mysteries, and the short story format prevents Christie from employing too much misdirection. Generally, she sets up the mystery, gives a clue or two, and announces the killer (or jewel thief, or matchmaker, etc.). Some of the results are silly, but they generally seem like fair solutions. This collection is probably most valuable for Christie fans (especially those who like Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, and Mr. Parker Pyle), but I was amused without being a real fan. If nothing else, this book presents some charmingly unapologetic classism that makes for an interesting historical snapshot (one mystery hinges on the fact that of course everyone has a maid, and of course no one notices any of their features unless they're especially attractive - not the story someone could write in 2010). This may be a good book to give young readers as an introduction into Agatha Christie and the idea of murder mysteries before American pulp fiction changed the genre."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"This is a book for those fans of Agatha Christie and her cast of detectives, Pyne, Poirot and Marple. Since another reviewer of this book has written an excellent and thorough review of each of the nine short stories in this book, I will simply state that I found the short stories, which were originally published between 1932 and 1939, to be truly entertaining. Every reader will find the type that they prefer, but there is really something here for all of those who like a short and intense read. I have come to appreciate the form of the short story due to the necessary requirement to convey so much in succinct and descriptive ways. Dame Agatha was extraordinarily adept in this literary form. Pick it up, set it down, pick it up, again. Short and sweet...gotta love it."},{"Title":"The Regatta Mystery","review":"While I prefer Agatha Christie's longer works, it's sometimes nice just have a sampling. My favorite of the short stories are the ones with Parker Pyne who in one story reluctantly admits that his first name is Christopher. Pyne is the opposite of fastidious and sometimes pompus M.

What did I like about it? I liked the tension between the heathen and christian beliefs. I liked that the characters were still at the crossroads there--unable to commit totally to one or the other belief. Most of all I like the characterization of Leif Eriksson. For the most part, we find him such an heroic figure. Elphistone shows him as rather conniving and not entirely the prince charming we are accustomed to seeing. In \\"The Sea Road,\\" he's good old Erik the Red's son, only a bit away from dad's violence.I'm not sure how accurate some of the ambiance is. I don't think the Greenlanders were able to keep chickens, and the ponies? Maybe only early on. But hey, this is a fun read. Wish I could have gotten it on Kindle thoughKindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)."},{"Title":"The Sea Road","review":"This book was beautifully written and the images floated inside my head as I was reading this book."},{"Title":"The Sea Road","review":"If you're looking for historical novels of the Viking Era that emphasize the rough aspects of Norse life (not disputing that the Vikings were a tough bunch) and are filled with epic battles and constant fighting, this book is not for you (I'd suggest you look towards something like Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales). However, if you've read those types of books are are interested in something a bit more cerebral, then this book is an excellent choice, albeit one that does take time to get moving.The writing style for the book is unusual, in that it is told almost completely in the first person, as the main character relates the story of her life (and in particular, her voyage to Vinland) to a monk in Rome. The book does take its time developing the storyline, but it then envelopes the reader in the tale of Iceland/Greenland/Vinland.Elphinstone is strong on nuances and atmospherics; it's most noticeable during the parts where she shifts from first person to third person to describe near-supernatural events that may or may not actually be occurring. She also has a good eye for detail, and captures many of the subtleties of Norse culture (for example, how the main character is impressed when her husband-to-be shows her linen and colored cloth when all she's ever known is undyed wool).Again, if you're looking for a rip-roaring tale of adventuring warriors, this isn't the book. But if you're looking for a story that will leave you wishing there was a sequel (there isn't) and that you could meet the characters in the real world, this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"The Sea Road","review":"Sophmoric and silly, it still might be a good second-choice for a teen book club. PG-13-rated sex pops up now and again, but no bad language and little violence besides an un-Viking-like punch or two. (In the Sagas guys carry axes and misunderstandings lead to body parts flying off.) Some of the best stories of the original get muddled or left out, so if you skim the dull parts, the book's not very long. For more advanced readers, I'd recommend the Sagas themselves."},{"Title":"Writers in Revolt","review":"Expatriate authors on the Costa Blanca set up the Left Bank website to publish books on the Internet and print-on-demand.

I was too embarassed to buy it that day, but I returned a few weeks later and decided to go for it.Reading it cover to cover doesn't take very long, which in some ways is good, and in others is bad. I like the fact that it describes (and sometimes there's a picture to go with it!) several non-traditional positions, what kind of person it is good for, and what it all does.I did not, however, find the \\"orgasm-ing together\\" section very informative, mostly because I didn't like the idea of different stages. Not everybody has a partner they can see frequently and can therefore test that method out. There's got to be a better way than saying, \\"I'm level 8! How about you, darling?!\\" Something like that totally kills the mood, so I was disappointed that the ONE part of the book that I REALLY wanted to learn more about wasn't very thorough.It's an enjoyable read; one that I'll lend to friends or have a partner read ;)"},{"Title":"The Good Orgasm Guide: All a Girl Needs for a Great Time","review":"After the great reviews on here and other places I purchased this book. I was more than disappointed. I read the whole thing in one sitting (less than an hour) and there was absolutely no advise given that hadn't been given before in even such places as Glamour or Cosmopolitan magazine. In addition the British wording of much of the book makes it a tad awkward for the average American reader. Add to that blatant grammatical issues and mispelled words, and you end up with a book that not only isn't giving you new information, but also which is frustrating just to read.Honestly the premise of this book is that if you haven't had an orgasm then apparently you aren't psyching yourself up enough for it. Her approach is far too simplistic, her descriptions are lacking any actual guidance (basically all she says is, do what feels good until you come, umm duh!), and the whole book just was overall disappointing. There are far better books that this out there. If you are just looking to become even more orgasmic than you already are, this might help you, but if you've never this is not the place to look for help."},{"Title":"Days of Infamy: Macarthur, Roosevelt, Churchill-The Shocking Truth Revealed : How Their Secret Deals and Strategic Blunders Caused Disasters at Pear Harbor and the Philippines","review":"There are few events that prompt as much spontaneous discussions regarding the possibility of conspiracy and guilty prior knowledge as those involving the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Indeed, there are a whole catalogue of titles dealing with the possibilities, the associated issues, and with the substance of arguments surrounding all of the varied possibilities, which seem to have endless permutations and countless variations. So too here in British author John Costello's excellent exposition, the fascinating world of this \\"what did the President know, and when did he know it\\" whodunit is deftly explored by a virtual master of the genre. Also the author of such notable titles as \\"The Pacific War\\" and \\"And I was There\\", Costello addresses himself to a welter of issues and conditions that paint an indelible picture of what he conceives to be the actual circumstances surrounding the Japanese attack.Indeed, the author not only asks a number of interesting rhetorical questions regarding the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor itself, but also delves into the shocking related attack on the American forces in the Philippines later the same day. Why, he asks, given his being warned so far in advance, did General Douglas MacArthur allow the Japanese forces to destroy the greatest single concentration of American air power in the Pacific region some nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor? And, in answering the question by way of detailing the complex series of miscommunications and fumbles surrounding MacArthur's mishandling of the circumstances, the author also raises the issue of MacArthur's unlikely escape from the blame game following in the aftermath of the attacks. Seems that those in power in Washington were so intimidated by MacArthur's positive image and reputation among the press that they dare not attack him openly by court marshalling or reprimanding him. In essence, his political connections saved him. Instead, after ordering MacArthur off the island, ostensibly to take command of all the Pacific forces regrouping in Australia, Roosevelt rewarded the general with the Congressional Medal Of Honor.Also discussed here is the half million dollar payoff that the Philippine Government gave to MacArthur as he departed the islands, as is the desire of the Philippine government to try to maintain their neutrality, an exercise in futility that may have played fatefully into the hands of the Japanese, and which the author suggests may have influenced MacArthur in his decision not to attack or save the pacific-based American planes under his command. Yet the book spends much more energy and time covering the ways in which the diplomatic and military miscalculations on the part of both Roosevelt and Churchill played almost perfectly into the hands of the Japanese. Yet it was, according to Costello, more the loss of the Pacific air power rather than the losses at Pearl Harbor that so severely limited and hampered American efforts to stem the rising tide of Japanese hegemony over the Far East in 1942.The author writes with considerable skill in arguing that it was the combined blunders, bungling, and malfeasance on the part of Roosevelt, Churchill and MacArthur that left the western world in such mortal danger at the end of 1941. For one thing, Roosevelt had committed the United States to a secret agreement with the British to aid in the defense of the British empire's Far Eastern reaches, a pact that was likely both illegal and unconstitutional. For another, the decision to move the bulk of MacArthur's army forces 5,000 miles west of Hawaii to the Philippines left Hawaii weak and overexposed to a potential Japanese attack. Finally, the combined neglect of countless encrypted messages concerning the details of the attack as well as MacArthur's failure to mount a preemptive air attack despite being directly ordered to do so doomed the American hopes for any quick resolution to the conflict once it had started. In sum, it was the colossal lack of good leadership that led us into the disaster of December 7, 1941, and in spite of the fact that all three men are held in high regard and remembered warmly, they were largely responsible for the American failure to prevent the disaster at Pearl Harbor in a day of infamy. This is an interesting book and a worthwhile read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Days of Infamy: Macarthur, Roosevelt, Churchill-The Shocking Truth Revealed : How Their Secret Deals and Strategic Blunders Caused Disasters at Pear Harbor and the Philippines","review":"Days of Infamy is a masterpiece. As a serious research book, it is incomparable. Just about every assertion is thoroughly documented with American, British, Japanese, German and even some Dutch and Soviet sources. John Costello also thoroughly comments on the major previous efforts to explain the surprises at the start of Pacific War. He clearly and thoroughly points out what the previous investigations have gotten right or wrong. Mostly, they have narrowly focused on just the Pearl Harbor attack, and the communications between the White House, Departments of Army and Navy in Washington, and Hawaiian Army and Navy commanders. This book takes the reader to all the participants, and especially the British, who had an enormous but unpublicized influence on American plans before the war.As a popular historical book, Days of Infamy is well-written and engages the reader very well. Since John Costello is a journalist and a TV producer, rather than a university professor, he lays this book out as a story, not as a dry research paper. He vividly describes the events of the spring, summer, fall and winter of 1941, the personalities involved, their conflicts, egos, fears, and desires. He also vividly describes the strategic and tactical plans of all sides, and where they went wrong.Overall, I believe this book is excellent. Unlike many previous efforts, it goes beyond just Pearl Harbor to explore the full scope of American and British efforts in the Pacific in 1941. This shows that today we, as a society, are getting very close to understanding what actually happened during those days in 1941. And the more we understand the more ugly it looks. It's 60 years late, but at least we can try to learn from this experience."},{"Title":"Days of Infamy: Macarthur, Roosevelt, Churchill-The Shocking Truth Revealed : How Their Secret Deals and Strategic Blunders Caused Disasters at Pear Harbor and the Philippines","review":"Days of Infamy by John CostelloThis book makes one very angry at the incompetence of our military commanders at the beginning of WWII. The 2 goats of Pearl Harbor, Adm Kimmel and Gen Short, seem very competent compared to Marshall, MacArthur, Stark, King,Turner, and others.The American plan assumed that the Japs would attack the Philippines first. To defend it, Roosevelt pulled MacArthur out of retirement in July 1941 and sent him there. In addition, he sent thousands of troops to help train the Filipinos, plus most of our latest bombers, the B-17, and many of our latest fighter aircraft, plus a potent Navy force. Marshall at the time said that reinforcing the Philippines was a mistake of the first magnitude. They allocated 200 planes to destroy 164 targets. In Europe, the allocated 8,000 planes to destroy an equal number of German targets. Japs and Jap targets were inferior, so needed fewer planes. MacArthur did not believe the Japs could fly planes due to their slanty eyes. Neither did the Brits, who would lose 2 of their battleships to Jap planes a couple of days later.Ath the time of the Pearl Harbor attack MacArthur was called and had an 8 hour warning before the Japs attacked. They did the same thing in the Philippines that happened at Pearl. Complete surprise, in spite of the warning. This was a mystery until the early 1990's when records came unsealed that revealed that MacArthur had received $640,000 from the Philippine president to not attack the Japs.(The plan was to have the B-17's MacArthur had to attack the Japs at Formosa and knock out their air force.) Had MacArthur followed orders, he would have done just that, as the Japs were grounded by fog.The Army Air chief, Breteron pleaded with Mac to let him attack, but Mac refused.In January, when Mac and his men got paid FDR himself had to approve the payment, as it was illegal for a military person to be paid by another government. Mac got500.000 of the $640,000. Sutherland and others got the rest.Mac also had the machine that decoded the Jap purple code, unlike the folks at Pearl Harbor, so he had the same intelligence as Washington.The Brits were supposed to get some B-17's but in an exchange of an secret agreement that we would use them to bomb the Japs at Malaya when war came, they let us keep them. Mac got them, and the Japs destroyed them. Stimson and the air generals told FDR that air power alone could beat the Japs.To keep Kimmel up to date at Pearl, Adm Stark in Washington mailed him letters. Kimmel was never told about the Majic machine or the intercepts.If operations started in the Philippines, and fuel was needed, this would create a fuel crisis in the U.S. as there was a lack of tankers to transport oil.Adm Layton, an intelligence officer at the time thinks Kimmel would have deduced the Pearl Harbor target if he had the Majic machine. Adm Pye thought that the Japs would not attack Pearl either. Adm Kelly Turner in Washington was convinced the Japs were going to invade Siberia. Facts could not disabuse him of this opinion.On Dec 5, Col Sadtler of the Army signal corps drafted a memo for Gen Short that hostilities were imminent. Gen Gerow did not allow the memo to go forward, saying Short had been warned enough.On Sat night Dec 6, Bratton asked Marshall to issue a war alert, and Marshall refused.The book is a listing of error after error made by our military as well as civilian chiefs. Kimmel and Short got sacked, MacArthur got the Medal of Honor, and the incompetents in Washington got promoted.Adm Pye took over from Kimmel. Kimmel had sent a force to reinforce Wake Island, which was under attack. Pye recalled it. He too was sacked. We could have defended Wake and been in a much better position in the Pacific, if Kimmel had been left in charge.The book leaves one gnashing his teeth in frustration reading this."},{"Title":"Days of Infamy: Macarthur, Roosevelt, Churchill-The Shocking Truth Revealed : How Their Secret Deals and Strategic Blunders Caused Disasters at Pear Harbor and the Philippines","review":"This is a best-selling book, by a best-selling British author, concerning the destruction of the greatest concentration of Air power in the Pacific, under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, on the ground, in the Philipines, a full ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as some information on the politics surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbor. A total failure on the part of MacArthur.Having just read Day of Deceit, by Robert Stinnett, with elaborate, detailed information demonstrating that Franklin Roosevelt indeed indubitably knew, in advance, of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor in an air strike on December 7th, 1941, and withheld that information from the commanders on the spot, Admiral Kimmel and Lt. General Short, both of whom FDR then demoted in disgrace, as \\"patsies,\\" for \\"dereliction of duty,\\" I am underwhelmed by Costello's book, Days of Infamy. It does, however, bring out some facts about General MacArthur's failures to adequately prepare his command for the impending certain attack by the Japanese forces, to wit: instantly sending a bombing raid against the Japanese air bases on Formosa (Taiwan), which his orders required of him, or at the very least moving the B-17s in question out of harm's way--out of range of Japanese Formosa based bombers, by sending them further South, as he could have done. Instead, he sat on his hands.With the exception of General MacArthur, the motivation for President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's blunders are quite understandable: Both men were faced with almost insurmountable dilemmas. It was necessary for Churchill to drag America into the war with Germany, kicking and screaming if necessary. It was a matter of survival for Great Britain, who was the lonely combatant for freedom left on the European continent. For FDR, faced with isolationist fervor among his constituency, but foresighted enough to know the stakes involved, it was necessary to get a cause celebre to inflame the American people into a warlike mood. The ploy succeeded, even though it involved chicanery, double dealing, lying to his people, and many American deaths at Pearl Harbor.Although the facts are seemingly ugly, and American and British icons reputations suffer as a result, Churchill and FDR peformed to the best of their abilities to save their nations. MacArthur's motives and judgments are less justifiable and bear scrutiny less well. For those who knew him best, MacArthur was a walking, talking egomaniac who made monumental blunders with little to recommend his decisions.I served under him in Japan during the Korean war, and observed him in his role as the defacto Emperor of Japan. Harry Truman had him pegged, accurately in my opinion. He would have dome better on the stage than in a military career.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)"},{"Title":"Days of Infamy: Macarthur, Roosevelt, Churchill-The Shocking Truth Revealed : How Their Secret Deals and Strategic Blunders Caused Disasters at Pear Harbor and the Philippines","review":"This book suggests, and convincingly, that MacArthur and Churchill and FDR engaged in treasonable, nefarious, and unconstitutional activities. MacArthurs intentional delay to implement war plans with influence from Phillipine authorities, Churchill's withholding of information and history manipulations, and FDR's unconstitutional guarantees to foreign nations in event of war are just some of the conclusions of this book. The first half of this book is the most interesting, especially the suggestion of MacArthur delaying action and leaving his B17 fleet exposed to Japenese air attack. Believeable but sometimes almost over the top."},{"Title":"Advanced Fun With Fundamentals (First Division Band Course, Drums)","review":"This is a great book for the beginning cornet or trumpet player. It was written by Bill Laas who was my band director over forty years ago. He was a great guy. I played baritone back then and recently decided to teach myself to play the trumpet. This book is perfect for me. I saw his widow shortly after receiving the book and it was heart-warming to her to see a copy of it and that someone remembered her husband fondly.It was written in 1966. It may not be glossy and slick. It doesn't not have a CD accompanying it. But \\"new\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"better\\". If you are looking for a book that will help you master the basics, this is a valuable resource.There are scales and simple melodies to practice and there are more complicated drills to master technique."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"C.J.J. Berry is a legend to winemaking hobbiests worldwide as the man who had a winemaking recipe for just about any ingredient. For literally tens of thousands of home winemakers, this is the only reference book they ever had or needed.When it first appeared, the layout of &quot;First Steps in Winemaking&quot; was quite unique. After an admirable discussion of the basic principles of home winemaking, Berry then presented his recipes on the basis of the month in which the principal ingredients are readily available at market or are typically harvested in the British home garden. There are three things wrong with this format.Firstly, citing harvest months for various ingredients geographically limits the accuracy of the format. Harvest times for any crop will vary greatly around the world, but they can differ from Britain's calendar by six months for gardeners in, say, Australia. Berry's treatment works fine in the British Isles and many other places, but certainly this is not universally so. In his later books, Berry abandoned the calendar-month format of &quot;First Steps....&quot;Secondly, at least in developed countries, there is no longer a need to be tied to calendar-month availability of ingredients. Advances in cargo transport and refrigeration over the past 50 years have made dependency on local crops a thing of the past. Almost any ingredient can be found in the modern supermarket or produce center at any time.Thirdly, Berry's presentation of recipes by month results in dependence on the index in order to find recipes for a particular ingredient. This is perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the book's layout. An alphabetical listing of recipes, as he used in subsequent books, would have been more convenient.In defense of the author, however, I must point out that Berry never anticipated his book would have worldwide appeal. Nor, it would seem, that it would remain popular for so long. Certainly he would not have quoted prices for ingredients and supplies had he suspected as much.Are these shortcomings fatal? Not in the least! This is still the classic reference to the subject and ought to be in every winemaker's library. Indeed, if you could only buy one book on the subject, only Terry Garey's &quot;The Joy of Home Winemaking&quot; could challenge &quot;First Steps....&quot; to a coin toss.Buy it. Read it. Make wine. You'll love yourself for it."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"The book is essentially divided into two sections. The first covers the basic principles of wine making: the science behind it, the key ingredients, and the necessary tools and techniques. The second half is a pretty substantial list of recipes, concentrating heavily on country wines.Sadly, the coverage of the principles and techniques was too brief, particularly with regard to timing. I am still at a bit of a loss as to how long one should allow the aerobic ferment to take place, how long for the anaerobic format and so on. I think I'll be getting another book that focuses more on technique before I make my first attempt."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"This book has many, many recipes that can inspire even the most seasoned winemaker, yet it is simple enough for the beginner. A must-have, in my opinion."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"This is the third copy of this book I have purchased. I gave the first one away. Ordered another for a friend and hope I can hold on to this copy for a while. I find this the best and easiest to follow and have made multible wines with these receipes. I highly recommend the book - especially the Mead."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"I've been making wine at home successfully for several years now from recipes but have never had a How To book. Berry's guide is so useful and helpful even though one might skip over some of the more elemental bits. Even if you think you know what you're doing, it's good to have the whole process covered fully step by step. Also, his charming English manner makes for fun reading. Reading this book will make you feel like you've been taught by a tweedy old major in his shed in the English countryside. Also lots of recipes for things I'd never even considered fermenting according to a yearly month by month calendar which should appeal to people interested in a seasonal, locavore type lifestyle.

However, if you really want a proper education on the subject, look elsewhere. Some might argue that this is merely a \\"starting point\\", but I'd rather not have the rudiments glazed over. Check out \\"The way to make wine\\" if you are considering making wine from grapes or pressed juice. I have only just started it, but it is a much more informative, well written book."},{"Title":"First Steps in Winemaking","review":"This book is still one of the best for the beginner and advanced winemaker.

I have bought three for friends."},{"Title":"The Man of the Forest","review":"I have only just started to read Zane Grey novels and I am very excited that I discovered this author. I live in Arizona and have explored many of the settings for his stories and with his detailed descriptions I can easily imagine that I am back in these scenes. In The Man of the Forest he has character development. He has many different characters in this story from the mountain man to the Eastern heiress and her little sister to the Morman cowboys to the Mexican shepherds and sleazy villains. And, his descriptions and development do not end at landscapes and characters but to action as well. It just takes your breath away when the heiress is being chased through the high desert and forest for 3 days in a stage coach and then on horse back. Also, the most amazing description that I can recall ever reading was the grizzly bear hunt. Both of these are \\"hair raising\\" darn right adventure. I truly believe that these novels should be resurrected and marketed for today's audience, but I also think that TV westerns like Bonanza and Gunsmoke should return as well. This novel is considered Zane Grey's fifth best novel of the over 55 novels he wrote by the Zane Grey's West Society and was written about 10 years into his career as a writer. I am looking forward to reading first through fourth."},{"Title":"Discourses on Violence: Conflict Analysis Reconsidered","review":"&quot;Discourses on Violence&quot; is presents a wholly different andcompelling theory to explain and understand the institutionof war as a social phenomenon. Drawing heavily from emergingsociological and post-structuralist schools, Jabri offers whatis destined to become a foundational text explaining thethe recurrence of war and violence in society today. The basisof the argument is that the recurrence of war over time is theresult of certain discursive and institutional continuitiesthat serve to legitimate it's use by political elites as aninstrument of policy. The work logically and rationally developsits theoretical concepts ontologically from the emergingsociological work of Giddens, progressing to the significanceof that work in the International environment. Jabri departssignificantly from structuralist thought, developing what iscalled structuration theory, which postulates that while actorsare constrained by the structure(political, social, economic, military) in which they operate, they also are a constitutivepart of it, so that actor and structure are mutually constitutive.This is significant departure from structuralist thought sinceit allows that since structure and actor are mutually constitutive,actors can act to change the structure in which they operate. It isthis factor that enables the actor(s) to emancipate themselvesfrom structure and enables the possibility of the creationof discourses on peace, which could serve to institutionalizean environment of peace, vice war, as a social continuity."},{"Title":"Discourses on Violence: Conflict Analysis Reconsidered","review":"If you are versed in postmodern theory and call yourself a &quot;Foucault Junkie&quot; as does V. Jabri, you will undoubtedly love this book. If you are a more typical human being who does not get off on clever semiotic turns of phrase and postmodern word play, you will hate this book. Just read the review by &quot;A Reader&quot; - if it makes sense to you and gets you excited, buy the book. If you have no idea what they are talking about, avoid this book like the Black Plague - it is more of the same."},{"Title":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Official Strategy Guide","review":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is probably the best fighting game out there. However, when I bought the guide, I realized that it was exactly the same info that could be found in the character's Konquest mode, and by pausing any game and bringing up the character's moves. The guide only adds a few combos, and it never covers any character's fighting styles very well.For instance, looking at Johnny Cage, even though it says \\"he works very well in all of his fighting styles,\\" they only go into small detail on Jeet Kune Do. With Shang Tsung, they only really explain two of his fighting styles. No matter the character, the guide actually tells the player to stay in one fighting style! This is extremely boring, and a bad idea, considering the fact that each style has some merit. It's obvious when you read it that the author didn't spend a whole lot of time with most of the characters. After reading storylines like Johnny Cage's, which explains he never died in the MK storyline, only in one of his movies (this was done to quiet some fan-boys [mad] that he was still around. Next up should be explaining to them that Scorpion's been dead in every game...), the author still says something about him being ressurrected (for this game), again. This is one of the many, many over-sights in the guide, and it shows the author's over-looking of details.When you play MK:DA, each character has three different fighting styles, usually 2 hand-to-hand styles and one weapon style. The fun is switching between them to confuse your opponent, and accessing the different moves in each style. Where this guide fails is describing each style's strengths and weaknesses. The guide only touches on select styles, and usually doesn't give enough info on these. If the guide would've had a few more pages per character, this might have fixed the problem. As it stands, the guide is almost useless. It promises on the back to reveal \\"Krypt secrets,\\" but no, you have to buy a seperate, \\"Krypt Pocket Kodes\\" book to find out what's in the Krypt--the book doesn't even touch on it, therefore lying to the potential customer. (The Krypt is a huge \\"graveyard\\" which allows a player to sapend earning \\"Koins\\" from battle on the 675 or so \\"koffins\\" in the game, which contain secrets like alternate costumes, hidden characters like Kitana and Reptile, etc.)After all is said and done, this guide doesn't really cover anything that isn't already available in the game, but it does make this info readily available. For hardcore MK fans, or people who hate pausing the game constantly only, otherwise it's pretty worthless."},{"Title":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Official Strategy Guide","review":"The book showed up in good condition.. a bit of bending but whatever the book is older then most people I know that play the game.. it was over all perfect for what I used it for.. and It shipped on perfect TIME..."},{"Title":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Official Strategy Guide","review":"This guide is crammed full of everything you need.True, the game is pretty much self-explanitory, but the guide is definitely still worthwhile (not to mention the artwork).

Being floated in body-warm water by a practitioner who moves you and allows your body to painlessly move, has turned my rock-hard body and shouting pain receptors way down in an accumulatively more bearable life (body, mind &amp; spirit) This book makes sense, is intuitively and therapeutically meshed, admirably presented, and invaluable to anyone in skin, in my opinion (and in experiencing bi-weekly sessions in the past 11 months). Most cities have warm pools through the Easter Seals' pools where the book's teachings can be tried. Call them! Get this book! Give this book away and get more, if you have ever benefitted from body work or not. In '87 my body began to hurt. The neck to the shoulders to the arms and hands, then the whole back and finallly, everywhere. Over time. I have now been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, chronic fatigue immune-deficiency syndrome (CFIDS), irritable bowel syndrome and many more. I've tried anything and everything, from Shiatsu massage, cranial-sacral therapy, myofascial release to faith- healing and Native-American healing ceremonies. Through all, pain continued almost unabated until Watsu. I still need pain meds because the damage is so vast, but after giving up on life, my husband and I leave for winter &amp; spring in Belize, towing our sailboat, in two days.

But let me say that I was profoundly moved with my experience with Watsu, and intend to become certified within the first half of 2005 and add it as a modality to my practice. I don't cry easily, but I had tears of joy four different times on my drive home while processing my experience in the water.I learned through the grapevine that Harold Dull used to hang out with the beat poets. After reading his book, which is in its third edition celebrating 25 years of existence, the poet side of Mr. Dull became crystal clear to me. Harold not only created one of the most exciting and therapeutic forms of bodywork of our times, but also is a gifted author, poet, and self-publisher. Harold Dull is truly a renaissance man and a gift to our planet. In his 60s and entirely computer literate, he is even the webmaster for WABA, the nonprofit group that trains Watsu practitioners!The book is not only full of the techniques and keys to the work, but a thing of beauty to behold and look at. It has time-lapse, digitally overlapped pictures, similar to the stop-motion chronological movement pictures used during the last Olympics. A jewel! I treasure my autographed copy from Mr. Dull!"},{"Title":"Roadside Geology Of Northern California -","review":"Alt and Hyndman provide an interesting summary of rock types encountered on a good variety of Northern CA highways. In plain language, they partially unravel the complicated, contorted geology of northern CA as seen through the roadcuts and park drives. This book's biggest deficiency, compared to others in the Roadside Geology series, is its failure to provide specific names and formation periods for many roadside rock layers mentioned, especially in the Sierras, Klamaths and Modoc Plateau. This info is a valuable time-saver for an amateur rockhound. For numerous excellent examples of the naming and dating I am talking about, read Roadside Geology of Texas by Darwin Spearing. Despite this important flaw (for the rockhound who catalogs his specimens), I recommend this book for anyone interested in geology who will be travelling across northern CA."},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus in Your Life","review":"Rev. Anderson has an excellent grasp of relational Christology and writes in a straight forward manner with great clarity and humor. Her personal story of coming to faith is captivating and offers encouragement to those who struggle with questions such as: Who is this Jesus? What does he mean to me? Does he make any difference in my life? She nailed it down when she wrote:&quot;Following Jesus is a radical step. It is not to be religious: it is to have a relationship with a person, who, in fact, calls into question everything about our lives and moves us in directions that go against all that the world thinks is important.&quot; Well done. She answers the question as to who Jesus is to her, details her shocking experience of being used by God for the physical healing of another and invites us into relationship with God that will indeed change everything. An excellent book, easy to read, hope filled and life changing. I will read anything that this author writes."},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus in Your Life","review":"While the style is a bit too oral and loose for 5 stars, this easy-to-read, short book gives a very down to earth introduction to what it really means to be a Christian. Personal stories bring theology out of the clouds and into real daily life; I especially admire the author's willingness to reveal her own weaknesses as well as how knowing Jesus has affected them. She never, before or after her conversion, comes off as a stained-glass, holier than thou person. Some of the images and illustrations she uses are uniquely helpful in bringing home what a Christian doctrine actually means to us. You will get right to the heart of Christianity by reading and reflecting on this book, and you'll feel able to make an intelligent choice about your faith."},{"Title":"Covering the Body: The Kennedy Assassination, the Media, and the Shaping of Collective Memory","review":"There is some very significant baby in this academese- obscurantist bathwater.Basically this is an instiutional approach to explaining why the media got it wrong. Does the author put it like this? Not exactly. The woman needs a job!She argues that the Kennedy Assasination took place at a key time for TV news; in 1963 the networks had just switched form a 15 minute to a half-hour broadcast. The assassination, she argues, made TV news. The later you get the more reporters and editors interjected what they were doing at the time; thier identities and the legitimacy of TV journalism itself had become married to a single bullet, even though it was much more of a shotgun wedding.Some of the narrative desriptions of individual reporters are priceless. Zelizer does a masterful job of capturing the chaos of the telphone truck, where there was only one phone. Sometimes these narratives of direct reporter experience seem to yearn for conclusions beyone those modest ones that the professor presents.Don't be put off by the cumbersome style of this book. It is worth reading twice. It goes far toward explaining why the Corporate Media have worked so dilligently to cast Warren Commission Sceptics in such a condescending light. Just so, those aristocratic flat-earthers!This book is simply too dangerous to be written clearly."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Ok, first, I agree that Steel's writing has severely gone down hill the past 5 or so years. I don't know what has happened to those great long books she used to write, such as Jewels, Thurston House or Daddy...books that carried you through almost the persons whole life and when you put it down, you felt accomplished, like you'd read a complete story. Her newer books aren't that. Moving on...I did enjoy this book a little more than some of her other newer books. It was a very quick read at 180 pages, which might have helped keep my interest. It could have been more like 160 if she had cut out all of the repetition. She kept repeating herself over and over and over...I don't understand why. It wasn't a long book, so it's not like we'd forget. She even had the same conversations with questions and answers repeated two or three times!Looking past that, the story itself was compelling. It was sad, but you wanted to keep reading to see what would happen. The ending was so predictable, I figured it out probably 50 pages in, but still was a good ending. It did bring out some emotion in me and kept my interest, so I would recommend this book, the story is good, just need to look past the writing at times."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I cannot believe that this book was allowed to go to print. As I read it, I was tempted to pull out my red pencil and edit as I went along. The repetition was more than I could bear and the writing was so elementary as to be insulting to the average reader. I can't believe that a writer with the kind of experience that Danielle Steel has doesn't even use quotation marks correctly. Unbelievable.The sad thing is, this could have been a powerful story. Ms. Steel lost her own son and certainly knows a mother's pain. That is where the problem lies. Her character Alice is strong and well developed. But no one else is.

The main character in the book has to deal with an internal struggle and realization in her life.In the story a teenager's life is changed forever and he will find out what work he has to accomplish in life. This realistic-fiction book makes you take a whole different outlook on life after death and the true meaning of family. I will always remember this book because it showed me that no matter happens in life the bond you have with loved ones is never broken.Some opinions that the author states in the book I definitely agree with. One opinion that is brought up is about high school and having to fit in and what you need to do so. Since I am a high school student I related quite easily and understood the situation to the greatest extent. The example in the story is that Johnny's girlfriend doesn't have enough money for a prom dress. Since it is primitive to have an elegant gown for the extravagant event Johnny uses all his money to buy his girlfriend a gown.This book affected me because it talked about communicating with others through different ways instead of just talking to them. The book has also given me ideas for my own writing piece and inspired me to expand my variety of writing. If you are looking for a book that relates to teenagers, dieing and about life and family, this book is definitely the right choice for you."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book i have ever read. Honestly, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the moving and emotional plot that Steel created in this novel, Johnny Angel. At the begining of the story it is learned that Johnny Peterson is an athletic, smart, well rounded highschool boy. Not to far into the story Johnny, his girlfriend, and a few friends are in a car accident. Not just any car accident, they were on their way to the prom, and Johnny was the driver. He is instantly killed and his whole family is devestated. This was the peak of my tears. Throughout the story, as a reader, I found myself laughing to the extreme, or crying to the extreme. This was a point where I was in tears. Now, Johnny's mother is left alone to deal with her 2nd child who is mute, her 3rd child who is dying for attention, and her alcoholic husband. As little time passes, Johnny's mother finds herself in the hospital because she has been starving herself. After a day of being in the hospital, she sees an Angel. She communicates with this Angel and realizes it is her beloved son, Johnny. He tells her that he is her Angel, and he is there to guide her and help her overcome her struggles. Johnny puts a lot of effort into bringing order back into everyones lives. He wants everyone to go about their lives and only remember the great memories of his life. However, he is having a hard time doing this, ecspecially while watching over his girlfriend. Danielle Steel does an amazing job showing the true reltionship that a mother and a son have, she illistrates the grieving and the healing process in such an understandable way, where you find yourself nodding and agreeing with the charcters emotions. Steel brings the reader a very emotional reading, which is why I say it is a book that women and girls will specifcally enjoy. Although it is not very realistic, the issues and relationships that are presented are very real. The emotions, the experiances and the morals are all very genuine and relatable. I really loved this book and think other girls my age will too."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"love all of Danielle Steels books. This one can be emotional, but kept me interested the whole way through."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"i love this book. it is spiritual and heartwarming.seems as if ms.steel tried to digest the loss of her own son (nick traina)by writing this one.couldn\`t put it down."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You can feel the pain of the loss of her son in this book, which makes it so real."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel is a wonderful and inspirational book. Johnny Angel is one of my favorite books, it tells you to keep going even through the tough times. This book is about a boy named Johnny that was in a car accident after his senior prom. He was in the car with his perfect girlfriend, and two of her friends, Johnny was bringing them home. When all of a sudden, another car came out of nowhere and hit Johnny's side of the car. Everyone in the car was injured, but Johnny was the only one that was pronounced dead. Everyone was very sad about Johnny's death. When one day his mother got deathly ill and was in the hospital. His mother would have dreams that she was in a room and was talking to her son. She didn't ever want to leave her dreams.But one night when they were talking and he said that the next time she would see him is when she woke up. Of course she didn't believe him so she tried to stay in her dream, but he forced her to wake up. But when she woke up, there he was, sitting at the end of her bed. It just so happens that Johnny had some unfinished buisness that had brought him back as an angel. We find out that only his mother, and later in the book his little mute brother could see him. Througout this book Johnny is helping everyone get through the tough times to move onto better things. If you like to read inspirational books I highly reccomend reading Johnny Angel by Danielle Steel."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"\\"Johnny Peterson was the valedictorian of the senior class, and the star of both the track and the football teams for the past four years. He and Becky Adams had been going out for four years.\\" He was the apple of his mother's eye, the love of Becky's life, and the ultimate role model for his younger siblings, Bobby and Charlotte. So when the unthinkable happened, they were all left depressed, helpless and in shock. Bobby had been killed by a drunk driver. His family was left broken. His mother was depressed and his fathers alcoholism had gotten worse. Bobby had been in a car accident previously and hadn't spoken in five years, and Charlotte craved for nothing more than her fathers acceptance. After his mother was sent to the hospital for being sick, Johnny suddenly appears at her bedside explaining \\"I'm coming back for a while, mom. But only to you.. I think this is kind of a special deal. Someone told me it happens to people who leave very suddenly, and need to tie up loose ends\\". Johnny puts his family back together, only showing himself to Bobby and his mother. He gets his little brother to talk, bringing the family closer together than they had been inyears.

He gets Becky a new boyfriend and helps her move on from him. He puts the lives of those he loved back together, and then leaves for good. If you enjoy a good family story and a tear jerker, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I had alot of fun reading this book. I had got this book from a friend and I started to read it and I loved it.When I started to read it was sad because something bad happened but I didn't cry.When I read this book, it had a twist and turns, sad things and things that you should not do but otherwise the book was good. If I rate this book to 1 it would get a 10 because it was the best book I'v ever read."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"My mom thought this was the best book and she said it would make me cry. Well, my mom is a smart woman and normally has good taste so I decided to give it a try. Halfway through the book I hated it and didn't want to read anymore. However, I'm not a quiter so I read it to the end and I'm glad I did. The ending was so wonderful I cried and laughed."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel is a conquering story how a family overcomes the death of their teenage son, that held them together. This story really makes you believe in angels, and how quickly something can happen to a love one, and how it affects your family. It also makes you think twice when you get in a car, will today be the day? This book is great for teenagers because it tells you the consequences while drinking and driving. This book is very realistic and life-affirming."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I told all my friends to read it. Any one who has ever lost a loved one knows how hard it is and to move on is even harder. Although this is fiction. I was touched by this book. This book is just another great one from Danielle Steele..."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel by Danielle Steel is an interesting story. A teenage son is killed by a drunk driver, leaving the family to deal with their situation. The father has a drinking problem and can't communicate with the daughter. There is a younger son who has his own problems.The teenage son comes back as an angel to help guide his family. It is especially touching that his mother can see his spirit and talk to him about what is going on. The relationship between the mother and the spirit of her dead son is very moving.It is also interesting to see how Johnny Angel deals with his girlfriend moving on with her life after his death. This to me was a very interesting part of the story.But the rest of the characters and events weren't really developed. Johnny comes back as a spirit to help his family, but the story is not told with any depth. I would have like to have read more about what the father was going through as he dealt with his issues. Instead, the story is focused on the relationship between the mother and dead son.I did enjoy reading it, but I just felt the character development and plot were somewhat \\"light\\" and situations could have been dealt with in a more in depth manner. But it is still a very touching story dealing with life after death."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"THIS NEW NOVEL BY STEEL COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT READ IF ONLY IT DID NOT HAVE SO MANY GAPS AND REPITITIOUS STATEMENTS IN IT.THIS STORY IS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN JOHNNY, WHO HAD EVERYTHING GOING FOR HIM, AND IS SUDDENLY KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT ON THE NIGHT OF HIS PROM. IT IS VERY SAD AND WILL MAKE YOUR EYES WELL UP WITH TEARS. HE LEFT BEHIND A FAMILY AND FIANCEE TORN ABOUT BY HIS DEATH. WELL, HE COMES BACK AS A SPIRIT AND HAS A JOB TO STRAIGHTEN OUT HIS FAMILY AND HIS FIANCEE'S BEFORE HE CAN ENTER INTO HIS ETERNAL LIFE. ONLY HIS MOTHER AND YOUNGER BROTHER CAN SEE AND HEAR HIM. THIS IS A GREAT STORY LINE BUT THIS IS WHERE STEEL FALLS SHORT. THE READER IS LEFT IN LIMBO AS TO HOW JOHNNY PERFORMS HIS MIRACLES, WHERE HIS ASSIGNMENTS COME FROM AND HOW HE GETS FROM PLACE TO PLACE. IF STEEL HAD FILLED IN THESE GAPS THIS STORY COULD HAVE BEEN HER BEST.I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK, BECAUSE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL STORY, AND THE ENDING DOES HAVE ITS MERITS, BUT JUST DON'T EXPECT TO MUCH."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Two words...&quot;just terrible&quot;..."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is the most horrible book I have ever read! Danielle Steel is getting worse and worse with her writing. She repeats herself over and over again. What she writes in over 200 pages could be written in about 30 by someone else. What an elementary level book!! Read something by Lisa Jackson if you want to read something decent."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I have read more books written by DS than by any other author. Steel's writings have never failed to be entertaining, challenging, never failed to touch me emotionally, nor test my intelligence, until now. I agree with those who have stated they felt the book was written on a 5th grade level. The writing was way too simple for adult readers. DS did not put herself into this book. She had an ulterior motive for writing this selection."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is literally one of the most poorly written books I have ever read, which came as somewhat of a shock as it is Steel's 58th bestseller. The story lacks depth and complexity, the characters lack development, the writing is repetitive, and everything is generally one-dimensional. Did she hire an intern to compose this book for her??"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I am glad to hear I am not the only one who is driven crazy by the way she repeats the same things over and over again. It truly makes me not want to read her books. After reading the other readers' reviews, I have decided not to buy. I can do without the frustration."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be like some of her other books, but I agree with some of the other readers. This book was like reading it over and over again. Had the same sentence over and over just in different sequence order. It was a childish story. We had a death in a family member and it's been over 7 yrs and we still cannot get over it. My ex-sister in law took her more than 5 yrs to move on and start dating again. So this book is not even close to reality. If you love someone so much, it doesn't take you just 4 months to get over that person. I do not recommended this book to anyone to read. Very Very disappointed in Daneille Steel for even thinking in publishing it. She must of had a mood swing or something."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"What a ridiculous story line! From the way-too-perfect Johnny to the way his one true love got over him within a few months, this book was hard to swallow start to finish. The writing style made me look online for the recommended age of readership - I truly thought I was reading a teenager's book. Ms. Steele repeated herself over and over.I have a library full of books in my home - from classics to beach reads. This is first time I threw a book out after reading it instead of keeping it on the shelves. Just seeing it there would have aggravated me."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This books was an extremely depressing book. Long and drawn out. Can all of this terrible stuff happen to these people. Does anything good ever happen. I will not buy any more of Steel's books after this one."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Definately not one of Steel's best. I was disappointed. I thought the plot was corny! It was an easy read, but I felt like I was reading a novel written for young teens. Every turn of the page was another predictible twist that just didn't add up to true Steel writing. If you liked &quot;Granny Dan&quot; or &quot;Silent Honor&quot;, skip this book. You'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"but a hard cry! This book can really give you a &quot;fun&quot; look into the &quot;afterlife&quot;. If only it were that simple. I really enjoyed this quick book!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I guess it's really true when they say that it's all about the story. The story is a great one, and the tragedy of losing a child in an auto accident is too often experienced by heartbroken families. I'll forever remember the characters and the story. It is one mother's way of coping with her loss. That being said, the repetition was a problem with this book, and some things that would have been picked up by a careful reading were left for the reader to say \\"say what?\\" I've read only one or two of Steel's novels, and this one sticks out because of the characters despite the way in which it was written."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I have read a lot of Danielle Steel books and usually enjoy them completely. But this book was lacking in editing -- there was a lot of typos the worse one is a very confusing daughter's name; she is Charlie sometimes and Charlotte sometimes as well, sometimes even in the same paragraph the name changes! The story of an angel come to help a greiving mother and her son deal with an older son's death was moving. Skip purchasing this book unless you find it in a thrift store or a discount bin, I have to wonder if Danielle Steel even wrote this book --- it does not read like her writing. It is sort of like a story plot from \\"Touched By An Angel\\" TV show."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Interesting story line. Not like other type of books she has written that I have read. Very different. I much prefer her other story lines."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"johnney angel is a sad book of johnny dying too soon. missed by his whole family that they become dysfunctioal with his lost. He returns as a vision to his brother and mother to help his family to function normaly. It's an easy read. I finished in one sitting."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I just got this book for my daughter. I read it years ago and I still think it is one of the best books I have ever read!!! I agree that Danielle Steel's books aren't as good as they used to be but this one was fantastic!!! I am going to read it again after my daughter is done!!!!! I think The Ring was another awesome book by Danielle Steel!! And I always loved the Promise...although I think it is out of print!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"The story itself was compelling. It was sad, but you wanted to keep reading just to see what would happen. The ending was predictable. It did bring out some emotion in me and kept my interest, so I would recommend this book, the story is good, just need to look past the writing at times. DS did repeat herself many times through out the book."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"The story kept my interest and the large print format was much easier to read. Definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is a little different than your typical Danielle Steel book. It's not hard to get into right from the beginning but it becomes a little far fetched. At first I thought \\"oh this isn't my type of thing\\", but I was drawn into it anyway and it was a very quick read. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it after it took a rather unrealistic turn, but it was interesting enough to keep me going and the end left me with a very happy, peaceful, and satisified feeling so I'm glad that I kept going. I believe that other Danielle Steel enthuisasts will also enjoy this if they are willing to keep their mind open to a rather unrealistic plot and wait for a very sweet ending. Like I said, it's a quick easy read... save it for a dreary Sundy and you will be happy you did."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"When I first began reading this book I was somewhat disappointed... it didn't lure me in like her other books, The Promise or Once in a Lifetime. However, I continued to read- and sure enough, by chapter 10, I was in tears! In fact, I didn't stop crying! The ending was absolutely beautiful!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This book was OK. Danielle steel has written much much better books with deeper, more interesting, and emotional plots. The story seemed drawn out. However, it's still readable and enjoyable, and was definitely different than the typical DS book - so for that I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I expected more from this book to be honest. I expected to cry more and to laugh more. I cried when they told the family about his death, and I got misty at the ending that was kind of sweet. And I felt the mothers pain grieving for her son, but not much else for the rest of the story. Seemed like it just kept rambling on with the characters saying and doing the same things."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I was dissapointed with this book. I kept reading it in hopes that something really incredible was going to happen but unfortunatly never did. The characters were vague and the story line redundant and ends without closure."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This was enjoyable reading. A young man taken much to soon is given the ability to come home and tie up the loose ends for all his loved ones. It was touching and I'm sure many people would love to be able to have just alittle more time with someone special that they have lost. I know I wish I could...."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I read this one within a day. It had me in floods of tears and made me aware how important it is to treasure each moment I have with my children.This family endures such tragedy and I felt like I was right there as a mother in the story dealing with the feelings as the character did. I surely recommend this one to all mothers."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Being a fan of this writer for a long time I'd like to say how much I enjoy all of her great stories but this book I think is one of my very favourite ones! Very touching read!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel is a touching story about a young man's unexpected death. Johnny Peterson was valedictorian of his class, star athlete of both the track and football teams, had a beautiful girlfriend, and was getting ready to graduate highschool. Then on prom night he was hit by a drunk driver suddenly ending his life and causing grief and pain amongst his friends and family. Johnny's mother was hospitalized due to an ulcer caused by stress from Johnny's death. Just when his mother didn't know how she was going to live without him he appeared to her just like he was when he was alive. The miracle didn't end there he stayed with the family on earth only visable to his mother and little brother Bobby. From then on he would change all their lives for the better.I felt that it has a touching story that woke the reader up to the harsh realities of drunk driving. Many of the family tradgies in this book could've beeen avoided by not consuming alcohol and driving. I also thought this was a good book to read if you had recently or ever lost a loved one. From the story you get the understanding that those who have passed on are always with you in your heart and our watching over you. At times the book can be a real tear jerker so be prepared with a box of tissues if your one of those emotional types.I liked the story, but I thought there were some things that could've been better. On a postive note the ending had a little twist to it that took away from the predictability of it. Some parts in it I found very predictable, somewhat like a Disney movie. I also liked the whole purpose of the story and how it touched you. What I didn't care for was that it was not challenging at all to read and in some parts I think she could've used a more descriptive style. She used many passive verbs.Overall it had a nice plot that was easy to follow and that the reader could easily relate to. I would only recommend this book to those who would find interest in it. It is a good choice to read if you like LifeTime movies or if you become absorbed in emotional novels."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Everyone is writing how terrible this book is and I thought it was great! Yes, at times it was a bit repetitive. If you have ever lost some one so close and never got to say good-bye, you can definetly relate to this book!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This story was so believable that it could have been a true story. It had me (at times) both laughing and crying. If you are into stories that grab you right from the get-go then you will love JOHNNNY ANGEL. The characters are believable and the plot realistic what more do you want in a book of this nature? Buy the book you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"With ever new Danielle Steel book i read i seem to get more and more disappointed..Is it possible to have so many great books early on in her career then nothing? If you readers want great romance and heart wrenching books, try Kirk Martin...these are a must for ever reader..he's a great new author with amazing stories to tell...www.KIRKMARTIN.COM trust me you will be so happy you listened to me...you won't be able to put these books down..they are a cross between Nicolas Sparks and Bridges Of Madison County....a must read..."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"In Danielle Steel's latest novel, number 58, she tells the story of a 17 year old boy who seems to have it all: a girlfriend he loves very deeply, a scholarship to a college, a family that loves him, and people who look up to him.Then hell breaks loose on prom night. Johnny and and his girlfriend, Becky, are involved in a traffic accident while on their way home from the prom. Riding in the car with Becky and Johnny is another couple. When the accident happened, the car got pinned between a big truck and a highway divider. at first, everything seems ok, but as we find out, things are not what they seem. The couple in the back seat are more stunned and shaken than anything, Becky has a gash on her cheek, and Johnny is dead behind the wheel with a broken neck.Things are going as smoothly as possible after a traffic accident occurs until Becky turns and sees the paramedics putting Johnny's body in the ambulance. She then goes into hysterics and has to be dragged away from the scene of the wreck.For months, all the people who Johnny was close two are inconsoloable, especially his mother and Becky. However, his mother gets sick one night and has to go to the hospital for a short stay. While there, she recieves a vision of Johnny and that the two of them are having a conversation. Thinking that it is all a dream, his mother does not want to wake up. However, he makes her and then she sees Johnny standing in her hospital room. At first she thinks it is the drugs the doctor gave her, but she is later convinced, by Johnny himself, that he is back because he has some work that he needs to finish.By the end of the book, Johnny has gotten quite a few miracles to happen, and everything turns out for the best."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I really am a big fan of most of Danielle Steel's body of work. I've read the vast majority of her books - purchased and listened to many of them as audio books...and even seen the ones that have been made into movies. This was pretty disappointing! I had purchased &quot;Dating Game&quot; the same time I got &quot;Johnny Angel&quot;. &quot;Dating Game&quot; was everthing that &quot;Johnny Angel&quot; wasn't! The book was thin in every way - the story line and the characters were lacking...and the whole thing reminded me of a beefed up short story. Hardly worth the $7.50 I paid for the paper back! Also, the entire time I was reading it, I felt like someone was pulling my leg. It was somewhat entertaining - but I certainly would never be interested in re-reading it - which I often do with her other works! It has the same silly fantasy of &quot;The Klone&quot;. I guess every once in awhile Ms Steel blows a mind fuse! Hopefully, she'll get back on track with the next book! Let's keep our fingers crossed!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I have read every one of Danielle Steel's books...however...this one was a real let down. Very predictable and boring. If you are looking for a great read...pass this one up. Hope this isn't the future for this writer...she seems to running out of good materail."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Although, this story is touching and will bring tears to your eyes, I couldn't help but feel let down after finishing the book. This was definitely not on a par with most of Danielle Steel's work. The book seemed short and the characters were not given any real depth of personality. It was almost as if they were held at a distance from the reader. Sorry, this is just not a &quot;Steel Classic&quot;."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is a fictional story about Johnny, a teen-age boy, who is tragically killed in a car accident just before graduating from high school. Johnny is one of the most popular boys in school. He is good-looking, popular, polite and a talented athlete. The entire school is devastated by his tragic death. Johnny's dysfunctional family cannot cope. He was their star son. His mother is totally depressed and is ready to fall-apart.The majority of the story takes place when Johnny returns as an angel and appears to only a few select people. He chooses to appear to his grief-ridden mother and autistic brother. The others in the family cannot see him. By reappearing, Johnny assures his mother that he is okay and helps her move on emotionally. He also \\"engineers\\" other miracles so that in the end the family is restored to healing and can function at a higher level.The story is peaceful and comforting. Danielle Steel lost her own son several years ago. She writes with great sensitivity and understanding. The story might help other mothers who are struggling. I also recommend Danielle Steel's His Bright Light, the true story of her son's life and death."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"The idea of losing someone unexpectedly and tragically is scary, REAL scary. The idea of that person being able to come back to &quot;tie up loose ends&quot; is wonderful isn't it? This book is about that very idea and how Johnny Angel came back to his family after his tragic death to right all that was wrong in his family before he died. The story itself was heartbreaking and touching, but the writing was so so. The book was short and very repititious. I expected more from such a well known author."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"What I think of the book, Johnny Angel, is that is a great book because even though it wasn't a realistic book I still loved it. In this book you can celebrate life, death, a little boy speaking, a family's love for someone loss, and so much more. The book is happy at times and sad at times, and sometimes it will make you want to laugh or just cry your eyes out. This was the first Danielle Steel book that I have ever read, but after reading it I would have to say that I will read more books that she has written. I would say it deals with the problems that any family suffering a loss would go through; a mother and father dealing with a loss of a son, brothers and sisters dealing with a of a loss of a sibling, and a girlfriend or boyfriend going through the loss of a significant other. Personally I think it is a great book to read if you're dealing with a loss of your own. Since I read this book while I was going through a loss of my own I think it helped relate to the book a little bit more and also helped me get through my loss.In this story the beloved, athletic, and smart Johnny Peterson gets into a car on with his girlfriend, Becky; and in an effort to save everyone else in the car he swerves so he is the only one hit. Johnny is the only one killed. His mother and Becky are devastated when they find out, his father becomes a drunk, his mute brother gets worse, and his sister is fighting for even more attention. Alice Peterson, his mother, had gotten sick from starving herself and had to go into the hospital where all of a sudden she starts to see and speak with an angel, its Johnny. He helps her get back on track in life, so she can help him help the family. Then he appears to his mute brother, Bobby, and helps him be comfortable around people and also talk. Johnny helps his father, Jim, stop drinking and with his job; and helps his sister, Charlotte get the attention of her parents, mainly her father. She helps Becky move on from him and find someone else for her to love. But, most of all he lets the people who cared for him the most forget about him.By: Hannah D."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel gives you a look at how hard it is when a family member dies. It also teaches you not to drink and drive. This book is all around awasome and i reccomend it to every body, young and old. At some point in your life you have to read tihs book. It is that good. I think i might read it again. Danielle Steel You did an AWASOME job with this one!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel was a Wonderful book! I laughed, cried, got angry and all of the above. It is a short book but great! I do belive in Angels but as far as them coming back and talking to us no. I do believe they come back and help us out when we need it though."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I agree with another reviewer that Ms. Steel's work is not what is once was. There are notable errors and quite a bit of repetition. However, she still knows how to spin a good tale, and Johnny Angel makes an entertaining light read. I would recomend a book by Debbie Macomber instead."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Danielle Steele is one of the most popular authors in our society, with over 510 million copies of her novels sold. Johnny Angel is her fifty-eighth best selling novel. Delacorte Press, Random House Inc. published the book, which is in New York.Johnny Angel is a work of fiction; it captured my soul from the beginning. It is a sad, but heartwarming story. The characters were portrayed in a very realistic environment with life like scenarios.When Alcoholism is involved it is always a negative factor in any situation. The story worked through this major problem with strength and hope in a positive way. Danielle Steele's style of writing kept me full of emotion and desire to read, not wanting to put the book down untill I was totally finished. It made me laugh and it made me cry. It filled me with hope of happiness and love everlasting. Johnny Angel is about good times and bad times, about love and death, but in the end it lets you know that there is hope. With a little prayer, and dedication to your loved ones we can work through almost anything. Johnny Angel showed me that family and friends are very important in our lives.This is a story that will pick your spirit up and make you glad that you read it, a book for the heart."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This mini-book left me wishing the angel theory could possibly exist. How many times have we wished we could see a loved one, just one more time?This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book, it is a sad story with hope for the future for any person, or family who might go through this horrible ordeal.I did not like the fact that the father in the story seem to be back in the 19th century regarding girls in sports.I also was tired of the repitition in parts of the story.Even with some reservation, this is a good book. It makes you feel good when you are done. Life does go on, even though we think it never will."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Peterson is killed in a car accident on the night of his senior prom. When his mother becomes ill and hospitalized she sees him in a dream and learns that he will be coming back to earth to do some &quot;work&quot;. He tells her he isn't sure what his &quot;work&quot; will be but that he'll be back and she'll be the only one to see him. Then, in the following chapters of the book, Johnny solves all the problems his family and his girlfriend's family had at the time of his death.Johnny Angel was a pleasant read. I don't normally read books with the death/angel subject as the main theme, but since this was a Steel novel, and I own all of hers, I bought this book and read it. I must say I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It was comforting to read about Johnny and how his family was able to overcome their grief and problems.At just under two hundred pages Johnny Angel seems to be written pretty well except for one thing. Ms. Steel insists on repeating things over and over. This has become a major issue in her novels of late. How many times do we have to be told about Johnny's father thinking girls shouldn't play boys sports?? Or about the accident involving his younger brother Bobby?? Enough with repeating everything already. I don't need to be told things over and over again. Sorry, this just becomes aggravating after awhile. With the repeating aside, this story moved at a steady, quick pace. I was able to read it in just one day.All in all this is one of Ms. Steel's better books in the past few years. It was a good story and for the most part well told. This book will bring tears to your eyes and also make you laugh with the light humor that it contains. A four and a half star read."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This book was a Christmas present for my daughter. She thoroughly enjoyed reading this author so she continues to ask for more books written by Danielle Steel."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This is a really magical story for a mother who has lost a child, to be really given the chance to see and speak to them again even if it is for a short time it could really help with closure."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"DS fan of many years. This was not one of her best. Quick read. Mildly entertaining although a bit far fetched even for DS.Looking forward to the next release in hopes it has more substance."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I found this book very easy to read. The story line in the book was predictable and i did enjoy reading it I would say it is a light read and like most of her books they seem to always tell the same type of story line and I guess I am looking for something to really get involved in but this was not that book.although I did end up likeing the book and would recommand it for a light read."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I'm a mother that tragically lost 2 of my teenagers in Dec 2004. I had read Steel's older books before. This was the 1st book I read since this tragic loss. It touched my soul so deeply. I cried, laughed and have treasured this story, because I can relate to the reality of deep grieving the loss of not only 1 but 2, teenagers killed so horribly. It's a pain I do not \\"ever\\" wish on anyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Very good Dannielle Steel book as always. It is amazing all the good stories she comes up with. This one was very heart felt. Enjoyed from start to finish"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel is a heartwarming and touching novella about a woman who managed to make contact with her deceased son,who died through a tragic car accident.This son of hers does wonders to the family like help her sister and father form a relationship,help his father move away from alcoholism,help his younger brother talk again,and help his girlfriend find a new boyfriend and manage to get a full scholarship at UCLA.Although the story is simple and predictable,it will manage to touch the reader's heart."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel was an excellent book. It relates to all teenagers. Teens tend to think that nothing can happen to them at this young age. However there are actually a lot of things that can happen at any point in time. A person should always be careful and make good decisions when the time comes.Johnny was a good student and a great athlete. Johnny got into a car accident on the night of prom and he died. He thought that nothing bad could happen to him on that night just like every other teenager would think. He then became an angel was sent back to finish some unfinished business. He had to help his family get through the tough times. The only two family members who could see him were his mother and little brother. This is so touching and heart warming. I was crying through most of the book. It made me realize that anything can happen to anyone at anytime even the people who are the closest to you.What made me cry while reading it was the fact that he came back and helped his two family members overcome their problems. I highly recommend this book because of the story and the meaning behind it."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"For once a book that has no sex. This is a fabulous novel. I opened it and never put it down. Three hours later, I put the completed book down. It kept my interest the whole way through and was totally moving. I cried and laughed and cried some more. All the past novels of Danielle Steel's that I have read, I loved, but all were romance novels and ended up being sexual. This one was totally different it was a drama. This would make a fabulous movie!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"To be honest, I was pretty let down by this book. I've read many of Danielle Steel's other works, including the book she wrote about her Son, Nick Traina, to which I thought this book would be related. Unfortunately I was wrong in that assumption. Reading her other works I've been privy to her writing style and have enjoyed it very much. Although this book was a quick read - I too finished it in less than a day - I was disappointed in the lack of character and plot development. It seemed like there were many opportunities for her to elaborate during certain parts of the story, yet she didn't.I did like the story line, and it definitely was emotionally moving. However, for someone looking for a well developed story line and more detailed writing, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I have been a life time fan of Danielle Steel and have all of her books. However,her writing style has severely been defective in the last few books. She runs sentences together, grammar is incorrect, over-use of the word &quot;and&quot; and repeats herself over and over and over again---as another reviewer mentioned. It detracts from the story entirely too much. When you read as much as I do and love to read well-written stories, Ms. Steel's style is not enjoyable any longer.However, having said this, the story is enjoyable. I skimmed this book to avoid all those deficiencies in her writing and was able to finish it in a couple of hours. Yes, I did shed tears in several places--didn't miss the story line in spite of the fast read. It's a different take on the &quot;angel in the home&quot; idea----never before have angels moved things around and made noise that everyone hears. But--it was somewhat comforting to read about the appearance of Johnny to his little brother as well as to his mother. I do think, however, that he could have also talked to Becky, the love of his life.I'm not sure &quot;angels&quot; can manipulate lives as much as talked about here. But having lost a child myself (he was 4) I know the pain of the loss, the comfort knowing he's in a good place and will be in my heart forever------I do &quot;see&quot; him in dreams but never during my awake times. My child angel does &quot;speak&quot; to me in eerie ways------songs that suddenly play on the radio----&quot;our special&quot; ones,fate-related events. But Ms.Steel went over the edge in some of her story lines. But that's fiction------and ok.Is Danielle Steel truly writing these books? What happened to an editor to check for mistakes, grammer and run-on sentences? Or is someone else-----perhaps a middle school child----doing the writing?? It just isn't the quality that we came to love and expect from her.Quick read, sad but comforting story----poor writing style.But great for the beach reading."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"This book was so bad that if I could have given it ZERO stars I would have. What a totally ridiculous story. The boy in the book is just WAY too perfect - from his perfect behavior, the fact that he's a perfect student, boy friend, son, brother all the way to the perfect relationship he had with his mother. The story is not in the least bit interesting and the ending was just WAY too predictable. Don't even bother picking this one up. It was a total waste of time."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"The story was touching, yet highly unrealistic. There was also too much redundancy. I thought this was an easy, yet disappointing read. I wonder if Steel has to meet a quota each year, and this was the by-product? Not her best book."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"The only other Danielle Steel book I've read was Sunset In St. Tropez, which I didn't fully enjoy. But this book...I loved. It was very touching and even if you've never dealt with a loss, you still felt like you could relate with the characters. I didn't give it a 5 because I'm very picky about my books."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"Johnny Angel is one of those books you can read in one sitting......quite the good read.....definitely a bit far-fetched, but good nonetheless. The end was not what i was expecting and some excerpts were repeated over and over....which happens alot in most DS books.I was truly delighted with Bobby's progree.. i would recommend this book to any die-hard DS fan."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I really liked this book because it was different from the normal Danielle Steel books that she rights. I've never read a book like this and i thought that it was very interesting. The way that everything ended was very good, I don't like it when books end sad so this book was a very good book to me. It kept me reading and up at night, and I didn't even fall asleep! This book over all gets a 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I am an avid Danielle Steel reader but this one is not one of her best. The concept was a good one but it was written in such simple language. The characters could have had a bit more depth. Maybe next time...I know she is capable for much better writing!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","review":"I was interested in this book due to the topic of a person returning to earth as an angel. I haven't read many of Danielle Steel's books, and after reading this one, I will NOT read another one. How many times can a writer repeat themselves? If you're Danielle Steel, WAY too much. She repeated conversations verbatim, she told and re-told situations and plot devices ad nauseeum (for example, father drinking, Bobby's accident, father ignoring Charlie's sports because she's a girl, Johnny's reactions to all of these events, etc). This was an extremely sketchy book. For example, Johnny would perform miracles, but he didn't know how and we weren't told, either. They just happened. Fine, you might say that miracles do 'just happen', however, if Johnny is the instigator of all these miracles, more thought and description should have been given as to how he accomplished them. DS could add a lot more depth and detail to her story telling. The ending was SO predictable. Someone earlier said the ending was an unpredictable &quot;plot twist&quot;. I figured it out less than half way through the book. It's hard to believe that she is a best selling author. I read this book in less than 2 hours. Check it out from the library (as I did) if you really do want to read it."},{"Title":"Revolution &Terror; in France 1789 - 1795 (2nd Edition)","review":"This book was required reading for my \\"Age of Revolution\\" class - a fact that you can take as an endorsement or as something quite the opposite.Is it light? Oh no. Is it difficult and dry? Nope, not that either. This is one of the books that is going to make you work a little at first if you're not already burning to know how Necker planned to solve the ancient regime's tax crisis or desperate to get some clarification on the Girondins versus the Montagnards.No, it's not an easy start, but hang in there, because with this much information it's worth stretching out of pablum-mode. I don't think there's a single superfluous sentence in this book. (Something my classmates apparently concurred with, as I watched them highlight entire pages at times.) It's a lot to digest, but while it isn't a rollicking good time it also isn't plodding or, for that matter, very long.The transcripts of important documents are a nice touch, as is the chronology, and the glossary, although brief, is vital to a beginner to this topic such as myself.At the end of the day, can you really go wrong with a book that not only repeats the shouts of...where appropriate and explains the origins of Lobster Thermidor, but that also quickly disabuses the reader of any Dickensian notions of peasants rising and nobles guillotined? Ah no, here's the book that taught me it was the aristocrats that revolted first and that more peasant heads went lopping into the basket than any bewigged silk-wearers'..."},{"Title":"From Puritanism to Postmodernism: A History of American Literature","review":"Easy reading but not dull witted, quite an enjoyable and informative book.

I think he is, either, the best or second best American thriller/spy story writer currently working. (His only competition is Alan Furst)I also think Formosa Straights is his best book. He is a wonderful writer, has complex plots, and is able to communicate a sense of place that is hypnotic.I only hope he publishes another book soon!"},{"Title":"China Lake","review":"I think his best effort has been Red Fox, that book is truly a five. This good is a close second but does not have the tension and great mystery that Red Fox had. This author writes tight, slick books that keep you interested through out. This is an interesting book that combines espionage with a murder mystery. You are never in need of additional details with this author, he really fills the pages up, and for some I think this can be too much. This really is a book that has two - three very well developed and written plot twists that makes you stay on your toes. I have reread the book and it is something how well he places the road signs. This is a great book; unfortunately he was not able to keep up this form into his next."},{"Title":"China Lake","review":"This is one of the most boring tales I have read. The author's style is the major obstacle. The paragraphs often fill the better part of one even two pages -- these are easy to flip through. The content rambles on and on with unnecessary details on minor matters. The main story line is hard to find. And then, when discerned, it is not worth the work of putting it together."},{"Title":"Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design","review":"This book stands by itself in the database design world which is mired down in the Entity-Relationship paradigm. In my mind, Terry Halpin has the most powerful technique for going from \\"hey I think we need a database\\" to a relational-table structure that has half a chance of satisfying the original loosely described need. The Object Role Modeling (ORM) approach described in this book is embodied in software that Microsoft is giving away for free! (VisioModeler 3.1 from Microsoft's download site. Search in the Visio 2000 Enterprise downloads. Check out ERWIN which will cost you thousands and then use Visiomodeler.) ORM diagrams are pictures which, like control system block diagrams, are exact mathematical statements describing interrelated data. They deal with data a \\"fact at a time\\", the way the \\"rest of us\\" do. These diagrams are simple enough to use as discussion points customers who could probably care less about the underlying database structures. One indication of how straight forward ORM is: high school kids in Australia use ORM diagrams to design databases in a computer science curriculum. To work through the modeling and design task Halpin describes the Conceptual Schema Design Procedure (CSDP) which takes care of all the necessary theoretical stuff. The book is out of print but Halpin has another in the mill titled, \\"Information Modeling and Relational Databases: From Conceptual Analysis to Logical Design\\", see Morgan Kaufmann Publishers web site mkp.com. Until then, Halpin's web site at orm.net and InConcept's Journal Of Conceptual Modeling at inconcept.com provide a wealth of ORM information. One caution when jumping into ORM. Take some time to get used to the ORM terminology and the very different approach to modeling at the fact level. You may be handicapped by the all pervasive entity-relationship notion and your knowledge of how to construct database tables. In the end you will be so much better off!"},{"Title":"Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design","review":"Too bad it's out of print. Too bad InfoModeler ... based on ORM ... is not sold anymore.Visio just lets you draw pictures. InfoModeler let you key in FORML statements .. ORM syntax .. and build database schemas.But a lot of study of ORM allows me to build a OO class hierarchy .. and has greatly enhanced my productivity.Dr. Halpin .. if you read this ... know that there are programmers out there you have helped immensely. I'm using your techniques in n-tier web applications as I write this."},{"Title":"Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design","review":"I think this book is one of the very best resources for database design available. As a professional database designer, I have seen numerous examples of database applications that don't really help the users run their business more efficiently. The root cause of the problem is poor database design.The heart of every business application is a database, and the key to creating a good database is accurately capturing business requirements and turning those business requirements into a workable system design.This book will teach you a method called &quot;Object Role Modeling&quot; (ORM) for gathering requirements and creating a design. In ORM, you concentrate on business facts (e.g. &quot;Commission is allocated to Salesman based on Percentage&quot;) instead of database entities and attributes. This fact-based approach allows the designer to communicate with the user in a way that makes sense to the user. A collection of business facts is called a &quot;conceptua! l model&quot;. ORM provides an algorithm that automatically generates a properly normalized ER model from a conceptual fact based model.Most other books that deal with database design focus on logical issues like normalization, key structures, etc. The problem is that logical issues don't matter if you can't accurately capture the business requirements using formal and managable method.Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design teaches you how to capture the facts using ORM. The book explains how the logical issues can be automatically resolved once you have a valid conceptual model.One thing I especially like about the book is the large number of sample problems. Each section has a list of questions, and the answers to the odd numbered questions are in the back of the book.If you need to build a system for business users, this is the book for you. If you are already an experienced data modeler, this book will help you communicate better with your users, ! and ensure success on your project. If you haven't done da! ta modeling before, this book presents one of the very best methods."},{"Title":"Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design","review":"ORM is a superior technique for modelling databases. A correct ORM diagram guarantees that your relational database ends up in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form). Compared to e.g. ER this is a major breakthrough for database modelling languages.Compared to ER, ORM is quite verbose. This is a clear disadvantage when documenting an already existing design, but on the other hand, it contains all the information necessary for generating an ER diagram, generate a schema for a relational or object-oriented database, or even generate the classes in A C++ or Java program.Working with ORM will almost always improve the design of your datamodels, whether they exist in a database or as classes in your program. I often find myself drawing up an ORM diagram whenever I have to come up with a datamodel for a given program (I rarely work with databases, but ORM is useful nonetheless).As for the book, well it works great as a textbook if you have no experience at all with database-design. But it uses many more pages than necessary, and can be quite dull. Using it to refresh your memory is out of the question, the information is spread out over 500 long-winded pages, with no summary at the end. If this book had been shorter, or included a 20-page summary at the end, I would have given it 5 stars, but as it is, it only gets 3."},{"Title":"Marriages and Families Diversity and Change","review":"This book provides a general educational foundation to the subject.

I do dislike how whenever they are speaking about people from both sexes, the purposely always list she before he. \\"She or he is likely to ...\\" \\"She or he sometimes may feel...\\" Why not go s/he, that seems pretty acceptable to me. Or he, then she, since that's alphabetical. Or mix it up and do both, but it's a purposeful action in this book to put female before male.I just fail to see the worth of the text. Why do I need to read a chapter on Living Single, Living With Others? Or Dating, Coupling, and Mate Selection. Or The Marriage Experience.What did this book teach me? Well, I now know such important things as the \\"developmental family life cycle theory\\", which pays close attention to changes in families over time and attempts to explain family life in terms of a process that unfolds over the life course of families? Huh? Really, who cares? The text is obsessed with trying to explain things, and give names and theories and terms to what I just refer to as \\"life\\". Everyone lives life a different way. Live and let live I say, and quit analyzing it. If two gay people have a kid, good for them. Why delve into it? If two straight people have a kid, good for them. If a grandmother lives with the family, who cares? Why is an entire book dedicated to this?Sadly, most of those probably reading reviews on this book are students who will be required to buy it. So my advice, buy it, use it, resell it. If you happen to be a professor of sociology, put aside your personal feelings about my or other negative reviews, read the book cover to cover, and ask yourself if it really taught you anything, or enlightened you in anyway.

Like many new Vermonters, Mitchell was an urban transplant, and upon arrival in Vermont, he didn't have a lot of the accumulated \\"country-sense\\" necessary for survival on the farm. Undaunted, Mitchell talked to his neighbors, read all he could, and slowly learned how to make a living off the land. In this book, Mitchell struggles to figure out the best way to raise kids-how to tell when they are ready to drive a tractor, or deal with life's passages in the sheep barn. He also spends a lot of time in the sheep barn, working out the guidelines for efficient animal husbandry and marketing his sheep products.Mitchell's first book, Moving UpCountry, kept me in stitches for days, as I recalled such scenes as procuring fresh chickens for out-of-town visitors. There's nothing spectacularly funny like that in this book, but there are several points to ponder. In a story about deciding whether to collect a pile of skipping stones from a park to take back home to his own pond, Mitchell writes \\"having my own private supply of stones might make them hard to share. Could I gracefully stand by while visiting guests fired stone after stone from my pail out across the water?...Would I have to remind myself, each time I skipped a stone, that now I possessed one less stone to skip?\\" When he realized the work and worry a stone supply would cause him, he gave up the enterprise at once so that he could enjoy the immediate pleasure of skipping stones with his kids on the beach.

Purdy describes the desperate lives of the Fergus family, who are, in fact, the Purdy family, and their great disappointments as they struggled to live in the town of Findlay, Ohio, in the 20's and 30's. He wrote the book three years after the death of his older brother from cirrhosis in 1967 in Toledo, Ohio. His brother was named Richard, called Rick in this novel. Richard was a well-known television actor in New York City during the early 50's who was forced to discontinue acting around 1955 due to his drinking. The book is about dreams thwarted by poverty and lack of a male parent. Rick gets a check for $6000 from is aunt which he plans to use to launch his acting career in New York, but he is swindled out of it by his ne'er-do-well father. Everything Rick wants to do to improve himself and follow his passion dies in the killing atmosphere of Findlay.This book lacks the scatology of Purdy's other books--it is an essay (which happens to be true)on the unpredictability and essential sadness of life. I found it very interesting, particularly since I knew Richard Purdy and found him absolutely fascinating. Despite all his travails, he did make it to New York, but unfortunately he was already in his 40's and only acted for six years.

I always want Alex Delaware but I recognize that authors get different voices in their heads and, on that basis, I did struggle through the Billy Straight book, knowing that Alex would not be far behind. I found this story to be totally unrealistic and I know Kellerman can do better. What truly concerns me, though, is that he revealed only bits and pieces of Jeremy's history, which makes me think that this character will be back. NOOOOO!The story sets up well but, in my opinion, goes downhill from there. Jeremy is a suspect in a variety of killings, all the while continuing his practice and no one at the hospital seems aware of the suspicion. He becomes erratic in his behavior and obsessed with his private investigation and no one is the wiser. Meanwhile, he seems to possess superhuman powers with patients.I must say that this book reminded me very much of Chasing the Dime by Michael Connelly. No, there are no similarities in the stories but both, in my opinion, are beneath the authors' amazing abilities."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book. When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books. This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not &quot;into&quot; the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was &quot;curious&quot; about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse. When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone. The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Look, if you want to read a good mystery, stick to Kellerman's early work. &quot;Butcher's Theater&quot; is dynamite.

It's time for Kellerman to retire his word processor."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"A wonderful book, full of insight, well-drawn characters, and the human element.

I highly recommend this one.Also recommended: The Da Vinci Code and Bark of the Dogwood by Jackson McCrae"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan - have read everything but this new book is just incredibly boring. The language is very self indulgent and where plot shoud be, there are just endless descriptions of people or events that don't really relate to the story. The only thing worse is the reader of the audio - flat, dull, the story may be putting him to sleep and his &quot;female&quot; character voice is just terrible. I was also offended by the need to use stereo type descriptions of Asian characters in the book. Very unusual and I'm so disappointed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was a fun ride and took a while to figure the real culprit, which you didn't know to the end unless you're really into murder mysteries!

Nonetheless, I liked it.The story centers around Dr. Jeremy Carrier, and the unsolved murder of his girl friend Jocelyn Banks. Jeremy is still grieving her death when he is approached by a mysterious pathologist by the name of Arthur Chess, while he is alone, having lunch in the hospital dining room. Although Jeremy has little desire for friendship at this time, Dr. Chess is persistent, and an odd relationship between the two doctors develops. Meanwhile, Angela, an attractive intern subtly flirts with Jeremy and finally suceeds in obtaining a date with him. Just as Jeremy's life begins to feel \\"normal\\" once again, he accepts an invitation from Arthur Chess to a dinner with some of Arthur's friends. Subsequently,Jeremy's life begins to become very strange. Anonymous mail is delivered to him at his office, his girl friend begins to spend less time with him, and his new-found friend Arthur disappears. As Jeremy attempts to figure out where his friend has gone, and solve the mystery of the anonymous mail deliverys, as well as come to terms with his relationship with Angela, he starts to wonder whom he can trust, and who the enigmatic members of Arthur's little club really are.I gave this story only three stars because it seemed to drag at times."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is not an Alex Delaware mystery and I really enjoyed the change. This mystery is well constructed and the pages turn pretty fast. The lead character is a psychologist but in many ways seems more \\"real\\" than Mr. Kellerman's other protagonists. A QUICK READ, ENJOYABLE THRILLER."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is a story from author Kellerman which is a bitof a departure for him, in that he usually writes about hishero Alex Delaware and his odd pal, Milo, who operate inthe psych and homicide world of L.A. The best of those storiesusually grab your attention and move at a fast, complex pace.Here, Kellerman does give us a different perspective with hishero a Ph.D psychologist working in the psych unit of a hospitalin an unnamed city. Dr.Jeremy Carter's life falls suddenly intonew depths when his beautiful girl friend is found murdered,and the details of her death are so gruesome the detectiveswon't talk about them to anyone.And, of course, since there are few clues, the hidebound policedetectives suspect the boy friend, Jeremy, and they try to workhim into the murder.Jeremy tries to build a new life, but it is a slow, painfulprocess; then he meets another beautiful young woman, and theymove toward a more intimate friendship. But he can never forgethis earlier girlfriend and her fate, but the police still won'ttell him anything, but they are obviously losing interest inwhat is becoming an old case.Then Jeremy is suddenly befriended by an older man on staff,who is a pathologist, and the older doc invites Jeremy to adinner, which turns out to be very mysterious indeed. Thehandful of participants are all older, seemingly wealthy, andthey have something secret in their past, which they hint ofbut never detail.The pathologist then disappears, and Jeremy begins receiving postcards from around the world, and about the same time, someone is slipping into his interoffice mail copies of bizarrearticles in medical journals. Jeremy's interest is aroused,of course, and he begins trying to make some connection amongall those articles and the bare hints from his new friend, thetraveling pathologist.The course is complex, with some false leads, and the psychologist begins investigating on his own. All leading todanger of course.In the course of his story, author Kellerman tells us a bit about the basic characteristics of serial killers and the kindof people who kill for no reason, or only for their personalthrill, and his descriptions are highly interesting, all the more because the author knows this business.The pace is both quick and easy, and the ending does revealthis to be a genuine mystery."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In the past I have found Jonathan Kellerman to be my favorite author, having read every book he has ever written. Conspiracy Club, however, does not live up to his previous works. The plot was weak, the characters even weaker. I found myself bored and thrilled when it ended. Mr. Kellerman, please go back to your previous style, this was simply not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have been rading Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels for years and I have really enjoyed them. I was so disappointed by his new novel The Conspiracy Club. It moved so slowly it was painful. There were no interesting characters. I can't even remember the &quot;hero's&quot; name. This one wasn't worth the time. I was glad when it ended."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers who believed that Mr. Kellerman's traditional lead character, Alex Delaware, was getting a bit stale. So, now Mr. Kellerman has given us Jeremy Carrier, but a psychologist is not a big leap in character differentiation. More imporantly, Dr. Carrier is not much of a character. Not much personality, not much flavor. I can't remember the last time I was less interested in a book's central character. If you can get past the lack of a good central character, some of the supporting cast members, such as Arthur Chess, are somewhat interesting, but none are compelling.The story itself, a whodunit, with Dr. Carrier trying to determine the identify of his girlfriend's killer is decent. There's not a lot of action, so the story is mainly cerebral. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, but some of Mr. Kellerman's early books are a better diversion."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a new character, perhaps a rework of Alex Delaware, before he had &quot;been there; done that.&quot; He's young, idealistic and fairly inexperienced. He's an orphan who got through school on scholarships against all odds. His first real love is brutally murdered and at the beginning of the story he is trying to find his way after being suspected of having killed her. A mystery doctor on staff at his hospital, Dr. Arthur Chess, drops into his life along with mysterious tips or clues leading him to look for Jocelyn's killer. The story is slow and hard to follow. The suspense finally picks up about half way through the book, and it's worth finishing.Now that we have met Dr. Carrier, perhaps his next adventure will be a little more suspenseful and intense."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Feeling that the Alex Delaware series has lost a great deal of zest in recent books, we snapped up this latest Kellerman on learning it featured a completely new leading man, psychologist Jeremy Carrier. This doc practices on staff at a regular hospital; and we were surprised to learn how busy he was with the care and concerns of fairly normal patients whose current medical conditions were mostly other than mental difficulties. Carrier himself is dealing with the unsolved murder of his former serious nurse girlfriend, a case that has brought suspicion against himself by cop Bob Duresh. Soon a couple more killings suggest a possible link between Carrier's girlfriend and the other victims, a thought that once again sics Duresh onto his trail. Then another mysterious character, pathologist Arthur Chess, befriends Jeremy and invites him to an elaborate dinner meeting of some sort of secret society interested in dark human deeds. A series of follow-up clues from Chess to Carrier set our hero in pursuit of who might be the real perpetrator of these crimes. The clues continue to unfold and confound as Kellerman sets a nice pace of action and reaction throughout this suspenseful mystery; and of course our hero catches the bad guy in the end.We felt mixed emotions about this novel. We almost always enjoy Kellerman's writing, even though his last few books seemed a little stale. Our problem with this one is that while the mystery per se was entertaining enough, the characters were almost lookalikes to the Delaware clan: Jeremy for Alex, new girlfriend Angela for Robin, and cop Duresh for Sturgis, though the latter mostly an adversary instead of an ally. We find the speculation of other reviewers that maybe this manuscript was a precursor to the Delaware series as mildly amusing, but not impossible. So -- reasonably good novel, but not great."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathon Kellerman is one of my favorite authers, and his last two books have been his best in years. But with Conspiracy Club he has totally missed the mark. This book is slow paced, the main character (Jeremy Carrier) is totally uninteresting. I've read about 100 pages and nothing has happened! I can only read a few pages at a time before I start getting sleepy. I had to put the book down, I couldn't finish it. I may go back to it but not right away. What a bummer. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep pick this book up. Everyone else should just leave it alone. Hopefully Kellerman's next book will be up to his earlier standards."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has become one of my favorite authors over the past year, having devoured his Delaware novels, and his other good books such as &quot;Billy Straight&quot; and &quot;The Butcher's Theater&quot;. However, this book is quite unlike Kellerman's earlier efforts.While I always admire an author who wants to break away from his series characters (ala Harlan Coben, Jeffery Deaver, etc.), I think Jon misses the mark in this one.Jeremy Carrier is not the strongest of lead characters. At times, his own self-pity and lack of communication skills makes him obscenely apathetic; when he attempts heroics, he seems incapable of filling the hero's shoes. The whole club idea is so preposterously laid out, that they come across as the Golden Girls on Prozac. The killer's identity is anticlimactic in the fact that it's a character who has had so little involvement in the book, it's like Betsy Palmer coming out of the woods in &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;Kellerman's usual mastery of pacing, suspense and intrigue are replaced with long, monotonous scenes, and very little tension.I hope this isn't the beginning of a new series, cause I don't think Carrier can carry it!Go back to Alex Delaware, Jon, and return to those pulsepounding thrillers you captured our hearts with!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have not or cannot finish reading this book. It is soooo slooow and seems to be going nowhere and I don't really care about Jeremy at all. Why is that? My first experience with Jon Kellerman was so wonderful that I had to read everything right away. But this book can't be his. I did catch his wonderful descriptive talents in describing scenery but that is not plot. As with Patricia Cornwell's disaster with Blow Fly, it seems as if two previous reviewers are right. Mr. Kellerman was phoning it in or he had this book from a college project and needed to get something published. I don't think I will bother finishing The Conspiracy Club so I can use the time to find a new mystery author. I checked out this site to be sure that I was not the only one who was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The first half of this book went by very slowly. So slowly, in fact, that I almost put it down. I was glad that I didn't in the end. The plot starts to pick up and the reader gets engaged in the final resolution. It's not the most clever or best written book I've ever read but it was certainly ok. I bought it on the bargain shelf and felt it was worth it - decent entertainment for a few hours time."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Here Kellerman inroduces a new central character, writes in the third person, places the action in an unnamed, generic mid western city, and creates an antagonistic relationship between the hero and the main homicide detective.These are all significant departures from the lengthy Deleware series, and I think they lend freshness to the novel. Kellerman retains his ability to build interesting characters, and handles the romance convincingly.I'm far less convinced that the investigative plot is plausible - why did those who apparently knew about a serial killer leave the hero so much alone, especially when the villain would kill again?It was good for author and reader to enjoy a holiday from the admirable but weary Alex Deleware, but this offering is a few notches below Kellerman's considerable best."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I won't sum up again, that's been done countless times on this one already. Psychological thriller is a pretty accurate two-word summary!The story was interesting, if not exactly gripping. I like the fact that Carrier wasn't able to make unrealistic instant intuitive leaps, and that he logically and credibly worked the &quot;mystery&quot; out on his own. The characters were well-defined and believable. The plot was intricate enough to keep me guessing, as a reader, and not blatantly obvious. Carrier's relationship with Angela was very well done, his shying away from any discussion of his past or especially his relationship with Jocelyn. When Angela began working closely with Dirgrove, I thought at first that it was uncharacteristic of her, since she seemed very taken with Carrier --- but then she proved to be true to her personality when Dirgrove hit on her and she told Carrier about it immediately. Doresh showing up to &quot;save the day&quot; at climactic moment was allowable because of his evident and continual distrust of Carrier, although I am a bit skeptical at those &quot;just in time&quot; rescues. However, the book was an overall good story, and well plotted with convincing three-dimensional characters. I'd rather read more Delaware books than Carrier, though."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have always found that a good reader can make a mediocre book more interesting and a bad reader exposes weak prose in a few moments. This audio book has the one of the worst readers ever and writing so poor that even George Guidall would be hard pressed to keep me listening.I agree with an earlier reviewer's thought that this book seems to be from before Kellerman's Delaware success. The use of latin names of diseases without a translation and clumsy use of language (When was the last time you found the term &quot;jimcrack&quot; in a novel with a modern setting?). And, this book suffers the worst of Kellerman's other novels: endless and pointless mental dialogue by the lead.All in all this audio recording is a must avoid."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"There is no such thing as a bad Jonathan Kellerman novel, but some are better than others. This standalone presents a number of problems. The protagonist is a close approximation of Dr. D, but with few of his more attractive traits. Dr. C is too tentative, too young, too soft. The plot is interesting and complex, a nice variant on an old theme, but with no interesting twists and turns. Finally, the setting is fictitious, so we lose some of the texture and local color associated with Kellerman's best work (e.g. BILLY STRAIGHT). Having said that, the narrative is lean, the story interesting, the writing always expert. I didn't devour the book, but I returned to it whenever I got the chance. This would be a top book if Kellerman were not a top talent who always raises our expectations. Read it, but wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is so wordy and difficult to read, that it wasn't even worth finishing. I was VERY disappointed in this author, since I usually enjoy his writing."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I read a few of the negative reviews before I got my hands on Conspiracy Club, and thankfully the bad reviews didn't spoil my fun.First, I read one Kellerman novel several years ago so I had no opinions on this author when I got this book. Even at 370 pages, this is a quick read.Dr. Carrier is a pschyciatrist at a big city hospital. His girlfriend has recently been murdered. Dr. Authur Chess befriends him and at the same time Carrier begins receiving strange packages and notes leading him to clues about various killings and killers.This book is from the point of view of Dr. Carrier. It covers his relationships with his patients, coworkers and new girlfriend Angela.The unique part of this book is there is absolutely no forshadowing or hint of what is to come. You read about everthing as it happens to Dr. Carrier. Nothing much happens in the book, but you do get to follow Dr. Carrier's journey as he is slowly lead on a path that could lead answers or more death.The Conspiracy Club of the title not really part of the book, yet its existence does leave a few unanswered questions. Those aren't really relevant to this review.I enjoyed this book, and might actually give Kellerman's books another shot after not being impressed with his first one."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid reader who always finishes a book with the belief that somewhere &quot;in there&quot; in any tome, there is something of value to learn. The basic plot of The Conspiracy Club is an attention-getter - women being murdered. And yes, the pages will turn.However, until I got to page 225, I was struggling with the decision --- is this a romance, mystery, or medical chronicle? After approximately page 225, the plot does gain momentum. I did not find the story psychologically complex, stimulating or challenging. I am slightly disappointed with this writing. Specifically, connections to the plot are expressed in shallow, below standard, and insubstantial build-up and depth. There is only a tad of &quot;breathtaking&quot; moments, and desire for the reader to hurry to the end to find out &quot;who-done-it&quot; is of meager concern. The characters, even the hero, Dr. Jeremy Carrier, are too laid back. Except for Jeremy, other characters are very inactive in their roles.I did not find the culprit &quot;hunt chilling&quot; nor do I consider this tome a &quot;21st century Jack the Ripper&quot; --- far from it. A small number of victims, very little involvement of police activity and investigation expressed, and did not see the police represented as &quot;assumed&quot; heavy investigative factions --- a part that made the story (among other factors stated) &quot;not believable.&quot;Many nondescript factors combined to make for weak storytelling --- other than the description of what/where someone ate (for) lunch. The roles of doctors Gwynn Hauser and Dirgrove were left &quot;flat&quot; with no follow-up; Arthur Chess and compatriots were left flat in most of the story, especially Dr. Chess in his travels and how they connected to the plot. I was left wondering whether the parts of the aforesaid characters add value to the story and am left with the question: &quot;Are they necessary to the story?&quot; On balance, though, I would read other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a big Alex Delaware fan, so I was unsure what to expect from this new Kellerman. But it turned out to be a great read. Really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Author Jonathan Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware series, but this one features another Psychologist named Dr. Jeremy Carrier. I like him. He's nothing like Alex. Jeremy is feeling kind of numb following the brutal murder of his girlfriend Jocelyn. Not only does he have to deal with the grief and shock of losing her, but he seems to be the prime suspect and the Police start hounding him when another body shows up. It's kind of funny because everyone seems to think he's such a calm, cool and collected guy when he's really broiling inside. He snaps and yells at a couple doctors and suddenly gets respect. He ignores his patients and they love him - apparently mistaking his apathy as some sort of Zen togetherness. He is basically sleepwalking through life until Dr. Arthur Chess, the Pathologist, enters the scene. He draws Jeremy out - with a sort of game. A game that turns deadly. Someone - Jeremy is pretty sure it's Arthur - is sending him strange, seemingly unrelated medical articles and news clippings. Eventually, he decides this has something to do with the murders and his curiosity gets the better of him and he starts digging, trying to put this puzzle together before another woman dies. Eventually, he is finally able to open up to another woman, but just when he starts to get domestic with Angela, he feels her life is being threatened by the killer too.Can he figure it out in time to save her?

It has less gore and more mystery. I love having to follow the trail of nuggets left by the older physician for the protagonist. The protagonist goes from clue to clue, doubting at first, but believing and solving in the end. A very satisfying story."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The first Jonathan Kellerman book I ever read did not feature Alex Delaware. It was a novel titled THE BUTCHER'S THEATER, and though I read it almost 15 years ago, I can still remember passages of that book as if I had read them yesterday. I've read almost all of Kellerman's fiction since that time, including every Delaware novel, so I approached THE CONSPIRACY CLUB with some mixed feelings. I was slightly disappointed that this was not going to be another Delaware novel. But Kellerman's work, whether it involves Delaware or not, is so uniformly excellent that a deviation from his normal characterization would almost certainly be interesting.Now, having spent a day or so reading THE CONSPIRACY CLUB, I can tell those of you who are diehard Delaware fans that, if you skip this excellent novel because Alex Delaware is not in it, you are cheating yourself. And if you're not already a fan of Kellerman, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is the key to becoming one. Notwithstanding my familiarity with Kellerman's work, I felt as if I was discovering a debut novel by a new author who had studied at the feet of the masters and was channeling them.The book is excellent in every way. The characters are unforgettable, the dialogue is witty when it should be and dark when appropriate. The plotting is so intelligent yet straightforward that you'll walk away from this great novel feeling smarter than you did when you first picked it up.THE CONSPIRACY CLUB introduces Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young staff psychologist at City Central Hospital in an unnamed Midwest city. Carrier is carrying around a boatload of grief since his passionate but all-too brief affair with a nurse named Jocelyn Banks was abruptly ended by her kidnapping and brutal murder. Carrier was initially a suspect in Banks's unsolved slaying, and Detective Bob Doresh has a disconcerting habit of popping into the hospital at odd times to ask Carrier off-kilter questions, just to let Carrier know that he's still under the magnifying glass. When another woman is murdered in an eerily and similarly grisly fashion, Doresh seems to be taking more than a polite interest in Carrier, a circumstance that creates even more sorrow and confusion for him. This is counterbalanced --- barely --- by Carrier's slowly developing relationship with Angela Rios, a hospital resident whose slow but sure emotional succor seems to put him on the road to recovery.At the same time, an elderly, somewhat eccentric physician named Dr. Arthur Chess begins to take a gently incessant interest in Carrier. This interest culminates with Chess inviting Carrier to a mysterious late night formal supper. Chess and the other four guests, all individuals of wildly disparate backgrounds, treat Carrier well. He cannot help but feel, however, that he is there more to be observed and evaluated than anything else.Almost simultaneously Carrier begins to receive a mysterious series of seemingly unconnected articles and messages through the hospital mailing system, correspondences that seem to be aiming him toward the identity of the true murderer of Banks and the other women. Kellerman, already a master of the suspense novel, takes the genre to new places here. Carrier is an empathetic psychologist, a master at sharing emotion with his patients, but he is not a detective. He lurches, in fits and starts, toward the true identity of the murderer, who is set to strike someone close to Carrier once again.Carrier is a highly believable character. He is capable of giving comfort to his patients, even to those who seem unreachable, but is slow to accept and receive such comfort himself. Kellerman's account of Carrier's initial encounters with Rios is absolutely first-rate. What is even more remarkable, however, is Kellerman's ability to infuse his novels, and particularly this one, with realistic minor characters, who sometimes enter and exit within the space of a single page. One such character is a woman whom Carrier encounters while she is sweeping out a vacated bookstore in a building that is scheduled for demolition. The dialogue between the two characters goes on but for a few sentences, yet the woman's portrayal, primarily conveyed through her comments regarding her own behavior, is perfect. A character like this is not the stuff of literature so much as she is the essence of life. Even if her actions make no logical sense to her, the reader understands them immediately.Carrier certainly has the potential to be an ongoing, sustaining character. He is too good a character to limit to one novel, even one as fine as THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist at City Central Hospital. Jeremy spends all his time at the hospital, mostly to forget the painful memories of his relationship to nurse Jocelyn Banks. Jocelyn and Jeremy didn't break up, Jocelyn was murdered and her killer still roams free.As Jeremy is struggling to get on with his life a new string of murders rocks the hospital...murders committed in the same fashion as that of Jocelyn, and Jeremy is the prime suspect.Trying to clear his name and catch a killer, Jeremy begins his own investigation which leads him to a dark secret being kept within the hospital's walls, and as more information is found out he is drawn into a game of cat and mouse with a diabolical killer.\`The Conspiracy Club' starts off slow and picks up speed about half way through. The first half of the novel is a character development study with some medical drama thrown in for good measure. The second half kicks in with the murders and the action that leads up to a satisfactory climax. This novel is well written and easy to read, as you would expect from Jonathan Kellerman, but the thriller aspects come into play a little too late into the novel to compare it to some of his best work.Jonathan Kellerman has introduced a new character (Jeremy Carrier) in a novel that could have been explosive...the plot is very interesting, the characters are all likable and the plot twists do surprise, but...Kellerman takes too long to get things cookin and when they do the novel ends.Fans of Jonathan Kellerman and his Alex Delaware series will welcome the introduction of the new character but will only be mildly satisfied with this new novel.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware novels, and rightfully so. When an author wants to break from a popular character, there's always the possibility of scepticism from the readers. Some authors are able to make this work (Jeffrey Deaver, for example). Others fall flat, as Mr. Kellerman has on this one. I honestly don't know what happened here. This is perhaps the slowest paced novel I've ever read from a veteran author. How this ever got past his agent or editor I'll never know. You are well over halfway through the book before anything happens, and I'm not exaggerating here in the least. It's almost like following someone's boring life with morbid curiousity for a while, waiting for something to go wrong. The ending, when it mercifully comes, isn't worth the build up. The Conspiracy Club from the book's title really doesn't do anything that a single character couldn't have done. It's like this is a novel he'd written years ago but put away and suddenly he had a deadline and had to grab it. The potential for a great story was here, but it would have meant losing the first half of the book and starting from there. I look forward to his next novel, but I hope it'll be back to his old standard of great storytelling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am about to bail. Its the lavish meal that did it. That's a first for me in a Kellerman book. I came to these reviews convinced &quot;The Conspiracy Club&quot; was Kellerman's first manuscript, written thirty or more years ago, rejected, and surfacing now to give readers a glimpse of how much he had developed.

I was hoping &quot;The Conspiracy Club&quot; would bring him out of the rut he seems to have fallen into, but for me, this book only proves he has run out of motivation or has become bored with writing.I am beginning to wonder when the publishing world will grow tired of continually feeding to the reading world mundane works from formerly best-selling authors (i.e. Cornwell, Patterson, Clancy, Kellerman, et.)and instead focus on more talented, unknown authors.

I have been reading JK for over 10 years and have read almost every book of his.

He spent more time building a love relationship between the main character and his girlfriend than he did solving the crime.1 word: BORING! If you are a fan of JK, don't buy this one. It has strayed too far from his main type of storyline."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As an avid Kellerman fan I was very disappointed in this book. ... The Conspiracy Club was slow and boring, the characters are one-dimensional and did not engage me.

I was thrilled to learn there was a new book by Jonathan that was not an Alex Delaware story. I very much enjoy series books and getting to know and like (or hate) the &quot;regulars&quot;. Sort of a soap opera behind the current plot thing. I was very excited to get to know the new characters in this book. It typically takes me about 2-3 days to finish a Kellerman novel (his or hers) I worked on reading this book for about two weeks. I made it about half way through this book. When I realized I dreaded reading anymore of it and really wasn't caring what was going to happen next I gave up. I tried skimming the second half reading a sentence here and there so I could find out the ending. I still couldn't figure out what was going on. It didn't matter though, by this point I really did not care how the book ended. I hope this will be a stand alone book and the characters will not continue on in another book. All in all this book was a major disappointment. Not at all of the calibar I have come to expect from Mr. Kellerman."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"When I saw a new Kellerman book, I snapped it right up and went right home to read it. I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN!! Guess what? When I finished it--still nothing. And Jeffrey was not even an interesting character. Why do authors who have great books and great characters have to leave them behind and do something DIFFERENT? Bah Humbug!!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I usually enjoy the author's works, even the non-Alex Delaware ones, but not this one. I agree with the other reviewers that the characters were flat, some of the plot lines were never tied together well, and that the setting hints that this was a discarded attempt from the past that Kellerman rescued from the trash can...But my main beef with this novel is the language! In some of his Alex Delaware novels, Kellerman turns off my interest with his grandeose architectual descriptions (I often think if he hadn't been a psychologist he would have been an architect), but this book is STUFFED with pompous, over-the-top language. I chuckled out loud at the reviewer who said he/she had multiple English degrees but still had to constantly run to the dictionary to look up Kellerman's obscure word choices. Kellerman's descriptions and dialogue during the secret dinner with Jeremy and the old eccentrics was just plain laughable.One reviewer said it best when they said that they language was \\"forced, bombasic, and esoteric\\". Trust me - this book is painful drudgery to read for such a small payoff."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"How lame is the plot of THE CONSPIRACY CLUB? So lame that even Kellerman realizes it. Because he takes this \\"plot\\", with the same red herrings, twists, and \\"the old switcheroo on who the real killer is\\", and recycled it into half of his next Petra Connor series entry, TWISTED."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was one of the best Jonathan Kellerman books I read in quite awhile. Really good character developement and a plot that is laid out perfectly. In past Kellerman books the detail of everything was too extreme for me at times. Conspiracy Club didn't slow down due to details but keep a fast pace going at all times. Looking forward to reading more from Kellerman."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is a very good author. Many years ago, on one of his first books, he got a blurb from Stephen King, saying he'd revived the Private Eye novel singlehandedly. I don't know about that, but he has done a lot, and the books he writes are very interesting. The style that he uses is interesting, and you can tell that he works at the prose and the characters.The Conspiracy Club is a complete departure for him. Most of his novels are technology-driven to an extent anyway, and the characters and action are reasonably rational. The atmosphere, such as it is, comes from the city they're in, the tension between the characters, that sort of thing. And there's a plot, generally a fast-moving one with twists and turns, false clues and real killers.Here, instead, we have what's almost a Gothic Romance novel. Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a shrink at a hospital in a nameless easter city (ala Scott Turow). His live-in girlfriend was killed six months before the start of the book, and he was the chief suspect, but the police could never develop enough evidence to arrest him. He wanders through the first hundred pages or so of the book, not really sure why he's so suspicious of everyone, meeting interesting people and not being sure what their motivations are.Somewhere in there, it becomes obvious that something's going on, but what it is remains murky and indistinct for most of the book. It's clear it has to do with the girlfriend's murder, but not how or why. As Jeremy slowly burrows his way through the mystery, following leads and suspects, we begin to suspect that someone else is controlling the pace, somehow, but we're not sure.This is an interesting, atmospheric novel. There's not as much plot, or as many twists, as the usual Alex Delaware novel, but there are enough for the usual reader. The characters, however, and the atmosphere, are palpable, and this is what shines through: Kellerman's skill with prose is undeniable.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jeremy Carrier's girlfriend has been brutally murdered and the police believe he did the deed. Grief keeps Jeremy isolated until a fellow Doctor convinces him to join him at a very private club. As Carrier starts to open up his life to others, mysterious messages begin to appear, messages that Jeremy hopes will lead to the killer. Once again Jonathan Kellerman draws readers into a twisted tale that will enthrall and hold you captive to the last page.Beverly J Scott author of RIGHTEOUS REVENGE, RUTH FEVER, and JENA'S CHOICE."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Although it took a couple of chapters to get beyond Dr. Delaware and the rest of my &quot;friends&quot;, the book had the same sub-plots and twists that will be familiar to all Kellerman readers and then ends with what could/should be the start of a fantastic new series of novels. I'm sure I'll miss Alex and Milo, but the CCC sets the stage for more complicated and interesting stories!Kellerman is one of the best insightful mystery author's around today!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As an avid fan of the Delaware series, I was thrilled to read a stand alone book of Kellermans that was a gripping story. I often find with authors of this genre that when they depart from their usual characters, their writing leaves much to be desired. Kellerman, however, does not disappoint - but regular readers will feel that the main character is not that dis-similar to Alex Delaware. I enjoyed this book, and would like to see Jeremy developed more in future novels - having said that - I am looing forward to reading the new Delaware book as soon as it is available."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"An Audie Award isn't the only prize on actor/director David Birney's professional shelf. He won raves for his role on TV's &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere,&quot; as well as critical acclaim for his stage adaptation of &quot;The Diary of Adam and Eve.&quot;His reading of Jonathan Kellerman's latest also deserves raves as he gives voice to a man caught in an ever tightening web of danger and deceit.Rob Kahn's vocal presentation of the Unabridged version is quite different, yet equally compelling as he gradually reveals the slowly closing trap hero Dr. Jeremy Carrier finds himself in.Among his many other attributes Jonathan Kellerman has a knack for inventing appealing protagonists. Alex Delaware, the lead in numerous Kellerman thrillers, won a host of readers, and we predict that Jeremy Carrier will do the same.Romance quickly turns to heartache and grief when Carrier's lover, nurse Jocelyn Banks, is kidnaped and murdered. Not just slain but brutally, insanely murdered. Lacking suspects the police cast a wary eye on the young doctor. He turns to work as an escape from a loss he cannot forget and labors as staff psychologist at City Central Hospital.Then, more young women are murdered in the same macabre manner. It will take more than a degree in psychology for Carrier to figure out who could be capable of such heinous acts despite a plethora of anonymous clues. Are these clues to help him or to draw him even deeper into a dark abyss?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read all of his books. The plot of this one is a bit too familiar. Psychologist help police solve brutal killings. And there's even a Robin-esque woman by this side, but not too involved in the murderish goings on.I hope he brings back Milo and Alex -- why try to remake the original characters, when they are already done so well."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I thought that I was not going to enjoy this novel very much because of the change in main character. I haven't read all the Delaware novels yet, but I enjoyed enormously those I have read. In the Conspiracy Club Kellerman sticks to what has made him a best-selling author...a psychologist involved in a mystery as main character.After his girlfriend is murdered in a gruesome manner, Dr. Jeremy Carrier is considered the main suspect by the police. As other girls are murdered this suspicion intensifies and Jeremy finds himself looking for the killer with the help of a stranger that sends anonymous messages and clues to him through the hospital mail. The clues started coming after he was invited to a &quot;secret&quot; dinner by one of the doctors on staff, Dr. Chess. In this dinner Jeremy met four very intriguing elderly people that piqued his curiosity and whose backgrounds are part of the solution to the mystery.The novel is very well written and keeps you on edge, presenting a considerable variety of suspects and a very interesting plot. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I suppose not liking this book is my fault. I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a &quot;stand alone&quot; type of novel. Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series. I wouldn't recommend your purchasing this one but borrowing from your public library. The story line isn't even that imaginative nor able to captivate and hold your attention for the length of the book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In this novel, author Kellerman has taken a break from his series of books about psychologist Alex Delaware to offer us a new main character, Jeremy Carrier. Although Jeremy is also a psychologist, he is younger than Delaware and practices in a hospital (as opposed to Delaware's private practice). Yes, he does become involved in a series of mysterious murders--including the murder of his own girlfriend--but unlike Delaware, Jeremy is working on his own rather than with the police.Although this book definitely contains some similarities to the Delaware series, Kellerman has done a nice job of creating an interesting new cast of characters. Furthermore, the use of a new protagonist has allowed him to break away from the staleness of the recent Delaware books and to return to some of the energy and intensity of his earlier works. While not as good as Kellerman's best non-Delaware novel, The Butcher's Theater, The Conspiracy Club reminds the reader of Kellerman's continued potential for writing great works of suspense."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In &quot;The Conspiracy Club, Jonathan Kellerman departs from his Alex Delaware series with a new protagonist who is moodier and has more of an edge. Jeremy Carrier, a staff psychologist at City Central hospital, is a loner who becomes emotionally distant when his lover is brutally slain. He is unsure of his worth as a psychologist and mistrustful of the motives of others. When he is approached by an elderly eccentric pathologist named Arthur Chess, Jeremy tries to avoid him. However, through persistence and an invitation to a sumptuous but odd dinner meeting with a group of retired intellectuals, Dr. Chess draws Jeremy into pondering violence and virtue and leads him to question his role in this strange circle of friends. Jeremy begins to receive cryptic journal articles and postcards that draw his attention to a series of violent murders. He suddenly finds himself the prime suspect of these gruesome deeds and harassed by a homicide detective. As the clock ticks down, Jeremy must track down a psychopath to protect the new love of his life and to prove his own innocence.This is typical Kellerman fare, reminiscent of his previous novel &quot;The Murder Book.&quot; In both stories, the protagonists are given a series of enigmatic clues by persons unknown and then left to follow their crooked trail wherever it might lead. Although the story starts off slowly while developing Jeremy's tortured soul, it picks up speed and ends with a twist. The book contains thought-provoking ideas on the nature and origin of violent behavior and is an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Lame plot, stale characters, and it takes over half the book for anything at all to happen. So much of this book is useless filler, I can't believe it even got published."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I really enjoy reading Jonathan Kellerman's novels, and THE CONSPIRACY CLUB was no different. This novel, however, does not feature Dr. Alex Delaware, the protagonist of most of Kellerman's books. It is instead a standalone novel featuring a much younger (and troubled) protagonist, 32-year old Dr. Jason Carrier.This novel is much slower paced than the Delaware books, and takes a long time to get started. The \\"mystery\\" in this book is also impossible to solve because Kellerman withholds key information until the last minute. So if you're looking for a tightly written plot that plays fair with the reader, you may be dissatisfied with THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.Still, this novel is fun because Kellerman's writing is so good. I found the dialogue and descriptions in THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to be first-rate. Most of the characters in this book strike me as real people, flawed but decent. The romantic relationship that develops in this book is very well done. The descriptions of the day-to-day routine of a psychologist at a large hospital are fascinating to read and sound true-to-life.This novel doesn't entirely work as a thriller, but I enjoyed it for what it was. If you like Kellerman's style of writing, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is a good choice. I give him credit for trying something different. On the other hand, if you're trying Kellerman for the first time, I would recommend his early Alex Delaware books instead, because they are much more exciting and fast-paced.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels. This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning. I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted. It turned out to be very well worth it. This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim. Eh? Got the hairs standing up? He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening. As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to. This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning. Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery. Loved it!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Thus you should like it or dislike it depending on whether or not you enjoy psychological, steady-paced, well-plotted mysteries, such as those by P.D. James and Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine). People who want a speedy, thrilling, more violent page turner like the Alex Delaware books, may be in for a disappointment (which I believe is reflected in many comments here). I do like the Delaware books (though I confess my favorite characters are Milo Sturgis and the city of Los Angeles; I find Dr. Delaware often whiny and Robin a total you-know-what -- and I'm female), but I liked this one as well. It's just different, that's all. To me the central mystery wasn't about the serial killer, it was about the Conspiracy Club, and whether or not they were actually steering the psychologist protagonist, or perhaps he instead is losing it emotionally and mentally. Is he being persecuted by the police, set up by the Club (for good or ill), set up by the killer, or just insane? The medical references, often involving cancers, surgeries, and serious activities (Tumor Boards, the Morbidity and Mortality Boards, etc.) to me added an ominous, building sense of inexorable tension to the atmosphere of the story. Very finely done. I couldn't wait to see what happened...the best recommendation for any story. If you're looking for a roller coaster thrill ride, however, you should probably wait for another Delaware book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and \\"traveling and learning\\" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I stumbled into an Alex Delaware novel long ago and was completely taken in. A long time after THAT, I discovered that there were more novels written about this same character and I quickly became a fan of Mr. Kellerman's books. I bought The Conspiracy Club hoping it was of the same standards as the Alex Delaware novels.I was disappointed. This book seems like a rush job, with things going on all over the place and no clear path to anything. I'm all for new characters and new novels, but I had expected this book would be as good as his previous ones...those I can't put down! This one's hard to pick up!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Wow, I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman's novels for years now, and while I particularly enjoy the Alex Delaware series, until now I've enjoyed his stand alone novels just as much.The only reason I struggled to finish the book was because it was a JK novel, but believe me, it really WAS a struggle. It's possible that some of the reason is that the setting itself is fictional; despite long narratives about the setting and its environs, I still never got a real feel for the area.I also didn't find any of the chracters likeable; whether they are good guys or bad guys, or somewhere in between, I can usually identify with the characters in some way. Like them, hate them, are they funny, smart? I just really didn't CARE.The second star is only because somewhere after page 200, the \\"action\\" started to pick up and make some sense, and THERE was the Jonathan Kellerman writing I've come to love, expect, and respect.Hopefully this was just a fluke. If nothing else, at least it's apparent I'm not the only one who feels this way."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"A decent story but too wordy and full of itself. I found myself wondering about this book when I wasn't reading it but when I picked it up, it was predictible and left too many ends dangling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The author is reusing a similar plot device than in \\"Twisted\\": a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish: (\\"favilla\\", \\"favillitos\\"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.In sum, a book carelessly executed."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"\\"The Conspiracy club\\" is told through the eyes of Jeremy Carrier, a psychologist at City Central Hospital. Throughout the story Jeremy tries to come to terms with the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Jocelyn. Other murders in the area occur in the same fashion and it's apparent that a serial killer is responsible. Although, Jeremy is a primary suspect for the murders and is harrassed by the police, he begins to investigate the murders himself to find the killer. He begins a friendship with the eccentric Dr. Chess, who is himself interested in the causes of bad behavior and evil.I found my first book by Kellerman to be entertaining,but has a depressing tone throughout and contains characters that seem a little one dimensional. Still at times, Kellerman seems extremely insightful in his descriptions of human interaction. I plan on checking out some more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Another awesome Jonathan Kellerman book! He's a clinical psychologist with characters that are psychologists, namely Alex Delaware, who is in many books. In the case of The Conspiracy Club, Kellerman created a new character, Jeremy Carrier. This book got me from the first sentence: \\"Raging emotions, dead tissue.\\" From there, Kellerman takes the reader on a ride as spectacular as any amusement park can send you on. From an aging forensic pathologist and a group of unlikely friends, Carrier obtains cryptic clues to a serial killer who most likely also killed Carrier's wife.Carrier becomes a suspect as he discovers the serial killer is most likely a doctor who knows how to dissect people using laser technology. Carrier is a staff psychologist at a hospital where a couple of other suspects in the crimes work, including his girlfriend, Angela Rios, who is also a doctor. Jeremy begins working to solve the mystery because police are misguided and he realizes the killer might have also killed his wife. This takes him into the bowels of a high-rise building to catch the culprit.Jeremy's interviews with patients along the way include a cancer patient who probably got another illness due to something wrong in the treatment of his cancer the first time. The book takes the reader into the mind of Jeremy and shows what goes on in the work life of a psychologist. Particularly humorous is when Jeremy must take all of his patients and act like he's interested on the same day he thinks he figured out the killer's identity!Overall, a treat to any reader of mystery and thrillers, particular anyone who has read any of Kellerman's other novels. I'm hooked -- I've got to read each one, now!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Jonathan Kellerman, a hit-or-miss writer with more misses in recent years, has something in the middle with the Conspiracy Club, a rather average thriller that takes a break from series character Alex Delaware to present a similar character named Jeremy Carrier. Carrier is a psychologist who is recovering from the murder of his girlfriend, a death that is more devastating because he is a suspect in the crime. He is drawn out of his funk by two people: Arthur Chess, a retired pathologist whose mysterious actions start to point Carrier towards the real killer, and Angela Rios, a doctor who he starts dating.As if working a puzzle, Carrier is presented piece by piece the solution to the murder. This is not a whodunit: there is no way the reader can figure out the killer before Carrier does. In addition, the reason behind Carrier's manipulation is not that plausible; there are easier ways to do things that seem to escape the characters.I have said for a while that Alex Delaware has become more and more of a nondescript, boring character (although there has been a little improvement in recent books). Carrier seems to be Kellerman's attempt to recreate Delaware under a new name. There is even a cop in this story named Doresh who has a similar gruffness to Milo Sturgis, although Doresh and Carrier have a more antagonistic relationship.The last time Kellerman did a non-Delaware novel, he excelled with Billy Straight; this effort is okay, but not as successful. Although it does have its problems, this book is a generally entertaining read, neither exceptionally good or bad. It is strictly a three star work, of more interest to Kellerman fans than to mystery fans in general."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have read all the Alex Delaware books and have been disappointed in the last couple. When I saw he had invented a new protagonist I hoped for something new and different. Instead I read a less skillful version of the Alex Delaware books, and I think I know why: The Conspiracy Club feels like an old, long-neglected first shot at writing a thriller, reworked enough for publication, but not enough to be a good book.Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist who works in a hospital in an unnamed Midwestern city. Alex Delaware, remember, spent his early life in the midwest. Carrier drives a Nova, and another character has a Falcon in his garage. Novas haven't been made since 1979, Falcons since 1970. So I think Kellerman probably started the book in the '70s. But it had a lot of work done on it in the '80s or early '90s. All the doctors have pagers, but none has a cellphone, a laptop, or any other of the gadgets we take for granted today. The hospital computer has a 2400 baud modem. We are told it is old, but it's safe to say that no institution has had that slow a modem for over a decade. Carrier uses it to connect to a database at a local newspaper, after paying a fee. He has never heard of Google, or apparently even of the web.There has been some updating, especially near the end, and it is not coincidental that the pace picks up in the later pages. I think Kellerman stuck his manuscript in a drawer in the early '70s, pulled it out and worked it up 15 or 20 years ago, and then finally did a bit of rewriting recently to whip it into shape for publication. The result is as you might expect: amateurish in places, with an unconnected feel.The Conspiracy Club is acceptable to pass the time, but I don't believe anyone who knows and likes the Delaware series will feel the need to read more about Jeremy Carrier, and I doubt that Kellerman has any intention of writing more books about him."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I read everthing Jonathan Kellerman and I'm a great fan but this outing was not his best. I agree with many of the reviewers who were dismayed by the lack of character development of the CCC members, the long drawn out path to the final conclusion, the somewhat irritating and whiney main character and the quick resolution of the plot. The story line was great but the execution was puzzling. But--as someone else said--Jonathan is allowed a stumble or two. We still love him!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"If this was my first Kellerman novel I would have been captivated. Kellerman has a unique writting style which I believe captivates and keeps his fans coming back for more. But Conspiracy Club was not his best. I was disappointed by the lack of development of the \\"Club\\" members characters. I also found Jeremy Carrier rather boring. Though it ended with Kellerman flare, I fear it was a case of \\"too little too late...\\"not his usual page turner.But Kellerman cannot please everybody all the time, and he is allowed the odd bad book, as long as he follows it up with a smasher like Therapy."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Very dissapointing. As a huge fan of the Alex Delaware novels and Jonathan Kellerman's style of writing, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found the main character, Jeremy Carrier, to be sad, whiny and an all around boring guy! The story took forever to develop and by the time it did I had stopped caring what happened. He spent too much time introducting characters that ending up having little or nothing to do with the plot. I was surprised at some of the twists near the end, but they weren't enough for me to recommend this book. I finished reading it only to find out \\"who done it\\". I recently read his new novel \\"Therapy\\" which I would recommmend along with most of the other Delware novels."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I too have been a great Kellerman fan, and have read all his books. But this one is bad, and not just because it isn't Alex Delaware or because it has little if any real plot. It's the style, something I don't remember from the earlier books. One reader noticed the annoying short chapters, a trend from some other \\"thriller\\" writers.What I noticed was the page after page of one sentence paragraphs.Or one phrase paragraphs.Supposed to make us feel breathless, I guess.But really more like [Dick and Jane]."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I generally don't like it when my authors go off on tangents and write something else other than what they got me hooked with. I loved the first Alex Delaware novel and became an avid reader of all his adventures.I was mildly disappointed to find that The Conspiracy Club wasn't a Delaware novel, but when I discovered that the protagonist was a psychologist, I decided it might not be too bad.It wasn't too bad. It took me longer to become engaged in Carrier's adventures than it does with Delaware. I also found the plot development to be somewhat ponderous. The book moved turgidly in the beginning and the premise seemed just a little bizarre. Of course it all became clear at the end, which I suppose is what an author shoots for, but it doesn't make for a really gripping book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The Conspiracy Club is told in an odd third party set up...it works...but I was expecting a twist of fate, or another character to come into play.The story is fresh, and offers a new set of characters for Jonathan Kellerman to expand upon.

I immediately liked the newness, and background of this book.A good change of pace, keep it up."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid Kellerman reader &amp; I've read many reviews from people who have bashed him having read only one book out of his Alex Delarware series &amp; am highly disappointed that they would consider themselves an expert on good novels having not been privy to the character developments. However, w/ the introduction of a new central character, I found myself in this position of having to learn to warm up to a new hero. I read the first chapter on a website before the book was released &amp; figured I would NEVER read the book, but out of boredom I dove into it w/ an open mind &amp; found by the 3rd chapter I was enthralled &amp; intrigued by Dr. Carrier. And although I hope he doesn't completely abandon the characters we've grown to love in the Alex Delaware novels, I do hope to hear much more about the new characters as well. Although these characters are very similar, i feel for people who read Series novels, it's a great way to get the quality you enjoy and still mix it up w/ out all the redundancy that comes w/ having to read the descriptions of all the same people, places, &amp; things you've been reading about for years."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"New characters, setting and purpose hold the readers attention.

I want desperately for Kellerman's latest to be up to his high standard and be the 5-star thriller other readers have reviewed, but for now it isn't. So I'll try again...later...and lower my expectations. Maybe that will work."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Nice to see a non-Alex Delaware novel, as Kellerman was losing his edge with this character.

Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it \\"re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,\\" was \\"gripping\\" and \\"intricately plotted.\\" I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring.

Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As a huge fan of early-middle period Alex Delaware novels (sorry, but all the post-&quot;Billy Straight&quot; novels have been weak), I was looking foward to a non-Delaware Kellerman novel. The facts are these: the mystery doesn't work very well. The way the author sets up clues, has his protag investigating this mystery, and his style of plotting are dense, but ultimately unfullfilling if you're a mystery buff. The reason I liked this novel was its main character, Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Kellerman has written a very-believable, three dimensional human who even in the tedious parts of the story, keeps you interested in what's going on. I liked the romance (usually a weak part of a mystery novel) between Carrier and the nurse Angela. Very realistic and interesting. Overall, I'd say that Carrier, his relationship with Angela and Dr. Chess are what kept me into the book. If you're looking for shoot-em-up action packed novels that read like a movie, I suggest anything by James Patterson, Greg Iles, or John Sanford. But most Kellerman fans should be pleased."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Is this reall written by Kellerman?? Why do authors DO this; abandon a character that the public likes....see Patricia Cornwell's HORRIBLE Isle of Dogs when she dropped Kay Scarpetta...where are Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis?? One reviewer referrred to them as &quot;stale&quot; ??? Not to me; I want more. I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money. I hope he or his staff reads these reviews, This character is weak and the whole story is simply NOT what I was expecting. Mr. Kellerman please bring back Dr. Delaware!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love the Delaware books, but was pleasantly surprised by this change of character. It was intellectually stimulating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Kellerman really seemed to be writing about subject matter he is obviously well-versed in, without making it too banal or over my head. I cannot understand some of the negative reviews, but to each his own. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I also did not know I'd be missing Dr. Delaware in this book. I was quite happy to embrace a new protagonist. Jeremy is so very human in all his feelings and responses. I enjoyed seeing him become interested in Dr. Chess despite his earlier standoffishness. I think that it is a mistake to expect an author to continue churning out books all using the same protagonist. I like the fact that Mr. Kellerman has chosen someone new, whether we see him again or not!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I used to read Jonathan Kellerman's books pretty regularly, but stopped buying them as they came out--more because of budgetary restrictions than anything else. They were always pretty good, but not good enough to make me keep up with them when money was tight. That being said, I've had two of his books on my bookshelves for quite awhile and thought it was time I got around to reading one of them.The Conspiracy Club is a stand-alone novel from Bellman, who departs from his Alex Delaware series to introduce Jeremy Carrier. Jeremy is a psychologist who is half-heartedly getting back on his feet following the recent murder of his girlfriend. The police have never identified her killer and have not ruled him out as a suspect. When other women start to disappear as well, Jeremy finds himself under additional scrutiny by the detective in charge of his girlfriend's case. While this is going on, Jeremy receives an invitation to dine with an exclusive group of individuals who he discovers have each experienced a similar unresolved loss in their past and who have an intense interest in the nature of evil.The Conspiracy Club was a decent book, but nothing special. The story takes a while to become engaging and Kellerman's attempt to shake things up with a little twist at the end left me inimpressed and ready to move on to the next book on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love his books and this is just another one in a long line of good novels. Thank you for your work ."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"What else you can expect from Jonathan Kellerman, well a continuous page turner. The only issue was that I could not turn the pages as what I was reading was a Kindle edition :). Not only I would highly recommend this book for all the thrill, simplicity of the characters and the great language but I would also recommend Kindle PaperWhite. I was quite anxious before buying that and was real concerned if it would be able to give the reading experience which you get out of turning the pages but now I can't keep it aside."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was enthralled from the first sentence. Jonathan Kellerman is a very accomplished author and well deserves his spot as one of the top thriller writers. I love his writing style, his detailed descriptions and his skill to keep you guessing all the way. I had all sorts of theories, from suspecting Dr Chess and his group in sinister plots and in the end I still did not get it right. Super read. I can highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Love Kellerman ... this was a fun mystery to unfold with a good protagonist in Dr Jeremy Carrier. And when it comes to a head, it's solved and over in a flash. Neatly done. As always, Kellerman delivers!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was not up to the usual standards of Kellerman's work.... no flow for me. I have been an Alex Delaware fan since he first started years ago... this is the first book of Kellerman's that left me cold. Hope this isn't a trend."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I hadn't read this author. He's a good enough writer I got to about 100 pages, but it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Might read something else of his eventually."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a huge Kellerman fan; own all of his books and love them all including Billy Straight and The Butcher's theater; both non-Delaware books. This one is just plain a miss. The characters never strike a note, the book is made up of 50 some chapters often 1 or 2 pages long, seemingly inflating a short story to a 280 page novel; a trend I think started by Mr. Patterson, and one I despise. 25 bucks for a 280 page book that is actually about 220? And the ending; I for one hate books that introduce the murderer 4/5'ths of the way thru. Pass this one; if you don't have all of the other Kellerman books, treat yourself and pick up one or two that are already published."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I, too, have been very into the Alex Delaware novels and was so excited about this one coming out. I was also disappointed when I found out it had a new main character (after I checked the book out), but was willing to give it a fair chance. I had to fight to stay awake almost 100 pages into this book, as it went nowhere! Arthur Chess is such a pointless character and the conversations they have are as boring as a forced lecture in college. Bottom line, if you have not read the previous books with Alex in them, go back a few in the series and read those. Save yourself the time on this one!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a big fan of Kellerman and have listened to most of the Alex Delaware novels, but I stopped listening after completing the second CD (out of 8) in this set. I found the medical jargon depressing, overdone, and totally irrelevent to the puzzle (which I assume was discovering the identity of the serial killer). Also, I didn't think the characters were particularly likeable. I won't stop listening to the Alex Delaware stories read by the terrific John Rubenstein, but I wish I'd passed on this book. The story was weak and the reader (Rob Kahn) was even weaker. Maybe listening to the edition read by David Birney would have been better."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This is the first J. Kellerman book I've read. Other reviews will inform you better about the plot itself. My small contribution will focus on the story's degree of suspense. The entire work is only 375 pages. I found that it was not very gripping at all until around page 200. Therefore, I'd rate pages 1-200 with just ONE STAR but pages 200-375 with FOUR STARS. The first 200 pages for me were too full of medical jargon and mundane details of characters lives that failed to interest me. I'm glad I read on. I'd recommend, however, that you either borrow a copy or wait for the paperback! It's the book equivalent of a wait-for-the-video flick in the theaters!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Kellerman has lost it! Years ago, when I first discovered his books, I could not put them down. Now I read them through our local book club as punishment. He has become blas&eacute;, predictable, self-involved and should be put out to pasture. I sometimes wonder if he has a secretary who fills in the gaps once he has decided on the storyline. Never again, not even for our book club."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am an avid reader and huge Johathan Kellerman fan. I have read many of his books and was excited to read his latest novel. This is the first time in years I actually stopped reading a book in the middle out of interminable boredom. This book is extremely slow moving. Too much description and not enough action. It was as if someone else wrote the novel under Jonathan Kellerman's name. The language seemed forced, bombastic, and esoteric. What a huge dissapointment. The only recommendation I would give for this book is to ask for your money back."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I have read every one of Kellerman's books and also have multiple degrees in English. So why am I running to the dictionary every 3 pages? Scrofulous? Remora? Come on......It detracts from the storyline and is pretentious. Give me Alex Delaware and easy reading anytime."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Conspiracy Club is either Kellerman's first manuscript (which may be correct given the type of clinical practice of the main character - comparable to Dr. Kellerman's early years in psychology), or a more recent manuscript written in a week. Overall, it is much more comparable to the Billy Straight novels than the usual enjoyable Delaware fare. From the perspective of a practicing psychologist, Dr. Carrier is no Alex Delaware - and isn't much of a psychologist either. He has at least as much psychopathology as any other character in the book; and that's not entertaining. Other characters are inadequately developed, the plot is convoluted, and the rush to conclusion is too improbable to believe - even when attempting to suspend reality for the sake of entertainment. Kellerman has done a lot for mystery readers and for psychologists; Let's hope that he bounces back again and produces another carefully thought out psychological mystery. Kellerman can be a good producer of interesting and intricate characters and story lines; we want and expect better than this. This one will be on my bookshelf, but only to complete the Kellerman work product."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I hoped that with a new protagonist, Jonathan Kellerman would once again come through with a goodd read, but I found this as bad as most of his recent Alex Delaware novels have been. There is no comparison between the early Alex Delaware novels. The Butcher's Theater (the best) and his recent books. Maybe he shoult take a rest."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"As tired as I've gotten of Alex and Robin's love trials, I couldn't help but miss that dysfunctional and self-important duo while reading \\"Conspiracy Club.\\" This book's main character, Jeremy Carrier, never comes to life and his adventures sound like Kellerman is phoning it in. . On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas! As much as he gets on my nerves, at least he got a bit more to him than a \\"tragic secret.\\""},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Hard to get into, I am accustomed to getting into one of his books and not putting it down until I finish it. This book is taking me weeks to finish. It just has not grabbed my attention. I say, &quot;Bring back Alex Deleware!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Six months may have passed since Jocelyn Banks was brutally murdered, but her lover Dr. Jeremy Carrier remains despondent as he knows first hand that time does not heal all wounds. Though the police remain convinced he is the prime suspect, a depressed Jeremy buries himself in his work as a psychiatrist at City Central Hospital because being alone is more difficult to cope with than working with emotionally crippled patients.However his antisocial misanthropic behavior is interrupted when colleague Dr. Arthur Chase hooks Jeremy to attend some social functions of a secret society. As Jeremy begins to come out of his emotional fog, he notices that other women have recently died in the same gruesome manner as his beloved. Clues begin appearing for no apparent reason. Realizing he must act alone as the police seem to be closing in on him as the serial killer, Jeremy begins investigating a cat and mouse terror game with someone guiding him, but is that someone the killer?More a combination conspiracy amateur sleuth tale than a medical thriller, Jonathan Kellerman's latest tale is an exciting story that hooks the audience the moment Dr. Chase breaks down the first of Jeremy's survival barriers. From that moment the story line is fast-paced filled with red herrings as everyone seems garbed in a masquerade (though not the same type of plot, this reviewer kept thinking of the List of Adrian Messenger). The \\"conspiracy\\" seems a bit odd and off kilter, but fans will value this exhilarating look at vengeance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm not even finished with this book, but feel compelled to write a 9 star review!!! While I love Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, this one has gripped me, kind of like Billy Straight.I still have about 80 pages to read and am still not sure where this one is going. However, since I started it this morning, I know that this is going to be one of my FAVORITE Kellerman books.Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist whose love, Jocelyn, has been murdered. The police suspect him. Dr. Chess, who works at his hospital, takes an interest in him. An unusual invitation by Chess to a gastronimic feast with some very important people leaves Jeremy confused, especially since Chess has left suddenly for Europe, sending him postcards that read &quot;traveling and learning.&quot;Jeremy is also getting inter-office mail not addressed to him specifically, and is very confused by the content. He tries to piece together the information. Possibly his new love, Angela, holds the key. Honestly, I don't know...but since I have work to do tonight, I will not be able to find out until tomorrow!I can't wait....honestly, I can't wait.Kellerman, this is one of your best!!! I have never read so far into a book without knowing what the premise is and what the outcome will be. Thank you, thank you, thank you."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I've I always been a grand fan of Jonathan Kellerman, and Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis have remained tried and true over the years. And although Alex and Milo have taken a sabbatical in this richly descriptive book, it was a wonderful read and they were hardly missed.Intrique, personal demons and and suspense are once again brought to the forefront in this exceptional authors latest endeavor.Highly recommended and will be one of the books that I will revisit again in the future."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In my opinion, Johnathan Kellerman's previous character, Alex Deleware, had gotten a little stale. This book is a refreshing introduction of a new character. The action is lively, the plot moves along, and the plot's concept is entertaining. A worthy read."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I could not get into this book. I have the audio version. My mind kept wondering off. I had to stop listening to it half way trough it. I love all the Alex and Milo book. Please keep writing them instead."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In his new novel, the second published in 2003, author Jonathan Kellerman starts fresh and creates an enigmatic plot surrounding a brutal serial killer. Kellerman is familiar to many mystery buffs for his psychologist hero, Alex Delaware, who works as a police consultant in a 17-book series. He's tried different threads before, most notably in 1988. Kellerman's strong ties to Judaism sometimes shine through in his novels, but are not featured, as is the case in wife Faye Kellerman's writings. Religious faith does not play a role in this newest book, but Kellerman keeps it rooted in something he knows much about, psychology.Jeremy Carrier is a hospital psychologist. He's still trying to find his way back into the life he once led, after his girlfriend, nurse Jocelyn Banks, has been brutally murdered. While stumbling through his days, he is befriended by well-known Dr. Arthur Chess, a pathologist old enough to have retired from the hospital, who is sort of an emeritus on hospital committees. Jeremy's initially puzzled by Chess' interest in him.Chess is Jeremy's entree into a secret society of oldsters who are all stars in their own professions, and retired. It takes most of the book for Jeremy to determine what ties them together in &quot;conspiracy&quot; and how he fits it the scheme of things.When Chess goes traveling, a series of enigmatic clues to other murders, similar to Jocelyn's, begin to disturb Jeremy's days. He can't help but wonder what role Chess plays in the mystery. In a parallel plot, Jeremy meets an interesting new love in resident Angela Rios. Between his relationship with her, and his willingness to be drawn into the murder mystery, Jeremy finds himself putting his own life on the line. In addition to an engrossing plot, Kellerman has created a young practitioner with feeling towards his patients and signifcant skill in making a difference.Some Kellerman-like touches (Carrier drives an old Nova; shades of Delaware's vintage Cadillac! Carrier, instead of being enlisted by police detectives to help solve the murders, is actually a viable suspect, but ends up assisting the police.)are present, and you have a nice, tight tale of homicide with a surprise villain and the possiblity of a new series. In particular, the colorful members of the &quot;Conspiracy Club&quot; could be utilized in future books.It seems as though, judging from other reviews, that many of Kellerman's loyalists disagree with my rating.Most probably it is because they just wanted another instalment in Delaware's continuing saga, since the last three books in the series (&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, the excellent &quot;The Murder Book&quot; and &quot;A Cold Heart&quot;) have revived the series from the total drek that Kellerman created in books 10-14. I think many readers gave up on him during that spate. By contrast, I'm intrigued by the fact that he's given the reader a viable alternative to his older series, and hope he continues to revisit Jeremy Carrier in future work.Nice work!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"At last something else besides boring Alex Deleware. The writing is better, the plot more interesting and for now more interesting new characters. Kellerman has recharged his skills with interesting possibilities. More Please!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I love J Kellerman's books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest one. I didn't mind that it is not part of the Ales Delaware &quot;series&quot; - I very much enjoyed Butcher's Theatre, and Billy Straight. But this latest book is so incredibly longwinded and boring! I cannot get into it, I do not care for any of the characters, and I am now on page 278, and still haven't found anything interesting in this book. I will finish it (sometime), just because it is by Jonathan Kellerman. But I think it will go to the 2nd hand bookshop straight away - and I still have all his previous novels, and reread them again and again. PLEASE - no more Dr Carrier!!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Mr. Kellerman wants the reader to believe that psychologists play a major role as medical providers. In his book, Dr. Carrier, a psychologist goes on medical roundswith physicians, is a consultant on the tumor board, is paged by the hospital for emergencies, is in a romance with a physician, and is seemingly requested by every surgeon for preop consults. Poppycock!! These roles describe physicians. A psychologist is not a medical provider. Most psychology degrees are liberal arts degrees not science. I believe Mr. Kellerman has delusions of grandeur regarding the field of psychology. His patientz deserve medical care-not someone to hold their hand and tell them they'll get better.There are many glaring medical errors in this book. The physician Angela recalls how she almost killed someone. She says that she almost injected a dose of insulin that was off by 100 units. It is common knowledge an insulin syringe holds up to 100 units. How could the dose be off by 100? What? She was supposed to give 30 units? And, almost gave 300 in a syringe that only holds up to 100 units. This explains why psychologists shouldn't write medical thrillers-they have have little to no medical knowledge. And,btw physicians rarely draw up or administer shots of insulin most patients are trained to do it themselves. There are other numerous errors. He should get somebody with a medical background to proof-read.He is just so annoying and irritating. I read and finish everything so I groaned when I realized I had picked up another one of his stupid books about the importance of psychologists in medicsl care. I hope if a medical crisis ever happens he has enough sense to csll a physician!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Delivery was timely as promised. The item was the exact quality promised. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I really like this author, and was somewhat disappointed in this book. It kept my interest, but was lacking on the suspense. Sure, the reader wants to figure out who the killer is, and the clues come slowly, but never once was the hero in any danger himself. A kindly old doctor slowly send him the clues to figure out, but that is about it. Not my favorite, but if you are a fan of Kellerman, give it a try."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars. The four categories are: character development (are the characters deep and complex, plot (is it interesting), voice (is the narration smooth and engaging) and cliche level (is it predictable.)Character development: 5 stars--Kellerman is very good at getting inside the head of his charactersPlot: 4 stars-- It took forever but there was a nice twist or twovoice: 5 stars-- Very easy and pleasant to digestcliche level: 3 stars-- The crazy serial killer and the non cop protagonist has been done a bitand this one didn't bring a whole lot that is newI like psychological thrillers and this one was pretty good."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Audio Book review - It wasn't the worst book, but it was very long and droning. However, it was only 5 CDs long, and that is a rather quick read. Something about the narrator or maybe the lack of a gripping plot, made it feel much much longer. In the end it became oddly confusing and I kept trying to remember who all these characters are and what their relations were to one another. Only because it was so long and so full of holes and twists, it became almost boring and hard to pay attention to. However, I can see that Kellerman may be a good writer of other books, so I will give him a chance and pick up another audio boook. It was a good enough book that I kept listening to it. However, I kept listening hoping that something would happen and that all of this time would have a pay off. I was wrong."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman's other books (3-5 stars, the lot), but this book would get 0 if it was an option. The underlying plot makes no sense - a club of do-gooders who somehow identifies a serial killer (it is never explained how), but instead of doing the obvious they guide our hero to solve it - whilst the killer is carrying on killing other victims! Almost needless to say, when our hero eventually does identify the killer, he decides to take matters into his own hands (a poorly motivated distrust of the police is to blame) and gets saved in a typical Kellerman last minute shoot-out (my only serious issue with the Alex Delaware series...) Turns out his mistrust of the cops was misplaced - they end up saving his life.Altogether a poor read - slow paced and a plot that is utterly devoid of logic."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was really enjoying my first read of a Kellerman novel about someone OTHER than Alex Delaware and his constant companion Detective Milo when, just as I got to the climax, I got a real shock: \\"Hey, I've READ this book before!\\" Sure enough, I distinctly remembered one small part of that scene and knew what would happen right after that. And nothing else. Not a single thing. And I'm still scratching my head about when I read it the first time. Still, it was quite a good read the second time, and that's a pretty good recommendation by itself . . . isn't it?At any rate, this book was good enough to make me want to read more of Kellerman's non-Alex Delaware novels, such as \\"Butcher's Theater\\" and \\"Twisted\\" . . . if only to discover that I've read those books before, too."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This book is definitely a diversion from Kellerman's usual psych-thrillers. It has a slower pace, but is deeper and more intricate than many of his other novels.The character development is most excellent. I was interested from the start and remained riveted until the end. The plot keeps you guessing and trying to figure out 'who dunnit', and just when you think you have it, Kellerman takes you down a different road.I was thrilled with this book. It was unexpectedly good and very entertaining. For Christmas I gave it to two people who were also taken by it."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...Not good at all! Really!At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending...."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Ok, I have only finished 2 J Kellerman books, this and \\"Twisted\\". They both have the same \\"solution\\" If I do read anymore of his I will have to watch out for the tricky sibling confusion thing. . . . again."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I was a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, that was until this book! A see-through plot and &quot;the Club&quot; was just bizarre to say the least.Hopefully the next book I read by Kellerman (if I read one again)will be better as this was a waste of my time!"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel.There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's \\"Demolition Angel\\" followed by Lee Child's \\"One Shot\\".The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so.However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels \\"Murder Book\\" & \\"When the Bough Breaks\\" quite some time ago."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I just listened through an unabridged recording of the book.The blurbs should have warned me, \\"...re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions...\\" \\"...Bob Kahn's reading adds suspense to Kellerman's less than original plot...\\" \\"...adds complexity to flat characters...\\"Tried-and-true-and-friggin-predictable-and-boring plot and real flat characters indeed!I know mystery storytelling dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years and basically every writer retells one of a few storylines in his own way. I have generally liked Kellerman's previous books from the Delaware series. But this one just went on and on without any building up of that tingling under your skin that you expect from a good serial killer thriller. When Kellerman finally decides to cut to the chase (on CD #8 out of 8), the end is a total anticlimax. I don't mind anti-climactic endings - I just saw and liked \\"The Constant Gardner\\" - but the previous seven CDs seemed to building up to an all-out nuclear warfare, and I didn't know when it was time to wake up and hear the fat lady sing.The book does no credit to Kellerman's excellent reputation. Where he tries to add emotional depth to an otherwise tepid story, the dialogue and the little soul-stirring twists fall flat. I mean, come on! Stick to your knitting (or whittling or wordsmithy, whatever), man."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I didn't enjoy this book much - we spend too much time \\"in the narrator's head\\", with long drawn-out, repetitive thought processes. The plot was disappointingly predictable, and the tension between the main characters, the detective and Jeremy, was sadly lacking. Kellerman can do much better.."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I usually enjoy the Kellerman books but this is not his best work. Major medical mistakes- Percocet is not an injectable drug, for example! should have been screened. The characters are uninvolving, and the ending a big letdown after all the work to develop characters."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"The Conspiracy Club started slowly, but kept my interest and turned into a page-turner through an exciting and surprising ending. Kellerman takes a break from familiar characters and the L.A. scene to introduce a new protaganist, who is a psychologist on the staff of a hospital in an unidentified city. There is a lot of potential for a new series here. Many times I felt as if I was reading a tale of a young Alex Delaware. However, I found the lack of real city with familiar streets and landmarks very disorienting. Secondly, Conspiracy Club, reminds me of a new house that has not developed any character. Kellerman's writing style seemed distant and shallow (like a lesser writer) particularly in the first half of the book. Basically, the protaganist has to analyze a series of clues, provided by a shadowy character who leaves the scene early in the book, in order to solve the puzzle of the identity of a serial killer. This is very interesting, but the number of hoops he has to go through seems very far-fetched and silly at times. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to others. At the end of the day, Kellerman has written a solid mystery that would have been a great first effort by a new writer."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I'm a long-time Kellerman fan, but I didn't care as much for this novel. It is extremely slow-paced, which is not necessarily a bad thing if there is some feeling of direction or plot movement, but it seemed missing here to me. The story seemed meandering and obscure, and I didn't find the characters to be compelling."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"Many reviews here stated that this novel by Jonathan Kellerman not as good as his other novels with Alex Delaware as a main character. I disagree. It's just different. Despite similar medical background, which could be expected, a lot in this novel, including a pace, is different. Maybe many readers started this novel having certain expectations based on previous Alex Delaware works and got disappointed but this difference doesn't make it worse. Granted, there are a few weaknesses (for example, antics of members of 'conspiracy club' sometimes seems silly or the ending may feel not very convincing) but I totally disagree with reviews that say that this book doesn't have a suspense. Although maybe the book has less action we used to find in the author' other books this one kept me very intrigued. Overall, recommended to all Jonathan Kellerman' fans."},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"In a departure from his Alex Delaware series, Jonathan Kellerman introduces us to Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Dr. Carrier is emotionally traumatized by the death of his girlfriend. She is brutally murdered and Jeremy becomes a prime suspect in her death. He is the staff psychologist at City Central Hospital. There he gets drawn into a unexpected and rather bizarre friendship with pathologist Dr. Arthur Chess. More murders ensue with the police focusing on Jeremy. Dr. Chess slips away supposedly to go on vacation. He leaves Jeremy what amounts to pieces of a puzzle that will help solve the spate of recent killings and to help clear Jeremy of suspicion.I always look forward to Jonathan Kellerman novels. The Alex Delaware series is one of my favorites. I had really high expectations for this book. The first half of the book really dragged. I never connected to any of the characters. The plot was undeveloped. Luckily the second half of the book got more interesting and a bit more suspenseful. Once Jeremy started solving the puzzle Dr. Chess was sending him, the plot really improved and Kellerman's skills were once again evident. The last quarter of the book was a page-turner, unfortunately I expected so much more.First of book: 1 starThird or book: 3 starsFourth of book: 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","review":"I almost never make a big deal about the number of Stars I rate a book, or any other product. The content of my reviews is what counts - that's what's most important. In the case of Jonathan Kellerman's \\"The Conspiracy Club,\\" I make an exception. I think this chilling mystery is an excellent read, and would normally rate it 4 or 4.5 stars. (It is Olympic Game season and I feel like a figure skating judge!!). However, the novel is so original and intelligently written, refreshingly so, that it deserves 5 Stars all the way!!To begin with, there is little, if any violence, blood or gore in the narrative. Almost everything traumatic is implied, not explicit - for a change. This subtle approach to brutality makes the violence seem more spooky, more mysterious than usual. The reader's imagination is almost always more fertile than the written word - unless the author is Edgar Allan Poe. And Kellerman builds suspense, little by little, to a crescendo finale. Character study is very important to this psychological thriller. And again, the author excels in character development, especially that of his protagonist, Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young psychologist at City Central Hospital.Carrier is a moral man, seemingly, dedicated to his profession and patients. He also appears to be a really nice guy. Six months earlier, his live-in girlfriend, Jocelyn Banks, a nurse at the same hospital, was horribly murdered, her mutilated body dumped under a bridge in a run-down area of town. Jeremy had been very much in love with her and broods over his loss and the cruelly sadistic manner of her death. The investigating detectives have targeted him as a murder suspect, even though there is no evidence of his involvement, whatsoever. This exacerbates his suffering. When more women begin turning up dead, obviously the work of the same psychopathic killer, the police come looking for Dr. Carrier - questioning him - turning up the pressure.Coinciding with this traumatic period, Dr Arthur Chess, an elderly but still vigorous pathologist, seeks Jeremy out, apparently wanting to be his friend. Chess is retired, but he is so prominent in his field, and has contributed so much to City Central that he is allowed to maintain his office there. Arthur Chess is a wonderful character - bizarre, wise, extremely mysterious, at times humorous and fascinated with \\"psychology's views on violence. Specifically, the genesis of very bad behavior\\" - not evil. \\"Evil is a.... weighty word. Theologically burdened. I believe we'd settled upon 'very bad behavior.'\\" He makes statements throughout like, \\"A stranger to fear is a stranger to conscience.\\" But he never follows through. He never tells Jeremy what he is alluding to.One evening Chess invites Carrier to a special dinner in a private, extremely elegant, out-of-the-way venue. There he is introduced to a group of friends - six in all, including Arthur - who have something in common besides their professional backgrounds and elevated status in society, but neither Jeremy nor the reader are let in on their secret. These are the members of the \\"Conspiracy Club\\" of the novel's title. They meet occasionally to discuss diverse topics with great intelligence, and eat extraordinary gourmet fare. The wine is pretty terrific also.Dr. Chess suddenly disappears, apparently to travel the world, sending Jeremy postcards from various countries - all with the same message, \\"Traveling and learning.\\" His departure coincides with the delivery of anonymous interoffice envelopes from the Otolaryngology Department containing what look to be random articles having nothing to do with psychology or Dr. Carrier. When Jeremy investigates, he discovers that no one knows anything about the envelopes or who sent them. Thus he decides to open his own investigation, amateur though it may be. He must connect the dots between Jocelyn's death, Dr. Chess' clues, the club, the envelopes, and other strange happenings. Meanwhile, danger surrounds him.To make matters more complicated, he has started seeing Angela Rios, a resident at the hospital. Although he thinks of Jocelyn frequently, he is trying to assuage his loneliness and get his life back on track. Will his burgeoning relationship with Angela endanger her also?The cat and mouse game which follows is truly compelling. I really found it difficult to put this one down. However, it is quite low-key, although very well paced. Is there such a thing as an effective low-key thriller? If not, than Jonathan Kellerman has invented one! ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"Nail and Other Stories (\\"Rebel Inc\\")","review":"With different Scottish voices, Laura J. Hird paints a grim picture of humanity with ironic humour. The picture painted, however, is a real attempt to find the nasty little things that make us all part of the human race. From the sick mind of an ex-soldier, children taking advantage the mentally retarded, to a woman abusing a cat, this has all of the sadness of life. That it is laced with a hard-nose humour speaks for the area of West Edinburgh (Gorgie) in which Hird was raised. The parallels to Irvine Welsh are there : the vernacular ; the train of thought. Hird is a more disciplined and visual narrator however, and rarely sounds drug-fuelled, as does the east of Edinburgh's more famous Hibernian supporter. Some stories in this book should come with a warning, but it is encouraging to see this dour picture is lightened somewhat in her excellent follow-up novel, &quot;Born Free&quot;, which is a gem. Start with &quot;Routes&quot; and watch out for the last story &quot;There was a soldier....&quot;, but above all don't miss out on a wee bit of urban blight from this lassie."},{"Title":"Nail and Other Stories (\\"Rebel Inc\\")","review":"From \\"Nail,\\" the first Kafkaesque story in Laura Hird's ambitious collection to the final cruel realizations of the last story, \\"There Was A Soldier,\\" the reader is by turns shocked, horrified, saddened, and amused. These ten stories have in common a certain grimness as they illuminate the sordid and dysfunctional world bubbling near the surface at the end of the 20th century in Scotland. Despite the use, at times, of Scottish dialect, I had no problem hearing the voices of these various characters: the sexual predator disguised as a teacher; the woman whose husband tries to talk her into swinging; the angry, stalking ex; the cruel girls subtly torturing a retarded boy. Their voices were clear-and often angry, nasty, or hopeless.Two stories particularly impressed me. In \\"The Last Supper,\\" the lively, opinionated first person narrator, Darren, is helping his friend Dave move from his flat. Dave's rapacious landlord cheats him out of his deposit, and when Dave gets his revenge, I almost wanted to cheer. The tension of the story is well-done, and I loved this line: \\"Why do lonely people feel they have to inflict their misery on everyone else?

This collection of ten of her stories is fairly consistent, lots of slices of the underbelly of Scottish life. Slices is a key word here, 'cause while she is strong in quickly getting characters and places out there and in the reader's mind, most of the stories feel like one's walked into the middle of a longer piece. There is a kind of haste and unfulfilled quality to a number of them that leaves the reader a bit empty. That emptiness may also be in large part due to the sheer grimness of the stories and the nastiness and/or patheticness of the people in them. Necrophila, pedophilia, animal abuse, abuse of the mentally retarded, spousal abuse, psychological abuse, it's all here and at the core of the stories. At times the symbolism is overwrought (the woman who kills her ex-boyfriend's cat/pussy, the para who rapes a corpse, etc.), and sometimes the clever ideas doesn't lead anywhere interesting. The stories are quick reads though, and are valuable as another perspective on modern Scotland. Hird's next book, the novel Born Free, delivers on the promise evident in the collection.Note: One of the better stories in the collection, \\"Routes\\", is available online in its entirety at The Barcelona Review."},{"Title":"Nail and Other Stories (\\"Rebel Inc\\")","review":"Laura Hird is a startlingly good storyteller. Whether all of her literary output will continue along the lines of these macabre and hauntingly strange stories remains to be seen. In this particular genre she is among the best. Her stories embrace the dark spaces of our night minds, our visualization of the ill-defined fears that populate the nightmares of reality and illusion, and she has an extraordinary ability to make these weird tales credible. There seems to be a running thread of exploring the possibilities of man's cruelty to man. She molds brief visages of young girls abusing a mentally challenged boy (not unlike the famous 'Lord of the Flies' story), brutality to animals, numbing revenge, pedophila, molestation, and near-extraterrestrial body invasions by growths on the hands and face. These stories may not be for the faint of heart, but Hird is a mastercraftsman at making these tales all seem like reportage. The one flaw in her writing is her tenuous ability to end a story: they often are left dangling like a half dead spider caught on our mind's brow. Some may find difficulty in reading her Scottish brogue manner of conversation, but try reading it aloud and you will discover how additive it is in thinking through the story.This is a fine short story collection.

Painstakingly researched, The Ohlone Way is an engrossingly readable study of the way the Native Americans of the Bay Area lived in peace, plenty, and harmony for centuries before the Spanish missionaries came in and annihilated an ancient way of life in the space of two generations. There was plenty of food (acorns from the oaks, birds, small game, fish, and shellfish), the tulle reeds furnished material for clothing, boats, and shelter, there was no cause for violence, and the weather was mild. Now and then I suppose an earthquake came along and knocked down a few tulle huts, but they rebuilt them the next day.Drive to the top of the hills above Berkeley on a clear day, look west toward the bay, San Francisco and Marin counties, and imagine no cities, just a land of plenty inhabited by many small widely-separated but inter-related tribes, little wisps of their fires rising skyward here and there...Then put back the freeways and bridges and houses and cars and people - and think about what we've done. Then go out and buy another book, Ishi in Two Worlds for the story of what became of the last of these people."},{"Title":"The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area","review":"A truly beautifully written book about the Native American people who populated the Bay Area, from Monterey to San Francisco. The descriptions of the land they inhabited as recently as 200 years ago makes wonderful reading aloud, and the Ohlone customs and beliefs will fascinate anyone living in the Bay Area. I rather fell upon this book at the SFPL, and can't believe my good fortune that it is available. As a high school librarian in SF, this can be well used by upper elementary through high school students wanting to know about the people and the place that existed long before SF was a settlement,when the area supported some of the densest populations of flora and fauna in America. The illustrations (b&amp;w) will be much used as the basis for a mural on our area's history. They are clear and capture, in their intricacy, so many details that kids will relate to."},{"Title":"The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area","review":"The wee folk were once beaten by iron-using people, which made them detest this powerful metal, and the people who used it. Consequently, when the Iron People conquered Europe, they were very careful to protect themselves. They sewed bits of iron into their children's clothing, and hung horseshoes on their doors. They used the dark energy of forged iron to repel the bright spirits.Malcolm Margolin's book, The Ohlone Way, is a magnificent collection of bright knowledge that is powerfully repellent to the dark energy of misanthropes -- those cynics who insist that all humans everywhere have always been self-centered, materialistic, and aggressively warlike by nature -- fatally flawed, and rotten to the core. If you carefully absorb the knowledge in this book, misanthropes will skedaddle whenever they see you coming. Bye-bye!Humans simply aren't the problem. The problem is crazy cultures. It is cleansing and healing to comprehend this important distinction. It implies no quick or easy remedies, but it negates the notion that the only effective solution to the Earth Crisis is human extinction. We possess adequate intelligence to do what needs to be done, but whether we will ever do so remains a potent and prickly mystery.The Ohlone were an assortment of tribes that lived in the region around San Francisco Bay for thousands of years prior to European conquest. Margolin does a lovely job of describing the various aspects of their way of life, and Michael Harney's drawings are intriguing -- many show skies darkened with millions of seabirds. The Ohlone were blessed to inhabit a land that provided an abundance of plant and animal foods.It's so hard for us to imagine what a magical treasure this planet was prior to farmers. Ohlone country, like much of the western region, was lucky to have a climate that was poorly suited for growing corn, so the tribes were able to avoid that dangerous and highly unstable way of life. They didn't farm, nor did they enslave animals, yet they were able to enjoy a complex culture and a stable way of life.Occasional armed conflicts were usually low-intensity ritual warfare, good for blowing off steam. Sometimes conflicts were intense, wiping out whole villages. But this was not a war-oriented culture. There were no wooden palisades surrounding villages. The men did not have shields, war clubs, tomahawks, or body armor. The culture did not enshrine heroic war chiefs, nor did it create a sprawling empire. They were really into dancing.The Ohlone lost few people to disease, famine, and war. But their culture was successful at maintaining a stable population. Taboos and restrictions on sex kept a leash on the birth rate. Sex was forbidden during the two years that a mother was nursing, as it was prior to hunts, or during menstruation. Deformed babies and twins were not kept. Women understood how to terminate unwanted pregnancies. They were careful to avoid the horrors of population growth. Smart!Stability was the core of their success, and time-proven wisdom was carefully preserved. \\"To be different was to be wrong, the best ways were the old ways.\\" Innovators and rebels were scorned, as were freedom and individualism. The Ohlone valued belonging -- having strong social bonds to family, clan, and tribe. A man without his family was nothing. It was a society built on a foundation of cooperation, sharing, and generosity. Greedy and aggressive people were banished, because they toxic. Respectable people learned well, and then passed the ancient knowledge on to the next generation.Stability is hard for us to comprehend. The Ohlone could live in the same place for a thousand years and not destroy the soils or forests. The hills were still filled with antelope, elk, and deer. The rivers were still thrashing with salmon. The nut trees continued producing sacred acorns. Stability did not diminish the seals, sea lions, sea birds, or shellfish. Fast forward a thousand years into the future, and it's the same culture, the same stories, songs, and dances.They did not live like a hurricane. They lived like reverend guests in a sacred land. \\"Everything was alive, everything had character, power, and magic, and consequently everything had to be dealt with properly.\\" \\"It was a world in which thousands of living, feeling, magical things, all operating in dream logic, carried out their individual actions.\\" \\"Power was everywhere, in everything, and therefore every act was religious.\\"All of us have wild ancestors who enjoyed a similar manner of living. The Ohlone were not fascinating freaks. Five hundred years ago, the tribes of western North America were among the most stable, successful, and sustainable human societies on the planet. The secret of their success was that their cultures were, in almost every way, the direct opposite of our own. Sadly, the Iron People arrived in 1770, and hurricanes of progress and ecocide soon followed.Margolin worked on this book for three years, and he often dreamed about the Ohlone. \\"It produced in me a sense of victory to know that such a way of life is part of the human potential, part of the human history.\\"Yes, indeed! The daily news in our world regularly fills us with awe and amazement at the stunning achievements of human foolishness. It's difficult not to feel like inmates at an insane asylum because, in many ways, we are. On the bright side, we all have front row seats as our insane civilization crumbles before our eyes, creating thrilling opportunities for new experiments in living. And Margolin reminds us of the important fact that our genes are not diseased, just our culture. Victory over civilization is not impossible, it's a matter of time and love and healing.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area","review":"This book does what many fail to: describe pre-contact Indians as HUMAN BEINGS.

I highly recommend it and have provided gift copies to some friends I knew would appreciate them."},{"Title":"The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area","review":"Unfortunately there were not many redeeming qualities to this book. The book was frustrating in its lack of citation and I believe the author lacks any historical credibility. The author himself admits that he has no credentials in history or anthropology. Furthermore, the few bits of interest are far outweighed by overwhelming amounts of unnecessary historical fiction.As fascinating as many parts of this book were, The Ohlone Way was a disappointment. I began the book with no preconceived notions but almost immediately I was frustrated with the author's style of writing. I found it nearly impossible to tell when the author was writing factual, sourced material, or if he was filling in blanks with accounts of other native cultures from the same time period or if he was purely speculating based on his own notions of what native life must have been like. The author stated that he did use sources on the Ohlone as well as other peoples and yet he rarely used actual citations. Such a lack of sources led me to doubt the historicity of much of the author's statements.Another bothersome characteristic of The Ohlone Way was how the author presented his information/conjectures. Much of the story sounded like some sort of bad soap opera or one of those intolerable after school specials. I didn't understand the purpose of the story about the hypothetical divorced woman who wallowed in her own depression. There was no need for the long, drawn out explanation of how she triumphed over her depression by weaving the most beautiful hypothetical basket ever seen. I understand the author is trying to be creative and make history more appealing to a wider audience but there are plenty of other ways to do so without resorting to writing cheesy historical fiction.In closing, I would like to say that the Ohlone people and culture seem extremely fascinating but unfortunately I don't feel like I really know very much about them. The author's lack of citations, historical credibility, and his disregard for historical integrity have only led me to doubt nearly ever statement he made throughout the entire book. If he had taken out some of the fictional aspects of the book and spent his time more wisely on citing sources, The Ohlone Way could have been a most fascinating historical study rather than the somewhat silly novel it became."},{"Title":"The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area","review":"Malcom Margolin must have researched intensively to create this excellent book.

I was delighted to come across this book because it demystifies the process very effectively and is written in a no-nonsense, discerning and user-friendly manner. It is not designed as a comprehensive guide to the Puces but rather as a &quot;short list&quot; of the stands that the authors have found to be most worthwhile (be it in terms of selection, quality, price and/or reliability). It's a bit like having a Zagat's guide to the Puces.

However, the action and characters are those still to be found in mysteries today. The Master Detective dominates the action; he is bold, aggressive, yet with wrinkles of kindliness showing in his face and eyes. The forces of evil are an assortment drawn from big business and politics while reform is possible for even the seemingly benighted young. Of course, women, while often of competence and know-how are still to be cherished and protected while providing the divine love without which a man cannot be truly mature and stable. Nothing cannot be sacrificed for the love of a good woman.I listened to it being read by the kindle male robot. While the pronunciation and verisimilitude to sentence structure can and should be improved, tinkering that the engineers of Amazon can easily manage to make good even better. Of course, this reading cannot compare with what a good voice actor does on the audio books (of which Amazon owns one of the best sources in its Audible.com). Over recent years I have grown accustomed to this medium and recommend not rejecting it on first hearing. With time the mind learns to overcome a good percentage of the deficiency compared to live reading by top people.Since, as of this date, there is no plot summary given by Amazon, let me give a brief one. One of the Great Financial Geniuses of the Day dies and is said by his closest friends and associates to have, in fact, been near bankruptcy. The devoted orphaned daughter ( mother long gone) cannot believe that he would have been so foolish and calls upon The Great Detective to find the truth. The remainder of the book retails the successes and failures of the Great One as he copes with the machinations of the Evil Doers. Subplots involve the daughter's fiance and a romance between one of the Master Detective's agents and the daughter of a suspected agent of the nefarious plotters.In essence this is one of the established patterns for a detective story dating to the very beginning of the genre. It is well handled here with some differences due to changes in prose style. Few average detective story readers should be put off from this well told story."},{"Title":"Future Spacecraft Propulsion Systems: Propulsion, the Enabling Technology for Space Exploration","review":"Its rather expensive, but you get what you pay for.. Overall a very good book. Its a practical, applied engineering text, rather than a physics text book. The book starts out with existing rocket hardware, and then makes rational expansions into rocket based combined cycles and air breathing scramjets. It moves on to various applications of nuclear rocketry (both thermal and electric) and ends with a discussion of various fusion propulsion concepts. There isn't much speculation on esoteric physics such as wormholes - just applied engineering based on known principles of physics. Its written by engineers, for engineers (I'm an aerospace propulsion engineer myself).

While I had mild misgivings about the other volume, because of the selection of at least some of the people biographied, in this volume I have more serious, central objections.This book is intended to fill a gap in American history, and at least outline the lives of the various commanders on the British side in the American Revolution. The first difficulty is that the writers are virtually all American, and their focus is on the participation of these individuals in the Revolution itself. It would be interesting to know more about these individuals *before* they participated in the war, in terms of what their experiences were.My second complaint is more serious. We know a little about the main generals of the American Revolution, Gage, Howe, Burgoyne, Clinton, Cornwallis, perhaps Carleton. The book includes a sketch of each of these soldiers, but it doesn't go much further. Instead it then includes a series of bios of various sailors who participated in the war on the sea. I don't mind the inclusion of Graves (who lost the battle of the Virginia Capes to de Grasse) or Lord Howe, but there's also a compilation chapter dealing with Arbuthnot and Gambier (in addition to Graves), and one on Hood and another on Rodney. I would have instead included a few pieces on various subordinates: Lord Rawdon, Tarleton, or perhaps some of the German mercenaries. Frankly, this crippled the book for me, to a large extent.There is some good material here on the various soldiers who are biographied, so I don't think this collection was a total waste, but frankly at this point we need another compilation like this one, but something more complete, and more in depth."},{"Title":"ANIMAL CRACKERS: A DELECTABLE COLLECTION OF PICTURES, POEMS, & LULLABIES FOR THE VERY YOUNG","review":"Jane Dyer's gentle watercolor paintings enhance a thoughtful selection of the best poems and nursery rhymes for young children. Collected in thematic sections ranging from alphabet and counting rhymes through the seasons, food, animals, and playtime to lullabies and night songs, the poems feature topics to tickle a young child's imagination while presenting rhythms and rhymes that encourage enthusiastic repetition through many read-aloud sessions. Loving parents, grandparents, and gift-givers of children ages 2 to 7 will delight in sharing these child-pleasing poems over and over. Most of the contents are of English heritage, but African, Danish, Brazilian, and German traditional lullabies are also included. Oversized pages allow plenty of interplay between text and art, while the book's slim (64-page) format keeps the volume manageable even in small hands. Dyer offers a broader variety than most collections for very young children, and if her art lacks the brash humor of a Rosemary Wells (My Very First Mother Goose), it offers instead a quietly satisfying world where children smile.

Definitely a must for every child's library."},{"Title":"ANIMAL CRACKERS: A DELECTABLE COLLECTION OF PICTURES, POEMS, & LULLABIES FOR THE VERY YOUNG","review":"Intricate details and warm tones fill the illustrations throughout this superb collection of sixty-two nursery rhymes. Dyer has incorporated a wide variety of traditional nursery rhymes such as Little Jack Horner, Humpty Dumpty, and Peter Piper along with some not so traditional, such as Grandpa Bear's Lullaby, Animal Crackers, and All Asleep. She has divided this medley of rhymes into seven unique sections, including &quot;Nursery Rhymes,&quot; &quot;Animals, Animals,&quot; and &quot;Lullaby and Good Night.&quot; These divisions make it easy to find rhymes for specific occasions or themes. Each rhyme is delightfully and intricately illustrated with warm watercolors which encompass the entire page. These illustrations invite the reader to become more involved in the story. This anthology of nursery rhymes is appropriate for the emergent reader because of the familiar text throughout the story. Dyer's intricate watercolors will help young children focus on the pictures to help create meaning. This well-designed collection of rhymes will be a valuable addition to any young child's personal library."},{"Title":"ANIMAL CRACKERS: A DELECTABLE COLLECTION OF PICTURES, POEMS, & LULLABIES FOR THE VERY YOUNG","review":"My brother sent me this book after getting it for his own kids many years ago. All 3 of mine have enjoyed it from 1 - 6 years old. As others have indicated, there are some traditional rhymes and some more modern, but the mix is good and the illustrations are charming (to me and my kids). I have watched my oldest grow with the book and her interest in different poems change as she matures. Like all good nursery rhyme collections, it can be enjoyed for many years.

I respect Pompeii, but it didn't feel as accomplished to me. It has some of the Harris intelligence in the description of people, but the description of place is easily dominant. A history buff might revel, but that's not me. Roman civilization is no model for me, and a picture painted of the culture pales after a while A natural events buff might revel in the eruption described at length, but I found the characters rendered inconsequential and gray under the weight of Vesuvious. Another review warned that folks who wanted formula adventures should stay away. Harris has the taste and sensitivity to avoid crude formulas. But the plot follows predictable paths. And isn't shy about using some degree of coincidence to wrap things up.With The Ghost, I was involved in the story, intrigued by the characters, welcoming of the plot twists, and made thoughtful by the politics subtext. I'd like to find more Robert Harris like that."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I was very disappointed to find that this is in fact the abridged version of Pompeii, not the \\"Unabridged Audio CD Collector's Edition\\" as advertised."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Although I enjoy historical fiction involving Roman era life I'm often overwhelmed by the excess of detail that can drown out the overall story. Thankfully 'Pompeii' is not this sort of novel. The author focuses on prose and characterizations. His descriptions of Roman era life, while seemingly well researched, are not overwhelming. And so this book reads well; it would actually make for a good beach read.Now as for the story, it's somewhat disappointing. It concerns with the engineer responsible for maintaining the aquaduct that feeds water to Pompeii and neighboring communities. When the aquaduct fails he is brought in to investigate and correct the situation. But he soon faces all sorts of obstacles. Oh, and he falls in love. Then Vesuvius erupts and, well, ... you what happens. Again this is not the most engaging of stories.

Somewhat disappointing, but still a good read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"If you're looking for a quick read while traveling, then this would be a good selection. I took a third year Greek and Roman Studies course on the archaeology of Pompeii and Herculaneum and can say that Harris did his research. He uses all the famous names, buildings and graffiti that archaeologists have recovered even down to the lonely gladiator that was found amongst other bodies in the building next to the amphitheatre. Harris even provides accurate detail of Herculaneum which was also buried by Vesuvius half of which has been recovered by archaeologists while the other half remains buried underneath the new town.I appreciated the amount of detail and research that went into this book, but I did not care for the story or the characters themselves. The story surrounding the characters was as predictable as Vesuvius blowing its top and the characters were one dimensional. Harris even goes so far as to rip-off the banquet scene in Petronius' Satyricon where he satirizes Trimalchio's feast which, as another reviewer pointed out, is lazy writing. However, if you do have even the slightest interest in this area and time period, in archaeology or volcanology give it a read, because the work is in the details."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"so i purchased \`pompeii' at the airport for some light travel reading, on the strength of ellipse-filled but positive reviews on the cover from respected rags including the NY Times and The Economist, \\"terrific..gripping...\\" etc. it performed well-enough, though not as good as the reviews indicated; it feels a little formulaic, thrown together and ultimately flat. the pages keep turning at a reasonable pace, but i kept having a certain \`color by numbers' feeling not unlike reading the machine-produced recent novels from tom clancy. i'm obviously no connoisseur of the light fiction genre, but i'd have to recommend \`da vinci code' or katherine neville's excellent \`the eight' long before i'd tell anyone to buy this. the one thing from this novel worth thinking about, with my own ellipsis: harris clearly has an undue influence on the biggest reviewing publications in the world...."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Let me start out by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this book. I have never read Harris before but have an interest in history/thriller/mystery idea. Needless to say I was excited about reading the book. In the end I was pretty disappointed.Pompeii chronicles the four days leading up to and including the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. While this backdrop is intriguing, I have to agree that the time limitations made the character development non-existent, the plot underdeveloped, etc. Marcus Attilius, aqueduct engineer from Rome stumbles across love, conspiracy, and heroism all within 96 hours. There are some interesting storylines here including the rebellion of young Corelia and the subsequent relationship with Attilius, the water conspiracy in Pompeii, the disappearance of Exomnius, etc. Nevertheless none of these storylines are grossly developed and in the end I felt that I really didn't care what happened to anyone.The novel is at times hard to read and the character names hard to pronounce.

I will definitely add Robert Harris to my list of authors and look for more of his books."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"There is a genre of books that adopts one tiny idea, some very narrow topic, and makes it entirely its own. Pompeii does this for the subject of waterworks in the Roman Empire. From this unpromising subject grows one of the most fascinating books about Rome that I have ever read. The masterstroke is to combine a wealth of minutia and esoteric detail about waterworks with the broad canvas of Pompeii just before and during the eruption of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. The result is a moving story of love, courage and extraordinary dedication to duty against the magnificent backdrop of the eruption, populated by historical characters like the Plinys (Younger and Elder) among others. The best parallel is the one with James Cameron's Oscar winning Titanic. What that love story starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet did for our knowledge of the Titanic, this book will do for the eruption that buried Pompeii. It is primarily a human story that lends immediacy to the known historical events. I bought the book in anticipation of an upcoming visit to the ruins of Pompeii. Being armed with a wealth of information about life in the city and its environs from the book, I now expect to better enjoy the trip. This is so much better than reading a dry guidebook (of which I have several; a good one is 'Pompeii' by Pier Giovanni Guzzo available at Amazon.com) that I strongly recommend this book to anyone planning to visit the Naples area."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I intend to reread it.

Through the research I have done, I have found the novel to be very historically accurate. This is a plus for the book considering the fictional plot is very simple and doesn't have a lot of development to it. The characters also are one-dimensional for the most part, all though there is some change in attitudes in Ampliatus, Corelia, and Attilus. This doesn't bring down the book though, because the way Harris uses historical data to make the novel interesting is superb. I found it to be a book I couldn't put down, as I always wanted to see what would happen on the next page. I was a little disappointed with the ending of the book. I felt like Harris did a good job of building up to the climax, but then the book just seemed to drop off. Almost as if the last chapter was missing. This is the only complaint I have of the novel.

So this is a historical novel and we learn of life in the Roman Empire around AD 79 at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius. Here are masters and slaves, filthy rich and beggars. We get a little romance as Attilius meets the lovely daughter of a viscous, cunning landlord who used to be a slave himself. We learn a lot about Roman culture: meals, daily life, transportation technology, ships, soldiers, relations between men and women, political and financial corruption, and the unique role of the baths in Roman culture. It's an old fashioned boy gets girl despite obstacles romance story during a fast-paced hectic three-day period between when the aqueduct fails and the volcano blows.

Vesuvius one August day in A.D. 79, and wondered what it was like during that horrible time. After reading this novel, I wondered no longer, thanks to Robert Harris's careful research and vivid portrayal of Pompeii's citizenry. The novel starts out slowly but tension keeps building all the way to the end with many clues of the impending disaster: sulfur in the water, the trembling earth and unusual increases of temperature on the ground. The protagonist is a water engineer named Attilius, responsible for the operation and maintenance of the region's aqueduct, with the job title of Aquarius. I liked that literary touch (I'm a computer & communications engineer). Altogether a most excellent literary and historical reading experience."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii is impossible to put down and represents historical writing at its best. I finished it in two days, and everyone I've passed it to has loved it. Harris's characters are real and intriguing, and though he's setting is in ancient Rome, I found I was able to relate to the characters, such as the steadfast public servant facing complaints about water shortages and the greedy real estate speculator. He really brings things to life.The other books rounding out my top three history novels areGod King of Angkor: A Novel of Tyranny, which is set in ancient Cambodia, andWolf Hall: A Novel, which is set in Tudor England."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Marcus Attilius Primus aquarius of the Aqua Augusta is one of the most likable, believable characters I've encountered in a long time. Harris immerses you in Roman life, teaches you about the role of the aqueducts, and introduces you to characters like Pliny the Elder. All the while you feel as though you are following Primus around the bay of Naples, through the towns, meeting the people. Amazingly textured."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris did a very good job researching day to day life in and around Pompeii around the time Mount Vesuvius erupted. Toward the very beginning of the book, you hear of sulfur in the area's water supply, and then a blockage in the aqueduct, and the aquarius (aqueduct engineer) spends most of the book trying to figure out what went wrong with the aqueduct. I knew as reader, but the characters did not know, that sulfur in the water supply is a sign of an upcoming volcanic eruption.I visited the Pompeii site several years ago, and ever since I have always wondered what it would have been like to have actually been in Pompeii almost 2000 years ago when the volcano erupted. When reading this book I really felt like I was there. Robert Harris did a very good job making you feel like you were there with everybody during the eruption.I did deduct one star because in my opinion it took too long to get to the actual eruption. The first about 2/3-3/4 of the book was devoted to the aquarius trying to figure out what was happening to the water supply, and the last 1/4-1/3 was the actual eruption. I know some readers enjoy the build up like that, and some authors like creating it, but I thought it was too much buildup with not much going on.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This book was given to me by my brother, who is an engineer in water management--so he would know about such things as aqueducts. I found the book fascinating both from an engineering and an historical point of view. It was also a nifty murder mystery."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this book on CD while I was commuting back and forth to work. I'm a sucker for the retelling of historical tales and I found it fascinating and completely engrossing. Harris brings the ambiance of the summer of 79 A.D. to life for the reader (or listener), and shows us that they were not really so different from ourselves."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris' Pompeii delivers even before Vesuvius lets loose. The story of the Aquarius Attilius has a double does of forboding, one of which the character is aware (that something suspicious is going on with a missing Aquarius and questions about the water supply, a nice Chinatown the movie touch lending a degree of noir charm to the book) and one of which the reader is very clearing aware and the author makes clear at the beginning of each chapter (the imminent explosion of the volcano). When said event does happen, all hell breaks loose and all stray bits of plot come together very nicely. Pliny makes an inevitable, yet very effective, appearance. If there ever is to be a noir-historical-disaster novel genre, let this book set its standard."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The book is short, concise, fast paced and, as we all know, has a heck of a climax. The characters are worth caring about. I seem to find what I like most about the story is the different angle it takes when it comes to a central character. Almost all historical fiction books set during the Roman era either pertain to the upper crust of emperors, generals and senators, or the lowest of the low slaves and gladiators. Here the hero is a good old-fashioned working stiff, someone I could identify with."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I bought this book two months ago, along with several other novels and guidebooks, to help me prepare for a trip to Italy. I read a few reviews that were less than favorable and was a bit worried that the book would get tied down in engineering prose about aquaducts... Don't get me wrong. I am curious about the technology of such amazing architectural feats... but I would need visuals to tackle such a topic.Needless to say, I was totally surprised at how much of a #pager-turner# this was for me. I began and finished the novel on the subway, with several reading breaks snuck in at home and basically whenever I could (standing on the street waiting for a bus, etc.). I was wholly engrossed by the first pages and hated arriving at my destinations and having to put the book down until the next ride.If you are the type to fantasize about what it might have been like to witness life under the Roman empire and in the fateful city of Pompeii, I would recommend this book. I am generally a skeptic when it comes to historical fiction and documentaries that attempt to put a face on ruins and skeletons, but this book failed to offend my sensibilities. I gave it four stars rather than five only because I am sure there will be some historians who challenge some of the facts or liberties taken by the author and because I was so disappointed to finish the novel! As for wanting more, I do!!! Now who will write a nice non-fiction that delves into some of the details that Harris attempts to recreate??"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I picked this up &quot;for an hour&quot; and fininshed at ten thirty at night. Having been to Pompeeii I could just see the action, .For a great summer read, you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is a terrific novel for the geek-at-heart, a historical set in the two days in AD 79 just before the explosion of Vesuvius that destroyed several of the towns set like jewels along the Bay of Naples. The protagonist is the young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus, newly appointed 'aquarius', or manager, of the sixty-mile-long Aqua Augusta aqueduct. He's only been on the job a few days when the water supply fails and he has to find and fix the problem or face an inquiry and the probable failure of his career. That means dealing with corrupt local officials -- especially Numerus Popidius Ampliatus, a freed slave who has become the main political power in Pompeii -- and also with Pliny, the great naturalist who is serving as admiral of the Roman fleet harbored at one end of the Bay. He's not getting much cooperation from his own subordinates, either, but they have their own agendas. Of course, we know what caused the buckling that shut off the aquaduct, and we know why the water smells of sulphur, and why the fish in the offshore pens have died, but Harris does an excellent job building the suspense. Will Attilius be able to do his job? Will he survive the plotting of Ampliatus, and get together with his daughter? Will any of them survive the eruption? The plot is a dead run from the first page, the writing is plain and straightforward (no need to invent drama here), and even though we know how it will end, we don't know all the details."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Overall I would consider this book a good read. It is definitely fast paced with a good developing story. However, once the story is developed it ends abruptly. The book left me wanting more of a conclusion. I would have enjoyed Harris writing an additional five chapters in order to conclude in a way that would be appealing to me. I feel that Harris could have expanded more on the ending because it came across very blunt. The rising actions were developed well but the climax seemed to come towards the end of the book, which caused a rushed falling action and conclusion. The attention that the eruption actually received was very minimal which caused for a few tedious moments throughout the book.It is a great book when discussing the history of the ancient Roman people and their way of life. It is obvious that Harris is an extraordinary historian, but his ability at creating the fiction to this historical fiction novel seemed to be difficult for him. Harris' ability to incorporate his historical knowledge into the book came naturally and was very informative. If you are interested in a very educating and enlightening book then this is a great pick."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The world's only superpower, an abundance of advanced technology, rich people who cheat on their taxes, corrupt functionaries, a huge gulf between the have's and the have-not's. All of this plus an event so horrendous no one could ever have imagined it. How very much Rome, AD 79, resembles a certain other place we all know. This sense that the world Robert Harris creates in \\"Pompeii\\" is at once alien (when was the last time you feasted on flamingo tongues?) while at the same time familiar is a part of the appeal of this book.\\"Pompeii\\" concerns an aquarius (an engineer in ancient Rome who specializes in aqueducts) who has just taken over responsibility for the aqueduct that supplies a quarter of a million people in towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has mysteriously disappeared, and he is noticing some very funny goings-on in the functioning of his aqueduct.I loved Harris's descriptions of Roman hydraulic engineering, his blow-by-blow account of the eruption, and the scenes in which Pliny the Elder - scholar, commander of the Roman navy, and eyewitness to the big event of AD 79 - is present. The book has been painstakingly researched, as the acknowledgements attest. However, I thought that the book dragged a bit in the middle, and that the love story could have been given a bit more substance. But I put that aside when I came to the book's last memorable chapters. The last sentence of this book is one of the best book-last-sentences I have ever read. But it won't mean anything to you until you've had the pleasure of reading this fine work, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Books based on actual historical events too often fall victim to the same symptom; that of too much research, not enough substance. You would think that a talented writer like Robert Harris (Fatherland, Enigma) would know better than to fall into this trap. Alas, he does not. Although well researched and historically acurate, the book has too much information and not enough plot or characterisation to make the reader care about anything that is going on.And that's too bad, because Pompeii had the potential of becoming a great historical epic. When the Roman aqueduc fails, it's up to Attilus to find the source of the problem and fix it before the greater part of Italian coast goes thirsty. He follows the problem back to Pompeii, an Italian city that is often plagued with earthquakes and where strange rumblings can often be heard. As he begins the repairs on the water system, he soon uncovers the truth of it all; that mount Vesuvius, the mountain overlooking the town, is actually very, very much alive.Told during the last three days of Pompeii, the novel is a fast read full of events and characters that always leaves you craving for more. The characters are paper thin and the plot so derisive that you never care about any of the subplots Harris throws your way. As a matter of fact, now that I'm sitting here, trying to remember who the supporting characters were, they all seem to meddle into one big mess in my head.But Harris should get credit in the research department, because the book is so well detailed that it often feels like a history lesson. Not only is he giving us a lesson on ancient Italian life, there is also a very good lesson on geology and volcanoes. Harris brings you right into the explosion and, with descriptive and very colorful writing, makes you see what this erruption must have been like for the people of Pompeii.Maybe I was expecting too much from this one. In thend end, Pompeii is a good pulp novel, though not much more than that. With more attention to characters and plot and maybe a bit less attention to details, the book would have been bound for greatness. As it stands, it is an entertaining read that probably won't stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii is an entertaining novel with a bare bones plot and a small number of characters. The description of Pompeii and the surrounding area, the discussion of the Aqua Augusta, and the rendition of Vesuvious erupting is excellent.However, the main character - Attilius - and his love interest are rather bland and one dimensional. A serious flaw - to have a main character and a love story poorly developed and of little interest to the reader.The secondary characters are fabulous though - Pliny the Elder, the bad guy Ampliatus, Brebix the gladiaitor, the short scene with a prostitute and the \\"never seen\\" Exomnius. These are just some examples.One final flaw - the book ends with a whimper and not a bang.

But come on, folks, has there been a better book in recent past as far as its ability to actually transport the reader into the story? Not in my mind. The sense of what was coming was palpable, and the efforts and struggles of the Aquarius in the face of so many difficulties were so realistic. I could smell the sulfur, feel the heat, the dust, the dirt. I could see the characters in each scene. I only felt that the book lost a bit of steam when the volcano erupted (no pun intended). I felt that the escape efforts actually dragged on a bit. But just a bit.One of the best books I have read in some time.

The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that. I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it. This book moves very slowly. There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that? There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts. The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting, exciting people. But, they are cliches. The completely evil villain; the sad, ever moral good guy.

The meticulous historical and scientific accuracy, as well as the probing psychological development of each of the major characters, makes this story intensely real, as if the reader is physically present and experiencing the unfolding of events.The eruption of Mount Vesuvius is set againt the corruption, decadence, and intrigue of 1st-century imperial Rome. That the entire plot is compressed into just three days intensifies the drama, not only of the impending eruption, but of the insidious schemes the main character, Attilius, unwittingly finds himself entangled in. The tension does not let up until the final page.

The author makes seemingly effortless use of his knowledge of the period, and from my own reading, I think his portrait of the first century under Roman rule is realistic and richly detailed. Harris weaves history, science, and engineering into the fictional events, but never loses focus on his tight and fast-moving plot. He also does a convincing job with dialogue and descriptions of his main character's inner thoughts. The novel keeps the reader's imagination fully engaged as the plot moves swiftly to the final crisis when Pompeii is destroyed, and the main characters make a desperate dash for their lives. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the period, as well as to many who just appreciate a colorful and exciting yarn."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"POMPEIIRobert Harris(Random House 2003)Here in \\"Pompeii\\", a novel, author Robert Harris has told the story of the eruption of Vesuvius (August 24-25 A.D.79) in verbal technicolor and has given us a cast of many characters from a clean cut young Roman engineer (Marcus Attilius) down to a couple of crafty villains (Corax and Ampliatus) who are almost stereotypically evil, one employed to kill Marcus, the other the employer. There is mystery, romance, adventure, fact and history aplenty in this great tale and it's a great read for everybody from the high school student to this writer who is past 90. But it's pretty much a guy's book. I read it when it was first published and have just reread it for the joy of reading a good story.The plot is simple. The Aqua Augusta, a 200 year old engineering miracle runs from the springs near Rome for a hundred miles south round the Bay of Naples behind Vesuvius and behind Pompeii to the Roman naval base of Misenum at a constant decline of one inch per hundred feet to deliver water by gravity flow to Pompeii, Herculaneum and Puteoli. But on August 22, two days before the eruption, Marcus Attilius, the young engineer just seconded by higher authority to take charge of the aqueduct, discovers two things. One, there is sulfur in the water. Two, somewhere up the line - past Pompeii but before Herculaneum the line is blocked and unless reopened in 24 hours half the population of Campania will have no water!The first 200 pages of this well researched novel set the stage for the eruption. You are in the naval base with Pliny the elder, the old general and avowed naturalist, now retired, run to fat but not to leisure. You are also there with Ampliatus, ex slave, cruel master, self-made millionaire with a beautiful daughter (Corelia), an ambitious politician and completely evil. You sail in the fast trireme with Pliny from Misenum to Pompeii where Atillius gathers his workmen and his supplies and goes out to find the stoppage; and you are with him while he finds and frees the obstruction just behind Vesuvius.In the meantime strange things are happening - waves on the sea, but no wind, flocks of birds where birds should not be flocking, vapor rising from the ground, wine shuddering in the wine glass - not much, but some, and more than intermittently. You are immersed in Roman culture, well and authoritatively set out by Mr. Harris; and you tend to recall your high school Latin (if you had it)The obstruction freed, Attilius, fascinated with the mountain, goes to the top of Vesuvius where justice done to Corax and you see the crater just about to erupt. Then on the way down he is flattened by the first explosion; and the last 75 pages of the book take you into the explosion, into Pompeii and into the ash.I had always thought that when Vesuvius erupted everything happened at once; people died instantly where they were and where they were embalmed for centuries until excavation stared in the 1800s. Not so. The eruption went on for 36 hours in various stages and included several things - a rain of pumice which covered the surface of the ocean to three feet and made it impossible for the rowers on the trireme to dip their oars, rocks raining - small ones, big ones - heat, vapor and the huge explosions accompanied by waves of heat (500 degrees centigrade) which brought instantaneous death and destruction. Some numbers: The original explosion released the energy of 100,000 Hiroshima atom bombs. 1.5 million tons of magma and lava exited the crater at a speed of Mach1 and reached a height of 35,000 meters before dissipating over hundreds of square miles of land and sea.All this is laid out in language which I have called verbal Technicolor. Great descriptive writing. When you are through with this great read - and, yes, Attilius and Coralia do escape the inferno - you know you have been treated to a really good book which took your mind off the troubles of our contemporary world. And that's eminently worth while!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Just finished Pompeii, which didn't come alive for me until the last half of the story. The characterizations are a bit shallow, with the exception of Pliny Elder, who is brought to life as a living person rather than the historical icon he'd always been to me. Some of the excesses of Roman society are set forth in a truly revolting fashion! What this book does so well is place the reader on the Bay of Naples, from the initial portents of the volcanic eruption, through the inferno with its deadly hail of rocks, to its completion and the smothering of the cities and their inhabitants. Makes it all real. The only other description of doom and destruction that I've seen done so well is the harrowing artillery bombardment presented by Michael Shaara in \\"The Killer Angels\\"."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii shows Robert Harris at the top of his form. As he's done before in Fatherland and Archangel, he meticulously creates a world. In fact, this novel represents his most ambitious attempt to do so. Pompeii chronicles the efforts of Marcus Attlius to uncover why the crucial aqueduct that serves the nine towns around the Bay of Naples has failed. To do so he must contend with both human malice and increasingly violent acts of nature.Most readers will know what is going to happen in this book (though at least one here seems to have thought that the events in the book were occurring in Greece, so I guess you never know). What is remarkable about this book is that our foreknowledge of the critical event in it does not lessen its dramatic tension in the slightest.Why is that so? Pompeii has nicely drawn characters, from the young and occasionally impetuous Attlius, to the historically based Pliny, the venal Ampliatus, and an impressive host of minor characters that are encountered. The world of first century Rome is restored confidently. What I found refreshing was that the book worked comfortably within its present; it did not feel the compulsion to work constantly at adding backstory, nor was that necessary. This book will not tell you who Julius Caesar or Augustus were, and you don't need to know it to enjoy it fully. What it does offer is a wonderfully nuanced and lively portrait of Roman life, making it as valuable in some ways as works of history. I, for one, would be very happy if Harris wrote another Roman novel."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris begins his historical thriller on August 22, A.D. 79,two days before Mount Vesuvius will erupt, burying the city of Pompeii and devastating the landscape around the Bay of Naples.Much of the dramatic tension arises because while none of the characters are aware of their impending doom, readers know what's coming.The unlikely hero is Marcus Attilius, an earnest young engineer from Rome who has been put in charge of the Aqua Augusta, the massive aqueduct that provides water to the Roman colonies around the bay. There's trouble with the aqueduct, but even before Attilius can find the problem complications arise. His predecessor has mysteriously disappeared and his men are surly and rebellious.The corruptness of the world he finds himself in is personified by the millionaire Ampliatus, a former slave who having gained his freedom, used it to make a fortune capitalizing on the greed of the wealthy Romans who have settled in this part of the world.But Ampliatus is also the father of a beautiful and rebellious daughter, Corelia Ampliata, who, needless to say, catches Attilius' eye and plays a major role in the ensuing drama.Harris provides a detailed picture of this world, which I enjoyed, although some readers may find it too contrived, too like a period room in a museum. I was also fascinated by his description of the aqueduct, its construction and its importance to Pompeii and the other settlements in Italy. Without water,he suggests, there could be no civilization.The action moves swiftly to Pompeii, where Attilius confronts Ampliatus and the Board of Four, the corrupt magistrates who have developed the city with no regard for the volcano's destructive history. Determined, he sets off for the slopes of Vesuvius to repair the aqueduct in the final hours before the eruption in a breathtaking race with time. Suffice it to say that the suspense increases as the inevitable catastrophe comes closer. And when Vesuvius finally explodes, readers will feel they too are fleeing through the streets of Pompeii.As suggested, some readers will no doubt find that Harris' historical material overwhelms the story. I, however, was convinced by it, and still enjoyed the story. While not a great writer, Harris knows his stuff."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"First of all, let me say that if you are fortunate enough to have ever walked the streets of Pompeii, you will love this book. For those of you who have never seen it for yourself, or have not had an obsessive interest, you may want to pass.I LOVED this story. Robert Harris captures the last hours of one of the most glorious and corrupt cities in ancient Rome. The main character, Attilius, is working to find what has caused the failure of the aqueduct. He finds it in pompeii 2 days before the eruption of Vesuvius. From the heartbreaking prophecy of the city's fame to the final 2 minutes of destruction, Harris somehow manages to place you in the middle of all the action. I actually cried."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This book engaged me from start to finish. Though the love story was weak, I found the book very enjoyable. The last 50 pages will grip you!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris' venture into the world of Imperial Rome provides a different slant on the usual historical method of fiction. More concerned with the engineering of the Aqua Augusta (the longest aqueduct in Italy at the time) seen through the eyes of its Aquarius - Marius Attilius Primus - the novel moves away from providing excitement through historical fictionalisation to a quiet retelling of one the ancient world's most famous cataclysms in a manner that touches on the style of a modern-day disaster novel.I suspect that a Robert Harris fan and a Roman historical fan who has not read Harris before will review this offering rather differently. The only flaw I felt with this novel was that (approaching it as a historical fiction fan and being the first of Harris' books I have read) its \`new' style made it, initially, all the more intriguing and readable. Yet, by the end I felt that Harris had missed one of the tenets of historical fiction - namely to ensure its main protagonists are given a vibrancy and life that makes us want to read about them. Whilst several of the supporting actors, Ampliatus and Pliny to be precise, achieved this our main \`hero', for whom Harris goes to great lengths to stress his intellectual, honest and almost stoic mindset ends up being a character that we \`watch' rather than \`follow'. At a technical level the contrasting characterisations are excellent and clearly display Harris' class and ability to understand how to write a novel, but his literary expertise has meant the empathy with the main character is minimal at best. Simply put, the novel could have been so much more.The story concerns the newly promoted Aquarius in charge of the aqueduct whom we find on the opening day searching for spring water and discovering very quickly that a breach in the aqueduct around the area of Vesuvius has both contaminated the water and then prevented its flow. In a humanising touch our erstwhile hero leaps to rescue a hapless slave who is being killed at Misenum's Villa Hortensia by the owner, freedman Numerius Popidius Ampliatus (who controls the surrounding areas through his plutocracy and also has the best line in the entire novel on page 134 of the hardback version: \\"there's no safer investment than property in Pompeii\\") after his prized red mullet fish are found floating in their pool. To complete the introduction we are offered a tantalising sub-plot love theme with the introduction of his eighteen year old daughter, Corelia, the usual struggle to assert himself over his new team with the oversee Corax leaping on every chance to undermine him, and a mystery in the disappearance of the previous Aquarius, Exomnius.After explaining to the historical Pliny the Elder his beliefs, Marius sails at all speed to Pompeii to locate the fault in the Augusta and gets tied up in Ampliatus' obseqiuous and mendacious generosity whilst searching out the truth behind Exomnius' disappearance. This we eventually discover and a disappointing sense of anti-climax arrives when we discover how and why he has disappeared. Corelia runs away to tell Marius that her father wants him dead, leading to the inevitable showdown with Corax. So, after two thirds of the novel, we come to the eruption where Harris focuses on fictionalising the Younger Pliny's letters, following Pliny as he tries to save the people fleeing Herculaneum and Pompeii, eventually dying on the beach at Stabiae and then follows Marius' herculean efforts as he races to Pompeii to save Corelia which he does in neat fashion using the Aqua Augusta as a means of escaping.I just felt that Harris' was more concerned with writing about the technical aspects of ancient engineering and vulcanology than giving due attention to character empathy. Given everyone knows the main plot then the focus (and thereby the interest) had to be on the sub plots which are a tad cliched and weak. It is particularly emphasized at the very end when the eruption ends and so does the book, somewhat abruptly.So, extremely well written, historically and scientifically accurate, the characterisations are very good and precise, but....whilst what we are given character-wise is good, it is not enough and results in a lack of empathy from the reader. For any fan of Roman historical fiction this is worth reading as the quality of the author shines through and the narrative style is very different to the usual offerings...it is just that, by the end, it could have been a McCullough...but didn't aspire to those dizzy heights."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"If you go into this book expecting latter-day Tolstoy, you're going to be disappointed. Harris is not reaching for that rung. He's canny enough to understand his mass market audience. That's not really meant, as a knock, however. The fellow can write, and he has clearly done his homework.Sure, the plot is a bit melodramatic and the characters are not exactly three dimensional, but the book's a gas and Harris provides just enough arcana that the reader learns something while hurtling through his/her speedy voyage along the 1st c. Italian coast. I found the information about Roman aqueduct construction and maintenance particularly interesting. Harris had to have done a fair amount of research into the subject, and works his factoids into the novel's exposition rather cannily.As I intimated, the characters are, for the most part, MGM cut-outs, but I did find the author's depiction of Pliny the elder amusingly eccentric. Pliny the younger is depicted as a zit-faced teen, for what reason I don't know. Harris has a grudge for Pliny the younger? The corporate villain, Attilius, however, was lifted straight from the pages of Petronius. The author even acknowledges that Attilius' banquet is basically a reproduction of Trimalchio's famous feast. That's fine, but rather lazy, as well.I recommend this book as a light, breezy read. Not much depth, but highly entertaining.BEK"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"from author Richard Harris. Harris has previously written three novels of historical fiction, set in WWII, and postwar. This time he's far more ambitious with his setting, returning to the Roman Empire of A.D. 79. Too few works about ancient Rome focus on the amazing engineering feats achieved by the empire; most focus on the battles, the slaves and gladiators, the cracks in the armor that eventually led to the fall of the Empire. Harris centers his work on the wonder of the Roman water system, dependent on a series of magnificent aqueducts that supported the needs of the people, and were truly a mark of engineering genius.Harris' first novel, \\"Fatherland\\" always stands out for me in the amazing niche it filled - a novel of historical fiction that attempted to answer the question -- what would have happened if Hitler won the war? Although new novelist Harris was unable to bring his talents and imagination for setting and conflict to his characterization of the main characters, it was forgiveable in light of the stunning impact of his work. His following two historical novels, \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Archangel\\" were interesting, but mere shadows of his promise from \\"Fatherland\\".Here, now, many years later, Harris brings us in with the tale too often ignored in our historical view -- the incredible eruption of the volcano Vesuvius that destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii. In his hero, Marcus Attilus Primus, an engineer newly assigned to the Aqua Augusta in the days before the eruption, Harris has created a character complex and equal to the tale and the impressive research he did and shares with us about the aqueduct, the times, and the eruption. It is a tale that draws you in and won't let you go. Flawed by lack of appropriate motive and characterization of the supporting roles, Pompeii is nevertheless a delicious read of historical nonfiction.You'll enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is a good book that really took me back to the last days of Pompeii - I love books that do that."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii was definitely a fun read. There was enough detail about the aqueducts, reservoirs and baths of the Roman empire to be interesting without overwhelming the reader in detail. This is really a mystery/thriller with an historical backdrop. Where this falls short is with its characters. Like many modern page-turning thrillers, this is more about plot (and historical background) than it is about characters. The characters were mostly uninteresting and superficial, yet the history and plot were engaging enough to sustain me, and I did like it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"When you consider that this story is essentially about a newly appointed chief aqueduct engineer (Marcus Attilius Primus) investigating the pending failure of the famous Aqua Augusta you may be inclined to think this story could be cure for insomnia.But Robert Harris chooses a fascinating moment in time and place to add to atmosphere to his fine novel. The coast near Vesuvius AD79. From Misenum to Pompeii and its mostly wealthy Roman citizens charmed and comfortable lives are all about to be rudely shaken.Combining the marvels of Roman Engineering with the marvels of natures pending fury, Harris weaves a very interesting story. Marcus Primus's investigations into the disappearing water flow bring him into contact with a crooked ex slave, turned wealthy developer. When Marcus cottons onto the scheme which enabled this man to gain his wealth he believes he may also be close to solving the mystery of his predecessors unexplained disappearance. Both aided and hindered by the mans beautiful daughter Corelia the plot twists and thickens to create an atmospheric and beautifully researched historical mystery that hold the readers attention.The authors writing is so absorbing you will even find the knowledge he shares through his main character Marcus's dedication and family passion for work on the aqueducts a true eye opener. Before reading this book I never really marvelled as to how the Romans designed and used aqueducts to bring water to the people long before pumping stations existed. Its strangely quite fascinating.My only complaint about the story and its enjoyable characters is the ending leaves one very big question unanswered. But I wont spoil it for you. Suffice to say you will be asking yourself the same question too after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"'Pompeii' is a highly readable historical mystery set in Roman Pompeii in 79 C.E. just before the 'you know what' happens. Robert Harris has an eye for historical detail and can spin a good yarn. The reader of Pompeii learns a bit about Roman aqueducts, the Roman empire and, of course, volcanoes.The protagonist, Marcus Attilius Primus, is the new 'aquarius' sent out from Rome to take over the care and maintenance of the Aqua Augusta, the immense aqueduct that served the Bay of Naples area. Figure out just what did happen to the former aquarius, why the water has dried up, and how did a former slave become the (apparently) richest, most powerful man in Pompeii. Meet Pliny the Elder along the way.A fun read. Highly recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, and the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris's \\"Imperium\\" is one of the finest historical fiction novels that I have ever read. So it was with some anticipation that I picked his his earlier novel, \\"Pompeii\\". This novel had all the ingredients to be successful. The destruction of Pompeii, details on the Roman system of aqueducts and the presence of Pliny the Elder. Who could ask for more?But in the end, I was reminded of Tony Curtis' performance in the movie Spartacus. You could put Curtis in a Roman toga and give him leather sandals but in the end it was the Bronx born Tony Curtis speaking his lines on the screen. This novel has all the superficial trappings of good historical fiction but in the end, there was a contemporary sensibility that ruined this book. It is as though modern characters were taken back two thousand years and inhabit the bodies of ancient Romans. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The novel has many, many historical flaws that render the story implausible at best. One gets the impression that it was written for a quick read, quick sell, and then right to the big-screen. In view of its publication date following shortly on the heels of the hit movie \\"Gladiator,\\" one can almost see the author rushing to cash-in on the Roman \\"craze,\\" spawned by that movie. All that would be fine, a light-entertainment piece aimed at a mass-market audience; however, the author repeatedly boasts of his extensive historical research and accuracy in creating this novel, while persistently making gross historical errors throughout.As other reviews have noted, the principle characters are thinly drawn, with modern viewpoints that have little relation to the era in which they are set. The protagonist, Attilius, condemns slavery (even as he makes use of it) in a civilization that was built on slavery and could not have existed without it. He somehow manages to deduce that Mt. Vesuvious is about to erupt, even though volcanic eruptions were totally unknown to the Romans of his time. Even the most scientific mind of his era (who figures prominently in the novel) Pliny the Elder, has no clue, but a simple aquatic engineer figures this out??? His love-interest Corelia's very name smacks of shoddy scholarship on the part of the author, who poses himself as an expert in Romanology. By Roman tradition, her name would be Ampliatia, after her father; the name \\"Corelia\\" has no connection to the girl's family, and thus is not an accurate Roman name. But perhaps the most annoying, and laughable mistake is also the most minute; everywhere in the novel, the characters are burning candles---yes, wax candles! One would think, with all of Mr. Harris's indepth research of Roman engineering, that he might have deduced that candles are a relatively modern invention, first appearing in the middle ages, virtually unknown to the ancient Romans. Might this be why not a single candle, candlestick, or candle holder was found in the ruins of Pompeii or Herculaneum? There's not a single Roman artifact indicating the use of wax candles for illumination; yet there are thousands upon thousands of oil lamps from the Roman era. This somehow escaped the author's attention. Exactly what kind of research did he conduct for his \\"meticulously\\" researched novel?"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Most good-to-great novels take some time to get absorbed in. (Think \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", or even \\"Lonesome Dove\\".) But not \\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris. Here you are immediately swept up in the excitement and suspense provoked by the appointment of a new \\"aquarius\\" overseeing the Aqua Augusta, the massive aqueduct supplying Pompeii and surrounding cities with fresh water. The resentment of his new charges, the mystery of what has happened to his predecessor, the reader's awareness of the impending volcanic disaster - all this contributes to a compelling beginning within the first few pages.The momentum established in the first chapter of \\"Pompeii\\" is carried through - until somewhere near the halfway point of the novel. At about that point my interest started to flag. It began to be clear that the breakneck pace of the story had momentarily obscured the formulaic structure, the lack of any real subtlety in drawing the characters, and the thinness of the insights into the structure of 1st century Roman culture. I began to breathe a sigh of relief each time the author paused all-too-briefly for an exposition of the engineering details of aqueduct construction.Far shorter than any of the more famous novels mentioned above, \\"Pompeii\\" in the end proved a pleasant enough diversion. But the author missed the opportunity to turn his story-telling skills and immersion in the details of ancient water management techniques to greater advantage."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The author cane up with a great time and setting for the novel and he provides some interesting historical details but the plot is otherwise weak.

I don't think characters and plot lines were developed as well as they could have been. Very disappointing considering how interesting the subject matter is.

Looking forward to reading more Harris novels in the future. But let me say, if you're into the formula driven, mindless, pointless drivel put out by some authors today who may or may not have bothered to pen the first word of it (i.e: Dean Koontz, etc.), don't bother.

Vesuvius erupted suffocating an entire city with ash and rocks. If you've been to Pompeii, you've probably left there with an eerie feeling and a desire to learn more. This was the impetus in my searching out some historical fiction surrounding this event and Robert Harris' book looked like it might be the right one for me.Based on all the other reviews here, I think I'm in the minority in saying that I really wasn't that drawn to this book. When I'm reading a good book, I can't wait to get back to it. I found myself putting off picking this one up again and again and ended up taking more time to read it than I usually do with a book this size.I will say, however, that the second half was much better than the first half. While I found it interesting how the eventual catastrophe was foreshadowed by blockages in the water system, I just found the beginning descriptions so tedious.After seeing what still remains of the town, I was able to clearly picture the streets and the stores and the homes of the Roman inhabitants having walked around this same town myself. I guess when you're reading a book where you know the eventual outcome, it takes some of the bite out of it for me and I'm probably being too critical of a book that I just thought could have been better. One thing I will say with some certainty is that I'm glad I didn't live during this time of overall decadence. Some of it really sickened me."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Out of all of Harris' books, this one is my favorite... Harris has a wonderful ability to describe things in a way that lets your imagination build a mouth-watering picture of every situation. Not only does he describe the aquaduct, the bay, the moutain and the towns with incredible detail, he also describes every single (minor and major) event the same way. Mind you, he does not take several pages to do either!This book is also not only a fun read, but it will provide an ignorant person, like me, with a basic understanding of the Roman Aquaduct system, specifically the Aquaduct Augusta, and Volcanos. And what is really great is that he does not bog you down with information or statistics, he gives you just enough so that you have a BASIC understanding which can later be researched with a non-fiction book."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This novel is great historical fiction and one of the most entertaining books I've read in awhile. While we all know what is going to happen -- Vesuvius is going to blow and bury Pompeii -- Harris creates tremendous suspense as his fictional mystery plot weaves through the historical catastrophe. Harris gives us a seemingly realistic and charming portrait of the most famous casualty of the eruption -- the Roman statesman, soldier and (best known to history) scholar Pliny the Elder. Harris also creates a fully realized protagonist that the reader will care about from the first chapter. Marcus Attilius Primus -- a water engineer or \\"aquarius\\" -- is a great character through whom we learn a lot about Roman aqueducts, marvellous feats of engineering that have always left me to wonder, \\"How'd they do that?\\" Rather than answer that question with a dry exposition on Roman hydraulic engineering, this novel provides a flesh-and-blood answer through Attilius, as we watch him sleuth out the parallel mysteries of why an aqueduct stopped flowing and why his predecessor as aquarius suddenly disappeared.If you are interested in Roman history, this novel is a must-read. \\"Pompeii\\" is not as moody or brilliant as Marguerite Yourcenar's \\"Memoirs of Hadrian,\\" but is worthy of addition to any short list of great novels set during the Roman Empire. This novel is set in the same generation as that of Lindsey Davis' entertaining Marcus Didius Falco mysteries, and Harris' novel is far better. If you are not into Roman history, you will still enjoy this novel for its characters, mystery plot, and vivid descriptions of a famous natural disaster."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I liked Robert Harris' Pompeii. I read it in a few days, enjoyed it, and found the story to be well written. But - there is a but - it could be boring at times. It was definitely not the 5* nocel I had expected it to be. Anyway, I loved the ancient setting in the Roman city of Pompeii with all it's hustlers, decadent senators, prostitutes, slaves and gladiators. The main character is the young engineer Marcus, who has travelled from Rome to take over the job as water-engineer in the area around Pompeii. He soon discovers that something is wrong, and the story takes place on this the last days of Pompeii. Will Marcus get out of the city before the volcano erupts? Will he be able to save the girl he can't stop thinking about? Will he find out what happened to the missing water-engineer of Pompeii? The novel is full of interesting questions plus a good deal of 'lessons' about volcanoes, earthquakes and so on. A fairly good read, entertaing."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris wrote a great novel for those of us who can not get enough of the Vesuvius story of 79 AD. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It borders on being considered &quot;faction&quot;."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"From the pedestrian dialogue to the adequate prose, Harris attaches lots of research. But there's a reason he opens each chapter with quotes from texts on volcanoes. He's too inadequate an author to incorporate this material into the actual text. No Leon Uris he! All the characters are cardboard with the possible exception of Pliny, but Pliny's views as expressed here on sexuality do not seem bona fide. Additionally, the hero's behavior and thoughts are inconsistent. A better writer would have used this book as an outline for a much richer work. The basics are here, but little else. Don't be surprised to find yourself skimming towards the end."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii was the first Harris novel I have read. I had looked forward to it based on some reviews only to be disappointed. He did a fine job with the historical and scientific material, but his plot was no better than the plots of Hollywood B movies of the 1940's and 50's. The central character, the young aqueduct engineer, was able to go without sleep or food for three days and survive the fantastic forces of the eruption of Vesuvius - more than once! Moreover, the moral stance of the novel is that it really did not matter what happened to all the other people in the path of the eruption - not just vile former slave now rich and manipulative land owner - as long as the young engineer rescued the young woman he met briefly just two days before the catastrophe. I think Harris really knows what are the geophysical consequences of a volcanic eruption, but not the human, and that is a serious fault as his central theme is the human response to the eruption."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"How is it possible for an author to take one of the most dramatic and destructive natural disasters in Western History and render it so flat and lifeless? One-dimensional characters are the problem. Harris's people have no personalities and no nuance; they wander through a book that has the formal tone and stilted style of '50s gladiator movies. The only way to read this book is on fast-forward. Or better, wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Having visited Pompei a couple of years ago and having had a rather truamatic experience there myself, ( My wife and daughter got seperated from me and it took me 4 hours to find them - Pompeii is big!)this book really fleshed out that experience. The last half of the book is particularly compelling to one who has visited because it has been accurately researched and the streets, locales in the book correspond to what you will experience there. Also many of the prominent characters correspond to names on election posters on the walls of the streets. After seeing the tortured looking stone figures of the victims of Vesuvius at Pompeiithe description of the eruption is particularly compelling. The insights into the administration of the aqueducts, the corruption etc. also is very interesting. The characters could have been more fully developed but in the end this does not deter from the engaging experience of reading the book. Bottom line: If you're going to visit Pompeii make it a point to read this book first and then bring it with you so you can visit the spots described not only in Pompeii but also in Herculaneum and Stabaie, Miseneum etc. and also the mountain itself."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Mr Harris has clearly done his homework about aqueducts, city life, and life on the bay of Naples in the first century CE. Had he made this a short history of Pompeii, description of life in the little city, and the eruption of Vesuvius in 79, it could have been a marvelously informative book. Unfortunately, he decided to make it a novel, and failed utterly. His research prepared him to write the \\"mechanics\\" of Roman city life, but not about Romans. He lacks the depth of knowledge, not easily acquired, to be \\"fully aware of the strangeness and remoteness of a past age\\" and so is unable to \\"make it comprehensible to [his] own.\\" (This latter is a comment on the task, and failure, of ancient historians from the biography of Julius Caesar by Christian Meier, professor of ancient history at the University of Munich.) Because such awareness is beyond Harris' reach, his characters neither sound nor behave like 1st-century Romans but like 21st-century British or American sorts, viz., agnostics who nevertheless make judgments and conduct themselves according to an ethic derived from Judaism and Christianity. Read the book for the information about the eruption; the characters are not Romans, and don't arouse much empathy."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"We all know the ending. It is certain that Vesuvius will blow and the beautiful seaside resort of Pompeii will be buried, its people immortalized forever in stone and ash. However, knowing the ending does not in any way detract from the suspense and impending sense of doom as this novel races to its inevitable conclusion.I readily admit that historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but I was anxious to read this before visiting the Pompeii Exhibition now touring the US and scheduled to open soon in my area. While I found the painstaking detail Harris gave to describing the structure of the Roman aqueducts and the scientific explanations for the eruption a bit much, I can certainly appreciate the importance of his work and the background it gives to those who relish discovering the WHY of everything.That being said, I did enjoy this for the wonderful details he gave of Italian life in 79 A.D. The customs, lifestyles, manners, and more have all been amazingly researched and presented by the author. I know this will make a spectacular transfer to the screen and am glad to read that Roman Polanski is doing this very thing with a target date of 2009 for the movie to arrive in theaters.Attilius, the young aquarian and hero of this novel, has been sent to replace the former aquarian who left his job under suspicious circumstances. Many things have been happening that are out of the ordinary: the failure of the matrix, the trembling of the ground, springs running backwards into the earth, sulphur poisoning of eels, and more. Attilius promises Pliny, the eccentric historian, that he will repair the aqueducts and insure a water supply for the people.But can the good and decent Attilius overcome a natural disaster of this proportion? Will his growing romantic interest in Corelia consume him? Will her evil father Ampliatus have Attilius murdered? Can the eccentric historian Pliny make sure his reports survive so that others can benefit from his observations?Beginning two days before the eruption and ending shortly after, this book gives you the feeling of being transported for a time to this epic event. As the author reminds us with a quote from the Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, \\"It is dangerous to assume that the worst is over after the initial explosive phase. Predicting an eruption's end is even more difficult than predicting its beginning.\\""},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book even though it is not the type I usually read! Details of he eruption from the perspective of a water engineer (an aquarius) I thought was an interesting perspective. I learned quite a bit about aquaduct construction and just life in general in this time-frame. The plot was interesting enough to keep me turning pages, and while the love story was kind of a side note, I liked it too.

There were a few instances in the book that I didn't enjoy reading, but otherwise, it was good."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"A very enjoyable historical fiction book that takes you back in time and creates an interesting sideline plot in the last days of Pompeii."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It was obviously well-researched. In its depiction of everyday Roman life, I felt like I was actually witnessing it. I thought Harris' use of a water systems (aqueduct) engineer (Attilius) was a unique idea that squares extremely well with the historical record. And I thought the ruthless, vengeful, over-bearing, and psychologically scarred former slave (Ampliatus) as the bad guy was another inspired choice. I liked the way he worked Pliny into the story, although that's really a part of the historical context that I think is the book's real strength. Finally, the setting of the fascinating disaster that was Pompeii is enough by itself to warrant a huge amount of interest. The book almost reads itself - the story unfolds smoothly and the action is pretty much constant, with only a few slow spots. So why only three stars?&lt;&lt;&lt; If you haven't read it yet, and I recommend you do, don't read any further. >>>Well, the plot, in my opinion, is really weak. For example, supposedly, as the book jacket tells us, there are \\"dark forces\\" at work threatening to \\"destroy\\" the hero, Attilius. However, all it is is that Ampliatus sends a guy after him to kill him (he sends an incompetent, who, by the way, only catches up to him under really improbable circumstances, with predictable results). The problem here is that Ampliatus doesn't really have a plausible reason to kill Attilius, at least in my opinion. Attilius doesn't know anything about the games that were being played with the water bills, and Ampliatus had no reason to suspect he did, at least until later. Also, the love interest that is supposedly the motivation to get Attilius back to Pompeii (among other things) is so little developed as to be totally unbelievable. Attilius and Corelia see each other only twice (almost literally just see each other), before they both start going all Romeo and Juliet. I mean, lust is a powerful force, but so is self-preservation. And then there was the great mystery of the disappearance of Exomnius, the man Attilius was sent to replace. Turns out he just got too close to a live volcano. Finally, I didn't like the ending. After a tremendous amount of detail throughout the book on Roman aqueduct technology and the physical manifestation of the volcano, together with a confidence that Attilius was all but a Roman Jason Bourne, I was sure the escape that Attilius cooked up for he and Corelia would be a tour de force of escape literature! Sadly - not so. All we get is basically an epilogue about a man and a woman. Kind of a let-down.OK, maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, and I don't really mean to be. If half-stars could be awarded, I would make it three and a half. I'm just saying that the plot could have been better constructed, and the characters could have been more realistic, but then, that's the case with most books. I still look forward to reading some of his other books. I did like the book, and as I said, the historical aspect was spot on. Actually, with a decent screenplay, I think this could make a heck of a movie."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I love intelligent thrillers and this certainly fit the bill.

A lot, in Robert Harris's remarkably fast paced and lucid historical fiction \\"Pompeii\\".The Roman aqueducts are one of the towering achievements of ancient engineering. Built to lengths of 50 kilometers with a constant gradient of 1 meter per kilometer, the aqueducts snaked around mountains and valleys to supply water to the Roman cities. These aqueducts were constructed and maintained by the Aquarii, the hydrology engineers of Rome.It is in 79AD, as we meet the protagonist Marcus Attilius Primus, young, incorruptible, recently widowed and the new Aquarius of the aqueduct Augusta. Aqua Augusta, a massive 50-mile aqueduct that supplies water to a quarter million Roman people is suddenly failing. The previous Aquarius has disappeared mysteriously. The perturbed Marcus Attilius skillfully determines that the aqueduct is facing some obstruction near the city of Pompeii, situated beneath the famed Mount Vesuvius.Racing against time, Attilius forms a small expedition and dashes to Pompeii, promising the Admiral of the Fleet, Pliny The Elder, that he will restore the water supply in a couple of days. Pompeii, a profligate corrupt city , is the center of the story.As the young engineer is working feverishly to detect and clear the man-made conduit, another conduit made by the Gods is forming under the bowels of Vesuvius. The man-made one bringing water, the one from the Gods bringing fire. The two stories collide and as we know from history, the Gods' conduit erupts, devastatingly.Few writers bring out the details from a long dead civilization as beautifully as Robert Harris does. As you read the book, you feel the heat of the sun, the smell of the sulphur in the springs, the noises from the streets and ports of Ancient Rome, the degrading sights from the brothels of the city and the awe-inspiring dread from a cloud of pumice stones raining death on Pompeii.This book is at times a morality play, at times a love story, at times a mystery and at others, a fast paced action thriller. But mostly this story is about the two conduits, between the man-made one and the one wrought by God, one bringing life, the other death.A fast and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This book is a must read for people that are interested in this time in history. It reads like an eye witness account. As I live in volcano country, it makes me wonder if this could happen again today."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I actually read this book for a class. It's a novel, very enjoyable, but is also an excellent introduction to Roman life at the time of the eruption. At least one of the characters, Pliny, really lived, and the others seem real. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris approaches his subject from an interesting angle. The hero is an engineer assigned to care for the water lines, reservoirs, and aqueducts which served Pompeii and a number of other towns in ancient Roman Italy. The young engineer shows up to take up the position left vacant by the previous, and missing, aquarius. Attilius is almost immediately saddled with a disaster: the aqueduct fails, and people begin to go thirsty. He must discover why the aqueduct has failed, what has happened to the previous aquarius and what to do with the daughter of a local former slave who has become the richest man in the area with a cruel streak to match his great wealth. Attilius must juggle all of this while he begins to realize that the water problems are somehow related to a reawakening of the volcano Vesuvius.The book is quick paced, well written, suspenseful, and very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris really hit the target with this atractive book. He writes well, makes smart use of the many details history knows about those terrifying days in Pompei, put his characters in the middle of all that with cunning and zest and so the result is, simply, that you just cannot leave the reading until the very last page. Very satisfactory book and besides instructive for those of us that did not know too much details about the catastrophe."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this trip back in time. Not knowing alot about history I don't know how accurate it is but who cares!!! What a great story to get lost in. It's hard for me to let go and flow with books and tv/movies, but I slid right into this one!! Sit back and enjoy. A must read"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Having read 'Fatherland', also by Robert Harris, and having enjoyed it thoroughly, I decided that I may as well give another one of his books a read. I picked Pompeii because not only did the idea of a book about an engineer on the Roman Aqueducts at the time of Pompeii's eruption seem interesting to begin with- but it was also a refreshing change of topic from Fatherland. And that it was- in fact, in the end, I found it to be amazingly well researched, offering a picture of just how modern and ahead of its time Rome really was. Not to say that it doesn't get off to a slow start. After reading the first few pages, I thought I would be somewhat disappointed, but the book gets moving quickly- and once it does, you will find it hard to put down. There are occassional bits where you might lose interest or the story wanders off slightly, but everything comes together. With each new revelation coming from 2 different mysteries, both parts of the story come closer and closer together until they finally meet one another: perfectly. I won't give away too much, or bore anyone by carrying on, but the story of the young aquarius from Rome- Marcus Attilius- and the discoveries he makes just shortly after taking over as the engineer for the Aqua Augusta is an interesting one, and one that seems to indicate that I should perhaps have a look at another one of Robert Harris' novels sometime soon!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"On August 24, 79 CE, at about 1:00 PM, Mount Vesuvius erupted, spewing black clouds of magma, ash, pumice, and lethal gases over the surrounding Italian countryside and into the atmosphere, shaking the earth violently and blocking out the sun. In less than twenty-four hours thousands of people died, and the flourishing Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum had disappeared beneath tons of debris and solidified mud.Inhabitants of the cities surrounding the Bay of Naples had long been accustomed to earth tremors and wisps of gas escaping from Vesuvius, but no one considered the possibility of a volcanic eruption. In 62 CE there had been a series of severe earthquakes which caused serious structural damage to many houses in Pompeii. These quakes were a forewarning. Another quake rocked Naples in 64 CE, which the Emperor Nero, who had just made his singing debut, took as a compliment; an ovation, of sorts. Although there had been several precursors of volcanic activity at Vesuvius, without modern technology, nor knowledge of previous eruptions, no one could understand their significance. The events which occurred on August 24, and their aftermath, are well documented, and we all know the inevitable conclusion - yet Robert Harrris' historical thriller, \\"Pompeii,\\" lacks neither suspense nor mystery. His plot driven storyline, which takes place over a four day period, focuses on a terrible crisis which preceded the eruption, and would prove to be, potentially, almost as lethal.Marcus Attilius Primus has just been awarded the command of the Aqua Augusta, under very suspicious circumstances. The previous aquarius, Exominius, had run the Augusta for almost twenty years, and then, two weeks ago, he had simply disappeared without a trace. Given the drought, the extreme heat, and strategic importance of the aqueduct, he was replaced immediately by Attilius, a fourth generation aqueduct engineer.The Augusta is one of the world's greatest feats of engineering. The longest aqueduct in the world, it is even more complex than those of Rome. Beginning high in the Apenninus, the aqueduct captures snow melt from mountain springs and bears it down to the plains of Campania, then south to the coast at Neapolis, and finally to Misenum, the system's terminus. The Divine Augustus had decreed that the empire needed a port to control the Mediterranean. Misenum, the port city where the Roman fleet is anchored, is totally dependent on the Aqua Augusta, which quenches the thirst of 10,000 sailors, 10,000 more citizens, and almost a quarter of a million other people in the region. There is no other fresh water source available.When the public fountains suddenly dry up, fresh water fish begin to die, and springs turn back into the earth, Aquarius Attilius puts all his skills and education to use to investigate and resolve the system crisis. He takes on the responsibility for closing the Misenum reservoir's sluice gates, halting the flow of water into the city for rationing. On his way to meet with Pliny the Elder, admiral of the fleet, Attilius learns that the town of Pompeii still has water, giving him a clue as to where the location of the obstruction might be. Pliny sends the engineer and his men by boat to find the problem and make necessary repairs. Although the water system has failed due to seismic activity, and the frequency and severity of the earth tremors have increased, no one has any idea that Vesuvius is about to blow, not even Pliny, with all his knowledge of natural history.Along with fascinating historic and scientific detail, author Harris doesn't stint on the thrills or the storyline. His version of the last four days of Pompeii includes vivid characters who bring their own share of tension and suspense to the plot, as well as enough corruption, cruelty, intrigue and greed for two novels. The lives of the rich and famous along the Neapolitan coast are portrayed in all their sophistication, extravagance and debauchery. Wealthy, powerful real estate magnate Ampliatus, is a former slave who made a financial killing in the earthquake disaster of 62 CE, buying up all the ruins cheap and rebuilding. It is not to his advantage to see Attilius succeed. His daughter, the lovely Corelia, hates her brutish, controlling dad and looks to Attilius for assistance when a slave is murdered. Pliny the Elder, the Renaissance man of his time, is a fabulous character and his death is a poignant one. Our aquarius protagonist, is the consummate professional, focused on his work and responsibility. Yet, he is also a man of compassion and morality, who can only fathom the possibility of a future with Corelia as the city begins to die beneath their feet. And the mountain, Vesuvius, is a powerful entity to bring to life, which Robert Harris does superbly. The novel's last two days feature Vesuvius, and the details of her eruption are stunning and accurate. There are some flaws in the narrative, the pace slows two-thirds of the way through, but overall, the book makes for a terrific read.Harris prefaces the novel with the following by author A. Trevor Hodge: \\"How can we withhold our respect from a water system that, in the first century A.D., supplied the city of Rome with substantially more water than was supplied in 1985 to New York City?\\"JANA"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"A fascinating novelization of the hours before Vesuvius's eruption, Robert Harris' romantic tale of good and evil weaves threads of volcanology, lessons from history of the Roman Empire with fascinating facts of the most revered of Roman technological accomplishments; the aqueduct. A must read for those who love ancient history or historical fiction."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I found Harris' treatment of Imperial Rome to be most fair and interesting. Unfortunately, the main character was not very interesting - he really just served as the tool to allow the readers to view Roman society and engineering. It is also unclear as to why he develops his love interest and is so willing to risk his life for her when they've barely spoken to one another.Other reviewers have criticized Harris' treatment of Roman society in general, claiming that he sensationalizes the unseemly parts of Roman life, such as the brothels, the sex with children and the frequent representations of male genitalia in public places and in jewelry. I feel that he represented the spectacle that was Rome quite fairly. The Romans were master engineers, they had a society that allowed quite a bit of upward mobility, women had no rights to speak of, they were brave, and they were sexually explicit. Harris covers these aspects well. The reader would do well to remember that this is not a history of the Romans, it is merely a snapshot of the last 2 days of Pompeii.I think that Harris' depiction of the eruption was some of the best descriptive reading that I've had the pleasure to read for a while: the refugees, Pliny's vainly rushing out of port to try to save the library and refugees, the ash falling, the panic. Well done - it more than makes up for the weak character development in my mind and makes it five stars."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Okay so anyone who starts out to pen a tale of the eruption of Vesuvius is severely crippled in the 'unbelievable twist' department but since the majority of people who choose to read this are going to be aware of it the task is really to create an interesting story before the inevitable happens. By and large, Pompeii succeeds.The characters are fairly obvious-- 'hero', 'love interest', 'traitor', 'corrupt politico'-- and show little growth but since the story only takes place over four days I prefer it this way rather than have Harris try and cram in sudden, miraculous conversions. It's the plot that's important and the discovery of political skullduggery, bribery, and broken waterworks running perpendicular to a major catastrophe lends a lot of anticipation to the story. I was sneaking in chapters during class because I couldn't wait to see how subplots were going to turn out.Harris never bogs us down with overly technical engineering details or geological facts (although I did skip the uninteresting quotes at the head of each chapter) and seems to know exactly how much info is exactly to enough to make us understand what's going on without boring us to tears. All the wonderful little details of Roman baths, banquets, and even fisheries add an extra layer of depth. I never even knew wealthier citizens kept their own fisheries, let alone prized some creatures so highly they decorated them with gold and diamonds.The love between Antellius and Corelia does ring false, or at least severely premature, but in an age where women were chattel it's entirely probable a girl would fasten on to a total stranger rather than want to amrry someone old enough to be her father to maintain the family's wealth. I saw Corelia as a modern woman born into the wrong time (a nice change from the self-sacrificing wife or salty mistress these books usually offer) who found Antellius exciting and romantic because he stood up to her father and her family didn't approve. When you're young and oppressed you always embrace the rebellious choice.I'm baffled by all the complaints about knowing exactly where the story was going, considering just looking at the cover tells you how it's going to end. Did you think the volcano wasn't going to blow up after all? This is clearly labeled 'a novel' not a mystery, a thriller, or even a novel of suspense. If you prefer improbable surprises to historical fiction I suggest you go browse that section but for an entertaing read about Roman life along with some action and intrigue this is an pleasant selection."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Fans of National Geographic (if they are old enough) will remember the haunting images of the excavations of Pompeii and Hurculaneum. When Robert Harris writes the following as the first section heading, \\"Mars, 22 August, 2 days before the eruption,\\" you know that the book is going to cover the details of the eruption. You also know, because this is Robert Harris, that there is going to be a suspense story going that incorporates the disaster, just as his \\"Fatherland\\" incorporates the Holocaust in a chilling way.The story: the Aqueduct at Misenum, the Roman naval base on the Bay of Neapolis, has run dry overnight. The mystery: Pompeii, further up the coast on the same bay, still has water, so there must be a break where the line passes by Mt. Vesuvius. The complication: the new Aquarius, responsible for the aqueduct, has only been on the job a few days. The suspense: the old Aquarius has dissappeared, and everyone in town seems very frightened when his name is brought up. The story follows the new Aquarius as he tries to determine the cause of the water shortage, and to fix it, and to navigate the politics of provincial Rome.On the balance, we learn more about volcanoes in this book than we do about Romans. That's okay, though - Harris is the master of telling a story, and placing it in a historical setting (either real, as in this case, or an alternate history like Fatherland). The story moves at a rapid pace as we march inexorably towards the disaster.The only problem with the book, which robs it of its fifth star, is the last 50 pages or so. It is difficult to discuss the ending without giving away key plot points, but with a disaster of this magnitude, you'd think there'd be more deaths among the major characters. Similarly, I seem to recall from the National Geographic articles that most of those people buried alive by the lava were already dead - victims of the noxious gases that accompany any big eruption. Perhaps Harris decided that people dropping dead from H2S poisoning was not dramatic enough, but it does rob the book of some authenticity at the end."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Depending on your expectations, you may find Harris's latest work a fast paced exposition on the last days of Pompeii or a crafty novel aimed squarely at a mass market audience. It is, of course, both. Harris won't be winning any awards for the depth of characterization. We've got noble gladiators, corrupt politicians and even an innocent damsel who releases her captive songbirds from a cage. Fortunatley, the plot moves so fast and so deftly, there is barely time to consider the weaknesses of the book as Vesuvius boils in the background. Harris has the skill of a good historical novelist, little factual gems are slipped, inconspicuously, into the reader's path. Whether it's the flow of an aquaduct, or the taste of a honey coated mouse, Harris is able to use his research well, bringing the cities of Southern Italy to life. And though the same can't be said of his characters, if you're looking for fast paced diversion, you won't be let down by Harris."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"What a great escape. Step back into time to experience what life in Pompeii might have been like. Robert Harris does an outstanding job transporting you there. You can see it, smell it, hear it, and feel the human dynamics. Much like Titanic, you know the ultimate outcome, but it doesn't prevent you from wrapping your arms around the characters you come to know. It's elegant in it's simplicity. A very good read. I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I have a slight bias in reviewing this novel because of my hydraulic engineering background. The hero is a young Roman engineer, Marcus Attilius Primus, who has just been appointed aquarius in charge of the Aqua Agusta, the aquaduct serving the population around the Bay of Neapolis (the Bay of Naples).The novel is set during the height of imperial Rome, and the action takes place over a period of a few days, just before and during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Attilius has taken a working party out to repair a break in the aquaduct, the main fresh water supply for about 200,000 people. In the process he has stumbled into a nest of corruption involving the use of water and the evasion of water bills. Attilius has the flaw of being honest, and is considered a danger to people profiting from bribes.Events are compounded by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (the last days of Pompeii). The hero, Attilius, must rescue a young woman (of course) and fight various evil people in the process (of course).The novel is well researched and well written, and presents information for a general audience on both the Roman aquaduct system, and the eruption of a volcano. It is also a good adventure novel and would make a great motion picture.The novel does give a few insights into imperial decadence and the Roman class system. A slave is fed to eels, young girls (and some young boys) are held enslaved in prostitution, daughters are bartered away like commodities, corrupt politicians trade favors for votes, etc."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris has managed to interweave a fine thriller and an entertaining history lesson in his latest novel, &quot;Pompeii.&quot; The story unfolds over a three-day period, August 22-25, 79 AD....the days that spelled doom for Pompeii and its neighbor on the Bay of Naples, Herculaneum. A young engineer, Marcus Attilus Primus, has been sent from Rome to take charge of the Aqua Agusta, the great aqueduct bringing water to the communities on and near the bay. His predecessor as Aquarius, or chief engineer, has suddenly vanished. As the new chief takes charge, his path crosses that of Nuemrius Popidus Ampliatus, a former slave who has amassed a personal fortune and political influence; Ampliatus's independent, headstrong daughter Corelia; the great scholar Pliny, who is serving as admiral for the navy; and other vivid personages. Looming over them all is Mount Vesuvius, soon to rain death and destruction.This is probably not an original observation about this book, but it's a worthwhile one--much like the story of the Titanic, we know the outcome from the beginning, but nevertheless are swept up by the drama and driving force of the narrative. The author's careful research is evident, as is his skill in interweaving these details so as to add life to the story. These are vividly-drawn, fully dimensional characters who almost leap to life off the page.Harris' story reflects a world almost two millennia in the past. At the close of the book, I found myself thinking about how much progress humankind has made in that span...and how little. The last couple of centuries have brought great strides in manufacturing, transportation and communication, yet the Romans enjoyed a standard of achievement and civilization that was not to be surpassed for centuries. We can be proud of many of our advancements as a people, though some steps--such as the abolition of slavery--have come very recently in the context of our overall history.The labors of generations of archeologists have unearthed the buried remains of this once-thriving seaport. The skill of Robert Harris has brought its people vividly back to life.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"What a great read. Harris delivers a wonderful reading experience in Pompeii. The story of young engineer Marcus Attilius is certainly plausible.Young Attilius takes over responsibility of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that delivers water to Pompeii and other cities in and around the Bay of Naples. When the small city of Misenum stops receiving water via the aqueduct young Attilius convinces Pliny the Elder to let him investigate. When Attilius arrives at Vesuvius he realizes that much more than water delivery is at stake.Thrown against the background of history, Harris manages to spin a story of human interest that is at once captivating. Against the history of the time Harris develops characters that are immediately believable and sheds light on a culture that is doomed both immediately and in the longterm. His writing is economical which is refreshing.A very intriguing story that is well researched. You won't be sorry you read it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. At a time when Rome was at the height of its empire, during the Pax Romana, the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum lie peacefully undisturbed at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. The acqueducts were central to the lives of the ancient Romans: for drinking water, cooking food, and for bathing. There are many people who still remember the earthquake which shook Pompeii 17 years earlier.The story follows an aquarius (engineer of the aqueducts), Marcus Attilius, as several cities near the volcano find themselves without water. Behind this story is that of Exominius, the Greek engineer who came before Attilius. Exominius' disappearance several weeks before the eruption is a mystery to all; and even more mysteriously, no one wants to talk about the departed aquarius. Yet no one seems to be aware of the tragedy which is about to occur. What i thought was ironic was that these people live in the most advanced civilization up to the period, and had the technology to detect volcanic eruptions; yet no one knew, or was able to figure out, that the eruption was iminent.Also included in the story: a wealthy, ruthless former slave who has plans to build a magnificent bath house in Pompeii; his daughter, Corelia, who has a special bond with Attilius; and the real-life Pliny, who dies as the result of the eruption.The reason why I give this book four stars is because I felt the ending was a bit of a cop-out. But otherwise, this book is a remarkable piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"His other books are somewhat wooden, and by demanding of themselves circuitous plots, work themselves into a uniform level of intensity. This book is a simpler story, with fewer twists and subterfuges, and as a result, it breathes reality and human energies where Harris' other books seem almost computer-generated in contrast. Yes, all familiar themes are rehashed here; it is done well. The author's insights onto history are both hackneyed and refreshing. It's not Hemingway but it's a good read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii is in the tradition of the best historical novel. Set right in the period of time right before and through the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii is told from the point of view of the water engineer for a nearby town.Harris portrays a period in Roman history. He has done enough research to make the people and their culture come to life. His writing is adequate to the task but not brilliant--but who cares--this book is a lot of fun and a quick read!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Though I actually preferred his earlier novels this was still quite good. His research into the Last Days of Pompeii and the workings of volcanic eruptions was quite extensive. His key characters were nicely developed. The book kept my attention."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the historical and technical aspects of this book...especially when Vesuvius erupts---however, I was disappointed on some of the formulaic- often predictable &quot;bad guy/good guy&quot; routine and the love story angle...but, I guess some readers need that!!! I still recommended---a quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"For a writer of Harris's caliber, this was a disappointment. I've enjoyed his other books, but felt this one was filled with so much additional detail about the era itself that he lost the storyline."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris manages to write a decent novel with an intriguing \\"hook\\". It was the Empire's easy access to water, thanks to its brilliantly engineered system of aqueducts, which kept it together. When the capital to keep the water flowing ran out three centuries after the time in which this story takes place, the empire fell apart.In the story at hand, it was the disruption of the flow of water to the \\"Roman Riviera\\" in the south that first alerted those with eyes to see that something was amiss, though they couldn't quite figure out just what was happening.The premise is intriguing, and Harris' attention to historical detail is admirable. He doesn't quite have the knack to combine this historical knowledge with writing a good story or in creating good, three-dimensional characters, however. Steven Saylor, in his series of Roman novels and short stories featuring \\"Gordianus the Finder\\", is masterful at doing this, combining historical accuracy with writing a good yarn, with flesh-and-blood characters, as Harris is definately not. Harris' characters tend toward wood, his dialogue is stiff, over-dramatic and doesn't sound like speech, and he seems to have run out of creative steam by the book's melodramatic, cop-out ending.But on its own terms, this book is enjoyable."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"\\"Pompeii\\" ends with a bang: the Vesuvius eruption of 79AD, which buries the town and wipes out most of the characters. A good guy -- a waterwords engineer -- and a bad guy -- a real estate developer -- struggle, but the reader can't help thinking that what they do doesn't matter because they will all be dead in two days anyway. While I enjoyed \\"Pompeii\\" as holiday reading, I found it less of a page turner than other books by Robert Harris, such as \\"Fatherland\\" and \\"Enigma.\\" Both were about people confronting the human-made disaster of nazism with their wits, and with the ability to affect the outcome by their actions.\\"Pompeii\\" also dwells too much for my taste on the dark side of Roman society. Yes, they had slavery and masters who abused slaves, but so did every other contemporary society, and so did the US until the Civil War. Of the many characters we meet, only a handful have any integrity. All the others are hustlers or corrupt officials. If 1st -century Rome truly had been this rotten, it is hard to imagine how it could have achieved what we still marvel at 2000 years later.The \\"Disappointed\\" reader who reviewed the book on 12/1/2003 is mistaken to assume that the hero's rejection of religious beliefs is anachronistic. Writing \\"De Natura Deorum\\" more than 100 years before, Cicero states that there are philosophers who don't believe the pagan gods exist. He himself makes no strong statement of faith, but, like Thomas Jefferson with respect to Christianity, he believes that the disappearance of piety towards the gods will entail the disappearance of loyalty and social union. In other words, whether the gods exist or not, it's good for the people to worship them."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I read this in part because of the favorable reviews and after finishing the book I have to wonder what the favorable reviewers read. The book is composed of two or three barely related stories. The first is about a young roman water way specialist as he works to restore water to a town. The second and least important story is how the young engineer developes affection toward the daughter of a villain, and the third involves the destruction of Pompeii as a result of Mt Vesuvius's eruption.None of the stories was especially engaging and I could have set the book aside at any time as the story and it's ending were completely predictable."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Painstaking historical research brought to life in novel form. The main character is an engineer called in to repair an aqueduct.Stuff about volcanic eruptions and decadent Romans vomitting at feasts so they can stuff themselves again -- this was obviously before the Atkins Diet! The point of this seems to be poetic irony -- the Romans 'erupt' then are erupted on! And, furthermore, since they're so decadent to just use food hedonistically, they are clearly guilty of the classical sin of hubris, so the eruption is supposed to be a kind of divine retribution, giving this blind act of natural violence some moral dimension. These are the literary fireworks that Harris has clumsily tried to embed in the text.In a nutshell this is regurgitated, pre-chewed history for the easy consumption of those who haven't quite developed their own historical molars."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris does a wonderful job of putting the reader into the everyday life of the Roman world. There is none of the stilted dialogue of so many historical novels, and his settings are vividly clear. The problem is with the peripheral characters, particularly Corelia. Throughout the book you get no feel for who she is or why she and the main character, based on just two brief encounters, should be so attracted as to risk their lives (first she, then he) for each other. The suspense and narrative could have held the reader long enough for Harris to spend a bit of time developing his characters."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I chose this book based on the reviews I read and am so happy I did.

I felt, the author's attention to detail was very good, but that some of the characters were a bit one-dimensional. A lot of time was spent on the build up to the eruption, but I felt the author did not spend enough time on the actual town of Pompeii. A lot of the book is set in the surrounding towns. Overall though, not a bad read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Interesting view of how Romans lived just before Pompeii blew. The explination of how water was moved great distances duing a time when many people think there wasn't much in the way of technology. To calculate the drop over run sufficent to move water at just the correct rate was indeed a great piece of engineering. Oh by the way the love story isn't all the bad either."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is a good read, a well written historical novel of one of histories monumental events. I can say that I highly enjoyed it but cant say I think it was fabulous. The slow build up of events that eventually lead up to the big bang, were paced nicely and I felt the length of the novel perfect. Not too short, not too long. I learned a lot about Pompeii and the explosion of Vesuvius, things I had not known, but even so learned quite a lot about the construction of the aquaducts. On that note, I have to say I learned more than I care to have learned. The story is told through the eyes of the Aquarius, an engineer in charge of the maintaining of the aquaducts. It was an interesting way to tell the story through his eyes and I myself enjoyed the creativeness of that aspect but I cant see where many common readers would care to get that much information about these aquaducts and their functions and constructions. I felt there was way too much focus on this and not enough character development to keep the story full of suspense or compassion within the characters we meet. The author attempted to bring the protagonist a love interest and we have an inkling of a budding romance but not enough again, happens with that for a reader to get enthused about it, or to want to cheer him on in this love endeavor. I also felt that there was so much of this aquaduct story that when the actual volcanic eruption does happen at the end, not enough story goes into how the many people in different areas are affected, or what they are going through as it happens, no compassionate, heart wrenching drama to be had even though thousands of people and homes were killed and demolished. I felt the book needed a more blend of human compassion story to accompany the aquaduct aspect and the volcanic scientific input. I wont say the story was too dry, but I think it needed a little something else for it to be more enjoyable to more readers. There simply wasnt enough character development for me to like or dislike the characters involved."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"\\"Pompeii\\" is a first hand account of the eruption of Mt.

Not only was it fast paced and enthralling, it is fascinating to see how dependent the mighty Roman civilization was on its high tech (for the time) water system.The main character, an earnest young engineer, is likeable and engaging. The female lead is a somewhat stereotypical fiery and rebellious girl. The villains are suitably disgusting, but not too interesting. The most terrifying villain is the looming Mt. Vesuvius, which any modern reader can expect to errupt, burying nearby towns in ashes and lava. The volcanic eruption is the true climax of the story, more frightening than any human's plot.Obviously well-researched, \\"Pompeii\\" is a Roman thriller well worth a read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"If you're like me, you've been fascinated with Pompeii since you were a child. Who doesn't remember staring at pictures of the plaster casts of the people who met their demise during the eruption?This book brings back all of the facts and more to the forefront. It tells the story of Vesuvius and the surrounding historical characters from the viewpoint of the Aqueduct Engineer. Harris includes interesting tidbits concerning the appetitites (horrific food), depravities and other social aspects of Pompeii.If you've ever wondered what the ancient Roman's were really like; I'd definitely recommend this exciting, and quick read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The novel was one in which was impossible to set down after starting. The plot line was historically accurate, however, not boring in the least. The true and fictional characters had such interesting personalities and led to some feudal and attractive subplots. They appealed to the senses and gave some insight on what the culture was really like - which is surprisingly similar to ours. There was even some crudely ironic humor amidst the fear, violence, betrayal and many many forms of seduction encompassing the novel. The historical facets of the book also helped me out when it came to recalling significant names and places in acient rome, that were necessary in order to understand certain school courses and movies that were related to this era. All in all, it was thoroughly entertaining and intriguing, while satisfying the need to understand the important legacy left by ancient Pompeii."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I love good historical fiction. It's a painless way to enjoy a good novel while absorbing some history. \\"Pompeii\\" satisfied me on both counts. The storyline and characters are well developed, and the backdrop of Roman life and culture were fascinating. As a civil engineer, I especially loved the details of the aqueduct system for transmitting and distributing water, and how water played such a huge role in the Roman Empire.Once the eruption of Vesuvius begins, \\"Pompeii\\" races to its conclusion. Harris gives a horrifying description of what it was like for the citizens of Pompeii, who were still recovering from a devastating earthquake a few years earlier. It was painful to read about the successive stages of the eruption, each more deadly than the previous one, until the final explosion of superheated gases finished off those who hadn't escaped by then.My hat is off the the author for keeping the book under 400 pages. He tells a big story without any excess verbiage.The inclusion of a romantic interest for Attilius (the main character) was a nice touch which leads to an interesting ending (no more - that would be spoiling it).A superb book whether you read it just as an exciting novel or for the history."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I originally purchased this book purely due to its subject matter, without having much of an idea of the plotline, and was very pleasantly surprised by a thoroughly enjoyable read set in one of my favourite historical periods.Robert Harris has delivered a fast paced read which, while giving you an insight into the times and events, does not get too bogged down in the details, instead allowing the action and adventures of the characters to also describe the environment and times in which they are set.The whole time I was reading, I found myself imagining how this book would look as a motion picture, even to the point where I would fantasize on the drive to work about how I could get the word out to movie producers out there.Originally doubting Harris' ability to maintain suspense considering most readers would know that the mountain explodes at the end (hope I didn't give too much away), I found to the contrary, that knowing how it all ended actually increased the suspense, because you knew that death & destruction were waiting just around the corner.All in all, Pompeii is a thoroughly enjoyable read which I would recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in the Roman era, Vulcanology, Hydrology or a good action/suspense book."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I recommend this book. For me it's strengths aren't in the mystery/thriller aspects. I don't care that much about Marcus Attilus Primus' search for answers to the disappearance of his colleague, but I never was a mystery person. And the love story doesn't do that much for me either. On both these things it's clear that Harris is getting out some of hooks to bring in a commercial audience. Which is okay.But what I like is that this serves as a vehicle to look at life in Imperial Rome. The daily job of the aquarius is fascinating, and the whole sun drenched atmosphere of the place really pulled me in. And definitely the best sections are when Vesuvius is actually erupting. It's such a visual, viceral, incredibly imagined rendering of one of humanities great natural disasters. The way the pumice stone fills up the bay... The cloud of ash spewing into the heavens... The heat and turmoil of it all... It's very vivid, and dramatic in a way that's a notch above any possible film version. Read it for this stuff, cause it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Being a history buff with a particular interest in ancient Rome Pompeii was a \\"must read\\" for me. In the tradition of Colleen MacCullough, it gives the reader a taste of the Roman world that is coupled with a potential \\"disaster\\" movie. The novel is peppered with descriptions of life in a provincial town, the engineering and importance of the Roman aquaducts, an ambitious but dedicated engineer on the trail of corruption and revelations of nature's awesome power, a portrayal of the historical Pliny observing the eruption, a strong dose of Roman corruption and decadence, a harrowing tale of the eruption of Vesuvius,and even a budding love story with a heroic, but mystical finish. It is plodding at times during the first two-thirds with its emphasis on the repair of the aquaduct. However, the build-up to the eruption gives the reader a bit of a sixth sense as the characters step on and off stage. Pompeii is one of those historical events that almost everybody knows about in a superficial way and this novel brings the town as it existed and subsequent destruction to life. However, some readers will get bogged down and frustrated early and may put Pompeii aside. My advice is to push on and you will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris chose an engineer as the hero for this story, and I applaud that choice for several reasons. Through his choice of a working man as his hero, Harris avoided many cliches about Roman people. Of course ancient Rome had some crazy emperors,greedy and unscrupulous businessmen, prostitutes, and lazy and worthless children of rich parents; Harris worked a number of these types of characters into his narrative, as well. But Rome must also have had people with courage and integrity who worked hard for a living. Roman acqueducts are recognized as one of the greatest engineering accomplishments of the ancient world, and they could not have existed without the intelligence, hard work, and technical knowledge of people similar to the fictional Marcus Attilius. Because the main character was an engineer, Harris was able to incorporate considerable information about Roman engineering into the story in a natural way. The appearance of Pliny the Elder also provided a way to comment on the natural science of the times. Harris's understanding of volcanic eruptions enabled him to write an incredibly vivid and horrifying account of the experience that residents of Pompeii must have endured in the last few hours and days of the eruption.This book engendered considerable discussion in my book reading group. How close are the parallels between ancient Rome and contemporary USA? What degree of control can people hope to achieve over forces of nature, even using modern technologies? How do people behave in the face of disaster and panic? In what ways were Romans \\"people just like us\\"?The only element of the story I found somewhat unsatisfying was the love interest; this did not seem well developed. Apart from that, I found this novel engrossing and suspenseful - and quite historically accurate. (I've done considerable research for my own writing about Pompeii, and that background helped me to appreciate that Harris made excellent use of a wide range of historical sources to supply the details that bring the ancient world to life). All in all, an excellent reading experience."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I have heard so many good comments about this book, that I decided I had to read it, even though I feared that it may be a little bit boring by giving too many details on the Roman aqueducts. What I found instead was a highly entertaining story, which merges historical facts with fiction in a well thought out way. It is clear that the author went through great trouble to research the topics: aqueducts, volcanoes, Roman civilization, etc; and he presents the information proficiently and without losing the reader in the myriad of facts. Some of the findings exposed are incredible; for example, in the first century AD the Roman Aqueducts supplied Rome with more water than New York received in 1985!The story starts two days before the eruption of the Vesuvius and focuses on Attilius and Ampliatus. Attilius is an engineer in charge of the Aqua Augusta, an aqueduct in the south of the Campania, which provides the cities of Pompeii, Nola, Neapolis, Puteolis, Cumae, Baiae and Misenum with their water supply. Attilius comes from a long line of engineers, notable for their work with the aqueducts. Ampliatus is a liberated slave who has become extremely wealthy after taking advantage of the destruction of Pompeii by an earthquake seventeen years ago.At the beginning of the book we find Attilius looking for additional sources of water due to the drought that is affecting the Aqua Augusta. In one of his errands he is interrupted by a young lady, Corelia, asking him for help because her father is punishing a slave that was in charge of feeding his red mullets. Corelia's father is Ampliatus, and upon arrival Attilius discovers that the fish were killed because the water from the aqueduct is contaminated with sulfur. At this point the aqueduct's engineer embarks in a journey to Pompeii, where the suspected failure is located, to find the source of the problem and fix it.Even though the action is not fast-paced through most of the book in terms of the writing, Harris makes the plot so interesting that the reader is drawn to the story as a scrap of metal to a magnet. There is a very impressive presentation of the aqueducts of Rome as well as of the main traits of the civilization, its politics and the interaction between the different social strata. As most stories dealing with the Roman Empire, this one does not lack in conspiracies and betrayal. It is impressive that the book has such a high level of suspense and tension considering that the reader knows what is going to happen in terms of the eruption of the Vesuvius. This is the first Robert Harris's book I read, but it definitely woke an interest in me to read his previous works."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris skillfully recreates the events leading up to and following the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. in his extensively researched historical fiction Pompeii.Through the eyes of Marcus Attilius Primus, aquarius and chief engineer of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct providing fresh water to the cities sitting on the Bay of Naples, we experience Roman society in and around Pompeii. Attilius is summoned by the emperor to Misenum, home of the royal navy, to evaluate a problem with the water supply. Pinpointng the problem to an area adjacent to Mt. Vesuvius, Attilius aided by the scholarly Pliny, commander of the navy, sails to Pompeii.While in Pompeii, Attilius learns quickly that the real reins of power are wielded by Ampliatus, a former slave and now a land speculator and richest man in Pompeii. Ampliatus cultivates a level of decadence and ambivalence in Pompeii that leads to inactivity as it becomes apparent that their are some major geologic problems facing the inhabitants of the city. Attilius, a widower, becomes enamored with Ampliatus' insightful and compassionate daughter Corelia.With materials supplied by Ampliatus, Attilius sets out to repair the damage to the aqueduct on the slope of Vesuvius. While affecting repairs, he observes the initial seismic events which will lead to the eventual eruption.Harris masterfully narrates the events resulting in the tremendous devastation to the cities bordering on the Bay of Naples. He interestingly explores the psyche of the citizens of the area who at the time were more apt to shun scientific explanations and base these events as signs from the gods. Harris immerses us in the ancient world of Rome as we live through four monumental days of nature's havoc."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is a mystery story set in AD 79, just days before Mount Vesuvius buried Pompeii in a volcanic eruption. The new Aquarius (water engineer) of the area must find out what happened to his predecessor, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace. Meanwhile, he is vexed by a strange interruption to the water flow in the aquaduct, and a mystery of poisoned fish. Very fast paced, suspenseful, with good historical detail. It is like the movie \\"Titanic\\" in that you know the coming disaster, but not whether the characters will survive."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I have always enjoyed well written historical fiction, especially if the story line stays fairly close to actual events. This new book falls perfectly into that category: well written, historically accurate, and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages. It also has characters with whom you can become involved, and the writing is of a level that it makes you wish the actual events turn out differently, even though you know that's not going to happen. That kind of feeling only comes with a book that completely enthralls readers, as this one assuredly does. The reader does tend to learn a bit more about volcanoes than he really needs to know, but this information never interferes with the onrushing plot, and you really do care about the fate of the principal characters. It's a good read, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris is a great writer, but -- and I realize I'm going to sound prudish here -- there's some junk in there I could have done without. It's almost like he had an f-word count requirement he had to meet, forcing him to have characters say things like &quot;you and your [eff-ing] mother&quot; when the protagonist asked if he were strong enough to pull him out of a pit. (Wouldn't a simple &quot;you and your mother&quot; have worked fine?) There's also a lot of locker room talk about male (and some female) anatomy and awkwardly placed homoerotic episodes that I suppose are in there to further establish the debauchery of the &quot;bad guys&quot; in the story.None of this was needed to further the plot, in my opinion, and even seemed to interrupt the flow -- &quot;we interrupt this story to briefly talk about erections again&quot;. Harris is a good enough writer to not need to fall back on the cheap titillation and shock value that seem to be all the rage these days.It would have been a great book without it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This book has a great story line along with historical facts and great information on how a volcano erupts!

The reader learns about the Roman aqueduct system and about erupting volcanos. She also learns about the effects of the exploding volcano on the town of Pompeii and the people in it. The reader is also learns how people lived in 79 AD, what they wore, what they ate, their customs and religious observations. It's all very instructive and....(yawn)....very boring.Unfortunately, the novel framework around all this research is weak and falls apart long before Vesuvious blows its top.Perhaps the worst transgressions in POMPEII are the cartoonish characters, cardboard thin and sterotypical. Hate that, don't you?There is the evil contractor, the learned philospoher, the upright, honest hero, the innocent maiden in distress.Give me a break!There is very little action in the book except running around trying to find the leak in the aqueduct or dodging falling rock fropm the eruption. The best action takes place when a hapless slave was fed to a nasty eel as punishment for killing some fish.There aren't even any (...) scenes in libidinous ancient Rome!I think this was a good idea and there is a good novel in in all this somewhere. Robert Harris just didn't manage to find it this time.But I learned a lot and there is something to be said for that: two volcanos out of five."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris has perhaps achieved the impossible: he has turned a civil engineer into a sexy, swashbuckling hero. For that reason alone, he deserves four stars.Marcus Attilius, is the new \\"Aquarius\\", the engineer in charge of the aqueducts, in the Bay of Naples circa AD 79. He comes from a family of honest engineers who have helped make the Aqueducts of the Roman Empire, the engineering marvel of their times. The description of these aqueducts and their structures is actually fascinating.However, Attilius has a lot more to think about than how to build the next aqueduct. His predecessor mysteriously disappeared, he has had a run-in with the former slave who now runs Pompeii in the manner of Tony Soprano, he has fallen in love with this individual's daughter, and the water in many places has slowed to a drip. And we're not even getting into the fact that Vesuvius will erupt in a day or two.Harris writes a thriller that is both fast-paced (Attilius traveling all over the area in a matter of hours) and SLOW-paced (to his credit, he makes you feel the excruciating pain as the lava dried second by second by second on individuals). He mixes true historic figures-Pliny the Elder, the Admiral/Poet, who wrote about Pompeii before he too was killed in the disaster-and fictional characters.I would recommend this book to those who enjoy the historical thriller genre and don't demand too much (e.g., fully developed characters). It's a great read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is the story of a latter day Super Mario, an Italian plumber who overcomes very difficult challenges to fix the water supply to Napoli and surrounding areas before the local volcano erupts to ruin everything for everybody.OK, I admit that I am grossly trivialising a tremendous story, which is really about Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or chief water engineer, who is sent to the Bay of Naples to manage the water supply to all of the towns in the area. The main artery is the aqueduct, Aqua Augusta, which Attilius's grandfather may have had a hand in building under the supervision of the great Agrippa. Water engineering has been the career path of Atillius's family back through at least four generations.From the off, Attilius is up against it. His predecessor disappeared mysteriously, and neither his team of engineers and slaves nor those masters who govern Naples and the surrounding area, are inclined to trust the new aquarius.The first chapter opens with the horrendous execution of a slave who has been held responsible for the deaths of one of the local lord's prize fish. The lord's daughter, accompanied by the unfortunate slave's mother, urgently seek the help of Attilius, who quickly discovers that it is something in the water which has killer the precious fish. But they are too late to save the wretched slave.Events unfold and develop during the two days leading up to the famous eruption which buried Pompeii.This is a rivetting read, if ever there was one. As you would expect, there are many dangers to overcome, and, as you read, you will be wondering who will survive and who will not. This does not become clear until the final pages. I have to confess that I was wishing for the demise of certain characters, whilst hoping for the survival of others. That is a sign of how well Robert Harris engages the reader with the actors in this story.Definitely merits five stars."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Great story line, based on extensive research on the history of the era and of Pompeii and the bay of naples. Enjoyed having history come alive"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"**NOTE: There will probably be spoilers in this review.**For historical detail and context, this novel is very good. I enjoyed learning about the Roman aqueduct system, which piqued my curiosity to learn more. The descriptions of Vesuvius' eruption are excellent and really gave me a sense of the sequence and complexity of the event beyond the ordinary \\"the ground shook and the mountain spewed a column of ash\\" kind of thing. I was never particularly engaged with the characters, however. Attilius returning to Pompeii during the eruption--and surviving--all to find a girl he met a couple of times, was far-fetched and disappointing. I'm glad Harris didn't go with a Hollywood ending, but the ending reinforced for me how flimsy the characters were in the first place. Overall, I recommend reading it for the historical detail but not if you're looking for a good story, and certainly not a good romance."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"In 79 AD, a new Aquarius is appointed, Marcus Attilius Primus, after the prior Aquarius disappeared.Unexplained water loss occurs in the cities near Pompeii and the Aquarius is sent to find the cause and to correct the problem.Water was a vital commodity of the day and Attilius, an engineer, feels that his position is important and that his work should be done in a scrupolous manner.As the story begins, one of the wealthy residents, Ampiliatus, a former slave, is putting one of his slaves to death. This young man was responsible for caring for Ampiliatus's prized fish which were meant to be delicays for honored guests. When the entire stock of fish die, the slave is blamed.In an attempt to save this innocent man, Ampiliatus's daughter goes to Attilius who demonstrates to Ampiliatus that the fish died because of sulphur in the water.With the excellent narration of Michael Compsty, the story follows as if we are experiencing events on the History Channel.Attilius begins to investigate a possilbe fault in the aquaduct while certain officials attempt to stop him because they fear that he will discover that they had used the water in an illegal manner.There is excellent drama as the action begins two days before the volcano erupts. We follow Attilius as he investigates the problem and attempts to provide a solution while his life becomes more in danger every moment.This is a highly entertaining story that shows the author's research into the times and the life in the city of Pompeii.

When things start going amiss with the water supply his investigations throw him in the middle of a disaster not just from nature but also from men who would stop him from knowing the truth about the water supply.MY FEEDBACK:1) CHARACTERS - First I needed to realize that I was listening to the abridged audio version. Even with that I enjoyed the main protagonist but I also found the rest of the cast to be backdrop. But I also realize the book is called Pompeii and the story is really about that part of the world more than the people in the midst of this historic disaster.2) SETTING - I definitely felt like I was in the Bay of Naples at this time in history. Enough detail is given to develop the right picture in one's mind but not too much that I just wanted the author to get on to other things. It appears he did his homework and delivered the right words for the overall setting.3) PLOT - How does one tell a natural disaster story? Not an easy question to answer and the fact that Harris chooses to take the story from the perspective of the aqueduct maintenance man shows ingenuity, creativeness and originality. At no point did it occur to me that something wasn't plausible or believable. I enjoyed the quest the protagonist had in his effort to wade through corrupt officials and the challenges of nature. Even though I didn't care for the characters that much, the story propelled me along at an even pace giving me enough suspense at the impending doom to want to know what happens next.OVERALL: It is a solidly good story. Not great, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris's Pompeii is the perfect combination of factual history and enticing plot that captivates readers from the very first page till the last. Once I began to read this novel, I literally couldn't put it down! I found Harris's depiction of Roman life to be very accurate and gave the reader a great view into the world of the typical Roman. Harris lays the foundation for the reader by providing brief descriptions of many elements of Roman life without straying from the plot too much. He skillfully unravels the plot with precise timing adding the just the right amount of suspense. This novel is far more than the story of Mount Vesuvius erupting; in fact most of the novel takes place before the eruption.Harris allows the reader to see through the eyes of many different people living throughout the Roman Empire. He not only examines the wealthy patrician class but also slaves and \\"middle class\\" Romans. I believe the best part of Pompeii is the characters, because inevitably we all know Mount Vesuvius is going to erupt. I have to admit I was disappointed with Harris's ending. He so gracefully laid out the plot of Pompeii only to end the book in a mere two pages. It seems as though he took his time developing the story then hurried to end it. Overall, I thought this was a really good book, but the ending was disappointing."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii, 79 A.D. has always fascinated, but who were the people now silently preserved forever? What must their lives been like? Many people fled and lived, there was time. But some did not, why? What are their stories? They held loved ones close in their last heart wrenching moments. The reader cannot help but put one's self in their place and wonder, 'how would I have faced my death?'The massive aquaduct is failing and several towns are going dry. In this believeable fiction we are introduced to a few people whose lives and schemes depend on that aquaduct. The reader is swept into Pompeii as we follow a young engineer or an aquarius as he is called. His job is to repair the aquaduct, FAST. He soon discovers to his horror that Vesuvius is the cause of the failure, but so much worse than that, the volcano's eruption is imminent.Not just the volcano threatens. Pompeii is nearly owned by a greedy former slave now powerful politician whose scheme of greater wealth depends on the water supply; and this aquarius with his high principles must never be allowed to report to Rome. Firestorms threaten on all sides, and time is running out.Michael Cumpsty's voice easily adapts to the many characters he portrays.

I wanted the story to go further, but it sort of just ended."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Just like the movie, Titanic, this book does not have a surprise ending. Since the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and Pompeii's fate are so well-documented and cited in our culture, the audience already has an expectation about the plot and is more likely to be critical. As a former archaeologist and an Earth Science teacher, I couldn't help but look for inconsistencies. As other reviewers have pointed out, Harris does come up short in some ways. However, I really appreciate his approach to the story.The book reads like a mystery, where an aquarius is trying to determine why the aqueduct (the water lifeline) has gone dry. As he investigates, he encounters many symptoms of impending volcanic eruption, but has no way of knowing this. He is suspicious and compelled to understand the phenomena, like his acquaintence, Pliny (Yes, Harris does make a character of the epitomal historian). All the time, Harris reminds us of the science that relates to these phenomena by opening the chapters with excerpts of volcanology resources.I would recommend this book as a read for a summer vacation at the beach or a cold weekend in blankets. It is a quick read and is very entertaining and compelling, but does not require reflection or mental exercise."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii is interesting from a historical standpoint because in 79 A. D. it was buried by rock and lava from the nearby volcano, Mt. Vesuvius. It was therefore preserved in its intact state for many centuries until it was excavated in the last century, and now stands today as a mostly uncorrupted example of and ancient Roman town. So when you see a book with this title you don't exactly have to be a genius to figure out what eventually is going to happen. Nevertheless, it is an interesting tale and seems to be an accurate representation of life in the ancient Roman empire.The story has to do with an &quot;aquarius,&quot; who is a fellow whose job it was to maintain the architecturally impressive Roman aqueduct system. He comes to the area after the previous guy disappears, and one of the subplots of the novel is how this happened. As a precursor to the event we all know is coming, there is also a rupture in the aqueduct system he must find and fix, which requires him to interact with various historical and fictional personages of the day. This is pretty much the plot before the big one hits, and it's at least mildly interesting.The historical detail also seems to be accurate and is also interesting. One gets a pretty good sense of life in an ancient Roman town. There is a memorable meal ending with a purge at a wealthy fellow's home. There is an investigative visit to a house of prostitution and a description of the building and the ribald goings-on there. There are descriptions of clothes and tools and weapons and other ancient paraphernalia.Things of course pick up a little after Vesuvius blows up and this is also well described. Interestingly, the thing was witnessed by a Roman historian, Pliny--who is an important character here--and the events described in this novel accurately reflect his observations. After the first explosion rocks literally rained from the sky, filled the bay, and were eight feet deep in some places in Pompeii. It then blew up again, and of course things became much worse.All in all, it's a pretty good, light read. There's not a lot of depth to the characterizations, though, and although the historical aspect is accurate, one would not really describe it as being richly detailed. One can't help but wish there was a little more to it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The year is 79 AD and the place is the Bay of Naples. The flow of water from the aquaducts have been interrupted leaving several towns without any water supply. It is up to the engineer, Marius Attilius Primus, who is in charge of the proper functioning of the aquaduct, to find out what happened. The problem is a potential catastrophe in that the water has been interrupted to over a quarter of a million people. In addition, sulpher gases have begun to appear from underground conduits and minor earthquakes have become more numerous. Attiilus soon fears an eruption of nearby Mt. Vesuvius. He must go to Pompeii for men and supplies to attempt to repair the aquaduct until his fears prove to be real.Using an aquaduct engineer as a main protagonist is an original and inspired idea. This proves to be an excellent way to highlight the politics and city life at the time off the eruption. The problem with the book was that the plot was not thrilling enough to keep the pages turning.

As soon as you meet these characters it is clear what is going to happen the writing is so bad.

Harris does take some liberty with the events, but all in all they are true to the accounts of what actually happened. The inclusion of Pliny the elder is truly great, since it is his accounts of what happened, that actually allow us a glimpse as to what it was really like.As one would guess, the novel climaxes with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and like all truly great historical fictions, even though you know what is going to happen, you find yourself hoping that everyone will make it out alive.

I can compare it to the movie \\"Titanic\\": the details of the disaster where gripping and very realistic. But to get there, the reader/viewer is asked to trudge through the development of a story and characters that doesn't live up to the end.I did enjoy the information about the aqueducts and Pliny the Elder. That of the aqueducts is probably very accurate, based on the ruins we still have available for inspection and study. That of Pliny is probably a little less reliable, but interesting and genuine-looking enough for me. The rest of the characters I thought were predictable and perhaps too stereotypical.The scenes of the disaster were rendered even more vividly for me as I thought of those scenes of 9/11 when we could see those terrible images of people walking around in a daze or running in panic in the dust that made it seem like nighttime at 10 o'clock in the morning. Having seen enough TV shows about the ruins of Pompeii and the figures of humans found in their death poses makes the book very interesting and helpful in understanding what happened.It is a relatively short book (274 pages) and it does read very quickly. So if the reader is flustered with the story leading to the eruption, I recommend sticking it out till the worthy end."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I could barely put this book down; now, having just finished it, it is definitely going on my \\"best reads\\" list for 2005.

I had just finished Eric Larson's wonderful Devil In The White City and James Dalessandro's astonishing 1906, trading the latter to a friend for Pompeii. I must tell you, I was greatly disappointed by Pompeii. Yes, Mr. Harris is a fine researcher, he had every tool and article of clothing down to a science, but I have a hard time understanding how anyone could consider this novel suspenseful. The main character, Attilus, a young engineer on the Roman aqueducts, finds out very early in the story that sulfur has somehow leaked into the water system, and the there must be a break in it somewhere, which is why the water has been reduced to almost a trickle in some spots. Good, let's get to it: the problem is, 125 pages later, they still haven't gotten to the break in the water. What we have is banquets and tool gathering and drinking and childish bickering and a fledgling romance that is so marginal you wonder why Harris even bothered. When he finally does get to the volcanic eruption, you are exhausted from plowing through all that minor details and tedious characters, and then wham, the whole disaster is over. It took James Dalessandro as long or longer to get to the 1906 earthquake, but every page was riveting, full of color and conflict, with a sense of suspense and urgency that had me squirming. With Harris, I could not wait for that section to be over: I had to constantly force myself to plow through it waiting for the emotional and physical pay off. I thoroughly enjoyed Harris' Enigma, and respect his scholarship, which is why I gave him three stars. But Raymond Chandler once said that the British may not be the world's best mystery writers, but they are the world's best dull mystery writers. This is dull, and tedious, and I hate to say, but boring for long stretches. Try Isaac's Storm, or Seabiscuit, or 1906 for mesmerizng historical fiction or journalism. I have several friends who agree with me on all of the above."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I read \\"Fatherland\\" and liked it.

The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore.\\"Pompeii\\" is more like \\"Enigma\\"--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it.And it is equally dull. I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details. The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional. They are predictable and uninteresting. And the plot, of course, is known beforehand. The romance has no sparks.If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you. But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Harris' \\"Fatherland\\", but I'm afraid I can't recommend \\"Pompeii\\". The plot was linear and predictable and the one-dimensional characters were just not very interesting. For a historical novel I expected more insights into Roman thought and culture, but those aspects of the book were pretty superficial.It's not a horrible book, but it's just fluff. Fuff with a touch of history, but fluff nonetheless. I expected better."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This 3.5 star story is set in the region around Pompeii just a couple of days before the volcano Vesuvius buries it. The protagonist, an 'aquarius' - works for the water department in Rome and is sent to investigate a problem with the aquaduct system near the city identified in the book title.He encounters disgruntled laborors, corrupt city officials, scholars, and a love interest.Harris does a good job of describing the lives of people from various stations of life in the Empire, especially the 'lower' positions. He portreys things that are different - technology, food, views of the worth of the individual - and the things that remain the same - greed, snobbery, government bureaucracy, violence and powermongering.I found it even more interesting for the picture of ancient Rome that it paints than the plot, but the story moves along well, keeps you turning the pages and comes together quite well."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii does not quite live up to the standards of Robert Harris's previous work. Perhaps as a consequence of the story's era, Harris spends a lot more time in scene setting. Day to day routine needed little elaboration in Enigma, nor really in Fatherland, given that the settings of those stories were relatively close to contemporary life. Much of this historical scenery is interesting, and Harris's detailed research does come through with a commanding grasp of the facts. The price the reader pays is that it also clutters up some of the character development.Where history and action combine (executing a slave by feeding him to the eels, for instance) the writing achieves and perhaps even exceeds the class and pace of some of Harris's earlier work. Parts of the text drag, however, as the need to explain context competes with the need for the story to move forwards. The corruption plot comes through a little clumsily at times, as well.Overall this is by no means a bad book - for holiday reading it is great. It is just not quite the compelling page-turner Enigma was."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"its ok, but it gives you to much information to soon, i mean the city of Pompeii is thrilling and so is teh thought of how the people must have felt about it, but this information filled book sucked teh life out of the doomed city, personally i think he could have done much better and his past books support that. I wish he couldve made some of the information just disapear then maybe it couldve made a better turn-out. I was throughly disapointed."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I cannot say I liked this book. It had its moments, but they were few and far between. Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in. Very boring indeed.Premise: The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct. Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why. He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing. You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad. The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.There is poor writing and very poor characterization. Each character is briefly described if at all. The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with. In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.Avoid this book if possible."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Despite what you might think, Mount Vesuvius is something of a secondary character in this historical novel, even though the reader is well aware of what's in store for the mountain and the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. But knowledge of the impending cataclysm only increases the reader's interest with each successive tremor or sulfurous odor.Robert Harris could have opted for a multi-character \\"movie of the week\\" kind of scenario, but instead he focuses more tightly on Attilius, the newly appointed Aquarius (think chief engineer) of the Aqua Augusta, the freshwater lifeline of southern Italy. It's a good choice, in fact I found the historical details of the Roman aqueducts more fascinating than the volcano; but then I opted for physics rather than geology in high school. In any case, a disruption to the flow of water to the people around the Bay of Neapolis (Naples) sends Attilius on an expedition to repair the aqueduct and restore the flow of water.If ash and lava pose the more imminent threat, it's water that offers the catalyst and ultimate redemption. What should be a routine \\"fix and repair\\" operation uncovers further mysteries involving the disappearance of Attilius' predecessor, political corruption and romantic intrigue. And the presence of Pliny the Elder as a major character offers a number of opportunities for scientific or historical digression, none of which derail the story, thankfully enough.The actual eruption of Vesuvious and its subsequent destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum only constitute the final hundred pages of the book, but the Harris does an excellent job of describing the event as if you were there to witness it. It's a good book, although not worthy of some of the hype that it's received."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Summary:Pompeii by Robert Harris is a historical fiction novel told from the point of view of an aquaduct civil engineer (interesting premise). He is used to bind the various elements of Life in and around Pompeii leading up to and including the eruption of Mt. Vesuveus. The political corruption, engineering mastery and social decedance of life in the late stages of the Roman Empire are hinted at but not much detail. The characters are ok not very developed but effective; the prose is tight and efficient; and the pacing is done well.Characters: The novel is fairly short so the character development seems to have been left out to a large degree. The architypal Romans are worked into the story but mostly a plot devices vs. true characters. The main character, Attilius, seems a bit too modern for the time period. He is strong anti-Gods which is not appropriate for the times -- he comes across as a agnostic modern civil engineer. Pliny the Elder is probably the most developed of the characters in the story -- nicely done.Plot: The plot is pretty simple; Attilius is made the new engineer in charge of the aquaduct when the old engineer dissappeared two weeks earlier. Attilius gets involved when sulphur is detected in the water. The story goes from there using the aquaduct as a way to move characters around the Bay of Naples and interconnect the political players of Pompeii with the action. The plot does not have many twists but shows how easy government can get corrupted and why big government is not good.Prose: The prose is tight and efficient -- like the engineer. The flowery prose of Pliny is a nice addition to the somewhat stark writing style. It is a quick and fun read. The information on aquaducts was very interesting to me...especially the fact the water kept running after the eruption. You have to admire the Romans as civil engineers; unparalled in the world.Action: The action is interesting; the stages of the volcano eruption are interesting to find out about and how they would manifest in Roman society plus a bit of the reaction to the effects. You should be expecting a huge amount of action but it obviously picks up as the eruptions gets really going.Overall: 3 stars - 3.5 starsCharacters: 2.5 stars - 3 starsPlot: 3 starsProse: 3.5 starsAction: 2 stars"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"What a wonderful blend of fiction and history. It's a perfect blend of real characters, places, with fictional ones. The fictional characters help you to imagine the real lives of all those folks that we've seen since we were kids of people caught by the explosion. Now you can look at them and wonder which character they were in the book.The story basically follows the hero (the Aquarius) as he tries to determine what is going wrong with the water supply on the peninsula. In the process, we're met with his predecessor who seems to be embroiled in a cover-up of what's really happening up on the mountain that could just as easily be set in modern times.Of course the book lapses into all sorts of heroics and almost impossible tales of survival by some, that would be worthy of a movie plot, but it is fiction, so enjoy the read. I may have to try more of Mr. Harris's books.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This seemed less a historical novel to me than a rather scathing critique of our own times. At the end Harris even makes some strange and cryptic comments on the goings-on of these days, including an odd thought about \\"global warming.\\" (no, not at all the predictable global warming comment). If it is all a metaphor for the current Zeitgeist then what Harris has to say may not make a lot of people happy.The favorable straight-up reviews are solid and those seeking a fast-paced and well-written historical novel should grab this. However, if you're the sort who likes books that may be more than what they seem (you know who you are) then i think you'll like this a lot."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This was the first book I've read of Robert Harris, and as it was recommended to me just a few weeks before going on a vacation that would include a trip to Pompeii, I thought I'd give it a shot. Harris' book breathed new life into the ruins as I visited them, and Vesuvius looked all the more menacing as it towered over Pompeii.For me, what separated this book from your typical mass-market fiction was the research that Harris obviously put into this book, as well as the unique perspective he guides the reader from. Rather than an obvious main character (such as Pliny, or a generic centurion), we have Aquarius: a man of character and honor, who above all has a pretty cool job that provided a bit of suspense to a book with an inescapably obvious ending to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Roman history!A fun summer read that's fascinating and well-written, Pompeii: A Novel provides a unique perspective on a famous natural disaster. I give it a solid 4-star recommendation."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I have to confess : I am a Robert Harris fan. He writes about times and places with the self confidence of a guide who was there when the story took place. All his books are well researched and POMPEII is no exception. It is a Greek tragedy with a twist : we think that we know the end - but we are kept in suspense until the last page delivers a new hope.There is no doubt that Robert Harris is in a class with James A. Michener and I hope that his next book will take us to some other exciting periods in human history: Carthagena ? Cronwell's England ? Vatican ?"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I was very impressed with Harris account of the last days of Pompeii. The details described, not only of the volcanic eruption, but of way of life in that period of the Roman empire were great.I have read a number of books regarding the Roman empire and all though I am not an expert, thought that part of the story was well researched and written.However, I had more issues regarding the romantic interests of our hero. I didn't think this really added much to the story. I was intrigued by the disappearance and mystery surrounding the old aquarius. Unfortunately, the story lines regarding the new aquarius's wife and the romantic portions were not to my liking. This got to be a little tiresome and in my opinion not neccessary.I did ienjoy the Pliny the Elder's character. This chracter comes more into play towards the end of the book.

Vesuvius and the two days of the eruption. Winchester provides a glimpse of Rome; both its glory and its ghastly. Readers are treated to historic facts. For instance, the aqueducts which supplied the city of Rome actually provided more water than the city water authority provided to New York City until 1985. However, many of Rome's repulsive attributes are also on display, such as the thriving institution of slavery, rampant sexual depravity and gluttony.

The story follows the aquaduct engineer well tries to fix it and try to find out why his predecessor goes missing. It also follows 3 other character who the engineer comes across, which are a freeman who owns a lot off the town and is corrupt, as well as a young lady who is his daughter and a elderly scientist (for the people into roman history is Pliny the Elder). The book is very well written and keeps intrested all the way through. It brings the ancient city of pompeii and surrounding area alive and puts a real touch to it.

Dambusters! The water engineer heads out amid widespread corruption in Pompeii, thwarts a murder plot, finds out what happened to his predecessor, falls in love, and investigates the ominous rumbling from the nearby Vesuvius.Sounds good no? Harris is good at building up the air of menace in the days preceding the eruption. Every action can be looked at as minor compared to the devastation coming and he really does a great job of creating an atmosphere of anticipation in the reader. He's also done a great job at recreating the feel of living in Roman times, as well as supplying a lot of information on Roman aqueducts giving you a sense of awe and genius for the Roman Empire.Where he falls down though is in the characterisation. Attilius, the engineer, is the hero. He's a stoic, good looking gent who sends his pay home to his mother and sister in Rome. He doesn't take bribes, he's hardworking, and is disliked for his strict attention to detail (all for the good of Rome naturally). He's so perfect in fact that he's boring. But he's not alone. A equally dreary love interest is introduced who meets the engineer no more than 3 times briefly but over the course of those 3 encounters the reader is supposed to buy that they have fallen madly in love and would die for each other. The whole reason for the engineer to rush back to Pompeii after escaping it is because of this love interest and as such everything feels very contrived.It's this lack of convincing that stops the reader in their tracks because there's no real reason, once the eruptions start, to care what the engineer's motivations are. He's a paper thin cardboard cut out and so is his love interest. So what?The third act also falls down. Harris does a great job of setting the scene but once Vesuvius erupts he somehow manages to make it boring. For a thriller to fail in the third act is not a good sign and I could quite easily put the book down and do anything else.It's not a bad novel by any means it just seems trite at times which spoils the overall effect. Harris has obviously done his research, it's just a shame the same effort didn't go into making an interesting enough scenario to take place during this immense natural disaster or characters worth caring about."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I first read this book at my mother-in-law's home in Germany and was thoroughly engrossed by the story and the author's interpretation of Pompeii and what happened there so long ago.

I noticed the phrase \\"begs the question\\" is misused on page 62 by Pomponianus, however.One thing I would have very much appreciated however was much more detailed annotations and a glossary. I found some of the descriptions of the workings of the aqueduct hard to follow; I would have really appreciated diagrams.

He started his writing career as a journalist, continued writing some non-fiction books till he wrote his first great success: \\"Fatherland\\" (1992) an alt-his novel exploring a world where Germany won WWII.After writing some more noteworthy novels Harris has turned his attention to the fascinating world of Ancient Rome (one of my preferred themes) starting with \\"Pompeii\\" (2003) and more recently issuing the first volume of an intended trilogy about Cicero.In order to write \\"Pompeii\\", Harris has done a good historical research that reflects all over the novel. Details about daily life, social organization, technical & building methods and transportation amongst other items are blended seamlessly into the main argument.Does this mean that the book is boring? By no means, Harris is able to show all these features and at the same time construct an engaging story that will trap the reader.The story is as follows: a young hydraulic engineer (aquarius for the Romans) is urgently sent from Rome to the Bay of Naples zone to investigate what's going on with the great aqueduct that services the whole area.Pending his investigation Attilus will become embroiled into local political affairs, corruption is old as human society and, fortunately, young incorruptible people too.At the same time as every reader knows Mount Vesuvius is going to violently explode erasing Pompeii and Herculaneum.

Being placed in charge of one of the Roman Empire's great aqueducts is a key advancement in the career he loves, that has been followed by the men in his family for generations; and taking on such an important job at a dangerous time, during a puzzling and increasingly severe drought, distracts him from the grief that still haunts him three years after his young wife's death in childbirth. He's challenged by the hostility of his work crew in general, and of its foreman in particular. He's puzzled by the unexplained disappearance of his predecessor, and by a lot of other things that just don't add up. When the Augusta stops flowing, leaving town after town without that great necessity of civilized life - a copious and steady supply of fresh, clean water - Attilius sets out from his station in Misenum for Pompeii, across the Bay of Naples, to find and repair the aqueduct's break. He suspect it's got something to do with earth tremors, sulfur-contaminated water that came through to Misenum just before the Augusta failed, and maybe even something to do with his vanished predecessor. It all seems to center on the mountain overlooking the prosperous coastal city of Pompeii...a mountain called Vesuvius.Vividly written and well researched, this fine historical novel plunges the reader into the Roman world of A.D. 79 and makes that world both understandable and real. Although there's little time and space for in-depth character development, the people depicted behave both consistently and believably; and it's fun to glimpse both Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger as actors in this drama.

The novel takes place over a 2 day period before the eruption as seen through the eyes of the water engineer and widower, Marcus Attiliusrecently dispatched from Rome after the mysterious disappearance of his predecessor Exomnius. Something rotten is going on with the Aqua Augusta, animportant aquaduct supplying the region around the Bay of Naples. Harris introduces some historical figures like Pliny the Elder, some local movers and tycoons, assorted and sundry slaves, politicians and scoundrels as well as the beautiful Corelia who is treated as chattel by Ampliatus, her machiavelian father. Tension builds as Vesuvio(It) rocks and rolls toward its famous blowup. Will virtue be rewarded, will the scoundrels get scalded, will true love win out in the end?The strengths of the book include a good feel for roman society of the time, a grand and detailed depiction of the events preceding and following the eruption which I know to be pretty accurate, and a quick paced thriller which keeps the readers interest. The characters are pretty believable and most of the action sequences flow pretty well, the exception being the end of the book which is clunky and abrupt. My disclaimer is that I am recently returned from the area and our climb of Vesuvio and visits to Pompeii and Herculaneum were one of the highlights of our trip and Harris' depiction of the area is dead on. What is stunning is the dense urban landscape that once again clogs the slopes and surrounds this dangerous volcano."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"The novel is just amazing, very easy to go though, you would want to read it all at once.The historical background is even more accurate, as an Italian and passionate of Roman and Napolitan history I can tell!you will feel like being one of the historic characters of the book, and live the drama of the Vesuvius eruption."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Robert Harris was born in Nottingham in 1957 and attended Cambridge University.

He is the author of a number of books, both fiction and non fiction.I have just read this book for the second time and found it even better than the first time. I am a bit of a sucker for anything to do with Roman history and although this may not be the most accurate account of what happened when Vesuvius erupted, no one who witnessed the eruption and the subsequent mayhem and destruction caused to the city of Pompeii is still alive, or for that matter has been for the last couple of thousand years (for those who like detail, AD79).

This book is an interesting and compelling work of historical fiction. The book opens in the days leading up to the great eruption. Marcus Attilius has been dispatched from Rome as the new \\"Aquarius\\" or chief engineer of the elaborate aqueduct system that moves fresh water along from town to town. The previous Aquarius has mysteriously vanished. Attilius soon finds impurities in the water that fortell of something ominous. He immediately runs into troubles when he encounters Ampliatus, one of Pompeii's wealthiest citizens and a man prone to immense cruelties.The book, without being too overweighted with historical dialog, is a facinating look at what Roman society was like. Attilius is a sympathetic and down to earth character amidst the backdrop of a Roman empire ruled by self indulgent and corrupt leaders. The Romans had brilliant engineers who designed and built this advanced aqueduct as well as powerful citizens who diverted and sqaundered this precious resource for their elaborate pools and fish ponds, even while the lower class goes thirsty. This book is reminscent of James Cameron's Titanic movie. This book and that movie both introduced compelling fictional characters who were caught up in the middle of a real and famous tragedy. Even though we know how it will end we still find it compelling. This fast paced book is a great read for the beach."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I bought four copies of this book. In addition to its being a colorful thriller, set in an interesting time, I should mention that I was just about to climb Vesuvius when I first read the novel and that I come from a family of geologists, hydrologists, and mining engineers. There, now you are alerted to my bias! I especially had fun imagining various men of my family as the protagonist. Heroes with backgrounds in the earth sciences are a rare breed because engineers tend to be too circumpect to get themselves into any sort of dangerous excitement. Of course, when one finds oneself involved in a volcanic explosion, being circumspect is no shield and one must use one's brains and experience to find a creative escape. (Brawn and bravado are not alone sufficient, but moral fortitude can define a different sort of heroism. (Think Bilbo Baggins.) I really liked this aspect of the novel. Creativity and seasoned intelligence are traits sadly missing from the heroes of most thrillers.I liked the writing well enough to go back and purchase Imperium (also by Harris) which gives a very different look at the life and career of Cicero. It, too, is an exciting discovery for anyone with an interest in the dirty side of politics. It requires a special talent to bring to life legal wrassling, social climbing and political events that occurred millenia ago."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I was disappointed when I finished Pompeii. Sometimes books are like that. I enjoyed it so much: learning about life in Rome in the first century, discovering the engineering wonder of the aqueducts right down to the degree of slope necessary to carry the water, discovering what an aquarius was, seeing the warnings that Vesuvius was sending, and then enjoying the \\"romantic\\" element that intertwined with the \\"mystery, murder, mayhem\\" scenario. Pompeii was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience for me that I didn't want to end. I'll have to re-read this one."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Somewhere in Florence, perhaps in the Uffezi, stands a plaster of paris imprint of the mumified remains of a roman soldier, fleeing from the advancing lava of Vesuvius, trapped and immediately frozen in time by the sea of molten magma moving several hundred miles an hour. All for us to discover 2000 years later.What's interesting is the muscle tone of the back, the lats, the traps, the fingers outstretched, clawing, shocked. And of course the size . . . 'anatomically correct' an ad might read, 'but a foot and a half shorter.'I've always been struck by the similarity of those men and women, breasts, knuckles, toes, calves, really all the same as us.So that's where Harris takes us, and like Umberto Eco, we see one mystery atop another, atop another. And despite the excesses common to a barely regulated society, we meet the same kind of people, from the greedy and the cruel to the honest and the moral. The brave and the cowardly, the curious and the self absorbed.I found nothing to flaw this book. Writing historical novels is to take on an extra burden in the dialogue: What would the characters have said to eachother? So when the Aquarian Attilus confronts his feelings for the 18 year old Corrilia, there just aren't any self help books written on papyrus to give him any advice. Insight. Suggestions.Like David Robbins, and the aforementioned Eco, and Ken Follet writing his masterpiece of the building of the Cathedrals in Europe in the 9th c, Harris does a wonderful job in bringing us back to the time just following Nero, four days before the most well known volcano eruption before Mount St. Helens. Good job. Worth the read. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"If you love history, thrillers, human drama, this is a very good book. The research is impeccable, the action very strong, the characters interesting. I read voraciously and just finished Pompeii; Isaac's Storm, about the Galveston hurricane in 1900 (excellent); and James Dalessandro's 1906, about the great San Francisco Earthquake, which I discovered after reading a review on Bookideas.com. I highly recommend all three, particularly 1906, which is one of the best novels I have read in years."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Eminently readable and encompassing a break-neck pace, \\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris is a delightful, action-filled novel that also has a unique historical side that should appeal to all readers. Under the aegis of the imminent eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in Roman dominated Italy in 79 A.D., Harris presents us with Marcus Attilius, a young Roman engineer who's suddenly charged with oversight of the massive Aqua Augusta when it's former manager disappears inexplicably and with troubleshooting of a seemingly damaged section of the Augusta.Right from the start, subtle clues and occurances force Attilius to consider that this is not a normal maintenance project. Coupled with the rougue state of the characters under his command, Attilius sets out to find whats wrong with his beloved Augusta. Character development and subtle plot twists overlay the coming disaster and Harris is superb at describing Roman life and 1st century Italy as it fits this story. What Attilius discovers and how he finds himself ensconsed in the tragedy is brilliantly depicted by Harris...we not only get a first-rate thriller, but an important geology lesson as well (Harris supplements each chapter with an excerpt from his various sources of scholarship on Volcanology).The apex of this work is without doubt the eruption of Vesuvius and how each character is then affected. Using the afore mentioned sources of Volcanology, Harris paints a truely realistic picture of what that massive explosion was like and the immediate after-affects on the towns and country-side. Without giving too much of the ending away, Harris provides an entertaining and plausible conclusion that should please all readers.Whether your interested in geology, Roman history or just enjoy an action-filled read, \\"Pompeii\\" should satisfy all these needs. Robert Harris is to commended for expert research and sublime story-telling that should make Pompeii not only a great story, but an important source on the Vesuvius eruption. I would not hesitate to recommend this work very highly."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This is superb beach fiction: It has all the elements - the courageous public employee trying to prove himself, his technical staff that may not be trusted, the criminal resort developer and his political toadies, the developer's pulchritudinuous daughter and the volcano that brought them all together - in 79 AD. Remember when Tony Soprano said...\\"We are the Romans\\". This should go straight to HBO..now - ignore the serious reviews - this is a FUN READ."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Dateline, August 79 AD: Marcus Attilius Primus, a young, savvy aquarius, or water engineer, has been sent from Rome as replacement for the AWOL Exomnius to ensure the proper maintenance of Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that supplies Pompeii, Herculaneum and the towns on the Bay of Naples. Investigation into the problem of the aqueduct drying up and its failure to deliver its critical liquid payload uncovers not only municipal theft of water and graft of epic proportions but natural problems and concerns relating to Vesuvius and its pending eruption - tremors, pollution of the water with sulphur emissions, rockfalls, and shifts and bulges in the earth's surface, not to mention breakages and blockages in the aqueduct itself.Insofar as the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum are concerned, we all know how the story ends. So it fell to Harris' skill as a writer to build and maintain momentum and suspense in spite of that. With the clever device of a brief excerpt from a scientific treatise on volcanism serving as a preface to every chapter plus absolutely scintillating descriptive writing, what might have been a monumentally boring exposition of the final few hours leading up to Vesuvius' cataclysmic eruption becomes rather a thrilling natural history page turner that actually had my stomach twisted up into knots as I felt the clock ticking toward the inevitable catastrophe!The resolution of Exomnius' disappearance and the discovery of the theft of water by Numerius Popidius Ampliatus, an ex-slave and now Pompeii's wealthiest citizen, serve as a springboard for Harris' outstanding description of an extraordinary cross section of daily life in the ancient Roman provinces - slaves vs freemen, men vs women, and children, the luxury and indolence of the wealthy vs the difficulties and squalid conditions of the poor, politicians vs their constituency, the use of the \\"games\\" as a means of distracting and buying off the general population, the baths, and the Roman diet. His charming portrayal of Pliny the Elder and the discussions surrounding the aqueduct problem will amaze and delight readers with the surprising level of sophistication of Roman science and engineering.Sadly, the d&eacute;nouement after the eruption and Harris' winding down of the romantic involvement of Marcus Attilius with Corelia Ampliata, who is promised under a contract of marriage to one of Pompeii's leading politicos, just doesn't come anywhere close to the standards of the first three-quarters of the book! What might have been a five-star book that I was tempted to place in my \\"Top Ten All-Time\\" list became merely good as I closed the covers on the final few chapters! Too bad, for sure, but 4-star recommendations are nothing to sniff at! Pompeii was well worth my time and I enjoyed it immensely.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I started this on the plane coming from NYC and finished it just landing in Atlanta. I found it to have an interesting level of historical detail, which provided an anchor point for the rather formulaic plot (ethical young engineer v. corrupt older businessman; romance btw said engineer, and, you guessed it, the businessman's daughter). Well written."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This was my first book by Robert Harris, so I can't compare it to his previous work like some of the other reviewers. I was hooked from the first couple of pages. Yes, there's a lot of science and technical info in the book, but I didn't find it boring at all. Rather, it was integral to the story, like the quotes from the scientific books at the beginning of each chapter. Not boring at all, in fact, it made me want to go back to school to take a class on the history of the Roman Empire, or to travel to the ruins to see for myself. To me, when a book can make me so interested that I want to learn more, now that's a good book."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"This book is excellent when it comes to the science of the eruption and aqueduct; not so great when it comes to people. As another reviewer mentioned, the characters are two dimensional. The villains are all-evil, (and of course get their comeuppance in suitable fashion). The hero is interesting but a little anachronistic for my taste (in his complete rejection of the religious beliefs of his time; his rejection of philosophers rings more true.)What bothered me most was the unnecessary wallowing in grotesque and ugly imagery, not to do with the eruption, but with the lifestyles of the rich and powerful. It didn't add much depth or insight, and was simply unpleasant to read. It made me nostalgic for old historical epics like Quo Vadis, the Robe, Ben Hur. These writers/directors knew how to make villains without wallowing in ugly details. They also knew how to add depth to their characters. Quo Vadis in particular is a masterpiece.Unlike another reader, I didn't find Exomnious' fate anticlimactic, but actually one of the more interesting moments of the novel. I did, however, have a little trouble with the hero going back to Pompeii during the eruption to rescue his girlfriend, not to mention a few questions about how he did it. Could they have survived, or would the water have been boiling?The final image of the book is impressive, but unsatisfying from the &quot;what happened next&quot; point of view. The story ends abruptly, with the eruption. It could have used an afterword.Bottom line: if you are a fan of this writer, or possibly of Pompeii, you will want this. For fans of historical fiction, I'd say, don't rush out to buy it."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"It is August of 79 A.D. in the Bay of Naples and the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct carrying water to the cities of the area, begins to dry up. Fish are mysteriously dying in their ponds. There are ground tremors and rock falls in the cities surrounding Mount Vesuvius. Some residents attribute these things to giants or to the wrath of the gods. But Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or water engineer of the Aqua Augusta, who is sent to Misenum to research and repair the problem, knows that there is a scientific explanation. As he tracks the aqueduct from its terminus in Misenum to Pompeii and then onward to the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius, he observes unusual natural phenomena, discovers the upheaval that disrupted the water flow, and realizes that an inevitable cataclysmic event is about to occur.In this painstakingly researched story, Robert Harris has produced much more than a historical thriller. Although we know the story will end with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of the surrounding cities, Harris has built suspense by describing the mysterious disappearance of the former aquarius Exomnius and the attempts of the officials of Pompeii to prevent Attilius from discovering the truth. This book also provides fascinating detail on the culture of ancient Rome, from the feasts in the sumptuous villas to the ingenious plumbing in the bath houses. It provides details on the aqueduct system, a marvel of Roman engineering. Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from a treatise on volcanos that describes the causes of, and events occuring during, an eruption. The reader is entertained while learning all this, and is not overburdened with facts and figures.The characters are well developed and fascinating. The brilliant writer, naturalist, and scholar Pliny the Elder, and the pompous and wealthy city developer Ampliatus come to life through Harris' talent. From slaves to powerful land barons, from laborers to statesmen, the reader is treated to all facets of the citizenry of ancient Pompeii. There is also a weakly developed love interest between Attilius and the daughter of Ampliatus. This is the one part of the story that would have been better if left out. Even with that flaw, the book is compelling reading with a built-in ancient history lesson."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Pompeii by Robert Harris has received some excellent reviews, and it was on the strength of these that I decided to read the book. I was not disappointed. Mr. Harris does have the gift of giving his reading the feel of a place and time. He breathes life into the late first century and presents the many facts and customs in a way that sparks interest and not boredom. The novel begins on August 22, 79 CE, and the chapters are cleverly organized following the Roman hours of the day and also give the actual hour when the events are taking place. Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from a technical work on volcanology that provides the reader with an idea of the activity going on inside Mount Vesuvius.The story revolves around the Aqua Augusta, an aqueduct that the protagonist of the story, Marcus Attilius Primus, first becomes the aquarius (the person responsible for maintaining the structure) of the aqueduct and then searches for a break that prevents the flow of water to the drought stricken countryside. Atillius is a noble character, an imperial official who takes pride in his work and is incorruptible. But he is now in the self-proclaimed city-on-the-make: Pompeii.Along the way we meet Ampliatus, a wealthy freedman who is, ironically, marrying his daughter to Popilius, his old master. Ampliatus represents a long line of uncouth and ambitious freedmen that came to dominate the principate in the early empire under Claudius and Nero. Mr. Harris paints a probing and revealing portrait of Ampliatus and draws an inevitable comparison with Trimalchio of Petronius' Satyricon, with the freedman presiding over a similar overly sumptuous banquet Ampliatus. As a classicist, I found the banquet scene a little too reminiscent of the novel by Petronius. The characterization was a little too close and I did not want a parody of that famous literary banquet scene. However, I think Mr. Harris more than makes up for identifying his character so closely with Petronius by giving him a darker and more ruthless side.Ampliatus' daughter Corelia is the conscience that her father does not have. She is a teenager of marriageable age and chafes under the ruthless nature of her father and her own helplessness before her own loveless marriage. The novel presents an interesting portrait of Pliny the Elder that I found captured his interest in the world around him and his battle of filling his days with as much activity as possible. We also have the embittered Corax; the overseer of the men who maintain the aqueduct, an enemy of Attilius, who is ready to do anything to get rid of the \\"new man in town.\\"A central part of the story is the mysterious disappearance of Atillius' predecessor Exomnius. Is he alive or dead? Little by little Attilius pieces together Exomnius' background and his association with Ampliatus, a revelation that places his life in jeopardy. In the background is Vesuvius. We know the catastrophe that is about to happen and look on as the trembling of the earth raises the curiosity of Pliny and the rumblings of the volcano remind people of thunder and giants.Pompeii is a well-conceived novel that presents a plausible story populated with flesh-and-blood characters. It is a fast-paced book that is a joy to read; a book that is hard to put down, and a must read for people interested in ancient history or who find the city of Pompeii a fascinating place."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Everybody thinks they know about the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius at Pompeii--79 AD . . .rivers of bubbling magma . . .citizens immortalized in pleading poses for all eternity by ash . . .the heedless rich getting their comeuppance from nature. Those basics are true, but Robert Harris reminds us that the eruption of Vesuvius was much more than that. It remains one of history's greatest and most dramatic disaster stories, and we know a great deal about it because one of the Roman Empire's greatest historians was there to write a blow-by-blow record of the destruction; and although Pliny did not survive, his report did.Pompeii and Herculaneum were the Malibu and Santa Barbara of Rome. In the hot August of 79 AD, tourists were swarming to the cool coast to enjoy the luxury accommodations, crystal swimming pools, and elegant spas of the bayside resorts. Marcus Attilius is there too, but he's not there to enjoy the occasional cool breeze, he's there to work as the new aquarius of the Aqua Augusta--the new water engineer in charge of the enormous aqueduct that brings endless water flowing to the nine towns around the Bay of Naples. Springs are failing for the first time in centuries and the flow of water is being disrupted to hundreds of thousands of people. Attilius' family has worked on the great aqueducts for generations, but even he is bewildered by the cause of this crisis somewhere along the Aqua Augusta's sixty-mile line--a line that stretches along the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius.The Roman aqueducts were an amazing feat, and Harris describes their workings in great detail. He does an excellent job of showing, not telling, and through Attilius and his crew he weaves an incredible amount of information into the narrative and it is fascinating. Also excellently done is his description of the various effects of the eruption--which lasted several days--where he uses Pliny's observation of the event of excellent effect. Pliny, historian and general, was also a very fat and cranky old man by 79 AD. He took one of his ships out into the bay to watch and record the devastation from what he thought was a safe distance. But too soon the ships in the bay were in danger from the roiling waves and huge chunks of pumice flying down off the mountain. Pliny had his scribes don helmets and take down his descriptions as clods of pumice bounced off the old general's uncovered head--\\"The pumice is less like rock than airy fragments of a frozen cloud.\\" he dictates. \\"It floats on the surface of the sea like lumps of ice. Extraordinary!\\" Eventually it would clog the bay and begin to crush ships. Pliny knew he was too heavy and unsteady to escape the final firestorm from Vesuvius and ordered his scribes to save themselves and his precious reportage. Fortunately they did, and Robert Harris puts Pliny's observation to fine use in this novel.Harris is a workmanlike writer with the gift of being able to integrate complicated information into a believable narrative. That's what made \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Fatherland\\" so interesting, and what works for \\"Pompeii.\\" The characters are take second place to the setting, and are not particularly exciting. However, they respond to the extraordinary circumstances around them in ways that are completely consistent with their characterizations. It is the same with Harris' establishment of place. He offers no special explanations of Rome, but builds it all into the action. As a result the Roman world seems very immediate and almost modern."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Harris, author of the acclaimed thriller's Fatherland and Archangel, has a hard task here: He must eke out suspense in a tale to which the final outcome will be known by every reader. Pompeii could well fall flat on its face, but instead it is a remarkable triumph. It straddled the bestseller lists in the UK for about 4 weeks, and should garner a similar reaction across the pond.Its high summer along the Bay of Naples. The merchants are trading, the tourists are visiting, and the rich are lounging in their villas by the ocean. But all is not well...Recently installed Chief Engineer of the Aqua Augustus Maximus Atillius Primus senses trouble; springs have been failing for the first time in years, his predecessor remains missing, and fish have been dying in their pools. Everything indicates a problem with the aqueduct, a disruption somewhere on the sixty-mile mainline, on the Northern slopes of the great mountain Vesuvius. Then, one by one, the towns around the bay begin to loose their water supply...One might think that because the reader automatically knows the outcome of the book (a horrendous eruption) it might be a little dull, but that is not true at all. Harris skirts the pitfalls presented by this potential lack of suspense by creating some great characters whose fates the reader cares about. Will they perish? Will they somehow escape? He also manages to weave in some excellent themes, most notably the slight shadowy parallels he draws between Rome, the superpower of the time, and modern-day America, and the subtle message that even a great power is irredeemably vulnerable when confronted by great unexpected destruction from within. In a way, he is warning us about complacency, but, more importantly, he is displaying how all the power in the world can not ensure our safety or complete peace-of-mind in this modern day-world, exactly as it could not then. It's rather clever how the book seems to reach across the years.The historical detail is amazing, and the atmosphere - at first relaxed, then later full of fear - is built expertly. He makes everything so interesting. Certainly, I never would have believed I could enjoy reading about the workings of an ancient aqueduct! (Actually, there might be a little too much detail on the engineering ins-and-outs.) The pace is good, and the book is, often inexplicably - the beginning, the scene-setting, threatens to grow dull once or twice - a complete page-turner. It moves softly, until the final 100 pages, which are absolutely brilliant. Possibly the best final 100 pages I've read this year. Suddenly, the book explodes along with Vesuvius. The pace cracks like a whip and suddenly everything's full of electricity and terror as everyone flees and rushes about confused. Everything progresses in tense bursts and then aching graduality, with painfully slow descriptions of people trying to wade through thick ash, for example. It is a very effective juxtaposition.Pompeii has everything: it is impeccably written, is crammed full of subtle historical information, it has death, destruction, undercurrents, mystery (the previous engineer went missing, remember) and even a little romance! As a thriller, I would recommend it highly. As an enjoyable education, I would recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"\\"Pompeii\\" was my first foray into historical fiction and it was quite interesting.It took me a few chapters to get used to the idea that the event (the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24th August 79 CE) was true, but the characters were not. I also had to catch myself a few times while reading this because I started asking, \\"This really happened?\\" If an author is able to do that, then he/she has done their job of drawing you into their world.The book starts off with an explanation of the superior Roman system of telling time and their ancient names for the days of the week and months. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the modern era's names for the above are close to those of that time. It never fails to amaze me that we have access to detailed information about everyday things that were around close to 2,000 years ago - and it's accurate! Unfortunately, it took a catastrophic eruption to preserve ancient history (I've read quite a few times that the ash made the city into a life-sized time capsule with the way it settled).Harris did a great job of documenting the buildup to the eruption through the aquarius Marcus Attilius, his fictional telling of the corruption of the ultra-rich of Pompeii (which could very well be based in fact, as I've read that numerous times in as many books), and who could forget to mention those numerous brothels?It was a shame that so many people had to die because of the lack of knowledge of volcanoes, but when something is dormant for so long you're led to believe it's a dead volcano (and it was generations before Vesuvius came back to life, so the knowledge that it was dangerous was long gone by the time Pompeii became an important port city). So before people ridicule the Pompeiians for their lack of knowledge of Vesuvius, I would like to remind them of a little incident known as Mount St. Helens in Washington State. Even though there wasn't the loss of life near the scale of Pompeii with that eruption, there was no excuse to not know about that as 1980 is not ancient history!This was one gem that was collecting dust on my bookshelf. I decided it was time to see what this was all about and was not disappointed in the least. I know there are other fictional accounts on the same subject, but this is a good start.And I'm elated to have read this knowing that Roman Polanski is going to direct the (rather expensive) movie adaptation of this soon. I'm rather eager to see how he brings the timeless beauty of Pompeii to life and how he's going to interpret the eruption and the ensuing chaos for the big screen.This was an enjoyable read. Harris's sources are excellent and his research was impeccable. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"An enjoyable, well written and well researched book gives an interesting insight into Roman engineering, science, business customs and daily life. Set in Pompeii, starting two days prior to the erruption is a story of love woven on a sound historical and scientific base (interestingly enough Plinius features in the story). Easy to read and enjoyable, albeit short (large print and double spaces are used to extend the number of pages to a respectable minimum for a book), a recommended read."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"I was excited to see this on the shelves, but somewhat disappointed in the overall story. The story focus is on the water engineer Attilius. He's been sent by Rome to Pompeii to repair a breach in the aquaduct. The mysterious disappearance of the local Aquarius, the title for the water engineer, factors into the storyline.I love the history of Pompeii and so I wanted to love this book. Where I feel this book failed me, at least, as a reader was in trying to build up the suspense of the eruption which we know is coming, know will be devastating and result in burying two entire cities at the expense of developing the characters. There are only a few characters to follow. Attilius and Corelia, the daughter of the corrupt rich freed slave Ampliatus. It seems Ampliatus has rebuilt Pompeii from the devastating earthquake that shook the region years before. Ampliatus is the bad guy here, but the fact he was a former slave takes away the edge of him being the bad guy, at least for me. To elevate his status in society he is going to marry his daughter Corelia to his former master's son. Pliny the elder factors into the story as well.. which is fun because I love the blending of fact and fiction. Unfortunately, Corelia is thinly drawn and has too little to do in the story - we don't even have the benefit of seeing her emotional attachment to Attilius develop. This is a shame because I eventually cared more about what happened to Pliny than Corelia! That's because this takes place 3 days before the eruption. Very little time to throw Attilius and Corelia together since he's trying to repair an aquaduct in the hills. In fact Pliny has more to do than the heroine in the story. The ending was a bit blah as well... I'm not in the habit of ruining plots so I won't mention what happens, but it was a big build up and then... a sketchy epilogue, as if even the author wasn't invested enough emotionally in his characters to give them a proper resolution. Oh well. I do have to say the description of the town, how citizens and slaves went about their daily lives were all fabulous. I can't get enough of Pompeii, and it helps if you've been to the ruins to try to place yourself in the story when a town square is described, the mention of fountains etc. In short, Mr. Harris did a fabulous job of making a doomed ancient city come to life. His characters on the other hand were left out in the cold. So, overall, in my humble opinion, it was just okay."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"True historical fiction is a rare genre. Historical fantasy is very common. But the ability to truly recreate a moment in time as it might have been is rare. In his previous book, Fatherland, Harris showed his ability to create historical fantasy. Now, he is warmed-up and wants to show that he can create historical fiction. And that is exactly what he does.In Pompeii Harris recreates the days before the eruption of 79 AD that destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. He does this by telling the story of Marcus Attilius Primus, an engineer who takes over the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that brings water to the area around Vesuvius, when the previous engineer disappears. As he deals with maintaining the aqueduct and learning the politics of leadership, Attilius comes face to face with the earth's--and human's--warning that will lead to the eruption and what follows.There are many things I like about this book. First, despite the fact that we know exactly what's going to happen big picture here (Vesuvius is going to erupt), Harris is able to keep us interested and excited. Second, we get a feeling that, although we know this is fiction, this is something that could have happened. It is not pure fantasy in an historical setting. Finally, Harris has the ability to create characters that we care about.Admittedly, Harris has chosen a subject in which I am very interested. The eruption of Vesuvius has long fascinated me and a few years ago I traveled to Italy to tour the ruins of Pompeii. It was very fun for me to read this book and get a feeling for what that time was like. This novel hit no false notes with me. If anything, I wish Harris had been willing to carry the novel past the eruption farther into the aftermath. That said, I think anyone who enjoys historical fiction will find a lot to like here."},{"Title":"Pompeii: A Novel","review":"Young engineer Marcus Attilius is sent from Rome to wealthy and glamorous Pompeii to solve a pesky mystery: why has the aqueduct failed? It's his big chance to prove himself with the powers that be, and he's frustrated at every turn by heat, surly locals, and bureaucratic bungling and corruption. He can't even ask the former Aquarius of the Aqua Augusta for hints, because the man has simply disappeared without a trace.We meet his main adversary, the rich and powerful former slave Ampliatus, just as he is throwing one of his own slaves to the moray eels. This poor man was charged with the care of red mullet in Ampliatus's fish farm, and the red mullets have all died. The slave's distraught mother enlists the help of Ampliatus's lovely daughter Corelia to spare the man. And Corelia, who hates her dissolute and cruel father, tracks down the new Aquarius to support the slave's charge that there is something wrong with the water.Of course there is something wrong with the water: sulfur, although this information comes too late to save the unfortunate slave. And then there is no more water at all, at city after city up the coast. Attilius convinces the elderly Pliny to help him with ships and men, then get back to the spot where they have deduced the blockage must be.Along the way Robert Harris spins a fast-paced mystery, and we learn much about life in Pompeii and the amazing engineering feat of the aqueduct itself. The decadence of the rich with their gorging and purging and young boyfriends is nicely counterbalanced against the practical, smart Attilius, who increasingly suspects an imminent disaster that is much bigger than a failure in the water supply. The impetuous young Corelia (who reminds Attilius of his beloved deceased wife) displays pluck and courage, spying on her scheming father and providing Attilius with information he needs to solve the puzzle. Human treachery and the forces of nature provide a spectacular finish.Mr. Harris couldn't have chosen a more compelling period in a more compelling city than the four days leading up to the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

He has shared the history of the time so well and I also enjoyed his travelling experience with his own father and son. Thank you Dayton. Be sure to watch the Ken Burns, Dayton Duncan PBS movie that is scheduled to air in early October."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"(Sorry about the title. I just bought a PC, so I have computers on the brain!) This book is the latest effort by Dayton Duncan and Ken Burns, a tie-in to their PBS documentary. It takes us back to 1903 and tells the story of the first transcontinental automobile trip, taken by Dr. Horatio Nelson Jackson (don't you just love that name?), his mechanic Sewall Crocker, and a bulldog named Bud. Dr. Jackson was in San Francisco when he decided to attempt the trip- it was really a \\"spur of the moment\\" decision, made after a fellow bet him $50 that he couldn't do it. Unfortunately for Dr. Jackson, he needed to come up with a car: he had purchased one just before he made the bet, but it was in the process of being shipped across the country to the doctor's home in Burlington, Vermont. Sewall Crocker suggested the doctor should buy a \\"Winton,\\"- because it was a heavy, sturdy vehicle. These were the days before dealerships, so Dr. Jackson had to find one of the few people in San Francisco who owned a Winton. The doctor located someone who was willing to sell his $2,500 Winton for $3,000. The upshot was that four days after making the bet, Jackson and Crocker were on the road. (Bud was purchased shortly after the two men started out.) One of the best features of this book is the pictures. It is difficult for most people today to visualize what driving conditions were like in 1903. There were almost no paved roads- so Jackson and Crocker were, for the most part, following old trails. The numerous pictures give you some idea of the rough conditions. The two men frequently had to remove boulders that were blocking the trails, or get through foot-deep mud, or ford rivers and streams. The two men had to stop frequently to repair blown tires or broken axles. Part of the bet was that the trip would be made within 90 days- at times it looked like \\"a near run thing\\" because of all the stopping to make repairs and to wait for spare parts. Adding to the excitement of the trip was the fact that two other teams, sponsored by Packard and Oldsmobile, were trying to make the same trip- although they both started about a month after Jackson and Crocker. Besides the great photos (taken by Dr. Jackson en route), the two authors have included numerous excerpts from the letters that Jackson wrote to his wife, Bertha, during the trip. The doctor's great affection for Bertha comes through in every letter, as does his can-do, optimistic personality (he was fond of comparing himself to Theodore Roosevelt). Duncan and Burns also include lots of newspaper headlines of the time, which are refreshing for their quaint, old-fashioned language (Jackson and Crocker are referred to as \\"transcontinentalists\\" and \\"automobilists\\") and lack of cynicism. Though brief (because of all the photos, the book can easily be read in one or two sittings), this is a wonderful trip back in time to the days when a person driving a car could still feel like (and indeed, was) a pioneer."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"Horatio Nelson Jackson was an intrepid explorer. His exploit should not be ranked, perhaps, with those of Lewis and Clark, or Scott, or Livingstone, but nonetheless, this year we should be celebrating the centennial of his epochal achievement. In 1903, Jackson took the first automobile trip across the United States. The commemoration will include a Public Broadcasting documentary on the trip by Ken Burns, who was persuaded to make the film by his friend Dayton Duncan. The two of them have produced a book to go along with the film, _Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip_ (Knopf), and it is a good-looking and entertaining volume. A hundred years later, anyone can take a car and perform Horatio's Drive in a few days, but in 1903, there were about 150 miles of paved roads in the entire nation, and most of those did not link one town to another. Jackson was a real pioneer.Jackson was a thirty-one-year-old doctor from Burlington, Vermont, and an automobile enthusiast. On 19 May 1903, he was with a bunch of well-to-do men at the University Club in San Francisco. A wager was made; fifty bucks said that no one could drive from San Francisco to New York in less than three months. Jackson accepted immediately; he was on the road four days later. He hired a mechanic, and acquired a mascot, a bulldog named Bud who got his own automobilist goggles. His owner said that Bud was \\"...the one member of [our] trio who used no profanity on the entire trip.\\" Jackson bought a used Winton for $3,000. It had a two-cylinder, 20 horsepower engine, a chain drive, and top speed of thirty miles an hour. It had no windshield and no roof. Jackson named it the _Vermont_. They bounced along the road, losing important items sometimes, and often they were mired in thick mud. The solution was generally to get a farmer to hitch his horse to the _Vermont_, and then pay the farmer by giving him a ride in the car. Stagecoaches had to bring spare parts. Blacksmiths had to weld parts together. Whenever the car came into a rural town, it caused a sensation. People liked to have their pictures taken as they sat at _Vermont_'s right-sided wheel. It took 63 days, but Jackson made it to New York, and was a sensation.Jackson went on to become the owner of Burlington's first radio station and a bank president. He got ex-president Teddy Roosevelt to get him into the Army for World War One, even though he was too old to enlist. But he loved telling his story about his great drive as the proudest of his accomplishments. In 1944, he donated the _Vermont_ to the Smithsonian, where it will be forever on display, gleaming without a speck of the dust and mud that it picked up in its historic 6,000 mile journey. Bud's goggles were donated, too. For better or worse, we can drive all over our nation now, with little of the trouble Jackson went through, and with little of the adventure or need for his sort of pluck. _Horatio's Drive_ in pictures and words brings back a time when automobiles were novelties enthusiastically boosted by eccentrics, and a forgotten little epic of American adventure."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"This is a brief account of the first cross country automobile trip, sprinkled with photographs taken by the \\"automobilist\\" as he traversed the nation's dirt roads just after the turn of the last century. Horation Nelson Jackson bet someone $50 in a club in San Francisco that he could cross the country in an automobile he had just bought, and do it in less than 90 days. He spent over $8,000 winning his bet (though he never collected the money).The car (something called a Winton) had numerous breakdowns. After each one, Jackson would write his wife and advise her that \\"the worst is over now\\" after which the car would inevitably break down again. Jackson and his mechanic, Sewall Crocker, spent endless days waiting for parts and jury-rigging parts for the car. After Jackson and Crocker left San Francisco, two other cars, each with its own pair of intrepid motorists, left there also, all three headed to New York City. In spite of a number of hindrances, Jackson's Winton beat out the Packard and the Oldsmobile. Jackson even picked out a dog, named Bud, who wore goggles and rode in the front seat for most of the adventure.This is a rather short book. It took me perhaps an hour and a half to read. It's full of illustrations and has a map showing the route Jackson took. It's also very interesting, covering a part of American history that I imagine many people had never heard before. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"The sprint of American adventure and our love affair with the automobile are captured by Dayton Duncan's in his new book, \\"Horatio's Drive.\\" Dr. Horatio Nelson Jackson sets off in 1903 from San Francisco in a 20-horsepower Winton touring car hoping to become the first person to cross the United States in the new-fangled &quot;horseless carriage.&quot;Duncan retraces Horatio Nelson Jackson's journey from San Francisco to New York, which personifies the individualistic spirit that Americans admire most. Duncan, himself spent 10 years, while on family vacations, retracing Jackson's momentous journey. The details are presented very well and so vivid that it allows you to ride along. You will meet \\"Bud\\" and discover a new meaning for the term \\"optimistic.\\"If you enjoy history and love a good story, this book has everything. Good Read!"},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"Not having seen the DVD (but keen to do so now!) I can say that this treatment of the story of the first men to drive coast-to-coast is a good one. Jackson and Crocker set off from California to New York in 1903 in an auto which only vaguely resembles the sophisticated machines of today and across a nation which depended on railroads for serious travel. Roads in most of the country were rarely, if ever maintained and some were still like the old wagon trails pioneers traveled on only a few decades before. It was an adventure and one which the two men (and their dog Bud) rose to the challenge, manhandling their machine through rough patches and mud, struggling to find gasoline where no such infrastructure existed and crossing America few would ever see. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"Remarkable tale of a true American crossing our great country with less horsepower than most mopeds and 10 times the weight"},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"This was a good nonfiction book that read like a journal or a novel. It was about the first transcontinental automobile drive in America: all the obstacles that the drivers had to overcome, what the conditions were like, and how people reacted to seeing this car. Horatio Jackson, accompanied by Sewall Crocker, left San Francisco in 1903 in an attempt to be the first man to ever traverse the U.S. from coast to coast in an automobile (and to win a bet). Jackson funded the trip by himself. They went over the Rocky Mountains, across the plains of the Midwest and all the way to New York City in 63 days. This book was an easy read, but I found it interesting and even learned something. I liked all the excerpts from Horatio Jackson's letters and the excerpts from the newspapers of the towns that he drove through. It also had great pictures and lots of them."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"The authors narrate this own companion to the PBS documentary about the first 1903 automobile trip across the US.

California to New York without freeways. Sound like a blast"},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"This is a great book that takes you back to a time in America's history when there was nothing but great expanse and little or no help available to travelers and you had to rely on your own resourcefulness to get to the next town. I am sure there were times they thought they might die. It must have taken great perseverance and courage. I once drove a Volkswagen bug 150 miles through the remotest part of Wyoming in the middle of the night on very remote BLM dirt roads with no lights but a flashlight taped to the fender so I could get to a rodeo to ride a bronc the next morning. The bug broke down in the middle of the trip and I had to fix a gas leak with tubing from another part of the car in the middle of a cold wind storm with a forty mile walk to the next home. The guy who wrote the book is probably the great grandson of one of those dime store novelist that wrote stories about real men in the old west like in Unforgiven or something. It is quite ironic that cowards usually write about real men. Most of these self serving socialistic storytellers have the gift of gossip but not the guts to ever attempt anything as brave as what they write about. Maybe they are living out there fantasy's and this is as close as they will ever come to doing something that takes cahoonies. Do you think the guy that wrote this book (Dayton Duncan) was a little on the \\"oh don't hurt me side\\" when he was younger? and the only long trip he has ever taken alone is to the mall to get some face cream for his wife. I guess we need guys like Duncan to stay home from the fight so they can record history."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"This inspirational story of an \\"indomitable-spirit\\" Vermonter has reinforced my belief in: what the lifetime goals of an individual can be; how \\"impossible dreams\\" can occur in real life (reference the Catholic legacy of St. Rita); and how a woman's love might stimulate a man's performance. I admit to being biased from the viewpoint of: a fellow UVM alumni; a former near neighbor (Springfield, VT) of the author's; an individual who has driven over a million miles in classic American vehicles visiting family, witnessing children's accomplishments and athletic competitions, visiting national recreation sites, participating in athletic competitions; and visiting casinos (crossing every state and many rivers in the continental United States); a soul-mate to an indomitable-spirit, lovely woman from Brattleboro, VT for 50+years; and an individual who has nearly retraced Horatio's Drive in my lifetime. I feel the story is especially well-presented and my first-reading time was ~3hours.I was also pleased with the example of Horatio's verbal love expression to his woman at every communication oppurtunity.Malcolm Bud Russell; SHS '54, UVM '58, UVM Athletic Hall-of-Fame '93, & USAT&F; Masters National Champion '01."},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"I enjoy reading almost anything about antique autos,the early days of the US auto industry, old car trips and stories about the history of early automobile travel in the United States.

In 1903, an adenturous 31 year old Doctor from Vermont, now retired and living happily with his weathy young wife (on her funds), decided he'd attempt to be the first to man cross the continent via the latest technological gadget: the automobile. Being a non-mechanic, he hired an equally spirited 21 year old former bicycle racer who had been working as a mechanic in a gasoline-engine factory in California to accompany him. Most roads were little more than muddy wagon paths, and when those stopped the travellers could only follow along railroad tracks or trust in their sense of direction as they set out across the vast plains and desert. Nevertheless, they made the trek successfully.Equally amazing, his beloved wife condoned his folly and waited anxiously at home. They wrote letters to each other regularly, and these (preserved) letters were the author's primary source of information about his daily successes and frustrations along his cross-country 'expedition'.This book, a companion to the PBS documentary film (available on DVD) is filled with rare vintage photos. Few would attempt such a journey today, even with modern GPS equipped 4x4 vehicles, and the book and DVD are both splendid inspirations for anyone who loves to share in the triumphs of those few individuals who would fearlessly challenge what has never been done simply because they believe they can succeed.I only wish there had been more more detailed excerpts from the original correspondences included in this book. Still, a splendid addition to your library... and your education!"},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","review":"I had it in my head that this was going to be the audio from the wonderful PBS show but I was mistaken.

The story of this historic trip, as well as the narration by various individuals, has retained both my interest and attention.I would recommend that anyone not familiar with the means of travel at that time and road conditions, become familiar with it before beginning with the audio CD...

I don't want to give out too much information about the plot, but I will say it's basically another chick lit with great fun, back stabbing, friends and humor.I am a big fan of Liz Ireland's other two books 'Three Bedrooms in Chelsea' and 'How I Stole Her Husband'.

She does have a lot of enthusiasm and energy so she dives head first into her new vocation with plans to learn on the job rather quickly so that she can be the best at what she is supposed to do (whatever that is).However, as she tries to learn her new trade in Midtown Manhattan, she gets an education in trust as her peers and her former boyfriend backstab her. Still she does her best and is beginning to learn the ropes though she still struggles with waistline office politics even as she helps her former employer Sylvie with a crisis leading to Inventing My Life and Luke.This satirical chick lit tale enables the audience to see a different side of the publishing world from the perspective of editor competition within a company. Rebecca is a terrific prime protagonist who learns the hard way how one can end up below the food chain in the office ooze if one is not careful of protecting your back; waistline politics can destroy your career.

It appears to have been written with a slight presuposition towards eastern philosphy taking away the initial aim of the theosophical society's goal towards unbiased truth, but aside from this premise it is very well written. The chapter \\"Life in the Subtle World\\" was interesting in that the author takes the views of Blavatsky, but explains them in a much more coherent manner. For those with no understanding of Eastern religion this book is a must read as it integrates the ideas into contemporary Western society.

Jasmine is only 18 when she meets and falls in love with Tariq, son of the sheikh of a desert kingdom. Young and insecure, her family convinces her to leave Tariq and end the relationship. Four years go by when Jasmine hears of Tariq's father, the sheikh passing. Having matured in the last four years and come into her own, Jasmine has realized the mistake she made in leaving the man she loved. She hops a plane back to Tariq, intent on making it work this time. Tariq knows that Jasmine has made plans to come back and he intends to make her stay. Picking her up from the airport he takes her to his palace and basically tricks her into marrying him. Sure, she knows what's going on but it doesn't change the fact that he thought he was doing it without her knowledge.Tariq is angry at her for leaving him all those years ago, which is understandable. However, what I don't understand is his why he ties her to him when he is so intent on remaining angry with her and not trusting her. I feel like part of him does it so that he can punish her. He withholds his love from her and his words and actions border on cruelty. I know he's afraid to show Jasmine how he feels because he doesn't want to be hurt again but at a certain point I just stopped liking him.I liked Jasmine a little more but not much more. I didn't understand why she put up with Tariq's behavior for as long as she did. Actually I think I do. Since she was the one who left him originally, I think believes his behavior is fitting punishment for her lack of faith and that this time around, she has to prove to him that her love will not be swayed - by him or anyone else. Unfortunately he didn't want to believe it for a very long time. When the Big Conflict finally occurs I was mad at both of them - Tariq for his lack of trust and Jasmine for putting up with it for so long. He also says something incredibly cruel to her during a big fight which made me want to punch him.Though I did feel an emotional connection between the two characters, in the end, there was little romance in this romance novel. I am glad I read it because Nalini Singh is one of my favorite authors and I liked taking a look at her early work. But I would not recommend this to someone if I wanted to turn them on to her books. My copy of Desert Warrior was bundled with the new release, Lord of the Abyss. Lord of the Abyss is freakin' AWESOME (see review here) so, if you're interested in Desert Warrior, pick up the bundled version with Lord of the Abyss.*I received this book free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Not just hard-nosed entrepreneurs, they set the standard that others strive to live by in their tight circle of the rich and powerful.For those with more patience than myself, The Pride makes an excellent read. Nearly the first one hundred pages are devoted to shaping the characters that are en route to the funeral of WinnerTomlinson, another distinguished member of the Pride. Just as I would begin to wonder if there was a story, one of the characters would remind me that there was one to come. In this tale, Mr. Fordtook me well beyond anticipation to \\"get on with it, already.\\" I felt there was a little too much background on the characters. As for Berta Colon, Jerome's secretary and Sture Jorgenson, owner of a poshrestaurant who played no significant role, I still wonder what the point of their appearances and subsequent back-story was.Getting to the heart of the matter in this story is definitely like peeling away the layers of an onion to expose the core. Written from the viewpoints of Sture Jorgenson, Paul Taylor, Deidre Douglas,Gordon Perkins, and Jerome Hardaway you will find long meandering passages of monologue telling of what once was and very little of what is to be, which stagnated the story. With very little dialogueor action and no real pull into the story, there was little to keep this reader stimulated.Even in looking at it from the perspective of the plot was not the essential element, but the actual characters, how they made their way up corporate ladders, and what moved them is, 150 to 200 pages could have been eliminated and their absence would be of no consequence.Mr. Ford has a keen sense of imagery. He sets scenes where the bitter cold is nearly felt and barges making their way across rivers can almost be seen. He spins lively creative phrases like, \\"bottomless color of dreamless nights that seemed to go on forever,\\" that will play over in one's mind. His expansive vocabulary is refreshing and very much appreciated.

She not only succeeds, but the tables are turned and those who hurt her, need her in the end.Gordon Perkins is a top Wall Street investment banker and also a member of The Pride. He was a very smart child and is a highly intelligent adult who has an appetite for control and cruelty. He is married to Kenitra, who unfortunately bears the brunt of his anger and manipulation. Everyone close to him ends up hurt but he is like a machine and has no conscious, hurting those closest to him and feeling no remorse whatsoever. He also has a secret addiction that could interfere with his business savvy.THE PRIDE is an intricate look at black professionals at their worse. Many people think that if they had more money, all of their problems would be resolved and they would be happy. But this book showed that everyone is susceptible to problems no matter the social status. Sometimes the more money and prestige you have the more problems you encounter. The characters were strong people who although were rich and could have any material possessions they desired, they still, to some degree, lacked happiness. What I enjoyed most about the book, was that it didn't portray the characters as drama or trouble free just because they were successful professionally. They in fact were real people, with real problems.Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinninof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Pride","review":"This book really gets moving with the development of Morningstar, I couldn't put it down. So many wonderful,suprising and strange things unfold as the Pride decide to work together. I was relieved to read that the good guys won, love prevailed and evil begets evil.Read it!"},{"Title":"Pride","review":"Wally Ford's new novel is an entertaining, fast-paced read that offers the reader an intimate view of the power, wealth, decadence, and human fraility that intelligent and successful African American bankers face as they attempt to strategically navigate Wall Street's economic quagmire. The novel held my interest from beginning to end and I have recommended it to many friends. I can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Pride","review":"The Pride is a great read. Although I was stunned that Paul's younger brother died so early in the novel. I highly recommend the book to those looking for a last minute stocking stuffer!"},{"Title":"Pride","review":"The Pride is an engrossing page turning novel, as much for its richly drawn characters as for its suspense and humor.Mr. Ford has allowed the reader entry into an often overlooked segment of the African-American community: the highly accomplished, supremely motivated, Black professional class. Mr. Ford's characters have worked extremely hard to achieve their version of the American dream and The Pride weaves their aspirations and their demons beautifully. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride","review":"Much of The Pride is a boring,narcissistic exercise.Long passages read as if they were the author lecturing rather than the characters speaking . These history telling monologues inform and reinform the reader about the mores, foibles and existence of this \\"elite\\" group of African-Americans as if their existence were a revelation. It was repetitious and preachy and the characters tended to speak as if they were clones of the author. The Pride was also incrediably slow-moving because it lacked sufficient interaction and believable dialogue between the characters. Thus, what I recall and detest about the characters is that they all graduated from Dartmouth, Harvard or Mount Holyoke ? ( are these the author's favorite best ? colleges) and use adjectives such as \\"knucklehead\\" or \\"chucklehead\\" repetitively to describe foolish acquaintances. How quaint ! I struggled to complete this novel, and by the time I did, I cared not at all about the outcome of the so -called plot."},{"Title":"Pride","review":"I truly wanted to read The Pride, so much that I forced myself to get through half the novel before I abandoned it. Mr. Ford writes lovely prose and can turn a phrase. Unfortunately, this novel is bogged down with tedious character development and a plodding storyline. It takes the first hundred pages or so to get several characters to a decedent's memorial service. Then, the next 1/3 of the book is spent over a luncheon meeting. Before the lunchgoers had finished their meal, I was completely tired of them and their business deliberations. I had no interest in continuing."},{"Title":"Pride","review":"I did not enjoy \\"The Pride\\" at all. The plot has all the right ingredients for a really fine story: murder, deception, power, wealth, sex, abuse, and drugs... but the novel is so poorly written all those great things are lost. I truly had to force myself to finish reading the book. Not a good read, by far."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Gary Giddins has performed a remarkable feat. He has covered one hundred years of jazz history in one volume. At 700 pages it is big for sure but it is well researched and very readable. At first glance it appears that Giddins has structured and organized the book in the worst possible way by having one chapter on each of the seminal figures of jazz history, and in semi chronological order.The pitfall here is that it lends itself to a book that looks like lots of note cards strung together. This structure can also obscure the larger picture; jazz is not just the history of a bunch of individuals. Giddins very skillfully avoids both of these traps. Each chapter is well researched, filled with anecdotes about the musician or group, and through the chapters flows the larger background of the historic movements and issues in the development of jazz.Giddins also approaches jazz with a refreshing \\"inclusiveness\\" and wastes precious little energy in defining what jazz is or in dismissing various movements as &quot;unpure&quot; or other such nonsense. In fact he makes the point right up front that jazz owes as much to popular music for its genesis as it does to spirituals or black folk music. In the chapter on Irving Berlin he points out that Tin Pan Alley was a mixture of black, Jewish and other ethnic blends of music, and in fact, Berlin was even accused of having an underground railroad of black song writers in his back room that he was ghosting for. And this, at the time, was not meant as a compliment..Of course, jazz cannot be discussed in a vacuum and race plays an important part in its history. Giddins adds two bits of trivia, which I find speak volumes in themselves about where we are and where we have come from. One was that Al Jolson lobbied Gershwin for the part of Porgy. He, thankfully, did not get it. Second was that Ellington's all black orchestra played in an Amos and Andy movie in the 30's and the producer had the lighter skinned members of the orchestra blacked up with makeup for the scenes. I suppose this was to dispel any idea in the minds of the movie audience that the band might be integrated.The book lacks a recommended discography, which would have been valuable. Giddins does comment on the recordings of his subjects in their respective chapters so that is a big help. There is a 2 CD companion set with the same title which is a nice-to-have but it is largely an afterthought and the only connecting material is the 4 inch square flimsy comment sheets that come with the CD which does not really relate back to the book itself.This is a essential book for any jazz lovers library."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"I am 57 years old, a white, suburban male, with almost no experience in jazz. I know what I like, but I don't know why, and although I enjoy older generations of singers and songs, many of the people in this book are unfamiliar beyond their names. That is the triumph of this book. It is so well written, so beautiful and rapsodic,so educational and entertaining, I want to learn more, hear more, and find the connections. The only thing I wish were included were photographs and a 10 cd set to hear the music the author refers to. Now, I have to get a saxophone or trumpet !"},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"The research and time but into this indepth overview of the first century of jazz is absolutely remarkable. Discussing the most influential and popular jazz artists of the century, this book gives insight into the artists and their music as well. Absolutely outstanding!"},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Gary Giddins was only a name to me until Ken Burns's JAZZ series aired on PBS in early 2001. While I appreciated all the commentators in that remarkable series, it was the observations of Giddins that I began to eagerly anticipate night after night. He made me SEE music that I knew and loved but whose structure and complexity I had often been unable to grasp. Despite some jazz appreciation classes in college and haphazard collecting of old jazz records over the years, I had not gotten much past the \\"I know what I like\\" phase. His passion for music I was less familiar with led me on some rewarding treasure hunts.I bought \\"Visions of Jazz\\" shortly after the conclusion of the Burns miniseries. I devoured it. I have turned to it time and again in the intervening years. Many critics overanalyze their subjects to the point where they suck the life out of the very thing they're attempting to illuminate. Giddins does not have that problem. His prose sings and swings with the elan of his beloved Sarah Vaughan.Giddins's re-examination of the music of Ellington and Armstrong may seem at first blush to be superfluous; you may think you know all there is to know on that subject. But he proves that even the most accessible jazz figures and their music evolve from and operate within a such a complex idiom that periodic re-evaluation is necessary, and, if approached with respect for both the subject and the reader -- which Giddins has above all else -- it is most welcome indeed.There are chapters in \\"Visions of Jazz\\" about musicians with whom I was completely unfamiliar. But I took a chance and read them, and wound up buying some Matthew Shipp recordings. It's that kind of book. You can take out as much as you put in.As much as I appreciate Giddins's bone-deep love of jazz, his scholarship and wry humor, I also respect him for his fearlessness in making a case for, say, the inscrutable Cecil Taylor. But I am probably a big fan of someone who leaves Gary Giddins cold, and that's OK. The jazz tent is big enough for us all.Why not 5 stars? The only \\"perfect\\" thing in jazz is Ellington's \\"Just a-Sittin' and a-Rockin.\\""},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Veteran jazz critic Gary Giddins is immensely articulate and intelligent, and yet so readable and user-friendly. As erudite as he is, he never pontificates, or &quot;talks down&quot; to the reader, as many jazz writers often do. Few writers can &quot;hear&quot; the music as well as he does -- and he somehow transmits this to the reader. Not content to be merely an historian, Giddins can also analyze a Charlie Parker solo with the best of them (as he does here), and his musical knowledge is formadible. He provides telling accounts and anecdotal information of the great jazz players and singers with great authority, a strong command of the language and an intrinsic love for this music. Of the dozens of books on jazz I have read, this is still my favorite. Each refreshing chapter stands on its own, and as a jazz player and teacher, I simply can't recommend a better book than &quot;Visions of Jazz&quot;."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Gary Giddins is probably the most articulate and learned jazz critic in the USA. This is an outstanding contribution to jazz scholarship. Its format is deceptively conventional in its linearity: it runs through the century through portraits of the musicians themselves, in chronological/thematic groupings. But it urges the reader forward with an exciting, fully engaged narrative that expertly interweaves the complementary and conflicting elements of the jazz tradition like counterpoint in a fugue. Giddins' infectious enthusiasm and enchanting storytelling skill make this an irresistible read. Unfortunately it falls slightly short of a comprehensive reference work; the index of recordings serves only as a vague guide to the aspiring collector, and the index of names is helpful, but not as powerful as a full index. A full index and coherent discography would have enhanced an already highly recommendable work."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"This is an outstanding, invaluable guide to jazz. I recommend it fully, with just one caveat -- not enough coverage of the incredible influence of Brazilian music (percussion, bossa nova, rhythms, MPB composers) on jazz. For that reason, one should also consult &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press) as a supplement to this work."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"I bought Visions of Jazz as a gift for a friend who is a music lover. I started reading through it and after two chapters I knew I wasn't giving it away. This is a book that you read first for pleasure and then reread as a reference. The book is a compilation of biographies that reads like a novel. The historical references, music criticism and wonderful narratives about the artists give the book depth and bring the music alive. I purchased the accompanying CD, which is great background music while reading or doing anything else. Mr. Giddins has such a profound knowledge and love of music that you can't help but want to be part of his world and vision. I bought another copy for my friend, it was too good to keep to myself."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"I have always been interested in jazz but I was intimidated by it. The wonderful thing about Giddins's writing is the way it draws you into the music and makes you want to listen; also the incredible range of music discussed, from Jelly Roll Morton to Joshua Redman with excursions into singers, songwriters, and other people (&quot;sidesteppers&quot; Giddins calls them) who have influenced or been influenced by jazz. The chapters on musical humor--specifically Fats Waller and Spike Jones--are a revelation. Giddins has the ability to analyze a solo note for note and keep you enthralled; when you finally get the record, you hear it in a different way, for example Armstrong's Tight Like That or Coleman Hawkins's One Hour or Dizzy Gillespie's Manteca or Sarah Vaughan's Thinking of You, and dozens of others. By the time you get to the book's last three words--&quot;Jazz is everywhere&quot;--you feel that Giddins has more than made the case for the universality of this music. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"I had some thoughts of using this as a text in a jazz history course, but it's probably better suited to jazz aficionados and &quot;adult&quot; learners (I tend to attract 18-year olds). Giddins may very well be the best jazz writer on the present-day scene, admirably carrying on in the tradition of Martin Williams, Leonard Feather, Gunther Schuller and Nat Hentoff. The sketches, retrospectives and evaluations in this collection are guaranteed to inform as well as provide fresh perspectives on things already known. Perhaps Feather and Hentoff are better at providing some of the first-hand personal information that helps a reader join the music to the musician, the musician to the human being. The making of this music does not come without great physical risks and costs, and it's always fascinated me how jazz artists have come to terms and compensated for weakened chops (Diz), altered timbre (Sarah), or a foreclosing mortage on one's time (Duke). Perhaps it's to his credit that Giddins avoids the merely anecdotal along with amateur psychologizing, though such details can often spell the difference between the glimpse that is insightful and the one that is memorable."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"To the previous reviewer: Mr Giddens was RIGHT. Coltrane's Impressions was based on BOTH pieces of music."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"The main reason I read this book is because I have become a Billie Holiday fan in the last 2 years and up till now not a true lover of jazz. This book caught my attention when I did a search for books on Billie. There was about 6 to 7 pages on her but I never imagined how long this book would be! Not a bad thing though. I know it took me a long time to read as it is SO detailed and thorough. It was truly an education for me and I have a much greater apprecation for jazz! Gary Giddens is an exceptional author and is obviously a veteran writer and really knows his stuff! A truly well written book. Highly recommended for lovers of jazz and those of us who are just beginning to have a love for it!"},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Giddins' book is invaluable as a reference and extremely readable. This is a book I often pull off the shelf after listening to an artist on CD and use it to read the background on that particular jazz performer. It is organized in a way that allows for that but is equally enjoyable to read from cover to cover. Very well writen and enjoyable. Deserves a place in the library of any jazz lover."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Well, at least Oxford provided an index which they sometimes fail to do with books that cry out for one. At least they separated the song titles. This was a good idea. But the presence of 100 Armstrong pages, to name only one, with no secondary captions is next to useless. An expanded, properly labeled index would have turned this into a 5+."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"This is avery informative guide and will appeal to those who know &quot;something&quot; about jazz, but really don't know that much about specific eras or classic jazz artists. The book does not include some important players, but such a thing is not avoidable. My only concern was the lack of consistent referencing of classic or otherwise notable recordings. In some chapters, Giddins provides titles and record lables, as well as choice cuts. In others, he'll say something like &quot;Ella Fitzgerald's classic 1945 recording&quot; and its up to the reader to see if any of the 400 available Fitzgerald recordings might be the one."},{"Title":"Visions of Jazz: The First Century","review":"Au unforgettable journey through the century written by one of the most open-minded and talented jazz journalist of our time!

This cost Gary a star."},{"Title":"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen","review":"In this work, Adam of Bremen discusses the history of Hamburg, Saxony, and Scandinavia from the 9th century on from his perspective within the Catholic Church in Saxony. He provides a great deal of important information about the times, though naturally his bias shows through frequently.Adam of Bremen seems to have clearly held Tacitus in high regard, perhaps even as a role model, as this work reminded me of Tacitus's in structure while at the same time using \\"Germania\\" as the basis for the first few chapters.I found this translation to be very readable, and the introduction was quite helpful in understanding the history behind the academic understanding of the text. For anyone interested in the history of the Middle Ages, or in Scandinavia, this work is highly recommended."},{"Title":"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen","review":"Overall an excellent book; however, inspect it closely upon recieving it. My copy was missing over 20 pages of text, which I only discovered after reading over half the book. My attempts to obtain the missing pages from the publisher were not successful."},{"Title":"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen","review":"This book was written by Adam of Bremen in or around the year 1075. That, in and of itself, should be enough to make this very interesting reading if you are a history lover. This was written almost 1000 years ago; think about that, 1000 years ago!The book is a compilation of 4 volumes written by Adam, a priest, as a treatise covering the history of the catholic church in northern Germany from 788 to his present time (approx. 1075).It also addresses the mission of the church to preach to the northern islands (present day Scandinavia) as this was a part of the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen and this is were the book is most interesting because it confirms the early Viking explorations to Iceland, Greenland and Vinland (most likely Newfoundland in Canada) which is to say that it is a record of the finding of North America before Columbus was even born; heck, this would be before Columbus' grandparents were born. Still bored?Adam was a catholic priest of little renown in his time, but well educated, as his honorary title Magister Adam would suggest that he had passed through all levels of higher education. He was invited to join the church of Bremen by the archbishop and eventually became director of the cathedral's school. He composed this work whilst director of the school.\\"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\\" (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) is Adam of Bremen's opus; a history of the actions of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, originally written in latin as all 'gesta episcoporum' (deeds of bishops) were. It is a record of the accomplishments of the archbishopric (perhaps even written a bit boastfully) especially in the mission to save the savage barbarians of the northern islands.This is a wonderful record of the dark ages including references to earlier works, which Adam would have had easy access to in the library of the church of Bremen, by historians such as The Venerable St. Bede (\\"the father of English History\\" & author of \\"The Ecclesiastical History of the English People\\"), Einhard (biographer for Charlemagne), and Cassiodorus (chief assistant to Theodoric the Great of Italy).The first 3 books are a history and the 4th is more geographical. All information is, of course, relevant to the time it was written and needs to be confirmed, but the book on a whole is accurate for the time of the writing.This is a wonderful source for anyone that is trying to gain an understanding of the dark ages, especially from the viewpoint of the catholic church which essentially ruled the dark ages."},{"Title":"Satisfaction Guaranteed: What Women Really Want in Bed","review":"Overall, I was satisfied with this book.

These exploits have been faithfully recorded by his friend and ally, Dr. Watson, who also resides at 221-B Baker Street. Doyle's literary style includes the following elements: ample dialogue, a detailed denouement which fills in all the loose ends, and occasional personal touches. Watson appears attimes as bewildered, disappointed, deductive in his own right,and truly concerned for Holmes' physical and mental health. Sherlock is presented as a man of personal honor and unflappable integrity, compassionate toward victims while ruthless toward criminals, and in one tale very human-delighting in the praise and recognition from Justice professionals. In addition he rarely extracts a serious fee for his services.The settings for these 8 mysteries range from six in the country to two in town. Holmes is sought out by clients in four tales, while he actively helps the police in the other four; onemystery he stumbles into while holiday. Most of these crimes involve cruel murder or bizarre death; two concern precious gems and one delves into English history. Readers will find a cypher in one tale and a multi-generational puzzler in another. The knowledge of Geometry will prove valuable on a treasure hunt. Realizing when he needs a little help from his \\"irregulars,\\" Holmes even relies on the keen nose of man's best friend. Delightful literary fare by the foremost detective in cases thatbaffle the pros and boggle the mind.

Also, great job on the characters, from the beggining of the book you'll feel like you've known them your whole life. Of all the books I have read lately this is the only one I would recommend without hesitation.

Ex-Navy SEAL turned psychiatric counselor at a successful halfway house, Colin is all business. Respected by both clients and peers for his quiet, compassionate, commanding persona, his pleasant demeanor hides a troubled youth. Shauna Cicchone is a fellow counselor who loves him from a distance because that is all Colin will allow. John Cordovone is father figure, friend, and superior all rolled into one. Colin and his father, Jack McGee, struggle to make sense out of their failed father-son relationship. The past haunts them both.Without warning, Colin's life is threatened from all sides by dazed strangers bent on killing him. Eventually, even the adoring Shauna hears the voice commanding her to rid the world of Colin. He's no longer safe around his closest friends, but why? Jack McGee holds the answer. But can he save his son from the suffocating evil bound on vengeance? Anh Sang Mat Tro'i, the White Light, has been a formidable enemy since Jack McGee's tour of Vietnam. Unreachable, unstoppable, the White Light stalks Colin and everyone he cares about.The White Light's inception and motives are revealed incrementally, in flashbacks to a special ops mission in Vietnam. The author takes his readers through time, past to present and present to past, revealing chilling secrets as the story builds. It made my hair stand on end.Readers who appreciate horrifying or mysterious happenings should love The Bad Voice. It seemed scarier because the premise could be true.

Edwards has a brain that God extremely developed and brought into His presence continually. Edwards had a heart for the lost and for the supremacy of Jesus Christ in all aspects of life. This is his most popular sermon that he preached at Enfield and many within attendance came to repentance in Christ while weeping and having great conviction. I would suggest all to read Edwards and think heavily on how He brings the wrath, justice, mercy, and grace of our Lord to the forefront of His sermon. He is gospel centered and wanting repentance to take place.\\"Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace of wrath...that you are held over in the hand of God...you hang by a slender thread...you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself...nothing you cando, to induce God to spare you a moment\\"\\"Christ has thrown the door of mercy open, calling and crying to poor sinners\\"Just to warn, occassionally some may believe that Edwards is somewhat harsh in his language. Please be prepared for a no holds barred view on sin through the eyes of God and what the fate of mankind is without the Savior of Jesus Christ. Many believe that God's love is not displayed enough within the sermon, but the fact the sermon took place to sinners is an act of God's love and mercy towards them."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"For those who think God is nothing but Love, this is an excellent eye opener, sort of like Lewis' \\"Screwtape Letters\\", a \\"new\\" perspective for some."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"Interestingly I have always heard reference to this sermon but never read it until recently.

This is the pure, unadulterated, hard hitting Truth that, once heard, simply cannot leave you as you were before you heard it.This sermon is regarded by many as the most famous sermon ever delivered. Written by (or perhaps through) one of the greatest American Theologians. It begins with the Word from Deuteronomy 32:35 '..their foot shall slide in due time', and with these words, the Truth is released upon the hearer without restraint.This sermon ends with this warning:\\"Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging over a great part of this congregation: Let every one fly out of Sodom: \\"aste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.\\"If you are a Christian, take heed that though you may have escaped the fate of the 'sinner' described in this book, there are those in your life that have not. I was moved to pray for those that I love that have not chosen the path of escape freely given and available to all - salvation by faith in Jesus Christ.If you are not a Christian, take heed.

It is about accountability before a Holy and Just God who hates sin and, because He is Holy and Just as well as Merciful and Loving (two sides of the same coin), demands accountability for our sins. He also provided a way for our sins to be paid in full when Jesus, His only begotten Son, willingly came and took the penalty for our sins. The law convicts us of the sentence we need to be spared from (the fires of hell). Grace is Christ taking our sins upon himself and suffering our punishment so that we can be spared from the awful sentence we deserve for violating God's Holy and Just laws. Edwards is merely pointing that out.

I don't think it would be fair for me to rate it as a sermon per se. But that doesn't prevent my having an opinion.I am curious about the community which reacted so strongly to the approach taken in this sermon. Was it representative of the populace in general, or was there some unique characteristic or circumstance that could explain the extreme response? The intro as I recall states that the community was considered a \\"hard case\\" unlikely to respond favorably to invocations to godliness, so I think something must have occurred to create a (temporary?) vulnerability to the fear-based call to spiritual revival that this sermon represents. I wonder what it was?On a more personal note, the tone of the sermon reminds me of the type of rant that struck terror into my youthful heart as an involuntary member of a southern fundamentalist church decades ago. At that period in American history, we were as likely to be threatened by immanent violent invasion of our homes by cadres of godless communists who would drag us into our yards and torture us into renouncing God, as by hellfire after our miserable lives were over.My impression is that the popularity of this genre of sermon continues, with more contemporary nightmares from the socio-political demonic pantheon substituted for the now largely irrelevant godless communists of my childhood. People have been so immersed in video over-stimulation that hellfire imagery isn't quite enough to stir the baser passions now. But, when fear-conditioning has been so effective in manipulating the multitudes, the pitch is too good to give up. Emotional manipulation rules in every age, and with a little modification in technical details the rant lives on.Don't think that I doubt the good intentions of many of those who take the rant approach. I am sure that most are convinced that freaking the heck out of honest hardworking folks who have taken time out of their busy care-wracked lives to listen courteously to them, is somehow going bring them up short and make them live more righteous lives and therefore do them good and get them into heaven.And, can I be sure that it does not really help in some cases? For one thing, as I recall there's a kind of psychological catharsis after extreme fear that emotionally refreshes, makes one feel cleansed and new. Surely that's better than a descent into addiction and despair? Also, it may be that some of us are dependent on a regular dose of threat / fear for sufficient motivation to live in a decent, non-predatory way. If this is the case, I cannot say there is no social benefit from the occassional rant.But I do not think there is spiritual benefit from it, neither for rant-er (who develops a bullying, dictatorial tendency) nor for rant-ee (who becomes inwardly servile and dependent). Neither bullying nor servility provide fertile soil for spiritual development. Indulgence of either tendency interferes with the experience of humility, stunting both heart and mind.This is a highly personal conviction, rooted in recollection of the terror I felt at the flood of vicious images invoked in the \\"sermons\\" I endured as a child. As I grew older I found such rants increasingly repulsive and inconsistent with core Christian teachings. Fear was strong but ultimately impotent; years before I left home for college it could no longer suppress conscious acknowledgement of my fundamental doubt that god existed.This sad history has a happy resolution: My doubt was overcome through years of consideration, contemplation, and prayer. I am confident that God does exist, and equally confident that God is NOT pleased with those who use the noble teaching of Christ as a stick to beat people down.I have noticed that great Christian teachers whose legacies have endured for centuries tend to emphasize love more than fear. Billy Graham is a familiar example of the success of this approach. Though he may be forgotten entirely in a generation or less, there's no doubting his contemporary influence. He is much more widely known and respected than any member of the rant crowd.It is easy to understand why! Life breaks our hearts sometimes. When our faith is at its lowest ebb, naturally, instinctively, we seek hope and encouragement, a glimpse of divine light. Ranters simply cannot deliver."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"This is a must read for anybody.

From the back cover: \\"With this marvelous sermon, Jonathan Edwards changed history and helped spark a spiritual awakening ... Historians recognize Edwards as one of the most brilliant men of all times.\\"The torments of hell are vividly described, but according to the book, \\"Throughout the sermon Edwards demonstrates the utmost compassion for the lost.\\" See if you can locate the compassion in this quotation from the sermon:The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked; his wrath toward you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire.I'm speechless. What can I say? My generic rating of three stars reflects an utter refusal to grade the sermon.One minister on the platform pulled on Jonathan's coat and cried, \\"Mr. Edwards! Is not God merciful?\\" Yet the results were remarkable. People cried aloud and grasped the back of the pews lest the ground open up and swallow them alive into hell. Others fainted, wept uncontrollably or quivered like a leaf in the wind.Gimme that old time religion.(The text of the sermon may be read here: [...]"},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"To imagine the words from \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\\" being passionately delivered by Edwards in a small New England church is downright terrifying. In reading the sermon, I could almost hear the pin-drop silence of the congregation, feel the sweat under their collars, feel the stiffening of their backs as if axles had been driven through their spines, and most of all share the panic of hell as Edwards hurls his words into the chests of the churchgoers like hurricane winds.Unfortunately, it is the rhetoric of fear and in response, people get a little crazy.\\"Sinners\\" is like the common man's Inferno. However, Dante's version of hell pales into a candle against Edwards description of the fires awaiting them in the pit of hell. Edwards makes hell palpable, as if you can feel the fire singing your skin. It is graphic violence, as bad as any video game today. While Dante's description of hell was composed as a work of art, Edwards description has no allowances for mythology or poetry. His purpose in this sermon is a singular focus on generating fear.The power of reiteration in Edwards's speech cannot be underestimated. Time and again he covers the same point of entering hell. Were the subject matter not being delivered so fervently, the repetition almost becomes laughable, as we wonder how many ways can he describe our entrance into hell. His use of the word \\"wrath\\" occurs many times in the text, and his imagery of dangling over the fire is repeated using different metaphors. In one instance you are dangling from a frayed string, in the next you are in God's palm, you are in front of the floodgates, you are a rock falling through a spider-web, you are abhorred, you are hated by God more than the vilest serpent or insect, and he will at any moment gladly tread your face, trample your body, and paint himself in your blood before your new career of suffering forevermore commences!The sermon grows sickly uncomfortable when Edwards begins to point his finger at the audience, assuring them that many in the congregation will suffer the miserable fate of hell. He uses the word \\"they\\" throughout the sermon in referring to the damned, but suddenly the detached \\"they\\" sits among the pews. Again, the written sermon nearly emits the discomfort felt in the church, the cracks of stiff pews when nervous legs shift in their seats.This type of sermon is dangerous talk because the concentration on evil and hate creates paranoia and sows ideas of hatred among the people. Jonathon Edwards dismissal from his church is a credit to the Puritan religion, since his goal was to alienate, not unify the people. His ideas, so rich in hate and disdain, could have easily infected the congregation and spread, and it seems that the Salem Witch hunts must have had this type of mentality steering the people toward injustice through fear and paranoia.Powerful."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"As one of the most well-known American religious discourses in history, this fire-breathing sermon roars from start to finish with the threat of hellfire and eternal anguish of soul. Delivered by Jonathan Edwards, an early Puritan preacher in America, this sermon is cold and calculating--utterly methodical in the dissection of just WHAT God's wrath is and just WHY you don't want it to be directed at you.To most religiously-inclined readers today, this sermon will seem a bit extreme, if not eccentric. But one has to remember the context in which it was given. These were the Puritans, the religious zealots that literally tried to 'scare the Hell' out of people. Edwards does this very well.It may be true that this sermon is quite harsh, but that does not mean that one cannot profit by reading it. The underlying message of this text is that the day for living a virtuous life is TODAY, and not later, or when we get around to it. It also warns against the dangers of allowing oneself to enter a carnal security--to believe that all is well when we are in fact under condemnation.Overall, this sermon has many great Christian values, though it should be taken with a grain of salt. This discourse is definitely recommended for anyone with an interest in Christian readings."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"True, God is not just Love, don't believe only the parts convenient to you. You need to understand the whole scope of God and have fear for him. By fear I would mean awareness of his justness and impartiality. God is the supreme judge as well as the one who is love.That said, I think this so-called most famous sermon goes against how Jesus presented God. While it could do a job in scaring the hell out of people, it lacks balance. Jesus preached about hell as a part of the whole picture and not just about it. I don't see Jesus relying on scare-tactics and harsh words to get his point across. The only people Jesus came hard against were the Pharisees and other religious people who were self-righteous and thought just knowing the scriptures and following a bunch of rules \\"made up by man\\" were the way to please God. These 'rules' were all the rules added to the original commandment, for example, the scripture spoke of 40 lashes but the Pharisees would say go 39 times in case of a miscount.This sermon is a brutal scare tactic that might give a church a spiritual kick in the butt but I don't think it would benefit people in the long run. While some christians have overblown God's love to the point of denying his wrath, overblowing God's wrath at the expense of his love is just the reverse of the first blunder."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"In the light of (Matthew 16:18-19) what are the revivalists trying to revive?

We should live neither out of fear of punishment nor out of the desire for reward, but for the sake of love of God, which should be our only goal. (1 John 4:18).

St. John Damascene*"},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"This particular sermon from Edwards has been trumpeted by some as the greatest sermon given on American soil, while being vehemently attacked by others as puritanical fire and brimstone of a backwards age. Oddly enough, there are elements of truth in both sentiments, more the former than the latter however. While unquestionably hitting on many timeless truths that are relevant in any period of time, the genius of the sermon really comes out when one considers the historical context in which the sermon was given.Contrary to many negative reflex and often revisionist reactions we tend to hear today about puritanism and Edwards, Edwards was not a constant fire and brimstone preacher. The writings of Edwards reveal a man who spoke much more on the grace and mercy of God then of His wrath. But really, the two go hand in hand. There's no need for God to be merciful if there's no eternal wrath to fear. There's no need for God to show grace to human beings if there's nothing bad enough in human beings to warrant divine punishment. It is impossible to adequately discuss God's mercy and grace without also dwelling very intently on the wretchedness of man and the divine justice that must be exacted if we believe that God is perfectly holy. This is the context in which this sermon by Edwards was given. He was invited to preach at a church that was spiritually dead and dominated by a spirit of skepticism and a deeply entrenched disbelief in the need for radical personal conversion. Such is the attitude that can be found in many churches today. Yet contrary to what happens each Sunday in these kind of churches all across America, the preacher at this particular church found such comfortable skepticism not to be a virtue of an enlightened congregation, but as a cancer that ensured that many in his church would go unsaved if things didn't change. Enter Jonathan Edwards, and his sermon to this church on that day changed the people in that church and made a lasting impact on American Christianity that is felt to this day.The main purpose of the sermon, contextually speaking, was to abruptly dislodge and disrupt the culture of apathetic skepticism that reigned in this church. Edwards attempted to do this by drawing haunting imagery of God's mercy in all things, ensuring the congregation that the only reason they are even breathing is because of God's grace. He paints a picture of man dangling over an eternal fire, and stressing that this is where man finds himself right now, and that the only reason he doesn't fall in is because God (and a very angry God at that) has a hold of him and hasn't yet let go. For Edwards, it was clear that by holding on to sinful and unrepentant man and not allowing him to fall at any moment, God was being infinitely more merciful than we deserve, but that such mercy is not indefinite or inexhaustible, but instead serves either to keep an elect person alive long enough for him to reach a point of faith and repentence, or serves to harden the sinner's heart to the point where eternal damnation is a completely just punishment for having denied and defied the authority of their Maker for so long.Some have commented that this kind of imagery is backwards because Christians shouldn't be in the business of trying to scare people into personal faith. While such a sentiment sounds good and tends to appeal to our modern sensitivities, such a view is decidedly unfaithful to the entire earthly ministry of Jesus Christ as recorded in the gospels. Jesus talked about hell and punishment more than anyone else, and certainly far more than Edwards. If one accepts that Jesus is God and can therefore be considered a pretty reliable authority on the supernatural and the afterlife, then one must conclude that Christ's continual warnings about eternal punishment are authoritative, accurate, and should be heeded with deep seriousness. I found this sermon by Edwards to be very faithful to the uncomfortable and even scary warnings given by Jesus throughout the four Gospels of the New Testament. Edwards is not scaring people for the sake of scaring people. He is doing exactly what Christ did 2,000 years ago - out of a spirit of deep love and concern, he is warning people of the very real and terrifying consequences of deliberately walking away from Jesus Christ.In the end, the basic question one has to ask when reading either Edwards or Scripture is whether the eternal punishment described by both is truthful or not. If it is, then how can it possibly be an act of love not to tell people about it? Better to offend with the truth and call people to faith in the one true God and personal repentance than try to make people feel comfortable believing a lie and not seeing a need for people to change anything about their beliefs, wrong and negatively consequential though they may be. If someone believes that eternal punishment is false, then that person has bigger fish to fry then Edwards, they must also patently reject the sayings of Jesus and adopt completely by blind faith a different view of the afterlife. Many have taken this latter road, just as Christ predicted would happen. But truth does not depend on whether our ears are sufficiently tickled. Those who sincerely want to know the truth will give Edwards a fair hearing here and put his views to the test."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"The danger in understanding Edwards is that all too few know anything about him except for this sermon. He spoke about the excellency of Christ more than any other topic.The editor was wise in noting that Edwards gave this sermon to a church that was playing around with God. Jesus' example is that He was very harsh with the religious hypocrites, and He was gentle and sweet with the &quot;sinners.&quot;It should be noted that without law there can be no concept of grace. When the doctrines of grace were recovered in the Reformation, respect for God's law was likewise recovered. If someone is coming to Jesus not based on because they need forgiveness and atonement with a Holy God, they are coming on false grounds. That is why this sermon is needed today. There is too much felt-needs sermons. Come to Jesus because He will make you better. No, come to Jesus and escape the wrath of God. If you come on other grounds than that, you are endanger of not being a true disciple. That last sentence may sound weird.

In 1729, at the age of twenty-six, he succeeded his grandfather at the important Northampton Church, where he preached the need for a return to the rock-ribbed Calvinism upon which the &quot;New World&quot; had been founded. The Calvinist creed entailed absolute and unquestioned commitment to beliefs in the total depravity of man as a sinner, unconditional election, predestination, divine revelation and conversion, and eternal suffering for sinners. Edward's ministry had an immediate and dramatic effect, increasing the size of his church, producing over four hundred converts by 1734. The Northampton Revival foreshadowed The Great Awakening--the popular religious movement of 1740-1741 based on the idea that &quot;opening of the spirit to the divine&quot; was more important than a trained intellect--that rocked the very foundations of colonial society.Edward's most famous sermon, &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; was delivered as a guest sermon to the parish in Enfield, Connecticut, on July 8, 1741, at the very peak of The Great Awakening. Edward's text for the sermon was Deuteronomy 32:35: &quot;Their foot shall slide in due time.&quot; Edwards, who typically spoke in an unemotional and relatively plain style, took advantage of the recent prophecy of the end of the world that no doubt weighed upon his listeners minds. Reaching to the depths of his emotional spirit, he preached a sermon designed to terrify his audience into conversion.

Yet this is probably one of the best-known American sermons ever preached! This sermon had three main sections: \` The state of mankind'; \`Sinner, beware'; and \`A warning to all'. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1785) was pastor at First Church of Northampton, Massachusetts. His aim in ministry was to transform his congregation from mere believers who understood the logic of Christian doctrine to converted Christians who were generally moved by the principles of their belief.On July 8th 1741 Edwards preached his most famous sermon, \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\\" to a Church in Enfield, Connecticut, USA. It was a word of light imparted to darkened souls and many came to faith experiencing true \`heart religion'. It was based on Deuteronomy 32:35 \\"Their foot shall slide in due time\\". Jonathan Edwards gave a clear picture of the predicament of every unbeliever and lukewarm Christian. Edwards used compelling words and images to describe the shaky position of those who do not follow Christ and God's urgent call to receive His love and forgiveness.Edwards spoke graphically, for example, \\"As the heart is now a cesspool of sin so if sin were not restrained it would immediately turn the soul into a fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone\\". He warned his hearers that, \\"Whatever pains a natural man take in religion, whatever prayers he makes, until he believes in Christ, God is under no manner of obligation to keep him from eternal destruction for even a moment.\\" This book gives an interesting insight into a revival sermon - used by God to help change America.

That's what the Jehovah's Witnesses believe, and that's what modern Christians have come to believe too.We have adopted this ultragracious and innocuous image of God, I believe, for two principle reasons:1) We like to selectively read the scriptures. By negating the hell and judgment passages with the more tolerable \\"God is graceful and loving\\" ones, we reconstruct our own likeness into a god who has now become an eternal \\"good god\\" with no emotions but love and giving and helping and blessing -- a god who advocates our carnal lifestyles, and is only worthy of notice during the Christmas and Easter holidays, and when devastation hits our lives.2) We rationalize His character by our own human standards. We ascribe certain attributes to God that are logical to us, and what we deem fair. After all, isn't God all about justice? And mercy? No earthly judge would ever consign a man to a fiery torture for a lifetime -- nevermind eternity! This, we therefore decide, is in no way an accurate image of God.We'll often recite the scriptures where Jesus forgave the woman caught in adultery, or had compassion on the multitudes, or ate dinner with the sinners, or preached the sermon on the mount about loving your enemies and not repaying evil for evil. And yes, He did all that -- Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. Many say here, \\"Yep. And Jesus' sermon on the mountain didn't scare the people, it was all about love and grace and good things, and blessings and givings and so forth...\\"Just like the moon has another \\"dark\\" side, there is also another side to God. And Jesus talked, warned, pleaded, and wept about it. The awful justice of a Holy and Eternal God. Jesus talked more about His Father's justice and punishment for the wicked than His love for the righteous.God doesn't fool around with sin. If He annihilated Sodom and Gomorrah with fire because of their sexual immorality, and had His own Son nailed to the cross, do you really believe He'll spare any man or women who stands before Him on that \\"awful day\\" in unrepentant sin?All throughout the Old and New Testaments, His prophets have warned of an impending day of fire and wrath. Joel called it the \\"Terrible Day of the Lord\\", Paul called it the \\"Judgment Seat of Christ\\", John called it the \\"Lake of Fire\\", and Jesus called it the \\"Place of Eternal Torment\\", John the Baptist called it the \\"Day of Wrath\\". David spoke of it in the Pslams!For every one \\"love scripture\\" you throw at me, I can give you three of which that warn of God's reserved wrath for the wicked. You tell me God loves the sinner, but hates the sin. But the Bible says God hates the sinner as well (see Psalm 5:4). The Bible also says that God is ANGRY WITH THE WICKED every day (see Psalm 7:11).If you've read my review thus far, you're probably angry. This may be an indication that you either: 1) Don't know the full character of God, or 2) Sin doesn't grieve your heart like it grieves the Holy Spirit, or 3) You've never been born again of the Spirit with a desire for holiness and purity which, according to the Bible, is the the only acceptable lifestyle before God.Jonathan Edwards was a Puritan preacher. These guys were after purity (hence, Puritan) and the holiness of the Lord. Today, 250 years later, we have lost sight of this. Today, the gospel of Jesus Christ is a politically-correct, inoffensive, recreational and powerless motivational philosophy for success and gain. The gospel has no power to change lives because we refuse to live in holiness and reverential fear of an awesome and terrible God. We've instead created our own god with our own ideals and contructed his character out of our own acceptable and worldly attributes that are centered around our own standards of success, comfort, and tolerance.We need the truth the come back to the pulpits. Do away with all the unctionless motivational speaking that passes for gospel preaching today. When Jonathan Edwards preached his sermon in 1741, people fell out of their chairs and cried out, \\"What must we do to be saved!\\" The fear of God had them shaking, weeping, pleading! Some were even clutching the pillars that held the gallery up, fearful that the ground was about to split open and swallow them whole! Did anything like that happen to the sinners in YOUR church last Sunday?Mine neither."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"I was in awe of the book and only wish we had men that would stand and say it like it is and that people would listen."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"It has been many years since I last read Johnathan Edwards sermon - \\"Sinners in The Hands of an Angry God\\". It is unfortunate that many people often misunderstand Edwards sermon. His sermon is often used by some to criticize God as angry because His Law is broken. There is a hint of truth to that, however, the real reason Edwards sermon is so powerful is that God is angry because His Grace has been rejected. I have recently completed reading \\"The Essential Works of Charles Spurgeon\\" (Kindle Edition). Once you understand what it means for individuals to reject God's Grace, then the sermon, \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\\" is clearer."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"Quite possibly the most famous sermon of all time, this classic by Edwards is sure to stir our so called \\"Modern Sensibilities\\". Edwards was a man fully devoted to what he believed was true, and preached that with conviction. This sermon is often thought of as an all fire and brimstone kind of preaching, but truthfully the entire thing is about the unfathomable grace of God. Though Edwards seems to spend only a short while talking about God's grace, he truly paints a much better picture of it then most preachers ever have. How? By showing us the backdrop of Sin and Hell. It is only with the background as black as this, that the White as Snow grace of God can so brightly shine through. I highly recommend this sermon for everyone.

This is not a sermon of a modern day type minister who rarely, if ever, would use the language of judgment concerning final damnation in such graphic depiction. Though we are to remember that God sends no one to Hell but it's the sinner himself who does.Rejecting Christ is the only reason why anyone would perish. Though this does not mean we \\"accept\\" Christ, either ('accepting Christ' is not a term or teaching found in the Bible).Read the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (Luke 18:9-14) for instance. The Pharisee congratulates himself on how righteously he lives. He then compares himself to the Publican he knew to be wicked. The Publican, however, standing far off and knowing his own wickedness, pleads to God. He does not deny or minimize his sin and does not even lift his eyes up toward Heaven but instead prays, 'O God, be merciful to me, a sinner'. He makes no mention of anything he may have done well or commendably but instead throws himself entirely on the mercy of God. Jesus ends the parable by saying that this man returned to his house justified and the other did not.Many people today fall for the lie that the good they have done outweighing the bad will eventually see them through. The truth is salvation rests entirely upon God. Jesus went to the Cross doing the will of His Father. The Cross is the price paid for all our sins and it is the Cross alone that has gained salvation for those who are and those who will be born again.God makes it very clear: He will share His glory with NO ONE.There is nothing we can do to add, contribute, influence, etc. the work God has already done for us to save our souls and to give us victory in this life from sin and evil.'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God' captures the urgency and immediacy that the salvation that God Himself provides is the one and only way a sinner is to escape certain and final destruction."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"Jonathan Edwards' Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is a complex web of traditional Puritan orthodoxy, calculated audience involvement, startling imagery, and theatrics. When he harangued his parishioners with the text of this sermon, he was attempting to re-convince a slightly over-affluent audience that they had good reason to fear God's imminent wrath and the collective loss of their immortal souls. The congregation that sat in their pews on July 8, 1741, was not cut from the same theological cloth as were those of the previous generation. Those Puritans did not need to be taught from the pulpit that they were walking a spiritual tightrope with no safety net. They well knew that piousness, frugality, and acceptance of grace were hardwired into their assorted psyches. These latter Puritans of 1741 were more numerous and more affluent than their immediate predecessors. In the eyes of Jonathan Edwards, they were thus more likely to lapse into sin. It was his hope that this sermon would fit into a larger framework of asceticism that was later to be termed the Great Awakening. In that sweaty room on Sunday, Jonathan Edwards began the battle to retain their souls.At the core of Puritanism was the belief that the soul was a testing ground or a battlefield between the forces of good, led by God, Christ, and holy piousness and the forces of evil led by Satan, his demonic minions, and excessive material prosperity. The primary combatant, at least in the eyes of preachers like Jonathan Edwards was a vengeful and irate God. Any other combatant mentioned--Satan, devils, sinning human beings--are set up only as straw men to be flattened at any moment by the infinite power and majesty of God. It is therefore not surprising that most of the images Edwards uses are martial in nature.Part of the reason that Sinners is the effective piece of rhetoric that it is derives from the extraordinary closeness between preacher and congregation. First, when Edwards initially addressed his audience, they were all tightly packed into a rather small church hall. His parishioners not only could hear his words but could also see his body language keep tempo with his rhetoric. Further, the tone of the sermon reeks of an emotional proximity between Edwards and his audience. He would often use parallelism and repetition to emphasize this symbiotic relation. \\"Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards Hell,\\" he thunders early on. His constant use of the pronouns \\"you\\" and \\"your\\" functions as a rhetorical fulcrum to move the congregation from their present state of smugness to a desired condition of appalling terror. Edwards was also a master of parallelism to render the sermon as bursting with energy: \\"You have no interest in any mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you have ever done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment.\\"Less obvious than his use of standard rhetorical devices is his implied difference between the implied force of potential energy and the actual force of kinetic energy. Every image that contributes to the impression of an all-powerful God is a function of what God might do when His divine wrath has reached a critical level. Edwards wisely omits mention of any already finished act of human or divine destruction. Consider the oft-quoted apostrophe warning the unregenerate that the Day of Doom looms: \\"O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in. \\"Tis a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the damned in Hell.\\" As Edwards continues his sermon, he also subtly constructs his images using the directions of \\"up\\" and \\"down.\\" God somewhere inhabits the \\"up\\" while the infernal regions of hell are the \\"down.\\" Humanity resides on earth in the middle. As soon as a reprobate passes the point of no return, God appears in His entire majestic wrath to swat him down to hell. Edwards uses a variety of words to suggest this violent act of descending: \\"If God should withdraw his hand;\\" \\"Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead;\\" \\"If God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend;\\" \\"He looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire.\\" And when Edwards is not explicitly involving his congregation in their downward spiral into hell, he employs images that conjure up a God who enjoys immensely using human beings as mortal pi&ntilde;ata bags. Edwards devotes several sentences that are built on a series of archery metaphors: \\"The bow of God's wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow.\\" In other paragraphs he constructs similar such sentences using water images and spider images. And while all this rhetorical haranguing is occurring, the congregation is as tightly focused on his words as future generations of radio listeners would do when radio broadcasters knew well how to entrance an audience using only the power of words.Even today, when readers need explanatory footnotes for Edwards' ubiquitous use of biblical allusions and exposure to the assumed collective knowledge of Puritan lore that assuredly lay in the minds of his audience, modern readers can yet sense the onrushing images of a runaway freight train that could at any moment dash the poor soul who has unwittingly tied himself to the track that goes straight to hell."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"This is an excellent rendition of perhaps the most famous, important - and convicting - sermon in the past two hundred years.

While the wrath of God and the existence of hell are obviously present in the Bible, something seems off with this piece of literature. I found myself wishing that the Father was more like Jesus, which doesn't make sense. I found it difficult to pray to my \\"Abba\\" in the heavens. I believe that, in the end, Jesus came to set us free from the sin that holds us as slaves, to lead us back to the arms of our loving Father, to heal and to renew, not just to protect us from the Father as Edwards seems to suggest here. One of the reasons that people are unable to trust God completely is because they don't believe that He is perfectly good, only powerful.I do understand what many other reviewers have said in regards to the words of Jesus to the self righteous. It's true that he doesn't compromise, which we should be thankful for. Without the destruction of all that is evil, how could the perfect kingdom of God, the renewal of all that is good that is spoken of in the Bible, be realized? I don't want to challenge any doctrines, I am not qualified to do that. I only wish to encourage all who read this book to question the character of the God that Edwards presents. Jesus said to love our enemies, wouldn't he do the same? I have not read anything else by Jonathan Edwards (I really don't want to now), and I know that he is greatly respected by many people. Hopefully his other works are better than this one. If you read this book, I would suggest using this piece of advise from a favorite author of mine.\\"The acid test for any theology is this: Is the God presented one that can be loved, heart, soul, mind, and strength? If the thoughtful, honest answer is; \\"Not really,\\" then we need to look elsewhere or deeper. It does not really matter how sophisticated intellectually or doctrinally our approach is.

To think that there are those who believe in a god who is just WAITING to cast his children into an eternal, everlasting, writhing, excruciating, pit of endless torment, is to think completely in contradiction to the message of Jesus Christ.If Jesus Christ was God (and I believe He was) then why didn't he spend every waking moment of his life warning about this Father of His who was waiting to torture His children? NOTHING else would have been as important-not healing the sick, forgiving sin, preaching the Sermon on the Mount, or feeding the multitudes as it would be to spend every living moment talking about the wrath to come. Merciless, pitiless, cruel wrath.In order to back up Edwards' diatribe, Jesus should have said, \\"My Father in heaven HATES you-every last one\\", \\"It is my Father's good pleasure to see his children twist and turn in agony in front of a grinning demon who smiles fiendishly as he lights another piece of brimstone.\\" In other words, what would have been the point of the Gospels or the Good News? What would have been the point of love? What would have been the point of forgiveness? What would have been the point of charity? What indeed would have been the point of the Bible except to say \\"you're damned with an everlasting damnation?\\"Scriptures such as \\"now abide these three things, faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love.\\" would have been childishly naive. The greatest would have been punishment. The Bible would not have been God's \\"love letter\\" to us as some have called it, but a book that described such miseries as to make the Holocaust look tame in comparison. That is if we are to believe in Edward's strange, disjointed, and schizophrenic ideas of God.The more I think about Edwards and his theology the more I believe that he told us very, very little about God, but a whole lot about Johnathan Edwards. He composed a sadistic, twisted piece of prose intended to scare people into believing in a petty, small, autocratic god, who, in the end, discarded people into a a huge fiery trash can full of infinite punishments for finite crimes; a god who would make Bin Laden, Hitler, Mussolini,and Stalin infinitely proud.A god sort of like, well, Johnathan Edwards."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this \\"sermon\\" has been to all who have read or heard it.

The first century church never believed in a \\"hell\\". The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from pagan religions of the world. \\"Hell\\" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and \\"converting\\" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as \\"orthodox\\" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.

Invited by the pastor in Enfield, Connecticut to come and speak to his congregation - a collection of apathetic, spirit-less people completely unaffected by the Great Awakening of 1734-35 in New England. Edwards, himself a pastor of the First Church of Northampton, Massachusetts, delivered this message on July 8, 1741 with the object of presenting the truth of the current condition of those outside the saving grace of God as being in peril and subject to the divine wrath of an Almighty and Holy God. It was said that as Edwards spoke, he was interrupted several times by people moaning and crying out, \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" And while this sermon has received heavy criticism since that day, it continues to proclaim the awesome wonder of our God and His incredible grace and patience for all mankind.Edwards begins his sermon with a proper perspective of the state of the nature of man - fallen from divine grace, now subject to divine wrath. He writes, \\"There is nothing that keeps wicked men out of hell, at any one moment, except the mere pleasure of God.\\" Edwards wants every man to know that their sin has condemned them to an eternity without God and writes, \\"As the heart is now a cesspool of sin, so if sin were not restrained, it would immediately turn the soul into a fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.\\" Using incredibly visual imagery, Edwards warns the unrepentant that their own efforts are worthless and insignificant at best to prevent their eventual demise into the pit of hell. \\"Your wickedness makes you as heavy as lead; it drives you down, with great weight and pressure, toward hell. And if God were to let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf. At that moment, you will see that your health, your own care and prudence, your best contrivance, and all your righteousness, have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider's web has to stop a falling rock.\\"Edwards ends by sounding his clarion call to all sinners - that their fate is an eternity without the grace of God. \\"When you look forward, you will see a long forever, a boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your thoughts and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely lose all hope or confidence of ever having any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at all.\\"This short, but powerful, sermon is an excellent reminder of God's sovereignty and His grace and mercy - as John Newton near the end of his life said, \\"My memory is nearly gone, but I remember two things: that I am a great sinner, and that Christ is a great Savior.\\" Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God will be such a reminder to those who know the grace of God and will be a sound and clear warning to all others of their pending fate."},{"Title":"Sinners in the hands of an angry God (From the inheritance of our fathers)","review":"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is the text of a sermon that Edwards preached to his congregation. I know of no author/preacher who is more consistently captivated by God's glory in his grace and love towards sinners, especially as manifested in the eternal joy in Him of heaven.

Hell is what we all deserve; God's eternal and infinite wrath is what we would be experiencing now and should experience for eternity if it were not in God's good pleasure to restrain Himself.

The complete run of this comic strip is available online by subscription, and this first volume of Narbonic in print offers a more economic alternative to internet-reading, as well as containing a never-before-seen 10-page bonus story.This strip offers the same spark as comics like Calvin and Hobbs and Bloom County: the combination of comic humor with satire. Make no mistake, Narbonic is delightfully funny. Garrity has chosen a deep creative well to draw upon in the lives of evil scientists, and we see many exploits involving death rays, brain transplants, and raising the dead, all tried and true B-sci-fi movie tactics. But she's also added more modern \\"evil science\\", like cloning, genetic mapping, and microcomputer technology. In this way the strip explores, while making us laugh, a wide range of current topics. For example, when Dave and Helen swap genders via the surreptitious experiments of their genetically-enhanced genius gerbil (don't you just HAVE to read this?), the strip ends up with some very telling moments of the treatment of women in American geek culture. Such antics also throw the characters' sexuality into diverse loops, and I imagine many cultural studies scholars could have a field day with this material. Another fine moment for satire is seen in the constant underlying element of \\"evil\\" in the computer industry and corporate culture.

You can't read, say, Shakespeare sonnets in another language without thinking that the Bard is spinning in his grave.There is no perfect translation of poetry. And this one ain't perfect. But it is pretty darn good. The imageries translate well, though the clever sounds are mostly lost. That can't be helped -- if you can't keep the clever sound in &quot;traduire c'est trahir&quot; in the English &quot;to translate is to betray&quot;, then you have to live without the clever sounds in Nguyen Duy's poetry.Nguyen Duy is the first poet to sound the alarm over the decaying state of the Vietnamese economy, morals, public spirit, and morale. He is a rare North Vietnamese poet to grieve over the tragedy of the boat people (mostly southerners). He called for &quot;doi moi&quot; (VN's perestroika) years before the government would do so.But he is not a political dissident. That is not a poet's job.

There were long, over descriptive sentances that I had to go back and read over again to understand.

It is surely the worst of Le Guin's novels and I hope the author is ashamed of it and wants to forget that she ever wrote it.

However, 'The People of Peace,' who led a non-violent movement against the great wars of Earth, were also sent to the planet be the government of a great nation. When the novel begins, the people of the prison colony enjoy great comforts in town, disdaining the People of Peace, who do their farming.Those who live outside the city grow tired of this poor exchange, and want to go found a new city, with no oppression. The novel explores the struggle to do this, as the non-violent people question their own ideals.This book has beautiful moments, and the characters are well-conceived. However, it lacks the depth of some of Le Guin's other novels like The Dispossesd and The Left Hand of Darkness. It is an enjoyable read, but in the end it is lighthearted rather than than deep and pondering."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"While this novel may not rise to the level of her very best work, prose-wise, it nonetheless is well-written--and its explorations of nonviolence, its challenges and the ways in which it can both succeed and fail, were highly influential on me, and have had a long term effect on how I view conflict. This one is well worth reading, and is as worthy of Le Guin's name as any of her better-known works."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"Written, I suspect, for a juvenile audience, The Eye of the Heron deals with many of LeGuin's favorite themes. Violence versus pacifism, hierarchy versus democracy, partriarchy versus feminism, and exile all figure in this novel. This book does not, however, have the depth or quality of writing of her best books. The plot is a bit mechanical and predictable, the characterization is a bit thin, and the quality of writing is good as opposed to outstanding. This book isn't at the level of The Lathe of Heaven or The Word for World is Forest, let alone The Dispossessed or The Left Hand of Darkness. As a juvenile book, this isn't at the level of the best Earthsea books."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"The planet Victoria was founded as a prison colony, but the original mission expired. The descendents of the prisoners and guards/wardens evolved into two prime groups: the Shantih farmers and those who live in the City. The agricultural residents of Shantih believe in independence for the individual and peaceful coexistence as a group. Bosses reign over the City and employ force to severely rule over the farmers.Tired of tyranny, some farmers decide to begin a new colony far away from their oppressors. However, the Bosses believe that one escapee could destroy their positions of power. Luz, daughter of the Big Boss of the City, knows oppression first hand though she has lived a relatively pampered life. She decides to grasp at freedom at all costs by joining the rebellious farmers.Ursula Le Guin's \\"Earthsea\\" books were some of my first fantasy novels so this reviewer has a special bias for one of the genre greats. THE EYE OF THE HERON is a reprint of a late 1970s tale that occurs on another world, but nothing unique really makes the reader feel that they are off-planet. Still, the key cast members, especially Luz and her father, come across as genuine, so that the audience sees the quest for independence and few societal restrictions and intrusions on two levels, that within a family and that between two castes with one enjoying the fruits of a dominant position that they refuse to cede (South Africa before Mandela). This still remains a solid work of fiction just not science fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"First of all, Ursula K. LeGuin is one of my favorite authors, if not my absolute favorite. Her writing rarely fails to be highly compelling, either in its imaginativeness, appeal to humanity, exploration of anthropology, or any number of other facets. Unfortunately, The Eye of the Heron struggles along and results in a merely average novel from a brilliant writer.The premise of this short novel is reasonable and interesting enough. Several ships have left Earth to colonize a new world, Victoria. The first two ships are filled with aggressive people banished from the Earth and the third is filled with uncooperative, non-violent, people from the Earth. The more bellicose people establish a city with a highly structured government and police force, and the pacifists establish a communal village a short number of miles away. The nonviolent people provide the manual labor to keep the entire colony running. There are two major conflicts in the book. The first involves the nonviolent people planning to move much further away to a more idyllic valley (where practically they will no longer provide labor to the city). The second involves the daughter of the top-ranking military member of the city. She wants to leave her family for freedom of her own, presumably among the village people. So there is a good bit of tension and a number of plot elements involving these two crises and they are interwoven seamlessly as the plot figuratively (and literally) plods along.The novel falls a little flat because there isn't a great deal of plot development and the limited action of the book is relatively slow. By using only peaceful noncompliance, it is hard to build a compelling conflict or decisive actions on the characters' parts. Le Guin has, in her other writing, proven that she can build compelling tension with only minor plot movement. For a while I thought the daughter would fall madly in love with the apparent leader of the communal village, but this would be too clich&eacute; for Le Guin to put forth. Instead the book tends to focus on minor actions and how they relate to principles of freedom. For example, the city members can only see actions in terms of individuals controlling others. Physical conflicts are quickly described in a way that does not glorify violence; thereby giving an implicit nod to the philosophy of non-violence that the villagers espouse. Exploring the principles of nonviolent noncompliance is an important element of this book, more so than plot movement or action. As such the character development was one of the stronger elements of the book.One minor quibble has to do with the overall dreary tone of the work. The conflicts are somewhat sordid and the colony is constantly shrouded in rain, mist, dirt and mud. Even the titular bird stands and walks around in muck. So this was definitely meant to be part of the theme, but it is hard to find uplifting. Towards the end there is a bit of brighter scenery, but even then life carries on in a humdrum fashion from there. The characters' success is largely philosophical, not material, and neither is dwelt upon much.Finally, on a lighter note, LeGuin has some very interesting flora and fauna in the book, including an exploding tree seed (with a neatly plausible lifecycle and biology) and a small creature called a wotsit that alters its viewers' perception as a form of camouflage; these are fairly unique and interesting ideas to explore. These fit in nicely with the theme and narrative and are signature Le Guin elements.If you are a Le Guin fan I can recommend reading this book because you will already know how to read for the important meanings in the narrative. For regular readers this book will probably just seem average."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"\\"The eye of the heron\\" is about a planet that started as a prison planet. There are two different groups of people living here, both with their own outlook at life. The first group is democratically organised and every decision has to be made by all the members of the group. The second group is very strictly organised and decisions are being made by the leader. The first group is being dominated by the second group and are only allowed to live in a small part of the planet. Eventually they revolt against that, but without using violence.Luz is the main character of the book. She is the daughter of the leader of the second group. She realises that there are other ways of living your life and she has to make a decision about her future.I didn't like this book too much. I thought it was mediocre. I liked the fact that there are two very different groups of people living in a planet, but the story was very shallow. The differences were very black & white and the people weren't becoming real people to me. I wouldn't want to read this book again!"},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"This book, I thought, was a very hard read, mostly because it had many run- on sentences that seem to go on forever. Sometimes she goes off on a tangent, which means she continues describing something that isn't relevant to the story. Le Guin has written many amazing books, but this is not one of them."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"LeGuin has written such truly amazing novels, like 'Lavinia' or the Earthsea books that its always disappointing to read one of her more average books. This was one of those. The writing was at its most strong when she was describing the wonders of the planet. She herself said it was a problematic novel for her because the hero didn't do what she had planned for him--she had to relearn how to write.In that way it might be interesting to study. Especially in terms of where it falls between the Earthsea books, as this book is where she says she really started to look at feminist analysis of writing. The Earthsea books have a real break between her self described 'masculine' style and the real feminine style that she takes on. The writing of this book appears to be the catalyst for that.But aside from that literary nerdiness, I didn't really enjoy the book. The characters were just sort of sketches, with hints of real depth. The conflict between them was forced and fairly boring to read about. And the part where her character did what he wanted to and not what she planned...sort of killed the novel for me."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"First off, this novel comes from a larger collective novel called Millennial Women published in 1978. This novel, as well as the other stories, follow the basic theme of a strong female protagonist throwing off the shackles of some dominating male(s). So The Eye of the Heron has the sense of being constrained by what the author has to write to, as well as being ten years dated even for 1978. The secondary theme of the story is a revolution, of sorts, by non-violence. When one thinks of non-violence one typically thinks of Gandi. However, Gandi made use of non-violence in India, oppressed by the British, by the fact that there were so many of them, almost a billion at the time, and so many fewer of the British dominators, so refusing to provide services literally shut down the country if one wanted that country to run. But as someone once said, violence has 'solved' more conflicts than any other method in history. In Russia between WWI and (during) WWII, Russia so dominated in population all of the surrounding countries it occupied that if any one tried non-violent revolution, the Russians would simply tortured, kill, or starve the population until they went extinct, and then just go on to the other countries it dominated. In the novel there weren't enough of the oppressed group to have non-violence succeed, and at least Le Guin knew that, because basically that attempt fails.The two groups, the oppressors and the oppressed, ended up on a planet by different methods. The oppressors were originally criminals sent there by earth, sort or a penal colony (think of Australia). The oppressed started as a group called the People of the Peace in a movement called Peace on Earth. This movement began the Long March through the countries of Europe and people joined them on the way. Eventually they all took boats to Montreal of Canamerica (I'm not making this up) and desired to populate the central plains of what is now Canada, but the government of Canamerica thought they were spies of some non-descript entity called the Republic and so offered to send the lucky ones on one-way ships to the penal colony world. Now one can look at a modern map of Canada and see a lot of open space in central Canada, but the reason Canadians or any one else, haven't populated that area in large numbers in because of bitter cold, and people of peace dancing around campfire naked or lying in the grass looking up at the clouds don't come across as a group that would generally tolerate arctic tundra cold, but also in central Canada there exists a small gnat that gets through the holes of the typical screen and delivers a painful bite. Also the mosquitoes are in such huge numbers that they've been described as a moving mat on a lake surface. Going back to the Soviet Union/Russian Empire, the Russians took anyone who didn't follow the rules, strip them, and threw them outside of the camp. These people would freeze to death in winter, or be eaten alive by the swarms of insects in summer. My uncle described a situation in the labor camp when working on some force project in the woods where if one had to relieve a bodily function, you would climb a tree to a limb, since the insects stayed mostly along the ground, and relieve yourself from there, otherwise the insects would be relentless on any exposed skin surface. Anyway, Le Guin apparently wasn't aware of the inhospitality by nature of central arctic Canada, so this sets up a flaw in her that there's got to be some place for people calling themselves whatever to find some country that would allow them to set up shop. Anyway on another planet there's got to be enough room, but no one can know enough to do anything until our protagonist forces the issue. For the protagonist, Luz, think of a snotty 16 year old kid that has all the answers, but not responsible for anything so doesn't take any blame for anything. I'm not sure how this character would be inspiring to any adult woman that is striving for independence from dominating men (a worthy issue) and may be why this novel has been relegated to the young adult section.Le Guin writes some interesting descriptions of the natural creatures and flora of the planet, but even her prose of this becomes tiresome after a while. Not a necessary book within feminine studies and certainly not within science fiction."},{"Title":"Eye of the Heron, The (Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed this book.

From the first few moving and thought-provoking pages onwards, Holden asks us to delve deeper into what the meaning of the word \\"success\\" really is.Unlike some of the more American approaches to self-improvement (of which I am also a fan), the author asks us and society to slow down and look into ourselves. With sections such as \\"Money Is Not Your Purpose\\" and \\"Insane Busyness\\", the crazy rush of the busy busy modern western consumer society is questioned throughout. Many real life stories of individuals adopting more intelligent and balanced strategies for success are scattered throughout the book. There are suggestions and exercises at the end of each section.The seven main parts of \\"Success Intelligence\\" are Vision, Potential, Wisdom, Relationships, Courage, Grace and Renaissance. At the end the reader is asked to say \\"yes\\" to life, yourself, your wisdom, relationships, a purpose, commitment and love. A book to read, re-read, ponder on and put into practice.

He doesn't play soft jazz in his apartment, and have a collection of paintings, crockery, special fry pans and the poems of Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. He drinks a lot. He has a friend on the cops and a sexy, very sexy secretary.It all starts with him. In his wake are Lehane, Crais, Lescroart, Parker, George, Margolin and the like.There's also a nice collection of Mike Hammer including \\"My Gun is Quick\\" and \\"Vengeance is Mine,\\" and you can now get several other novels together.

Based on all the hype I thought it would similar to Raymond Chandler novel, with his Philip Marlowe character. I discovered this to be largely untrue, which isn't entirely a bad thing.In \\"I, the Jury\\" we have a lovable cad of a private investigator looking for the killer of his best friend. But he seeks justice in a very crude way - revenge (ie, he's out for blood). Of course during the way he meets with some sexy \\"broads\\" (to use the vernacular of the times) who, of course, fall madly in love with him. So far this doesn't sound far off from a Raymond Chandler novel. However with Mickey Spillane the dialogue is less clever (yet easier to read), the prose is only fair, and the story could have been told better. In \\"I, the Jury\\" the rather terrific ending is very quickly brought to the surface is an an abrupt way. So Raymond Chandler seems to be the much better writer, capturing the essence of 1940s Los Angeles and the folks who inhabit skid row. Mickey Spillane's book is set in New York but it could have been Anywhere, USA, and I didn't exactly feel hurdled back in time. But I enjoyed \\"I, the Jury\\" overall and I will read others in the Mike Hammer series.Bottom line: a bit crude but very entertaining piece of private eye nonsense. In its own way it is deserving of its status as as classic."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"This Mike Hammer detective thriller was a best-seller hit in the 1950's, selling over a million and a half copies in the USA alone in that decade.It begins when Private Eye and ex G.I. Mike Hammer discovers that Jack Williams, a former WWII comrade who had literally given his right arm to save Mike's life, has been murdered. Williams had died with a dum-dum bullet through the lower body, apparently at the hands of a particularly sadistic killer.Mike is in a race with police detective Captain Pat Chambers to catch the killer: Pat wants to arrest and try the culprit, Hammer has promised that he will kill the murderer, whoever it is, in exactly the same way that Jack Williams was killed.(Now, I was under the impression that in law, shooting someone dead other than in self-defence is still murder even if the victim is also a murderer, but different rules seem to appliy in novels.)As Mike and Pat think they are closing in on the killer, they start to get shot at themselves - then more people are murdered.The story is quite exciting, and the shock ending when Mike Hammer finally confronts the killer is absolutely chilling.Quite nonsensical in places, but if you are into 40's & 50's style thrillers you will probably find this entertaining. Be warned however that the book packs a major sting in the tail."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Spillane's first novel is unfortunately out of print and I hope this will encourage the publishers to reprint.

In many ways he was similar to Erskine Caldwell who was also a prolific writer and their leadership created a whole new venue of literature,namely the low cost Paperbacks.Though most people don't realize it,these writers outsold even Hemmingway and Steinbeck,even in their day.Spillane considered himself a \\"writer\\" as opposed to an \\"authoer,\\" defining a writer as someone whose books sell.

Mike Hammer, one of thrillerdom's ace protagonists was introduced, and the world couldn't read enough of his adventures.Today Mickey Spillane is 85-years-old, and acclaimed around the globe for inventing the hard-hitting, hard-boiled protagonist who is a compelling mix of sex and sharp shooting. It's hard to believe this many years have gone by for the Brooklyn born Spillane. He's outlasted and out sold many of his contemporaries, and when last heard from was still hard at work.Perhaps those of us who love to read don't take time to thank the writers who have given us so many hours of pleasure. I certainly fall into that category, so a big hats off to Mickey Spillane and gratitude for the wealth of reading pleasure he's given so many."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Mickey Spillane captured the attention of crime fiction fans when he introduced Mr. Tough Guy, Mike Hammer in I, JURY. Mike is the essence of the hard boiled detective who found murder objectionable and women personable.A friend who gave his arm to save Mike's like during WWII has been murdered. Mike vows vengeance against to caution of his friend Homicide Captain Pat Chambers. Pat must work inside the law, but Mike is a private detective who has a ticket to carry a gun and is not bound by any laws.A novel filled with violence, sex, murder, hatred, and the evil of drugs Mike fights and claws his way through the barbed wire of emotions to find the killer. In doing so the reader is never allow to draw a breath in relaxation.I, JURY is non-stop action with no holds barred.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"This is your stereotypical hardboiled private eye type, or part of the mould from which many of the latter day variety have poured forth.Mike Hammer solves his problems with a gun, a fist or two, and many bizarre turns of phrase and thought.

This is the milieu anyone who has a vague inkling of MS's MH automatically conjures. & it's the setting where the world 1st meets private cop MH. There's the babe: Myrna, & MH's old army pal Jack Williams. The cops see a routine case. MH senses sadism & describes it to Pat Chambers, his cop buddy, & captain of the local precinct. It is only at the evidence of sadism that MH makes his famous vow: \`He won't sit on the chair. He won't hang. He will die exactly as you died, with a .45 slug in the gut, just a little below the belly button. No matter who it is, Jack, I'll get the one. Remember, no matter who it is, I promise.' Or this: \`You're a cop, Pat. You're tied down by rules and regulations. There's someone over you. I'm alone. I can slap someone in the puss and they can't do a damn thing. No one can kick me out of my job. Maybe there's nobody to put up a huge fuss if I get gunned down, but then I still have a private cop's license with the privilege to pack a rod, and they're afraid of me. I hate hard, Pat. When I latch on to the one behind this they're going to wish they hadn't started it. Some day, before long, I'm going to have my rod in my mitt and the killer in front of me. I'm going to watch the killer's face. I'm going to plunk one right in his gut, and when he's dying on the floor I may kick his teeth out.' This is where we get the 1st rift between the genre's formalities & MS's new take on things. As with many prior crime books this 1 has its own \`society party'. This is where MH scopes out a typical lineup of possible murderers: the sexpot Bellemy twins- Mary (who lacks the birthmark, but later gets nailed by MH) & Esther (the non-nympho)- rich playgirls with nothing to lose; the sobbing Myrna- a recovering smack addict; Charlotte Manning- the wealthy psychiatrist-cum-goddess-cum-fianc&eacute;e-cum-drug dealer-cum-killer; Hal Kines- a playboy college boy who turns out to be a plastic surgically altered pimp & drug dealer; & George Kalecki- a shady rich man with a dark past MH knows all too well.But, the inevitable get-together of all the chief suspects at another party does not result in the revelation of the suspect- although Mike hammers Mary Bellemy. Yes, there are classic elements in the book- the death of innocents (Jack Williams, Myrna, Bobo Hopper), gratuitous but entertaining brawling, MH seeing his fair share of gorgeous pussy, plot turns galore- the prime suspects (Kines & Kalecki) turn out to be red herrings, & MH's monomania for justice/vengeance. The clues slowly sort themselves out for MH. The book's denouement, now classic- & almost trite, after later imitations, had to have been a scorcher back in the day.This book lays the template: 1) nasty quotables, 2) MH's cat-n-mouse love for Velda, 3) his \`partnership' with Pat, 4) his overall character, 5) the sex & gore, & 6) the crescendos at novel's end- which reached its climax 2 books later. On a scale of 1-100 I will give MS's books 2 ratings- the 1st is for its excellence in the genre, & the 2nd is for its literary value- regardless of its genre.In genre I rate I, The Jury a 97 out of 100- it's just so classic & archetypal. Yes, some elements saw MH improve upon in the later books, but this was the great \`break' from those who came before. As pure literature I'd give it a good solid 88 out of 100. There are too many nods that tie it to the genre to rate it as highly as I do in-genre, but there are too many positives to not admit this is an excellent book- better than anything Dickens or Tolstoy ever penned.Now that I've limned the book's tale let me criticize it in a wider context. In many ways, much of what critics said about MS, MH, & this book was absolutely true. They just mistook those qualities- acts of violence, titillation, machismo, narrative rapidity, archetypes- for their negative counterparts: wanton violence, pornography, sexism, shallowness, & stereotypes. Part of the reason, I believe, that this error in judgment occurred was for the very reason that MS WAS SO GOOD at what he did. Were he not critics would not have bothered with it- but they kept coming back to pummel this book as if they really knew that it hit a primal nerve with an America that understood such entertainment (yes, art) at a fundamentally visceral level at odds with the gentlemanly art of dialectical criticism. It reminds 1 of the silly- & now obviously ridiculous- pummelings that Impressionist paintings 1st got- that is, the critics knew that the art they were weaned on was soon going to be obviated by this newer type of art that was at once \`more realistic' & more mythic."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Mike Hammer was an alcoholic, a brutal fighter, a bully with a short temper, and he carried a loaded gun. He was also a racist, a sexist, a homophobe and thought his way was the only way. He was, in short, what inexperienced 16-year old boys wanted to be in 1950. Gorgeous women threw themselves at him, pleading for his--his whatever. He had plenty of money, although no one seemed to be paying him. His \\"heap\\" (automobile) looked shabby but it had a powerful, souped-up engine. What more could one ask?For one thing, reality. That was the missing ingredient. In this book, Hammer's best pal, an ex-cop, is murdered, and Hammer is devastated. So is the murdered pal's girlfriend, an ex-drug addict. Hammer spends a lot of time drinking, driving and drooling as he goes after the murder--but there is no mention of a funeral for the pal. Funerals are reality, and Mickey Spillane didn't bother with such trivialities. I give this as but one example.Still, there is a certain pleasure in reading Spillane, if only for his literary style. He didn't invent the staccato sentence sequences, but he certainly was master of them.\\"I, the Jury\\" followed the Dashiell Hammet books and others. Mike Hammer wasn't exactly an original, just an exaggeration of it. Unfortunately, one of Spillane's books is enough to satisfy my thirst for another 50 years or so."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Truly, truly bad... If you want good noir, see, Hammett or Chandler (both pof the Macdonalds are great too). Spillane simply does not know how to write: the prose is awful, the murderer managed to be both obvious and utterly implausible, the main character is an egotistical brute with no redeeming values. Very unpleasant to read.If you must read Spillane, you might try his later work--its possible he learned to write in his later years..."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"If you are looking for hardboiled detective fiction, Mickey Spillane's I, THE JURY is the place to start. Spillane's Mike Hammer is as brutal and uncompromising as they come. There's nothing weak about this book, and the conclusion is so suprising, so shocking, that it will leave you with a powerful, but guilty, sense of vindication."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"This was Spillane's first book - and what a book! Mike Hammer's war buddy is taunted and murdered and Mike vows to bring the killer to justice. He smashes his way to a conclusion you won't soon forget. After you read this one, try the next 6 - All Hammer stories with the exception of &quot;The Long Wait.&quot; At one time all of Spillane's first 7 books were listed in the all time top 10 best sellers. There's a reason for that - read them and find out."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Make no bones about it: this is definitely one of the best detective novels ever written, but not only that. It is also a piece of art, beautifully told, with characters that are hard to forget, and scenes that must have made Norman Rockwell shudder with disgust. It is also, more by accident than purposely it seems, a description of the underbelly of American society after World War II, when U.S. power was at its peak and the American way of life seemed to leave nothing to be desired.Trying to find out who killed his best friend, Mike Hammer ruthlessly punches, kicks, and shoots himself through the mesh of thugs, pimps, racketeers, and femme fatales, that pave his way before he can finally nail down the murderer. His methods are brutal and totally inconsistent with even the most lenient interpretations of the law. Along the way, he meets a host of the most beautiful and attractive bombshells ever to grace the pages of a novel, not without getting a little closer to at least some of the most beguiling ones of these kittens. Despite his apparent disregard for rules, norms, and morals, deep down Hammer is a very decent and honorable man. Loyalty means everything to him; he treats doormen and elevator attendants with respect; and he even refuses to sleep with his soon-to-be wife before they officially seal their commitment. He even doesn't think anything of having a drink at the bar of a friend, who, incidentially, happens to be a black man.As far as violence goes, Hammer sure doesn't shy away from it. Neither does he seem to dislike it all that much. However, he never resorts to it without a purpose. It's a means to an end, namely, to make the murderer of his friend pay and to finally bring about justice. The latter would not be served if not for Hammer taking the law in his own hands. \\"No jury would ever convict you on that, would they? ... We won't have to worry about a smart lawyer cracking our chains of circumstance and making them look foolish to a jury ... No, I am the jury now, and the judge, and I have a promise to keep\\".The extent to which Spillane was despised by the 40s literary critics in particular and the then dominant voices of public opinion in general is not hard to imagine. I don't believe he would fare much better today; a statement like \\"you no longer had the social instinct of a woman - that of being dependent upon a man\\" would not go too well in today's politically overcorrect society. Well, I don't give a damn - to me Mike Hammer is an honest, straightforward, and down-to-earth character, just as I, The Jury is an unpretentious and sincere effort by its writer to make a buck. This, I guess, he did, and, incidentially, he created a great work of American fiction. You'r a good man, and I believe we all should have a whiskey or two to your health. Here's to you, Mickey.(I have come across the \\"Unofficial Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer Site\\" - it's the best web page on this topic and about the best site on the whole world wide web)."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"I'm not trying to be sexist, just realistic. I, the Jury, is outstanding reading. Spillane is in top form with this one, and the story is strong and riveting. But there is a good deal of sex and violence, and things were certainly a lot different when Mr. Spillane wrote this. Don't look for any politically correct jargon or attitudes, and don't hope for a happy ending, because you'll be disappointed on both counts. But if you want a good read, and you want something that is WAY different than any stories being published today, buy this book."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"\\"I, the Jury\\" is not really a mystery. It is a \\"vendetta Eastern\\" in the same pattern as the Clint Eastwood vendetta Westerns (\\"A Fistful of Dollars,\\" \\"A Few Dollars More,\\" \\"Hang 'em High,\\" etc.) In the opening pages of the book, Mike Hammer stands over the body of his slain comrade and swears terrible vengeance on the killer. Then he embarks upon a series of crimes which should have garnered him several life sentences. When the last house is burgled, the last head broken, and the last killing perpetrated, I was left wondering the same thing I wondered at the conclusion of the Dirty Harry movie \\"Magnum Force.\\" How's the \\"hero\\" gonna explain all this to the police?"},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Filled with thrills and twists this is mickey spillane at his best. A great mystery story which can be read in one sitting either in bed or when travelling.I could give you details but then it wouldnt be a mystery would it."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Mike Hammer has never been told so boldly, so brazenly as he was here by the master of the dime novel mystery, Mickey Spillane. This should be standard reading for any man's man as well as standard fair on any pure study of American literature. Mickey Spillane's prose ranks at the highest of its form, bar none, and there are very few novels that narrative points come down to the last sentence of the book.This is a must for any serious fan of mystery fiction, whether you prefer your private eyes hard-boiled or not, and this should be on any serious men's literature list.Trust me. &quot;It was easy.&quot;"},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Mike Hammer is the classic hard-bitten private detective. He talks hard, he fights hard and when it comes to love he falls fast and hard. Nothing at all is held back in this highly charged murder case that cuts straight to Hammer's core.The tough, no-nonsense Hammer is faced with the cruel shooting murder of Jack Williams, a close friend, and takes it hard. In front of Pat Chambers, another good friend who just happens to be the Captain of Homicide, he vows that when he catches the murderer he would gladly shoot him in the gut, just like Williams had been. The case quickly becomes a race between Hammer and Chambers, as Hammer is determined to have his vengeance.This is hardboiled detective fiction as it should be. There are no qualms when it comes to violence, no regrets over shooting the bad guys, whisky is swallowed easily in one swallow and the dames are kept begging for more. We charge from suspect to suspect watching Hammer extract information under threat of violence, and following through on the threat whenever necessary. Moving at breakneck speed, the bodies pile up while Hammer finds himself falling in love. It makes for terrific reading for lovers of the hardboiled detective genre."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"This was better than I expected and is a thoroughly compelling read. It was every bit as lurid as advertised, but is generally a very close cousin to Raymond Chandler's Marlowe novels in character and tone, though the plotting is much less convoluted and we don't get quite as entangled with secondary characters or setting. Spillane emphasizes Mike Hammer's incredible toughness and verility on every page, with all the usual gumshoe vernacular, and as with the best detective novels, character counts more than crime. That's a polite way of saying I figured this one out pretty early, despite trying hard not to, and it didn't diminish the reading experience at all.Spillane has the last laugh on his critics- this is good stuff."},{"Title":"I, The Jury","review":"Mike, slow down, buddy.

You want them to feel themselves dying. You want to watch.You can use a little therapy, Mike, but I suppose we all can. And let me say this: if we're going to pick sides here, I want you on my side. You're a tough cookie. You put the hard in hard-boiled. You shove your way around the city, tossing bad guys and girls in the gutter where they belong. And who knows more than you that there are plenty of them bums to go around. They're on every street corner, in every alley, under every rock.You use women, too, Mike. You play them like a musician playing the scales. Up and down. You bring them up, they fall for you, then you drop them down - hard. Sometimes you're soft, but most times you're rough, and they like it when you're rough - the rougher the better. But there is one dame who plucks your strings, Mr. Hammer - Velda, your secretary. You almost tossed her overboard in this one, Mike. I was surprised. But look who she was up against - Ms. Perfect - body and all.Yeah, you're crazy as a loon. You're wound up tighter than the rubber bands on the inside of a golf ball. But I feel safer when you're around, Mike. I sleep better, too, knowing there's one pug out there who's looking out for the little guy. You got class, buddy. It's not polished bright and shiny on the outside, like a knight in shining armor, it's deep inside where no one can see it. That's because if they saw how much you cared then they'd know something about you, and that would be a flaw, right, big guy?

But once you are past the beginner stage, you will leave them behind. After all, you didn't keep the training wheels on your bike after you learned to ride, did you? And wouldn't it be embarrassing to do a \\"professional reading\\" if the client could see you were taking the meanings off phrases printed on the cards?There are hundreds (or thousands?) of decks out there, but 99% can be eliminated off the bat. It may be fun to collect cards with cute pixies, cats, druids, witches, classic cars etc. but to do serious readings for other people, you want a better image. You really want to avoid skull obsessions, vampires with dripping fangs, \\"Dark\\" decks, or anything that looks like it might have come from a poster over the bed of a 14 year old.The Marseille Deck from Fournier is actually a modern deck based on the most popular traditional tarot existing before Mr. Waite came out with his excellent deck for beginners. The actual historical Marseille decks were rather crudely illustrated with blocky woodcut style images. The Fournier version is true to the original shapes, but is redrawn for modern printing methods. They have added color backgrounds that are in accord with the elemental meanings of the minor cards. Unlike most modern decks, the colors do not \\"flash\\" or clash. They are muted complementary colors that blend harmoniously when spread on the table. They make it easy to tell at a glance which cards are strong or weak according to association.I truly believe this is the most beautiful and appropriate deck of all for a professional reader. It is both modern and traditional with a perfect balance between being colorful and restrained. It is \\"symbolic\\" rather than \\"pictorial\\". \\"Pictoral\\" decks wrongfully highlight the individual cards as standalone units, whereas a symbolic interpretation takes into account the way the spread works together as a whole. There is a theory of interpretation based on the geometric arrangement of the pips. This art has been lost to modern literature, but study of this deck might be a good way to recapture it.(Post script: Since posting this review, I have found a few books that describes meanings for the arrangement, flowers, leaves, etc. on the Marseille pip cards. Some would be Le tarot de Marseille. by Paul Marteau andLa Via Del Tarotby Jodorowsky.)The only thing I can say negative about this deck is that the back patterns are a bit bland. These are good quality coated cards, but they are of only medium thickness. They are not like some of the really thick and heavily coated decks from US Playing cards, but they hold their shape well in heavy use. I think you will find them satisfactory."},{"Title":"Le Tarot de Marseille (The Tarot of Marseilles) Tarot Card Deck (French Edition)","review":"Everyone I know LOVES this deck, and people who don't love it LIKE it, but they were looking for something else anyway... Le Tarot De Marseille by Fournier is brightly coloured, unique unto itself, and therefore works best without being compared to traditional editions. It's Great!"},{"Title":"Le Tarot de Marseille (The Tarot of Marseilles) Tarot Card Deck (French Edition)","review":"Vividly colored and traditionally illustrated, this Tarot is ideal for those who prefer the Marseille style. It is rather difficult to obtain a copy here in the USA. The faces of the cards is in French only, that I prefer. The instruction books are multi-lingual. Basic meanings of each card are given with only sketchy details of the depths beyond. I would not advise a beginner to try reading from this pack initially.This edition is wonderful collectors and Tarot historians. It provides more than just the simple woodcuts of the earlier editions. Color and depth give this pack that extra touch of magic. Reading these cards are a joy because the suites have colored backgrounds, making them easy to distinguish. Knowledge of the traditional interpretations help. My personal readings are accurate each time I lay them out accordingly.I can see why the the 18th C. occultists were so impressed by these images. I dreamt of this deck 5 years ago. It is more like a river of the subconcious. The Tarot rarely tells me of future event, rather a couse of action to be taken. To serious Tarot students, find a deck if you can. Or better yet, let them find you!"},{"Title":"Sex and the Married Girl: From Clicking to Climaxing - The Truth About Modern Marriage","review":"Mandi Norwood is an angry woman. Through the lens of resolute feminism, Norwood presents a venomously skewed scenario of modern marriage and relationships. Blatantly anti-establishment, she balks at traditions such as taking one's husband's name, nurturing and caring for one's family, and taking on the responsibility of creating a healthy home environment. Her tone is perpetually pissed off--a shock to those of us who are happy in our relationships, engagements, or marriages. Perhaps Norwood should have titled her book \\"The Complete Guide to My Pessimistic Outlook on Modern Marriage.\\""},{"Title":"Sex and the Married Girl: From Clicking to Climaxing - The Truth About Modern Marriage","review":"First off, this book is not about sex, it's about marriage, so don't waste your money if you're looking for sex tips. In any case, Mandi Norwood utterly disapproves of sex advice for women (but more on that later).The purpose of this book is to teach new-millennium wives how to act like 1950's husbands - only I truly doubt if 1950's husbands were quite as selfish, thoughtless and utterly inconsiderate as this book suggests wives should be.Offered a job on the other side of the world? Don't discuss it with your husband, just go home and tell him you're taking it regardless of what he thinks. He can either come with you or get lost. Feel like taking a year off to travel the world (using your joint savings to do it?). Don't ask him how he feels about the impact on your finances or how it might affect your future plans. Just give him a list of places you're going. Invite him along, sure, but don't make out you give a damn either way. And let him know that your destinations of choice are non-negotiable. If he has places he wants to go \`you can talk about that'. Feel like having an affair? Go for it. Society says this is OK for husbands (apparently - though that's news to me) so it's OK for wives too.I think when most people get married they have at least some intention of making the other person happy. But to Mandi Norwood this is not only irrelevant but wrong. Redbook magazine had the temerity to publish tips for women on how to be terrific in bed. How dare they! Who cares whether your husband enjoys your sex life? The only important thing is that you do. (Quite a risky position to take when three weeks without sex is portrayed by one of Norwood's friends as grounds for divorce.)Showing you care for your husband, or showing him any kind of loyalty, is portrayed as hopelessly outdated. If his brother's wife is leaving him, get on the phone and give her advice on how to get the best divorce settlement. And always remember, his mother is the enemy. (Actually all women over 45 are utterly contemptible sell-outs according to Mandi).The start of the book is full of women expressing their reservations about marriage and why they were reluctant to do it. It's never explained, anywhere, why they did, or why anyone would. The unbearably self-satisfied Norwood (who throughout the book seems to think all women are just like her) says:\\"My life plan was pretty much this: junior writer, features editor, global travel, buy own home, become an editor in chief, get married and have kids. I was prepared to take or leave the final two.\\"I bet her husband was thrilled to read that. But it would be REALLY interesting to know why someone as independently minded as Norwood ultimately decided to get hitched. It's never explained. Why, Ms Norwood, do independent women still get married in this day and age? What's the attraction? Particularly for you and your friends - after all, if you believe all you should care about is yourself, why make a commitment to another person? If it's total self-centred independence you want, why not stay single? That could have made an interesting chapter or two but somehow it just doesn't occur to Norwood to address it.The book finishes with a discussion of the \`death fantasy' where modern married women apparently daydream about what it would be like if their husbands were dead. Sure, they'd be upset, (kind of) but in a lot of ways, it's actually quite a nice thought, isn't it girls? That pretty much sums up the book."},{"Title":"Sex and the Married Girl: From Clicking to Climaxing - The Truth About Modern Marriage","review":"i'm a women in the army and have 2 kids with my husbanded. he lets me do what i went in the point of letting me chase my dreams. and yes i keep my own last name. i like it. but i still keep in mined that my husbanded and kids have feeling to. so when i read this book it pissed me off. if this book is about married girl of today. why dos it sounded like a women that need to get a divorce and anger mangment class. i think if u want to be anger at the world and are ready to leave your husband then this book is for u."},{"Title":"Sex and the Married Girl: From Clicking to Climaxing - The Truth About Modern Marriage","review":"I'm getting married next year, and I've read alot of books related to marriage and planning weddings, and this was the worst waste of them all.

She never talks about finding what's right for yourself, you either worship Norwood, or you belong in your mothers generation and are doomed to pain misery.

This book emphasizes \\"me\\" over \\"we\\" at every turn. It completley omits the idea that a woman might want to put her job on hiatus while her children are young. In fact, it suggests getting a nanny so you don't have to deal with them at all. To summerize, love your children, but aviod a real relationship with them. Same goes for the rest of your family. You can't go to your mother for advice. She either, \\"lost her identity to that of 'the little wife'\\" or \\"swallowed the Superwoman ideal and collapsed under the pressure...\\" (p. 10) Your husband is an inferior life form, according to this book. He must be domesticated with negative reinforcement. The book suggests standing in the middle of the room and yelling until you get what you want. Extra points for swearing. Otherwise, you will be taken for granted. Effective, but not well thought out. Then there's the section on how affairs can help your marriage. If you're a conservative Christian, you wont like the chapter about why you need to sleep around to help decide who you should marry. It seems everthing Cosmo and Redbook says about nice ways to show your man what you want in bed is just a waste of time to this woman. It's more efficient to find one who already knows.This book is all about life with a roomate you happen to have sex with, not a marriage. I gave it two stars because there were a few things I agreed with, such as not giving your husband ultimatums and it is important not to lose yourself in your marriage (or job, or anything else in life) but I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. I'd be very disappionted if I had spent the money.I would suggest this book to someone who doesn't like her husband and wants him to spend all his time in the bar.

I believe that historically wives have been given the shaft, and that a cultural shift in this regard is a positive thing. But her solutions to these issues were utterly laughable to me. Marriage is a partnership where both husband and wife should work hard to please, sacrifice when needed, cheer each other on, and aid each other in their individual and mutual goals-- and above all, love unconditionally. Amazingly, the ideas of the author seemed incredibly outdated-- like a throw-back to 1990s' feminism. (And I should know! I have a minor in Women's Studies from the 90s.) Hey, I'm all for feminism, but I do not believe in the notion of elevating one gender over the other. Haven't we moved beyond that initial knee-jerk reaction and realized that equality and mutual respect is the better, more mature response? I don't think we need to create the same kind of environment for men in marriage that women of generations past had to endure. Two wrongs do not make a right. We need a fresh, new model for marriage in which both participants are actively engaged in making the relationship work-- not some \\"to hell with you!\\" model that is as old as the hills and never did anyone any good.

Fascism is posited as Enlightenment turned against itself (it must be noted Adorno & Horkheimer were among the first to state this, even if it is somewhat of a cliche now). Enlightenment's general instrumental reason knows only power as a measure of behavior. Therefore, it cannot tolerate the existence of groups that thrive, yet never have power, such as Jews and women. Whenever Enlightened society fails to satisfy the needs of its members, their anger is turned against such groups.\\"In summary: Fascist anti-semitism was the result of the Enlightenment's \\"instrumental reason\\".But this is of course absurd. German Christianity has a long history of anti-semitism extending much farther back than the 18th century, at least to Martin Luther's well-known violent anti-semitism. Hitler attacked the Jews in the name of Christianity, not in the name (say) of Enlightenment deism. His world-view and rationale were drawn from the theories of distinct national or cultural \\"races\\", theories that sprouted and flourished as part of Romanticism's rejection of the rationality and trans-nationalism of the Enlightenment.So Germany's (and in fact, Christianity's) long history of anti-semitism, along with the tendency of *any* society in distress to vent its anxiety by attacking a vulnerable minority, is a sufficient and historically adequate explanation for Nazi anti-semitism.But Adorno and Horkheimer invite us to attribute Fascist anti-semitism to \\"Enlightenment's\\" inability to tolerate groups that are (paradoxically) both powerless and (despite being powerless) thriving. \\"Enlightenment\\" doesn't like powerless people because it supposedly \\"knows only power as a measure of behavior\\". Basically, \\"Enlightenment\\" wants to kill you because it doesn't like the way you part your hair.The book is full of this kind of false, nasty nonsense, wrapped up in sweeping generalizations couched in vague terms such as \\"reason\\", \\"power\\", etc. So, as a work of philosophy or history or social analysis, it is, well, rubbish. In terms of philosophical merit, as well as authorial rage and despair, its most recent contemporary equivalent is the Unibomb Manifesto.But it is also historically important rubbish. This book is the seminal work of (philosophical) post-modernism. If, for whatever reason, you are looking for the place where \\"Critical Theory\\" and post-modern epistemic relativism first emerged into the light of day, then this is the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Wow. A must read by any student of critial thought"},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This is a book that should change the way the average American thinks. Yes, it is not the easiest book to read and the authors' main ideas are not always readily apparent and schematically laid out. It will take you time to pry them out of the long and densely worded paragraphs that make up the sections of this work, but if you do take the time and expend the mental effort to make sense of what Adorno and Horkheimer are saying, then you will be in for a REAL intellectual adventure because the critical method on display here and the conclusions offered are nothing short of subversive in the positive sense of the word and are therefore truly thought-provoking. Their quasi-Marxist critical approach does an impressive job of standing our analytical habits on their head. It reconfigures the customary Anglo-American way of dealing with subjects and their related controversies, which is to say, when you are reading this book you can say bye-bye to our usual dichotomizing, either/or modes of analysis as you are ushered into the quickly shifting world of dialectical thinking. Make no mistake about it--these are some extremely busy pages, and when you read them you will alternate between being confused and astonished at how much is going on and how many ideas are simultaneously in play in any given paragraph or its constituent sentences.This is apt to make us suspicious at first precisely because it is so foreign to what we as Americans regard as analysis. Our habit is to reduce problems to sets of antithetical principles and then we quietly assume each set to be real and concrete--conservative vs. liberal, traditional vs. progressive, science vs. magic, mythological vs. enlightened, intellectual vs. anti-intellectual, autocratic vs. democratic, autonomous vs. heteronomous, etc.--but our reification of these principles and their standing connections with prevailing modes of production and exchange are what these Frankfurt School authors expose in their treatments of (so-called) enlightenment thinking and how these factors are intertwined in the areas of myth, morality, mass culture, and anti-Semitism.The basic thesis of the book is that the traditional categories of bourgeois intellectual history are ideological constructs that tell us only half the story. We think of Western thought as progressing from mythological modes of thinking to an outlook that is more rational, scientific, and thus enlightened, but what their analyses seek to demonstrate is that instead of a steady linear progression from myth to enlightenment rationality what we have is a situation in which the two opposing categories are closer to each other than one might suppose. The modern bourgeois thinker assumes that all is rationality and light in his camp, but Adorno and Horkheimer argue that (a) enlightenment thinking is as inescapably 'mythological' as any of the pre-scientific worldviews to which it feels superior and (b) how that conceit has played an instrumental role in the increasing violence, domination, and deception that characterize the 'civilized barbarism' of modern industrial societies. Their analytical results, even if they are not wholly convincing to some readers, are astonishing in their subtlety and implications, and if you read these essays attentively you will never think about these subjects again in the same way as you did before.As an example of the way in which this critical method is employed, take our lazy American habit of dividing people up into either conformists or non-conformists. We take such a seemingly neat and definite division for granted, and we assume that it is just a matter of pointing out which is the more coherent, honest, and therefore justifiable attitude to adopt. But Adorno and Horkheimer show that these two labels do not correspond to two separate and distinct realities/truths, but rather each is but an aspect or manifestation of a more fundamental human problem, i.e. that of Hegelian/Marxist alienation, an inescapable condition of separation and incompleteness that continues to twist and turn in our society at any given time. Critically speaking, it is not the case that it is better to be one or the other because the problem of alienation is not solvable either by a robust conformism or by an equally calculated non-conformist spirit. On the contrary, each is but a symptom of something wrong and unaddressed in the life of any society, namely, those deeper issues of perennial import, the traditional stuff of philosophic and religious concern that have to do with us as whole beings and not just as disembodied, rationalizing minds, totalitarian and/or fascist vitalists, bourgeois capitalists, ideological contrarians, bohemian radicals, philistine reactionaries, etc. The latter are examples of the attitudes that reflect our more fundamental human state of alienation, the social masks of ideology that we unthinkingly don and then in turn mistake for the face of reality.Critical theory is devoted to leaving no stone unturned in the criticism of thought and culture, and it professes the ideal of never ceasing in that endeavor. In the case of a problem like social alienation it is the critical theorist's task to probe ever deeper into the social realities of our culture and to subject these to ruthless examinations which, while the efforts in themselves are never entirely free of ideological determinations, they still have as one of their own critical goals to become conscious of any underlying ideological factors in what is supposed to be a process of analytical self-emancipation. Yet it is arguable as to whether the critical theorists and their disciples have remained true to these ideals because since the 1930s we have seen the work (if not the individual life) of each of its practitioners decompose into various radical left-wing viewpoints that have remained highly influential (if not inflexible) in some academic and/or artistic circles, but conversion to its particular point of view is certainly not the point of this book. Think of these essays as a collection of 'thought experiments' in the Frankfurt school critical method, and the results as dialectical stepping stones on the way to a critical work that by its very nature can never be final.It is a widespread but shallow opinion to write off the Frankfurt School thinkers as MERE Marxists or even as neo-Marxist revisionists, and Adorno's writings in particular, though complex and multifaceted, reveal him to be rooted firmly in the German tradition of idealist philosophy. Marxist ideas are important to him, but over and above the critical concepts they furnish for his books and essays and the role they played in the formation of his method of 'negative dialectics', the guiding figure for him is always Kant with whom he shares an inextinguishable concern for what in today's rarefying intellectual parlance might be labeled as 'metaphilosophical' issues: how human freedom and personal autonomy are inextricably bound together in a seeking that must go beyond the categories of any rationalist epistemology and the bare material facts of common history in order to illuminate and safeguard those things that make us human and which come from the directions we might least suspect."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"The dialectic of Enlightenment is a history of false appearances. For Adorno & Horkheimer, trying to explain the world in its totality is equal to try to dominate it. Totality becomes totalitarianism. The authors present history as a tool of domination. Myth and reason both hide the deception of trying to make all things equal. By this logic -of identity/identification- everything is not, but must be the same. Knowledge is mythical because it promises a happiness that can never be achieved in knowledge's terms. The central argument of this wonderful book is that myth is already enlightenment because it tries to explain the world and gain utility from it; and enlightenment is already myth for it tries to exclude anything that is different or contradicts Enlightened Reason. As Adorno & Horkheimer put it: \\"Enlightenment has a mythical horror to myth.\\" Enlightenment obsessively tries to free itself from myth, but in doing so it becomes also mythical. This obsession takes the form of a saturating, technical rationality that ends in the horror of ethnic genocide.

It is a handy volume , rich in content and weaved with lenghthy sentences. It was an outcome of shock given by the Nazi forces. Nevertheless a thought about direct results of extreme reasoning, radical socialization and discovery of motives behind humanity's retrogression instead of progressive civilization.The urge to reach the technological zenith started in that crucial period. Demonstration of destruction of masses with atom bomb was yet to kick off. But the terror started shaking the two intellectuals. Again and again they questioned themselves. Conclusion was insight - social freedom is inseparable from the enlightened thought.The need for enlightenement was to create a civil society with rationalised idea grows in individuals and institutions. Not just the rational consciousness. What was needed that time is to deparate fear from fate. But with modern science , commerece and politics, it endd in a fear of social deviation.Enlightenement is as equally destructive as that of romanticism. The self of enlightened being itself comes in to life only when it surrender to its enemy. It refuses to transcend the false absoulte in reality. The book is clearly classified in to five simple segmental chapters which deal with the metamorphosis of modernity. It is a critical study with myth is already an enlightenment and enlightenment reverts to mythology as the basic premises. For the authours, Homerian odyssey is the main target to show the dialecic of myth and enlightenment. Odyssey was accused as the earliest representative testimonies of western bourgeois civiliztion. Kant, Sade and Nietzsche were not spared. Adorno and Horkheimer show how the submission of everthing natural to the autocratic subject finally culminates in the mastery of the blindly objective and natural. Kant and Sade's idea were branded 'bourgeois thought' and accused of morality mixd with amorality.First chapter deals with how myth is already an enlightenment. Second one shows the reverse of enlightenment to mythology. Third, projects the submission of subject which makes the object a master. Fourth, &quot;culture industry&quot; brings out the process where enlightenment is ideaogized. Fifth chapter traces the movement of humanity to barbarism.It is a thorough thrasing of enlightenment. They understand that extreme enlightened self is as dangerous as that of fully radiant earth which radiates disaster triumphant.One have to undergo an intellectual torture to read this book.

Through a highly sophisticated, nuanced analysis of Ancient Greek Myth (with a particularly fascinating exegesis on Homer), Horkheimer and Adorno proceed to interrogate the logics of key Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant and Sade in an effort to further interrogate the \\"culture industry.\\" Standout analyses of the text include the chapter on anti-semitism and the limits of enlightenment as well as enlightenment as mass deception.

Drawing on their own work on the &quot;culture industry&quot;, as well as the ideas of the key thinkers of the Enlightenment project, (Descartes, Newton, Kant) Horkheimer and Adorno explain how the Enlightenment's orientation towards rational calculability and man's domination of a disenchanted nature evinces a reversion to myth, and is responsible for the reified structures of modern administered society, which has grown to resemble a new enslavement. Furthermore, Horkheimer's and Adorno's treatise was one of the most ambitious attempts to synthesise Marxist economic analysis with Freudian psychoanalysis, and is developed with much complexity and skill. Their philosophical and psychological critique of the Enlightenment concepts of reason and nature (which they identify as the loci of domination) spans almost the entire history of Western thought up until recent times, from Homer to Nietzsche. The book was written in 1944, during a phase of the war when the threat of Fascist victory still hung ominously over Europe, and when Horkheimer and Adorno themselves had to flee Germany to America. &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; thus represents one of the most pessimistic strands of Marxist thought, giving up all expectations of a people's revolution in Western Europe. This was, in addition to the outbreak of the Second World War, due to the meteoric rise of extremely right-wing reactionary parties in the twenties, and their subsequent popularity, which ruled out by fiat any chance of a popular support for the left. The proletariat, instead of embracing the cause of the people's revolution, opted to give their vote to the Fascists. In their psychoanalytic investigation of this phenomena, Horkheimer and Adorno identify the rise of Fascism with the return of the repressed."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This Amazon page is a disaster.

In fact, all of the reviews predate the publication of the new translation.By all means read the Dialectic of Enlightenment! But be sure to use only the new translation published by Stanford."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"These comments refer to the old Continuum edition, NOT to the Stanford edition, which is a fine translation ...While not wishing to detract from what has been said about the importance of this book, it is worth mentioning that the English translation is scandalously bad and in need of replacement. I've had occasion to make extensive comparisons between the German original and the translation and the results are not encouraging. Much is simply flat-out wrong (e.g., sometimes the translator mistakes one German word for another) even more is unnecessarily clumsy. While Horkheimer and Adorno adopted a rather dense style of writing, nothing they produced is quite as cumbersome as what readers of this translation have had to endure.One can sympathize with the translator -- he did the translation at a time when very little by Horkheimer and Adorno was in English and it appears that he worked under a rather tight schedule (it is possible to find errors piling up on a page and then suddenly ceasing -- suggesting that the poor fellow took a break and came back later on, with happier results). But there is no forgiving the publisher for leaving this text uncorrected for so long despite a long-standing consensus among students of the Frankfurt School that this is a deeply flawed translation. That anything of the power of the original makes it through the muck of this translation is a testimony to the force of Horkheimer and Adorno's ideas.A new translation is long overdue. Until then, readers coming to the work of the Frankfurt School might want to seek out Max Horkheimer's Eclipse of Reason, a summary of the argument elaborated here which Horkheimer delivered in English at Columbia University at about the same time of as the publication of the German original of this book."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, the editor of the Stanford edition of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT, has taken a dense, difficult book and made it more work to read. Horkheimer and Adorno's \\"philosophical fragments\\" reward the reader not only with sustained analyses of capitalist culture, but also with pithy one-liners worthy of the authors' role as the philosophical Statler and Waldorf heckling Euro-American civilization. But Noerr's pedantry constantly gets in their way and yours.The edition has two problems: insufficient translation and worse-than-useless endnotes. First, the translation. Edmund Jephcott does what I can only assume is an admirable job translating (nearly) all of the original German into English. Unfortunately, he does not translate the French, the Latin, or the Greek (though, to his credit, he does render the latter in the Roman alphabet). That would be fine if I read those three languages, but I don't, and neither do most Anglophone readers of this book. Classicists aren't the major audience for Frankfurt School culture criticism, so you'd think that Noerr would do us a favor and get somebody to translate the dead languages with the living. Nein. When Horkheimer and Adorno quote Seneca, you're on your own.Second, the endnotes: never have so many endnotes been of so little use to so many readers. Noerr preserves H & A's original endnotes, putting them not at the end of each fragment, but at the end of the book. Fair enough. But interlarded among these are Noerr's much more copious endnotes, with their own numbering system, notes that deal almost entirely with the publication history of variant editions of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT. What percentage of readers wants this information? Ten? Five? Anybody writing a dissertation on this book is reading it in German anyway, and has the different editions ready to hand. To a general audience, these textual notes are clutter. Putting them in a different location within the book would at least have spared readers the labor of sorting through them.Were these the only endnotes that Noerr provided, one could ignore them altogether (difficult, considering their ubiquity on the page). But Noerr sometimes provides content-related notes--for example, explaining the idiom \\"white trash\\" as a \\"derogatory expression for white workers\\" (267). So all that Latin, all that Greek, and all that French Noerr left for you to puzzle out on your own, but when a familiar American English idiom appears in a book published by an American university press, Noerr opens the lantern shutter and dazzles us.A second example should convey the stunning inutility of Noerr's endnotes. On page 102 appears this sentence: \\"Even before Zanuck acquired her, Saint Bernadette gleamed in the eye of her writer as an advert aimed at all the relevant consortia.\\" This is the first time either name appears in the book. Now, a great many readers of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT are students of mass culture who will at least recognize producer Darryl F. Zanuck's last name as connected to Hollywood, if not to 20th Century Fox. But in case we don't, Noerr helpfully supplies a note saying as much. But Saint Bernadette? No endnote. Noerr does not tell us that she was 1) a 19th century Frenchwoman canonized for her visions of the Virgin Mary, or that she was 2) the subject of a now-forgotten 1942 bestseller, or that 3) 20th Century Fox produced a film adaptation of the novel in 1943, a film that netted four academy awards, despite being forgotten in subsequent decades.My question is this: who is so steeped in Hollywood lore that he or she can follow Horkheimer and Adorno's oblique, dated reference here--to a 1940s hagiography exploited by a big-five studio into a successful but forgotten biopic--yet at the same time needs a footnote to decrypt the name of Zanuck? Nobody. Endnote both names, endnote neither, or endnote the MORE obscure of the two, but don't endnote ONLY the LESS obscure! Can an editor possibly write worse endnotes than this, short of supplying counterfactual notes? (\\"Zanuck\\": Zanuck IV, Martian conqueror of the thirty-ninth century, CE.)So be warned: this edition is extremely labor-intensive. You'll have to look up a lot of dead words, internet-search a lot of names, and grit your teeth through Noerr's vanity-project endnotes. Let's hope Stanford puts out a more useful edition as an apology for this one."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, both prominents of the Frankfurter Schule of critical theory, wrote this work during WWII. In their own words, the purpose of the book was to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism. Obviously their experiences as Jewish intellectuals fleeing for the national-socialist regime to the United States was a strong impulse for this view, but the book is not limited to a critique of nazism or even totalitarianism altogether.The main subject of the book, though that itself is already difficult to disentangle, is Enlightenment's betrayal of its own liberating capacity. Adorno & Horkheimer analyze this by means of various cultural metaphors, which in highly abstract, contradictory and aesthetic language (especially the parts by Adorno) trace the development of Enlightenment and its subsequent 'dark side' throughout an equally metaphorical history of culture and ideas. In a certain sense this may most remind readers not familiar with both authors of Foucault and his use of concepts like the Panopticon to express a view of power relations. The method of Adorno and Horkheimer is however not so much genealogical, as Foucault's is, as dialectical in its idealist form.The book consists of an introduction, two \\"excursions\\" and two chapters on the Enlightenment itself, as well as a series of aphorisms provided at the end as \\"notes and sketches\\". Each part of the book consists of a very abstract, very metaphysical and almost entrancing analysis of, in turn, the development of Enlightenment as myth out of earlier myth, the form of modern Enlightenment as instrumental reason and mass deception, and the limits of Enlightenment to its own rationality, in the form of anti-semitism. The language of the book is extremely difficult, even in English, and in the best (and worst) traditions of continental philosophy it contains a very great amount of layers and meanings, not all of which are free of internal contradiction. Readers familiar to Situationist works are perhaps best prepared for the effect, which is somewhat similar in method, if not in style, to Guy Debord.The introduction, \\"The Concept of Enlightenment\\", posits Enlightenment as thought liberating man from his natural shackles, and creating man as master of the earth. This process of liberation entails at the same time the possibility of man to protect himself from, and understand the workings of, nature, and also mankind's loss of being one with nature. In this process, the self is created as a subjectivity divorced from direct experience of the outside world. Man's memory of this is very vague and distant, but is present in everyone as a certain inchoate feeling of loss.This is also the main subject of the first Exkurs, \\"Odysseus, or Myth and Enlightenment\\". The story of the Odysseia is here used in many ways to provide metaphorical expressions for the role of myth in and against Enlightenment. Myths are primitive descriptions of the world, and in being so are already classifications used as a form of instrumental reason, which is the seed of Enlightenment. The role of sacrifice to the Gods, for example, is presented as manipulation of those Gods, and in so doing already expression of an Enlightened mind avant la lettre. Odysseus' adventure with the Sirens is metaphor for man's loss as described above: Odysseus, the Enlightened ruler, knows his loss but is constrained by his knowledge from acting on it; and the shipmates, the great mass of modernity, is only vaguely aware of the loss, and are not affected. But Circe, the Cyclops, and many other themes are used besides.The second Exkurs is \\"Juliette, or Enlightenment and Morality\\". The works of De Sade, in particular Juliette, here provide an expression of Enlightenments freeing and therefore contradictory character. Kant is contrasted with Juliette; where Kant is the restrained form of reason, reason as classifying and ordening power, Juliette is reason's destructive power of old orders. Because Enlightenment destroys the validity of any appeal to tradition, religion, etc., it falls pray to itself, in that Enlightenment's appeal to its own absolute values is undermined, in the same way that Juliette uses and is used by Catholicism in undermining it.The third chapter is \\"Enlightenment as Mass Deception\\", covering the subject of the culture industry. Here Adorno rants against all the vapid and degraded culture forms he perceives in the United States, although he never states it as valid only for the US, of course. There are many interesting insights and observations about modern culture and still valid ones too in this chapter, but Adorno's general tone is that of the \\"hochb&uuml;rgerliche\\" bourgeois annoyed about the offenses against good taste he sees. Yet to dismiss it based on that would be superficial, even if we cannot agree with Adorno's hatred for radio and jazz. His observations on American movies are very poignant, and in between his cultural criticism he hits on certain relations between the capitalist mode of production, its Enlightenment ideology, and the cultural superstructure that are very worthwhile for a patient radical.The fourth chapter is called \\"Limits of Enlightenment\\", and addresses directly the subject of anti-semitism and fascism more generally. Fascism is posited as Enlightenment turned against itself (it must be noted Adorno & Horkheimer were among the first to state this, even if it is somewhat of a cliche now). Enlightenment's general instrumental reason knows only power as a measure of behavior. Therefore, it cannot tolerate the existence of groups that thrive, yet never have power, such as Jews and women. Whenever Enlightened society fails to satisfy the needs of its members, their anger is turned against such groups.The last chapter, \\"Notes and Sketches\\", is as said a series of aphorisms, familiar to people who have read situationist works, or for example Walter Benjamin's notebooks.Overall, this book is an extremely complex, but very worthwhile philosophical critique of modern culture, and a very pessimistic and negative analysis of Enlightenment and its possibilities. It is hard work to get to the bottom of it, but nevertheless rewarding for any student of philosophy."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"\\"Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts back to mythology\\" (xviii). This statement is likely one of the most explosive philosphical theses penned in the 20th century, for not only did it give expression to much of the suspicion and pessimism that people experienced in the early 20th century, particularly under the Nazi regime, but this statement set into motion much of the later suspicion concerning the Enlightenment project and its relation to not just freedom, but domination under freedom's guise.Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments is the most important work ever written by any of the members of the Frankfurt School; it stands as a type of manifesto really for the possibility of Critical Theory as a post-positivistic discipline. It is easy to miss, but this is not just a work of philosophy - it is not a work written by old men with elbow patches on their jackets pondering various ideas in a scientific and socio-historical philosophical vacuum. Quite the opposite: this is a book that drew upon then-current sociology and anthropology (particularly pertaining to religion), in addition to the history of philosophy and philosophical currents such as Marxism (Western Marxism, to be specific). This is a book that draws - obviously - on history; it is a book that has much to say about media and the effects of what Adorno called \\"The Culture Industry\\".Several authors, such as Jurgen Habermas and Leszek Kolakowski, have noted the the structure of the book - what we might call its \\"poetics\\" - is quite abnormal for a work of philosophy. The subtitle of the book comes well into play here as a means of understanding the book; \\"Philosophical Fragments\\" very much describes what it is like reading this work. The genuinely fragmentary nature of the book - it begins with an essay titled \\"The Concept of Enlightenment\\" before two excurses (one on Odysseus and the other on Marquis de Sade), the chapter \\"The Culture Industry\\", a series of theses titled \\"Elements of Angi-Semitism: Limits of Enlightenment\\", and the closing section \\"Notes and Sketches\\" (which is anything but smooth) - only adds to the sense of urgency.The attempt to ascertain \\"why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism\\" (xiv) animates the work. This regression ultimately has to do with the very nature of myth, which is \\"obscure and luminous at once\\" (xvii). It is with positivism that science believes it can banish all mystery from the world such that humans become masters of it (1); art itself has fallen prey to this myth (14). Perhaps surprisingly, this does not begin in the 18th century European Enlightenment, but with one of our most ancient of founding myths: Odysseus. The deceptive nature of the sacrifice in Odysseus is the beginning of our journey towards enlightenment, for it places us on a similar footing with the gods. The attempt of persons such as Sade to advocate a world without superstition not only turns us into beasts with \\"the innocence of wild animals\\" (77), but means that we still must hold onto one myth: that we can actually live in a world where all is entirely as it seems. Transgression of the previous morality (Catholicism) is the necessary mythical supplement to this view; it brings no pleasure but only violence. Both the Culture Industry and Anti-Semitism ultimately have the same totalitarian goal: to make everyone the same, as economic cogs in the machine, devoid of their individuality. Thus Enlightenment is necessarily violent against the Other, who doesn't fit in. The book ends with Notes and Sketches in a kind of anti-climax; Dialectic of Enlightenment is left open.In many ways, this edition by Stanford University Press, in their uber-fine series \\"Cultural Memory in the Present\\", is like a critical edition in English. Dialectic of Enlightenment was printed various times and in various editions from 1944 thru 1969; this edition collects each of the prefaces for the various editions, and notes every single textual variant for each edition, some of which are seen as rather unimportant, but others of which show that the text was very much a continual work in progress for Horkheimer and Adorno. In addition to an Editor's Afterword, there is an essay appended at the end of the book titled \\"The Disappearance of Class History in \\"Dialectic of Enlightenment\\": A Commentary on the Textual Variants (1944 and 1947)\\", which many will likely to find insightful reading. This is an important addition to the library of many different fields - political thought, intellectual history, philosophy, theology, religious studies, and social theory, among others - regardless of how it has been produced. Stanford University Press should really be commended for producing it in such a way that it is a fine addition to one's library as well.One does well to remember that this work should not be simply taken at face value. In their 1969 Preface, Horkheimer and Adorno mention that they ascribe a \\"temporal core to truth\\" (xi), which means that as an older text, what remains applicable in it should be used today, and what no longer applies should be left alone as having been applicable at one time in the past. Neither author ever endorsed the irresponsible usage of their work in the 1960s by protesting students who had become little more than mobs; that they have been linked to irresponsible New Left anti-politics (via their friend Herbert Marcuse) is not their fault. Rather, what Horkheimer and Adorno endorsed then (and would continue to endorse, were they still alive) is not a brutal application of a particular theory, but a sustained, thoughtful and well informed engagement of theory with the whole of the modern world. \\"As a critique of philosophy, it does not seek to abandon philosophy itself\\" (xii). In short, they believed in wisdom: and this is what philosophy is ultimately all about."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Adorno and Horkheimer are associated with the Frankfurt school of thought in post-WWII Germany. In this book, Dialectic of Enlightenment, the two thinkers disect the post-war condition looking at all aspects of cultural identity as based on ancient enlightenment-esque ideals. This book illuminates the devestating results of progressivist models of history in late capitalism. Probably the most famous essay deals with the culture industry and how, in post-war capitalism, movies, books, television all become tools of subjegation through which a falsified sense of individuality is produced and commodified to the ends of keeping the consumers of this industry distracted enough to ignore the insideousness of that which we allow to control us.A very dense read, poetic in areas, but challenging throughout. Adorno is often criticized for being a cynic, but I think that under his often scathing view of modern culture is a message that through exacting self-reflection change of the \\"total system\\" can occur.These themes are expanded on in Adorno's other works: Minima Moralia, and Negative Dialectic."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"One of the more important, and somewhat more readable, founding texts of the Frankfurt school of critical thought, this book (probably because of the influence of Max Horkheimer) is more readable than Negative Dialectics (by Theodore Adorno) but less readable than Adorno's book of short essays, Minima Moralia. Its orange cover, and alarming, intellectual, title, make Dialectic of Enlightenment somewhat of a chick magnet :-).The unreadability of Frankfurt School texts is an artifact of the very phenomena they criticize. Educated people in America at the time Dialectic of Enlightenment was written were influenced, directly and indirectly, by the pragmatism of John Dewey and English Logical Positivism as mediated by Bertrand Russell and A. J. Ayer. A bit later, the Continental school of Logical Positivism came to America fleeing Fascism.Pragmatism is the homegrown American philosophy that the useful is the true and the true, useful. Logical Positivism in Britain and on the Continent is the view that the meaningful is only the verifiable statement of natural science. Both traditions are completely inimical to the older Continental views of Adorno and of Horkheimer, based as they are on those of Hegel, Freud and Marx.Adorno would probably see straight through the question begging that goes on in both Pragmatism and Logical Positivism. Both these philosophies fail to self-apply, in a logical failure which is also a failure to exhibit the intellectual virtue of humility. If we ask the Pragmatist about the utility of his view that truth is utility he cannot answer. Similarly, Logical Positivism's own claim, that meaningful statements are either verifiably true or verifiably false using the procedures of science, fails, even less than Pragmatism, to self-apply, because we simply can't verify the nonexistence of a meaningful but unverifiable statement. This result, which conclusively has shown nearly all major-league philosophers that Logical Positivism is deep nonsense, has been generalized in recent years to show that there are even apparently scientific statements, such as statements as to what transpires inside black holes, which are not verifiable.However, the nonsense of Pragmatism and of Logical Positivism had in the period 1930 to about 1980 much influence, again direct and indirect, on educated Americans. Directly, they were exposed to it in undergraduate survey courses and of course as philosophy specialists. Indirectly the ideas were in the air, and they have had strong influence on the management, and the mismanagement, of America's economy and its foreign policy.For this reason, and because of the deconstruction of a decent educational system, contemporary post-moderns in America find actual post-modern classics including Dialectic of Enlightenment tough going.But to be constructive. \\"Dialectic\\" in the title refers to a form of logic which commencing with the early 19th century German philosopher Hegel. It is presented, superficially, in survey classes as a weird kind of pseudo-logic in which things become their opposite, and then the thing and its opposite \\"synthesize\\" to form a higher, more involved thing.But this superficial nonsense fails to account for the dialectic at all. The dialectic is a response, in the real material conditions that have obtained in developed societies since the end of the 18th century, to the fact that mere traditional logic is a closed system. Mere traditional logic seems to the ordinary person verbal games and, strikingly, it is the same to the evolved modern mathematician if he's of the \\"formalist\\" school. You merely have to change the axioms to get the results you want in mere traditional logic.Tradtional (and modern) logic is like a machine for accomplishing our purposes that it becomes (in indeed a dialectic fashion) the opposite of what we need. The 17th century philosopher Leibniz was so impressed by the apparent power of primitive forms of modern logic that he thought that any dispute would be by now, at the close of the millenium, settled in gentlemanly fashion with \\"let us calculate, sir.\\" As what would now be termed a high-paid \\"consultant\\" to the CEOs of his time and place (petty, and small-minded, German princelings) Leibniz included political and social matters in this view.Leibniz saw in logic a machine that would remove decisionmaking from passion and self-interest and indeed logic, and its technological, embodied form the modern digital computer, does so with such thoroughness that the \\"fair\\" decision machine becomes its opposite. We merely have to change the program to get the results we want, whether those results be true and fair and just, or deep nonsense.Hegel, Marx and Freud were healthy and human reactions to this manipulative spirit, and dialectical logic, far from being anti-modern-logic (as its more hysterical opponents like Quine seem to feel), actually rescues traditional and modern logic from criminal manipulation. For example, in human and in social affairs, the very fact that each actor is not a thing and has capabilities to react to features of the system in totality, consistently makes social planning self-defeating. In the Five Year Plans of the Stalin era, the very fact that factory managers were more or less informed of the direction of the whole caused the numerical decision procedures used in determining whether those targets would be met to be distorted towards optimism that caused famine and war. In the Reagan White House, the commitment of an autistic Chief Executive to meeting impossible economic targets likewise caused his budget director, David Stockman, to fudge the numbers using a primitive spreadsheet and what Stockman called \\"the magic asterisk\\" to identify needed savings, not yet identified, that would balance the books.Traditional and modern logic is a babe in the woods as regards such chicanery. But the dialectic, centering human over technical relationships, sees and can account for this behavior. Its overall procedure is to weigh irreconcilable interests against each other, to predict the synthesis that will result. In Horkheimer and Adorno, the dialectical claim is that the very science and technology produced by the 18th century enlightenment would over time produce its opposite. Kant's individual freedom to be a knower (a scientist or independent entrpreneur) would turn, amid the pressure of real human events, into a higher form of enslavement."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Most educated people think of the Enlightenment as an era that ushered in a much desired trend toward rationalism and cultural progress. In \\"DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT,\\" Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer counter with the startling proposition that the Enlightenment, far from advancing the cause of modernity, progress, reason, and order instead created a new age of barbarism whose basis was centered on a tyrannical manipulation of every aspect of each citizen's life, habits, and environment. Such an interpretation begins with the founding of the Frankfurt School in Germany in the 1920s with Adorno, Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Georg Lukacs as the creative Marxist core. Originally located in Germany, its creators first thought of calling their school the Institute of Marxism, but wisely concluded that such a name would render widespread acceptance of its name as unlikely. They then settled on the harmless sounding Institute for Social Research. After Hitler became Chancellor, the Institute moved to New York, and then, after 1945, back to Germany. The Institute was determined to advance Marxism as the dominant political and economic theory in the world, but its founders were wise enough to recognize that Marxism, as it was then constructed, was simply not up to the task. Classical Marxism was based solely on its undiluted appeal to workers as a marginalized class beset by a cabal of greedy capitalists. The Frankfurt School widened the net of victims by including women, gays, and assorted ethnic minorities as the newest downtrodden. To accommodate this widening net, Adorno and the other founders dreamed up what they termed \\"Critical Theory,\\" which as its name implies was a criticism of nothing less than society itself. Out went capitalism as the Marxist bogeyman. In came anti-Semitism, sexism, racism and homophobia as the newest allures for converts. Thus, the Frankfurt School melded Marxism, which was originally designed solely as an economic philosophy, to a series of competing philosophies like the psychological theories of Freud, the emerging range of literary theories just then spreading, and a variety of multi-disciplinary schools, none of which shared any common ground except that their totality could be used as a club to bash western style capitalism.When the book was published in 1944, it called into question a two thousand year tradition that reason must eventually lead the way to a golden age. Reason, they argued, did quite the opposite by encouraging the growth of a fascist mentality that was then raging in Europe. This mentality that leads to the destruction of true human freedom is based on the pairing of traditional opposites: freedom/tyranny, man/woman, urban/rural and the like. They argue that rationalists of the Enlightenment see a sharp dividing line between the left and the right pair. One must be either one or the other. Not so, say Adorno and Horkheimer. At various points, the one merges into the other to such an extant that it is only a myth that they are truly separate. Critical theorists maintain that neither side of the slash holds the preferred position. Rather the source of frustration seemingly caused by identifying with one side or the other is in actuality a result of underlying tension which emanates from an overpowering sense of dislocation and alienation, both of which are the deliberate goals of the Inner Party of the industrial/military/consumer cabal. Using Orwell's terms again, it is the Outer Party and the Proles who suffer the most while paradoxically are misled into thinking that they are not suffering at all. Adorno and Horkheimer suggest that the de-evolution of society into fascist conformity and thus into inexplicable alienation has its roots in the ability of the economic Powers That Be into seducing an entire generation of consumers into producing a false sense of individuality while at the same time masking a stifling sense of conformity.In the book's most well-known chapter, \\"Enlightenment as Mass Deception,\\" the authors take the classic Marxist view that all consumers are essentially interchangeable cogs in a multi-national machine that brags of individuality even as it ruthlessly stamps it out. The key to this stamping out of individualism is the insidious role of culture, which classifies, organizes, and labels consumers to the point that their reactions can be pinpointed as accurately as science fiction author Isaac Asimov described in his FOUNDATION series. To accomplish this Cassandra-like level of accuracy, Adorno and Horkheimer assume the legitimacy of several questionable basics. First, they see broadcast programs as \\"exactly the same.\\" This must come as a surprise to ratings companies which identify quantifiable differences among them. Second, they envision a movie audience whose reactions can be precisely identified in advance. This too must come as a surprise to producers of costly films that tank at the box office. Third, they make statements about the relation of consumers to products that simply make no sense. What, for example, do they mean when they write \\"Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work\\"? Finally, they write of consumers as sheep with no power to resist blatant advertising. The advertising industry is replete with failed policies that did not foresee a fluctuating consumer response to advertising. The authors mask their leaky ideology behind some heavy paradoxes that promise much meaning but emerge as devoid of such. Such paradoxes are usually pithy fortune cookie utterances: \\"The perfect similarity is the absolute difference:\\" \\"Chance and planning become one and the same thing;\\" and \\"Everybody becomes an employee.\\" Those who read this book and intone that it \\"made them think twice at the apparently simplistic world in which we live\\" are probably unaware that the complexity of this world need not be limited to the bashing of capitalism to which both Adorno and Horkheimer had long been committed."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"One of the most famous pieces of Finnish prose is 'Seitsem&auml;n veljest&auml;' by our national iconic author Aleksis Kivi. Some people even describe it as the first real novel in our literature history due to its self-reflexiness. Within 'Seitsem&auml;n veljest&auml;' one can find a scene depicting the agrarian village-school where adult men are learning how to read and write in order to get a licence to marry. The authoritarian teacher shouts out letters one by one and the stupid lot reluctantly repeat it with loud voice. \\"A,\\" says the schoolmaster. \\"A,\\" bellow the tortured fellers. \\"B\\" spoken leads to a roomful of \\"B\\"'s and so forth. Eventually one of the pupils can't take it anymore and escapes through a window, breaking the glass.Reading Adorno & Horkheimer is bit like this. Despite their brilliancy one feels sometimes that he is reduced to go trough the same irritating formula time after time - too many times. \\"Thesis,\\" shouts Adorno. One replies obediently. \\"Antithesis\\", shouts Horkheimer. A reply follows. \\"Synthesis,\\" bellows the schoolmasters. Again, an answer imitates the curriculum. It works for a while. But after a couple of hundred pages illustrating the philosophical alphabets of the Frankfurt school one does feel like breaking & exiting. Maybe the reader in questin is slow-witted.

From the very first paragraph I was able to experience all the pain and torture the family had been subjected to. It is quite clear there are demons and angels along for the ride, but who are the pawns and who are the leaders? This is a must read and will really get deep into your head! Playing games, mind games, power trips, obsession, finding control, these are just some of the themes and issues featured in this suspense-ridden novel. You are taken on a roller coaster ride of what is real and what is not. Diane is a mother wracked with voices, memories, and a past that she begs to forget. The pain she endures is something she endures alone. With every outburst and cry for help, she is met with her family questioning her own sanity. Is she the one going crazy or are there darker forces making her think she is? With her husband away at sea constantly, providing their only means of financial support, she battles each day alone with a will that tests her faith and mocks her progress. Her son, Alan, a boy ready to become a man if his mother would just give him some space, doesn't seem to be himself. Years of altered behaviors, changes in character, and events he barely remembers, for him everything is a nightmare, or at least that is how it seems. Looking into the mirror, the image reflected is not one he's sure he recognizes. Concerned for his mother's welfare he tries to take charge of the situation, anything to take the focus away from the images he keeps seeing. What the author has done here is get deep into the headspace of characters that are on the edge, threatening to delve into a state they fear and try to fight. The dialogue is raw, emotions are powerful, and twists run plenty in each chapter. There is such a rush of real inner dialogue, it sweeps you up and doesn't let go until you are at the conclusion. Sherry L. Gibson gives you an in your face story with a plotline that moves at a speed of light pace. She challenges your own ability to handle a situation and makes you question it every step of the way. I was physically and mentally exhausted by the time I finished the book. This is a clear picture of how dysfunction is handled in families, the way time passes yet nothing changes. These people move along in their lives, consumed by their thoughts, always questioning other's behavior, yet not taking responsibility for themselves. The characters will stay on your mind long after you've finished, and perhaps makes you think about your own inner strengths, and the demons you may battle inside.

If you are looking for a translation which carries the flavor of the original language, these translations are not for you. If, however, you are interested in reading poetry that tries to maintain original images and make them understandable to the Western mind, then you will find that Barks achieves his goal very well.Like This contains 43 odes originally translated by John Moyne, a linguist at CUNY; Coleman Barks has then used in skill in English poetry to make version of these poems. What is most evident in his versions is that he has spent many years with the material and has developed a &quot;sense of it&quot; without mistaking that &quot;sense of it&quot; with being a Sufi Master.If you have an interest in Sufi or religious ectastic poetry, this volume is well worth your time. If you are a 12th-13th century Persian scholar they are not. An example: &quot;There's a tradition that God can be seen / in the color red. In the lights / that come from red hair!&quot; - interesting thought which arouses in me, at least, a healthy curiousity regarding the tradition."},{"Title":"Like This: Rumi ; Versions by Coleman Barks","review":"The fact that Barks cannot read the original Persian and must work with literal translations of others only adds to the significance of his achievement: it does not lessen it. I cannot begin to fathom how he managed to extract the spirit of Rumi's work from cryptic and often nonsensical earlier translations. Yet Barks remains faithful to what Rumi uttered 700 years ago and reaffirms that the poet's message is indeed universal, beyond language and time. Barks never set out to preserve the musicality of the original Persian. Here he's been wise to avoid an effort whose futility is evident in the works of Arberry and Nicholson. As someone who can read Rumi in both languages, I am delighted and amazed by the way Barks releases these poems from the cage of literal translations.

R. Nicholson, whose translations from the original Farsi Barks cribs (sorry - &quot;rephrases&quot;) in several books, himself admits: &quot;I do not, of course, pretend to have understood everything...&quot; No such humility encumbers Barks, however. Apparently, his unique spiritual insights into Rumi make reference to the original writings unnecessary. At worst, this is the channeling approach to translation. At best, it is postmodernist orientalism. The scholar Nicholson writes that &quot;no writer can fairly be judged by fragments, however fine...&quot; Barks seems to agree, writing that his poems are &quot;buckets lifted from a whole, whose connectedness runs its vast and intimate course...&quot; To get a glimpse of that course, take a look at the translation Nicholson recommends, Whinfield's Masnavi, still in print through Octagon Books, under the title &quot;Teachings of Rumi&quot;. The New York Times equates Barks's Rumi success with Kahlil Gibran's popularity in the sixties. That's good for Barks, at least financially. Whether he accurately conveys the teaching of the poet whom even contemporary Sufis refer to as &quot;Our Master,&quot; or even approaches the literary value of that original, is another matter."},{"Title":"Like This: Rumi ; Versions by Coleman Barks","review":"i found this style of writing a little difficult to follow and read it a couple times, but overall i really enjoyed it and it had a lot of really beautiful, insightful things to say."},{"Title":"Like This: Rumi ; Versions by Coleman Barks","review":"must rea"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This is sort of an Indian James Bond story with a realholy man guru as the second hero.Kim is Kimball O'Hara whose Dad was in an Irish regiment in India when he died.He left his son as a street orphan in India.Kim finds friends is strange places from a Buddhist lama to an Afghanistani horse trader and a British spy master.

At the end of the novel, he sets aside his native costume, and takes him proper place in the world of the rulers, instead of living with and as an Indian.In a sense, KIM is almost impossible for an educated person to read today as literature. It seems instead to be more historical artifact. We simply are not able to go back and time and read it with the same imperial eyes of just over a century ago. I found it exceedingly difficult to read any passage dealing with Kim and his adventures with any degree of sympathy and I found it impossible to identify with him. Whatever enjoyment I found in the book I discovered in the character of the old lama. Nonetheless, while it is hard today to read this novel as literature, it makes for fascinating reading as a documentary of colonial assumptions and beliefs. In other words, it makes great history.I would very strongly recommend anyone wanting to read this novel to do so in the Penguin Classics edition. The introduction by Edward Said, author of ORIENTALISM, alone is almost worth the price of the entire book. He does a masterful job in a remarkably brief space of limning the key issues in a post-colonial reading of colonial literature, and applies this brilliantly to the major issues that arise in a reading of KIM."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Great book...have been reading it in a hisotry class...easy to read, flows well and engaging."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This was probably the first - and almost only time a white author really entered the mind of asia.It opened the whole relationship of the west with india an even ironically helped the campaign of Ghandi and his (MKG's) portrayal of a hindu holy-man (so frightening to muslims).Kipling himself perhaps saw Kim as his \\"perfect self\\" though sadly the real Kipling about this time embrased the two dimensional imperialism of the Daily Mail - in want of a distant Bad Guy for his actual manichean fantasy he fitted up the germans - and sadly had a huge influence on the disaster that was the First World War.\\"Kim\\" Philby (named for the hero) and others in search of this foreign world of duplicity and black and white values later embraced communism.This novel affected all of this - was the first realistic (rather than idealised) view of buddhism in its evolved and contradictorary form (I like the way the Lama blends in snatches of Pure Land etc along with his \\"no self\\" agnosticism). Kipling \\"sold\\" a positive picture of India and its two-way relationship with \\"Blighty\\" that greatly influenced later events an perceptions of both right and left.Too bad he embraced the rich and powerful so whole-heartedly - (as did WB Yeats at a similar time in a similar way) and so lost his clear poetic vision.Rather than take on the task of fighting germany - he might have written a sequel - in which O'Hara had to contemplate the foundations for the glamourisation of the struggle between the European powers - questioned the disruptive influence of the Entente Cordial (all the dangers of a treaty and none of the mutual benefits) and why exactly Britain had to be a continental power with a land-army (responsible for the defense of France and Belgium but with no say in the methods) when it had plenty to do across the oceans.Kipling painted a picture of the glamour and cultural richness of India - and of great-power conflict. He knew a lot more about the first than the last - sadly because of his authentic voice on Asia folk took heed of him over Europe.He is one a few people who almost completely discounted a great cultural good with a massive social evil. The pen was mightier than the sword and it was correctly said that at that time the word of Kipling was more eagerly listened to than the words of all but a few heads of state. He lost his own son to the multinational meatgrinder that he and a few \\"war-glamourisers\\" wound into action - implying that the whole thing might be more fun than driving a desk in Finchley - he encouraged the French to think they could use the British to gain hegemony in Europe - based on the sound prediction that the Rosbifs would leave when the bloodletting was over.I adore this man and abhor him - I want to grab hold of him after this book (1901) and send him back to India. You don't understand the Twentieth century if you don't read this book - from the Somme to TE Lawrence to Woodstock to the rise of Mandela is the story of folk who read this book and/or felt its influence. Only the Beatles can compete - but only because they too were influenced. Kipling as colonial taught generations to identify with the locals - thus fuelling de-colonialisation - into the hands of the very \\"Babu-Class\\" that he distrusted. They were not like his \\"Babu\\". Hurree - they were \\"in a hurry\\" and so were the brits!If only the Neo-cons had both read it and understood its mixed influence and implications. The whole Iraq fiasco could be described as \\"insufficient Kim\\"."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This review is forKim (Penguin Classics) (Kindle edition)Publisher: PenguinASIN: B0050N7G8QA nicely formatted edition with lots of extras.

The Old Lama was interesting at first but quickly palled as he never said anything interesting and simply said the same things over and over and over. His view of Buddhism was shallow at best. The attachment between Kim and the Lama never seemed to have any real foundation or purpose other than to give Kim a reason to wander about. The characters may have had interest and relevance in 19th Century India but they are not very realistic today. Walking all over the country side while spouting \\"The Wheel of Life\\" doesn't make for much excitement. However, it does provide a real perspective on what India must have been like under Victoria. But the perspective is all Indian and the British play a very small role, which I think detracts from the story. Kim is pressed into service as a spy but his spying never seems to come to fruition and he never seems to have any direction. Creighton recruits him and then never actually uses him. In fact the entire story seems to wander around much like Kim. The teacher Lurgan may or may not have been a pedophile but like much of this book, it is long on hints and short on action. The Wheel Of Life seemd to turn relentlessly without going anywhere and the Great Game was mostly talked about rather than played. I read it to the end and I can now mark it off of my list of classics to be read, but I think it is a classic past its prime.I gave three stars because parts are interesting and you do get a good view of what India must have been like in the 19th Century and how the natives saw the British, but it isn't a page turner."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"You know, I really wanted to like this book. Maybe it's the first chapter, which fills you with such goodwill for the characters, especially (what a great title Kim has) the Friend of All the World. But then the narrative gets bogged down in a whole bunch of espionage baloney. Imagine a _Huckleberry Finn_ (the supposed prototype for _Kim_) where Huck gets sent to military school for several years in the middle of the book, and you can see whata wrong direction Kipling took. I can't deny that the book abound with local color or whatever, but a plot that drags is a plot that drags, and I could never get around that. It's not helped by a prose style that is often pretty, but ultimately too flowery and opaque for an adventure story. Maybe it's just dated; but I doubt it, for some of Kipling's contemporaries, like Doyle, Stevenson, or Haggard, could write in a similar genre, and they have aged fine. I will say, though, that the ending doesn't cop out the way I'd feared it would, and is very satisfying. But a good beginning and a good ending...that's all you've got here."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Unless you enjoy working hard at reading novels, I don't recommend this book.

They came from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. They came to trade, to spread Christianity and to rule ever larger swatches of territories populated by Sikhs, Jains, Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.One such man was John Lockhart Kipling. With his bride he sailed for India. In Bombay their famous Nobel Prize winning son Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in December 1865. His first years were lived in India, pampered by native servants. After unhappy school years spent in Engliand with his younger sister, Rudyard returned to India to be a journalist and to discover what a colossal expert on Indian culture and religions his father John Lockhart had made himself, inter alia, on Buddhism, as curator of an ethnic museum in Lahore, West Punjab.Britons living in the Sub-Continent doggedly made themselves \\"the men who ruled India.\\" As Rudyard Kipling would later salute them:\\"Take up the White Man's burden--And reap his old reward:The blame of those ye better,The hate of those ye guard-- \\"Britons wrote well and insightfuly of British experience in India. Novelist John Masters wrote of six generations of the fictional Savage family. E. M. Forster in A PASSAGE TO INDIA showed how hard it was for English men and women who arrived in Hindustan as adults to relate empathetically and effectively to local mores. In perhaps the greatest work of non-fiction about fabled Hind, THE MEN WHO RULED INDIA, Philip Woodruff sang of the unselfishness of young men who came out from England with a bible in one hand and Plato's REPUBLIC in the other to be rulers of alien races as career members of the Indian Civil Service.Rudyard Kipling, by contrast, told of a notably different British experience in India. In 1901, six years before his Nobel Prize, Kipling serialized KIM for an American magazine. Kim (Kimball, Jr.) was born in India in the 1870s to Irish domestic servant Annie Shott and Colour Sergeant Kimball O'Hara of the Mavericks, a 900-man strong Irish regiment. The sergeant mustered out of the British army and supervised a work gang on an Indian railroad. When young Kim was only three, his mother Annie died of cholera. Father and son then lived up and down the railroad until the father settled in Lahore, joined the local Masonic lodge and began to live with a half-breed woman who taught him to smoke opium. That final addiction plus his earlier one to alcohol soon proved fatal to the still young ex-Colour Sergeant.The unnamed local woman raised orphaned Kim to age 13, when Kipling opens his novel in Lahore. As his adoptive mother insists, at novel's beginning Kim is dressed as a poor young white boy or Sahib (trousers, shirt, floppy hat) and is playing with neighborhood Indian friends: a wealthy Hindu boy and a poor Muslim boy on Zam-Zammah, the mighty cannon still stationed before Lahore's Wonder House, the museum run in those years by John Lockhart Kipling.As Cardinal John Henry Newman, himself a novelist, would have argued: any Englishman of any stripe of religion would believe that young Kim had started life precisely where a loving God had intended him to start. Soon he will meet, as fate or kismet or God intended, Father Vincent, Roman Catholic chaplain of the Mavericks, the man who had officiated at his parents' wedding. By that time Kim has already become the disciple of an ancient Buddhist monk wandering down from Tibet in search of a river of India. That stream had been created ages ago when the future Buddha won an archery contest for his bride. He shot an arrow farther than all his rivals. Where it landed no one knows. But redemption is the reward of whoever discovers the River of the Arrow. There is something in Kim that uncharacteristically attracts this teenaged scamp and prankster toward genuinely holy men of any religion, but uniquely to this Urdu-speaking Red Lama of Tibet.And there is also something in Kim that makes native Indians who know him both as a sunburned poor white Sahib and sometimes in disguise as a low-caste Hindu, salute Kim as \\"little friend of all the world.\\" For years Kim has impressed Mahboob Ali, aging Pathan horse trader and secret agent of Colonel Creighton, head of the British Raj's spy network. Mahboob Ali regards Kim as an extraordinarily promising young colt, a perfect future polo pony to run in the \\"Great Game.\\" Kim loves games of any sort, especially, carrying love letters across the roof tops of Lahore to married women on behalf of admirers like Mahboob Ali. And as young Kimball O'Hara is taught the mechanics of spycraft by Lurgan Sahib in 7,000 foot high Simla, Kim is strongly tempted to play the Great Game: that Victorian Cold War between Russia and Britain for domination of Central Asia, Afghanistan, parts of China, India and Tibet.Catholic Father Vincent and his rival Anglican chaplain of the Mavericks, the latter also a Freemason, learn from a birth/baptismal certificate he carries in a pouch who young Kimball O'Hara really is: a white Sahib, who must without question take up the white man's burden. Both the regiment and the Masons maintain schools in India for their orphans and Kim must go to one or the other to take up his father's trade as a British soldier. \\"No!\\" insists Kim's lama. Educated as a Sahib Kimball must be and at the finest school for Sahibs in all India, St. Xavier's in Lucknow -- all at the lama's expense! But soldier, never! Violence is not the Way of Lord Buddha. That is fine with Kim. Over the next four years Kim is taught to be a surveyor and wins school prizes in mathematics. He is ready to move up a notch in the Great Game.During school holidays Kim is either helping his monk find the river of the arrow, or learning spy trade secrets with Lurgan Sahib and a fat Bengali Babu or out training for the Great Game all over northern India with Mahboob Ali and his horses.At novel's end, as Cardinal Newman would have it, Kim is at the lama's side, with Mahboob Ali the spy also at hand. Kim is at a moral crossroads and must choose: either religion (the Way) or spying (the Great Game). Kipling leaves Kim's answer open. It is Kim's choice. God, presumably, whether Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan or Buddhist God, has seen to it that Kim's life to age nearly 17 has empowered him to make wisely his next Great Choice.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim, orphaned son of an Irish sergeant in the Indian Army, is brought up as an Indian street urchin. Fluent in Hindi, English and Pushtu, he is quick-witted and street-wise. When he becomes attached to a Tibetan lama searching for the River of Buddha's Arrow, his life becomes intertwined with \\"the Great Game\\" - England's espionage network that safeguards British India. This is a terrific novel: witty, suspenseful, rich in descriptions of forgotten or disappearing people and customs, and above all as complex and layered as India herself. There is a smack of the colonist's superior airs in the novel - it is Kim's \\"white blood\\" that makes him immune to the suggestions of India's magic and his English education that allows him to resist hypnotism - but there is nothing, to my eyes, denigrating in the novel. Kipling loves India, and Kim is India. Able to mimic a Sahib, a Hindi, a Muslim, a beggar, a chela or what have you, he represents all of India: its \\"good, gentle\\" people who revere the wise and the virtuous. The ending of the book is perfect: there is closure, but it leaves all of India, from its dusty plains to the bitter cold of the Hills (Himalayas), open to Kim's skills and knowledge. A truly great book, much more than an adventure story, road trip, or coming of age story. It is all these and more."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This review is headed by a quotation from the author who said it of this -his most famous novel .It is the work of an author deeply in thrall to his subject matter and Kim is a very autobiographical work .The eponymous Kim is like his creator torn between two allegiances -just as Kim is unable to decide between his British employers and benefactors and his longing forthe freedom of his roving life ;so too was Kipling torn ,raised as he was by his Portugese Roman Catholic \\"ayah \\" but also listening rapt at the knee of his Hindu servant as he regaled the eager young Kipling with stories and nursery rhymes of India .Kimball O'Hara is an orphan -his late father being a soldier with an Irish regiment serving in India .He lives the life of a street urchin in Lahore and attaches himself to a Tibetan lama as his \\" chela\\" -or apprentice -and together they roam northern India as the lama seraches for the mystic \\"River of the Arrow\\" .They have many adventures among the beautifully described and meticulously evoked scenery of northern India .Then Kim is adopted by a British regiment and sent away to school where he is unhappy but still escapes in vacation to resume his roamings with his beloved lama .In the final section of the book Kim is recruited by Colonel Creighton to be an agent of British Intelligence and play a crucial role in \\" the Great game \\" of espionage -notably to thwart the ever present Russian scheme of occupying northern India using Afghanistan as the base .( Lest sceptics decry this as absurd I suggest they brush up on their history and would also point out Hitler paid the Afghans to raid India during World War 2 and so tie up British and Indian troops )These scenes are well and vividly written with the Indian agent ,Hurree Babu being a strongly written characterThe book is unparalleled in its portrait of life in northern India and the reader can almost picture the open skies , experience the very sights ,sounds and smells of bazaar life and taste the dust of the roads as it swirls in the wake of the characters journeys .This section of the book is the work of a man in love with the countryside and its people .It is less successful -and accurate-in its passages dealing with Indian religion and as a novel it is patchy .The school section is les gripping and the novel as a consequence rather sags in the middle but its climax cements its place as a key novel in the espionage genreKipling's genius was as a storyteller rather than a novelist his best work coming in the shorter form such as short stories but it is still a wonderful book that is unequalled as a descriptive work and an insight into British India"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This book delves deep into India's caste system and culture at the turn of the century.

Kipling does an astounding job of mixing action and philosophy, adventure and theology. Although I do not agree with some of the views Kipling presents, it was an excellent look at the pluralism in India, and it also presented an excellent historical look at India during it's imperial period. Some previous reviewers have said that they disliked the ending of the book, saying that Kippling ran out of steam, but I liked it. I thought the ending was very good, and found myself wishing that it had not yet ended so that I could continue reading more and more about Kim, his lama, and the Game."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This is probably the most famous of all the books written by Rudyard Kipling -- a much maligned writer in today's politically correct environment for his views on British imperialism and \\"the White man's burden\\"; but you will find none of that in this book.Kipling captures the sound, smell, and color of India in the early part of the 20th century like no one else. He was a writer gifted with an acute sense of observation and a keen eye for details. The imagery, the clever use of Indian words, and the vivid description of the characters from different parts of India (even Afghanistan and Tibet) with their own peculiar customs and idiosyncrasies couldn't have been done by someone not intimately familiar with the land and its people.Kim -- the hero of this book -- is a boy of mixed Indian and Irish descent who grew up as a beggar in the streets of Lahore. He becomes the disciple of a Tibetian Buddhist Monk, and with him, embarks on a journey to find a sacred river which the Monk believes will lead to their salvation. Slowly, he gets sucked into \\"the great game\\" between the British and Russians for the control of northern India and Afghanistan. Also involved in this dangerous game of espionage and intrigue are Mahbub Ali, a horse trader from Afghanistan, and Hurree Babu, a semi-anglicized man from Bengal.As many reviewers have pointed out, Kipling's love for India is evident throughout the pages of this book.

Times have changed and Kipling is worth rereading.This a wonderful adventure story. A wiley street urchin, Kim is a self-sufficient and loving child. His mentors include a Muslim horse trader, a Tibetan lama, an aged and difficult Maharanee, a Brahmin spy, and a British colonel.Throughout the book, the Anglo-Irish orphan ponders exactly who and what he is. Raised by a local woman, he is often mistaken for a lower-caste Hindu. He adores the Muslim horse trader and protectively cares for the Buddhist monk who becomes his father figure.The astute modern reader should withhold judgement until the book is read, looking at Kipling's stories as extraordinary time machines that can take the modern reader back to the not-so-glorious days of the British Raj. Pompous reviewers who insist on imposing their self-appointed, so-called \\"enlightened\\" 21st century view points on Kipling's books miss a magical opportunity to understand another era, and I expect, shut their minds before reading this book.\\"Kim\\" is a story of love, honor and respect between generations. The friendships in this book cross tribal, ethnic and religious differences, and illustrate how The Wheel of Life impacts us all. Kim lives up to his nickname, \\"Little Friend of All the World.\\"Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This was Kipling's only full-length novel. For it he was reviled, during his lifetime, both as an imperialist and as an Indian-independence sympathizer. In truth, the novel reflects Kipling's own experience - first as child abandoned by his parents while they went to India, then as a treasured child upon whom all the love and attention of the Indian Ayahs (nannies) was showered, when his parents returned and took him to India to live.Actually, there are three aspects or themes of the story, reflecting the different phases of Kipling's life in India: first, as an army orphan, abandoned by those who were set to watch over him; second, as a participant inducted into the \\"Great Game\\" - the unseen, silent war of espionage between the British and the 19th century Russian Empire; third, as a spiritual journey as the boy, Kim, becoming a man, follows a Tibetan monk in search of a river that cleanses the soul.The way in which Kipling weaves these three themes together is quite unparalleled in modern literature. There are points where the writing verges on sublime. Also, in the context of the two recent conflicts in Afghanistan, the story contains much pertinent historical context. I know of no other novel quite like it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling's tale has been compared to Huckleberry Finn since it is a story about boyish adventures with an older man of a different race. Most of the story's characters have mildly hostile criticisms against other people different from themselves. The characters vacillate between hostility and friendliness. Usually, these criticisms are put in a humorous context. Kipling seems to accept it all with a grin as if to say \\"Oh well, that's how people are. They do enjoy their prejudices\\". There is no discomfort or condemnation of what the characters think of others. The judgments can be against someone's religion, caste, race, or sex. But as far as religion goes, the characters seem to think that someone of different religion is a surprisely decent person, even though they are following a religion that will send them straight to hell.The characters are all distinctive and the closeness between the Lama and Kim is presented in a convincing, moving way. I really got the sense of wonder that Kim felt as a boy on the road for the first time and how he joyfully looked upon the new sights. Kim grows up by having many mentors since he is an orphan. He is also seen as a good candidate to be a spy for the British government since he can move so easily between the world of the British Sahibs and the Indian natives they rule over. The author mentions that most Sahibs would not like to be among the natives so closely, but it all comes so naturally to Kim who considers himself halfway a native. In fact, he struggles with his identity. Is he to take on this new identity as a white sahib or will he remain a white totally assimilated into Indian culture? But this identity crisis also helps him become a spy because he can easily wear different masks, acting a part for any occasion.The other part of the story is the quest for the river which will give the lama enlightenment and how Kim, as his chela, helps the lama on his quest. This is the Hindu theme of freeing yourself from desire, lust, and anger. Kim does not really become like the Lama in pursuing this religion. But the Lama does warn Kim to act to acquire merit or don't act at all. Whether Kim acquires merit in the great game of spying is questionable since the game itself requires you to be a shady character who serves the interests of the government with its ambiguous reputation. Kim manipulates the lama to move in his direction during their journeys, just as the British government manipulates Kim into working for them. I can't say the relationships are entirely pure."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Some say Kipling was an imperialist. Some say he was an Indophile. I think he was both at the same time. One Kipling was a polished and sophisticated part of the ruling class, the British. Another Kipling was a child, innocent of the artificial divisions of the society, fascinated by the color and splendour of the Jewel in the Crown, India. This novel at a subtle level, to me, represents a tug of war between the the two warring Kiplings. While the British elite Kipling is forced to believe in the good the Raj is doing to the poor rascals, the other Kipling has his doubts and frustrated by his inability to declare them freely, they find a veiled expression in Kim.Kim is a Classic story of a boy's adventure in British India. There runs a background plot about &quot;the great game&quot;, the spying war between the British and the Russian empires. Kim becomes a chain-man (spy) for the British and his native early years make him formidable in the profession. However more interesting is the other parallel story, that of friendship between Kim and a Tibetan lama and their wanderings together which also make this a road novel.Kipling understands the oriental way of life and its philosophy. &quot;Only chicken and Sahibs walk around without reason&quot; he says. Through many such comments Kipling questions the western way of work, hurry and constant activity. As the lama says &quot;to refrain from any action is best&quot;.Lastly, one can not but wonder, how much Kim represents a fantacy of Kipling that he wanted to happen to himself. A few common facts between the story and Kipling's own life, for example his father's association with the Lahore Musuem, his own schooling experience etc are revealing. They almost make you hear Kipling sighing &quot;I wish thus would have happened with me!&quot;Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I first read this book-or tied to-when I was 10. Having already read &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and enjoyed it I hadn't expected &quot;Kim&quot; to be too hard. Halfway through the book I had to give up in disgust- it was too deep for me. Later on I came to love the book.It flung me into colonial India with all its native intrigue and wonder. We follow the journeys of an eleven year old boy,Kim or &quot;Friend of all the World&quot;, a white brought up among the natives. We watch him travel around India with an old lama who becomes something like a fatherto KIm. The book is jam-packed with characters that will dazle you but that are still believable. People complain of the jargon Kipling uses; to me it was an added beauty, it made the atmosphere more tangible. Another thing I loved was the habit Kipling has of inserting verses before some chapters.At first you might not understand the relevance of the verse but the time you've finished the chapter you'll get it. This is a book that deserves to be respected, but also to be actally thought about, too.You have to have a certain amount of patience. Once you get over that, this book will enthrall you."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"First, to straighten out a few errors in other reviews -\\"Kim\\" most certainly did not cause controversy \\"at the end of the 18th century\\" since it wouldn't be written for another 100 years! Perhaps the reviewer was confused by the Italian use of \\"century\\" where \\"quattrocento\\" does mean the \\"14th\\" century. Kipling wrote at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th. \\"Kim\\" was published in 1901.The Great Game was not really a mysterious secret-service organization - it was simply the name for the activities of British Army intelligence as it gathered information aimed at maintaining control of British India. There were three aims: to prevent other Great Powers gaining influence (especially Russia), to suppress any incipient revolt against British rule, and to maintain order by preventing wars between the Indian princes themselves.Kim is not part Indian by birth, as some state, but wholly - I was going to say British, but that is not quite right, since Kipling tells us his father was an Irishman, Kimball O'Hara (though at that time indeed Britain ruled Ireland, infamously). His mother was \\"nurse-maid to a Colonel's family,\\" named Annie Shott.Apart from that, what at first I found strange in some of the reviews was the complaint that it is \\"difficult\\" to read. What? Kipling's writing is much more direct here than in many of his short stories, where you must really stay alert to catch 'why' a character responds to someone else's words in a certain way. As for the Urdu or other words used naturally by the speakers, I am not sure how different editions, or the original text, handled them: my edition, printed in the US by Macmillan, simply includes the English in parentheses where needed \\"No,\\" said Kim. \\"Thy man is rather yagi (bad-tempered) than yogi (a holy man). \\" (yagi and yogi are in italics). I think these would be Kipling's parentheses.But perhaps for modern American readers some things are unfamiliar - flipping through again, I see hookah, tramway, scapular, coolie, Babu, chela, fakir - these are words that are more likely to be familiar to Brits like me, and especially Brits of middle-age or so.....I guess we don't always realize how much we simply absorb from the specific cultural background. I see that some editions provide lots of footnotes, but of course looking at footnotes is a pain and spoils the flow and pace of reading. All I'd say is, let yourself be swept up in the amazing panorama of the life of a huge sub-continent as it was 100 years ago, and don't sweat the small stuff! This is a story that above all conveys a zest for life, and has nothing to do with prejudice or preconception about how things \\"should\\" be. Do as Kim did- take it as you find it, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is a good. though dated. novel. but badly transcribed. In some places very badly transcribed."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is to me the epitome of the intelligent adventure story. Written in the somewhat lofty style of the Victorian era, it will make some demands on your concentration. This is not an action-adventure type tale on the order of the Tarzan stories of Burroughs, but a true work of literature where the action is as much cerebral as it is physical. Though the title character,Kim, is a boy, this is by no means juvenile fiction. Kim is an extremely intelligent little street urchin whose deeper character has not yet become set. He has the potential to achieve excellence in many different fields, and on the streets he has already been exposed to many of the evil possibilities. His encounter with his long-lost European heritage opens up a vastly larger arena of opportunity for a youngster of his capabilities. Another influence for which he develops a deep-seated devotion is the noble, ethereal Tibetan \\"holy one\\" whose purity of spirit inspires Kim to be his \\"chela\\", or disciple. Except for his association with the Teshoo Lama, Kim is not offered anything for free. His other associates, even the British, are interested in Kim only in so far as he is useful to them in their \\"Great Game\\"; that is, the swirl of intrigue involving espionage and counter-espionage as the imperial powers pursue their designs on that part of Asia. Kim knows the world is indifferent to his fate, but he is happy to partake of the great game not only of the British, but of life itself, with only his own ingenuity, bravery, and gift of gaining the friendship of wise teachers, to sustain him in an environment full of sinister possibilities. Kipling has given us a picture of India and its peoples of that time that is richly colorful and could only have come from one who had keenly observed them first-hand. It is a deeply satisfying adventure story with strong spiritual overtones. The respect and reverence shown for the cultures and religions of the East are a backdrop to all the other ingredients that make this a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"My Mom has tried to get me to read Kim for years, and I finally broke down and read it. My Mom recommends infrequently and when she does the book is always brilliant. This was no exception. I loved the slow pace of the novel that allowed you to really sink into the experiences Kim was describing. I can never be in India in that time and place, with those characters, but Kipling made them seem very real. I recommend this book for anybody who is able to slow down and feel the book with all your senses, and don't read it when you are in a hurry because you will lose much of the magic."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"'Kim' is a work that could receive very different reviews depending on the biases of the reviewer.Any professor from the English department of my alma mater (Rutgers) would insist that 'Kim' should never under any circumstances receive any praise as it is racist, glorifies imperialism, was writen by a dead white male, and lacks a political philosophy acceptable to a modern progressive liberal. Well, I suppose that it lacks any real political philosophy (except some very general complimentary comments about democracy) and Rudyard Kipling is dead, white and male, but the first two comments are completely wrong and and this sort of review is the voice of ignorance.A staunch traditionalist, conservative would insist that it is a canonical work that should be read by every school child as a superior example of English literature and the epitomy of the written Enlish language. This is equally ill-informed and ill-considered.'Kim' is a wonderful story of an orphan in India (the part that is now Pakistan; Abid-please consider it a gesture of respect that I mention the change in geography) in the late 1800s. Kim is the son of an Irish soldier raised by locals, familiar with the customs and languages of the Hindus and Muslims of the area who gets recruited by the British to spy for them. Kim acts as a guide for a Tibetan Buddhist priest who is on a quest in India, broadening his knowledge of the cultures of his world and giving him an excuse to travel even further. He comes upon his father's regiment, and the officers of the regiment arrange for Kim to attend a 'proper' British school. Throughout the story, a British spymaster is helping Kim receive an education (both formal and in the skills needed to serve the British rule in India) and arranging for Kim to carry messages and run small but important tasks for him.Throughout the book, the only Indian group that is treated with disrespect is Hindus who have sacrificed their own culture's customs in order to get ahead in the British goverment. Frequently, the low opinion of the British held by the Indians (Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist) is mentioned, and is usually pretty funny. The other European powers that are mention in the book are not treated with respect, but that is understandable (at least to me in context; other readers will have to make up their own minds).Kipling's passion for the land he was raised in and his love for the peoples he was raised with is unmistakable, as is his love/hate relationship with the British government (N.B. he was not knighted in a time when most prominent authors were; he was entirely too candid about the British rule in India and the Crown's treatment of her soldiers). The language of the book is a little hard to follow, between regional loan words and the English of the time, but a patient and persistant reader will find the effort rewarded.A great spy novel, read it for yourself and don't trust the critics who speak based on assumptions rather than knowledge."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I feel as if I truly missed out as a lad in not reading this book. Unfortunately, the book was more or less verboten in the UK when I was young as racist, imperialist etc etcI don't find the book to be either of these things. If it's racist, then the racially superior ones are Tibetans, as personified by Kim's beloved lama, the inferior ones are Sahibs (whites), and, in particular, non-Anglo sahibs who are notably mean-spirited and cruel, not just laughable, like the Anglos. If it's imperialist, then it's only depicting the India that Kipling knows. I don't find anywhere in this book the notion that this should always be the case or that Indians couldn't eventually win their independence. There may be undertones to this effect. But undertones, of course, are notoriously ambiguous and subjective.What this book IS then is a lovely adventure and spy novel, as well as a sort of Bildungsroman for Kim. It is also a book whose main character seems, at times, to be the Indian land itself, portrayed lovingly and gracefully throughout the work--and also, it's just good rollicking fun!No, it's not exactly literature. Aside from the lama's speculation on the wheel of life, and on the illusory nature of the senses, no profound insights abound. But Kipling is not a particularly introspective writer.Note: Those of you with the Penguin Classics edition and Edward Said's rambling 50 page introduction, pray don't bother with it. It's nothing more than an obfuscatory, academic apologia for Kipling's racism and imperialism, evident perhaps in other works, but not here, which I suppose Penguin felt they had to include. Bother it. Jump headlong into the adventure!"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This classic story of a young English boy's coming of age in India is a tale for all ages and all times. Kipling's young hero becomes the dedicated disciple of an ancient, wandering Tibetan monk in search of a legendary river which will wash all of his sins away. Our young hero has a quest as well, and its coming about thrusts him into a different world entirely. Their adventures unfold on the Grand Trunk Road, taking them across the vast subcontinent and introducing readers to a broad cross-section of Indian life and its people at the turn of the 20th century. How Kim resolves the inherent inconsistencies of his life choices is a fascinating process, and the story ends too soon--we find ourselves wishing for it never to end. You will want to reread this wonderfully written book over and over, and find new levels of understanding and pleasure with each reading."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is Rudyard Kipling's mysterious India: a combination of East and West, of mystery and mysticism. Kim is not the India of history books. It is not a neat historical fiction nor is it a simple adventure story in a slightly exotic setting.Kim was published in 1901 and is the story of the orphaned son (Kimball O'Hara, known as Kim) of a soldier in an Irish regiment. The novel is set in the Indian subcontinent where Kim spends his childhood as a waif in Lahore.The story of Kim's journeys, as he moves between the East and the West can be enjoyed as an adventure story or read as a window into British colonialism. Kim himself straddles a number of different worlds but never really belongs to any of them completely.While the novel includes a richly detailed portrait of Indian life and assumes that western mastery is desirable, Kipling frequently identifies similarities between the cultures of India and those of the Europeans in India.This is a novel which I think is best read twice. Once as a child - for the adventure and mystery and again as an adult for the broader story.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I loved the imagery in Kim. The vivid representation of live in India under the British, although idealized, creates a reading experience that surpasses most of Kiplings writing. The way in which he represented the clash of cultures and religions was well done although skewed by Kiplings own beliefs. Through these clashes Kim takes an image of its own, both beautiful as well as insightful."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The orphaned son of a British Army officer learns the way of the streets of India, where he acts as a courier, and sometimes a spy, for locals who are in the pay of the British as spies, in their pursuit of the Great Game, in which the 19th century empires of Europe and Asia vie for control of India - the jewel-in-the crown of the British Empire.At the age of thirteen, Kim befriends a Lama who is seeking a mystical river. Kim accompanies him on his search, and takes an important message to a British Officer regarding the nature of a white stallion's pedigree, which is really information about a tribal conspiracy. So Kim embarks upon an adventure which will lead him to his father's old regiment and his induction - after suitable testing - into the Great Game.Not too much to do with the British Empire directly in terms of the Imperium and the underdog, the Indians with their tribal fiefdoms and a myriad of caste and religious divisions keeping the pot boiling well enough on their own. So there's not much jingoism evident.I was struck by how much a couple of the characters resembled some of those by Fritz Leiber, and C.J. Cherryh. Kim was akin to Fritz Leiber's Gray Mouser. And the old woman in the carriage reminded me of Illisidi from C.J. Cherryh's Foreigner series.I found the quality of the writing suffered from very abrupt changes in events, which required a couple of re-reads of many sections to get the hang of what had just happened. The most literary section was the one describing Kim and the Lama's trek through the mountains in the end section. The rest was to a good standard, but would have benefited from a more point-of-view style to keep things on a more even keel."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"good book, but this digital format is messed up. whoever converted this from the gutenberg project version didn't do it right."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Although I had to read this book for a class I enjoyed it. It was a fun read and easy to follow. I recommend it to anyone interested in Indian history."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"'Kim', taken solely on its own terms, is a late 19th century adventure tale, an early spy story, a travelogue of northern India, a coming-of-age story all set in the midst of the Great Game, the Russo-British contest for imperial dominance in Central Asia. It's a good tale well told, if the language is somewhat dated for the modern reader.But, of course, 'Kim' is generally not simply taken on it own terms because its author Rudyard Kipling came to personify British imperialism as much as Lord Kitchener. The Norton Edition includes excellent articles that provide historical context as well as several critical essays. I consider myself an anti-imperialist, but also admittedly somewhat of a romantic about the British Empire, and I did not detect jingoism in 'Kim'.Readers interested in even more background will want to readQuest for Kim: In Search of Kipling's Great Game. Readers needing to be disabused of romanticism about British imperialism may want to considerImperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya.At the end of the day, 'Kim' is quite a good adventure tale and a book that really need to read for yourself. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I have to admit, I struggled for the first 4 or so chapters. I was about to give up, mostly because of the foreign vernacular and customs. But I hung in there and ended up becoming totally absorbed. The adventure and intrigue kept me turning the pages late into the night. The imagery was rich and exotic. Although the difficult reading often frustrated me, causing me to re-read sections because I worried I was missing something, the language also added to the richness of the story.One recommendation: if you don't &quot;get&quot; something right away, don't get too hung up on it because you will probably end up figuring it out. Keep going because it'll develop over time.It's a totally unique story with unique characters, made even more interesting by the history it is based on. In the end I was disappointed it was over. If you're willing to have a little patience, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Yes, if all you've read is John Clancy, Kim is a bit of a change. But so are Dickens or Shakespeare or Melville. The thing that might be intriguing to a certain sort of reader is that Kim is constantly being torn between the material world of the Great Game and the spiritual world of the Teshoo Lama. How he resolves the conflict reflects Kipling's choice, but in someone else's hands, the resolution might be different. Kim was one of two &quot;bathroom books&quot; I read and re-read during college. If you like stories of the choices young men make as they grow to adulthood, Kim is for you. Stick with it, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I enjoyed this book. I think it is a very good insight to older Indian culture under English control. The story is about a young boy who goes on a journey with a Buddist llama in his search for the river that will cleanse all sins. Kim encounters many adventures and interesting situations as he gets involved in British military affairs. I would recommend this book for those who are interested in more challenging reading have an attraction for both the cultural and the spiritual."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I read KIM at school. We studied at the Convent school so reading KIM was part of our curriculum. And I must say KIM was the first introduction of a colonial era, now far removed, from the perspective of an English author. Before reading KIM my only introduction to life before partition of Subcontinent in 1947 was via the lens provided by my grandparents, for they had migrated along with millions of Muslims on the eve of partition. So reading KIM was like hearing another episode from the man who belonged to the rulers and not the ruled. So off course there was a perspective shift and we thought that it was a bit racist. But after re-reading KIM - I still have that copy from my school days - and after reading general history of British India, I think although Rudyard was being a bit racist but he loved India to the hilt. He loved Pathans so much that his main character besides KIM in the novel is a Pathan horse seller.My verdict: I am not going to tell you a story of that orphaned kid on the streets of Lahore. But I must say that you better buy this book. And read it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling's KIM is perhaps the best spy novel of the last 200 years. It is strikingly contemporary in its portrayal of the dark and dirty side of the spy game, its robust understanding of India, and its honest respect for the myriad ethnic differences of that complex nation. The darker works of John le Carre such as THE SPY WHO CAME IN FORM THE COLD come close to matching the weltshmertz but not the grit and sophistication of Kipling's presentation of the Great Game as it was played in India. KIM paints a world in which no one can be trusted and any, even children, may be sacrificed to advance government policy.The reader would do well to do a little research into the Great Game, the first Cold War, an espionage battle between Britain and Imperial Russia between the early 1800s and the Russian Revolution (and in fact, until India's independence in 1947). Generations of British spies earned their bones in the Great Game, and the lessons they learned shaped British intelligence through the Cold War. Many have tried to convey the utter creepiness of espionage at the street level. No one succeeds like Kipling."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling, Rudyard (1901) Kim.Kim is an old book. It was published in 1901. That does not mean that it is not a good read now. Briefly, it deals with a boy who is English in India during the time when England ruled India as one of its colonies. The story takes place after the Indian mutiny of 1858 when many families were split by violence. Kim survives with his native ayah. Eventually he changes from being with his nursemaid to being with a lama, a Tibetan monk who wonders the roads of India looking for enlightenment. The period immediately after the mutiny was a time of immense upheaval in India. It went from being a country made up of many native princely states with Englishmen as merchants to one unified under the flag of England. There was tension between the English in India and the Indians, as is always the way when colonialism occurs. There was also sometimes a devout love of India by those same ruling Englishmen and women, though they might be blind to their own ignorance and blindspots.India is a land of extremes and magnitudes. The climates range from the hot, dry and low to the snowy cold heights of the Himalayas. There are vast numbers of peoples, religions, languages, cuisines, arts and cultures. The north of the land is different from the south, the west from the east. Into this mixture of people, events, agendas and intersections, Kipling pops down a young boy Kim. The book is his story; where he goes, who he deals with, what he does and for whom and why. It is an amazing story that captures ones imagination. One author: T.N.Murari, an Indian was so taken with Kipling's character that more than three quarters of a century after the original story was written and published, Murari published two sequels to Kim. One; The Imperial Agent picks up where Kim left off and the second; Last Victory continues on after that. They are also set against the dramatic historical events that took place in India between 1858 and 1920. They too, show how history looks when it is lived day by day by just a few people. Kim comes to mind again now, since the world is again facing issues of national sovereignty. Kipling never thought that the mutiny of 1858 was a step in the fight for India's independence because he was so convinced of the rightness of England's rule. He was convinced that what England was doing was right. Kim is a boy. He goes back and forth between the worlds of the English and the Indians. When he works for the English he is surprised when he figures out that he has been used. This book is a good read and it could provoke some thought now that boys are once again thinking that what one white country does in ruling a non white country is right. Murari being Indian, does take the action further in time than Kipling did and it finishes the story perhaps differently than Kipling might have, but it works well. These are three books to read, to enjoy, to think about and to then leap from onto other books about the wonderful land that is, was and always will be India.Murari, T.N.(1988) Imperial Agent.

Hodder and Stoughton, UK New English Library"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Rudyard Kipling's reputation fell for awhile because many critics interpreted him as a mere apologist for empire. Recent criticism has reviewed his work in new light and has found his work, both stories and Kim, to be much more ambivalent about the relationship between ruler and ruled than traditional opinion held it to be. Traditional critics have often interpreted the ending of novel to portray Kim as having defintively chosen the English side of his English/Indian duality. Such interpretaion makes it seem Kipling himself thought that the English way was the better. Some of the postcolonial literary theorists , however, find no resolution of Kims character in the end of the novel but interpret the ending as just another indication of Kims ongoing ambivalence as he straddles two very distinct cultures. Perhaps only in the interior worlds of characters like Kim do the east and the west meet. Such a reading makes the experience of reading the book a much less resolved and so richer one. Also the stories are full of a similar ambivalence about English rule in India. Kipling often employs invented narrators who are used ironically to comment on the action of the stories being told. Some reviewers interpret the invented narrators views to be Kiplings own, a mistake which leads to simplified readings of the stories which are full of unresolved and contradictory elements. Kipling as shown by the careful readings of postcolonial critics was a much more complex character than he was traditionally thought to be and whose fiction refelects his own complex ambivalence toward the English presence in India."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I had not read Kim since my childhood in the 40s, and had not thought to reread it as I assumed it would be too \\"old fashioned\\".But I found it wondering through the Kindle listings and decided to give it a try. I've since read and reread it 3 times. It's an amazing book--the characters of Kim and his Teacher, and many of the peripheral characters are distinctly drawn, and very real. The drawings are quite wonderful too; even on my iPhone they stand out and help to picture Kim and the Lama. I am so happy to have re-discovered Kim, and Kipling as well.The book is even more fun in tandem with one of Laurie R King's Mary Russell novels, The Game, which carries on with Kim's story."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Bigoted and Prejudiced. No, I'm not referring to \\"Kim,\\" but rather myself, at least in relationship to Kipling. It was the three words in the subject line that hung like a millstone around Kipling's neck. Admittedly, I never read the poem, and it too seems to be more complex than the simple phrase that seems to exhort the \\"white man\\" (as it was, in a more sexist era) to the \\"duty\\" to raise the \\"natives\\" into civilized enlightenment (a concept that resonated with the French as well, and whose practice was, well, so often diametrically opposed.) But my reviewer colleague slightly to my north, RM Peterson, prodded me, more than once, to read a book he has read several times. And so we made a \\"deal,\\" and he would read one of my favorites that he normally would not have. Talk about the \\"burden\\" of trying to enlighten your fellow man... ( a concept that is still not fully PC).And what I found was a marvelously complex and insightful novel that depicted so much that was the wonder of India at the end of the 19th century. Kim or Kim(ball) could be a model for multiculturalism and even, ugh, \\"diversity training.\\" He is left a street orphan after his parent's death (his father was a soldier in the Irish Guards.) He manages to scratch out a living, mainly begging, with Hindustani as his first language. A \\"mere\\" youth, he grows up quickly, developing a sound judgment of human character; he is precocious in accessing the ways of power. Depending on the circumstances, he can be a model of propriety, or an utter scoundrel.There are several themes woven into the novel. Kim becomes a chela (disciple) to a lama (a holy man) from Tibet who is seeking Enlightenment (different than that peddled by the colonial powers), \\"The River,\\" and release from the \\"Wheel\\" of reincarnation. (At times, this bordered on Hesse'sSiddhartha). As a counterbalance to the spiritual, there are the efforts by British military personnel to recruit young Kim into what was dubbed \\"The Great Game.\\" That was the conflict between Britain and Russia for dominance in Central Asia, well documented by Peter Hopkirk in his excellent book of the same nameThe Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia (Kodansha Globe). \\"Kim\\" is referenced three times in Hopkirk's book. With Kim's language ability, and his nuanced understanding of the customs and habits of various ethnic groups, he becomes natural spy material. But as the chief recruiter, Colonel Creighton warns him: \\"... if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down other than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain.\\" Other longer native portraits involve the wily Muslim horse-trader who frequently visits \\"beyond the passes\\" (in present day Afghanistan) and returns with goods more valuable than horses (information!). Another is a double-dealing Bengali, Hurree Babu, who helps the Russians late in the novel: \\"The reason of his friendliness did him credit. With millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon Russia as the great deliverer from the North.\\" There are numerous female characters, most are depicted as being fairly strong and forthright, including the Woman of Shamlegh who seems to have her eye on some good genes recalling a lost Sahib love.Is Kipling racist? I saw no evidence in this book. True, there is the \\"n-word,\\" but it is coupled with an admonition by the Colonel not to involve oneself with the students who have that outlook. The author seemed to be an \\"equal opportunity\\" user of sardonic observations, certainly including those directed at British rule. Consider his comment on an Army Chaplin: \\"Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of \`heathen.'\\"There are numerous observations of the human condition that remain all too true more than a century later: \\"Sahibs are always tied to their baggage,\\" or on professional rivalries: \\"All we ethnological men are as jealous as jackdaws of one another's discoveries.\\" America has now replaced Britain as the dominant imperial power in the area, with seemingly far less insight into the \\"natives\\" than a Kim would provide. In the \\"Plus ca change...\\" category of eternal truths, as the present-day newspaper accounts of missing billions merely confirm Kipling's words in Colonel Creighton's mouth: \\"One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit... the funds are administered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present itemized accounts.\\" But did they have Swiss banks back then?Kipling writes well, and I liked his technique of utilizing Hindi or Urdu words, coupled with the English meaning, which, inter alia, reminded me what \\"pukka\\" means. Thanks for the recommendation Mike. It is both the history of a time and place, and yet another guide for contemporary events. Certainly 5-stars until the next re-read."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"[...]When I was twelve, my mother decided to donate our complete edition of Kipling to the library. I pleaded with her not to, on the grounds that I needed it for my master's thesis. She said that a twelve-year-old couldn't possibly know what she needed for her thesis, and the donation was duly made. Twenty years later, I wrote my master's thesis on Kipling, concentrating on Kim. My mother apologized.Kim is a miracle of realism in fiction, in the American school of realism rather than the English or European style of realism. According to many Indian critics, Kipling's enthralling picture of the Grand Trunk Road is unparalleled in its loving accuracy. The babu who is a Bengali and therefore very easily frightened proves himself to be a miracle of courage. The lama's visit to the Museum which of which Kipling's father was chief curator is described also with loving accuracy. And the character of Kim is based on countless Anglo-Indian children, although Kim himself is pure Irish.Although Nobel Prizes are given for an author's complete body of work, it was never any secret that it was Kim who tipped the scales for Kipling; the prize for literature for that year was shared between Kipling and Mark Twain, who wrote the Great American Novel, Huckleberry Finn, which shares many of the same traits as Kim. The plots are totally different, though Huck's relationship with Jim is somewhat similar to that of the lama and Kim, but the realistic portrayals of an idiosyncratic society seen from someone living a picaresque lifestyle are equally powerful. Kipling, who had adored Twain since he first began to read him and had paid him an apparently unwelcome visit during his first tour of America, was overjoyed to be in such select company.I have never regretted my decision, actually made at the age of ten, to write my thesis on Kipling and concentrate on Kim. I am 67 now, and I still love Kim as much as I ever did. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, nor do I know enough words of praise to encompass it. If you are interested in humanity, you want to read Kim."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This book is, in one word, splendid. Rudyard Kipling has become a controversial figure in today's politically correct world. His notions of the White Man's Burden and the civilizing mission of England (and America) are well-known and often cited as evidence of a racist mindset and disposition. KIM, however, serves to bring out the basic humanity in Kipling's character. It is certainly one of his best works of fiction, if not the best. Kipling's great knowledge and love of India and its diverse peoples shine through on every page, as do his way with words, his story-telling ability, and his intellectual depth. The concluding passages of the book are breathtaking in their literary beauty."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"\\"Who is Kim?\\" is the rhetorical question posed several times in this novel of India under the Raj (Queen Victoria, latter 19th Century). Born of British parents but raised as an orphan by natives, this unique boy is a Eurasian sprite, a gamin not only of the streets but also the plains and ulitmately, the hills.Comfortable in various dialects and delighting in disguses andurban pranks, Kim little realizes that Fate is grooming him for the Great Game (secret service to Great Britian). Indeed Kipling frequently uses the horse metaphor, with the boy as \\"the colt.\\" Ignorant of his true heritage and birthright, this merry and resouceful hustler attaches himself to an aged holy man--a seeker of the Way. As the tale progresses, there develops acurious but deep bond between the Tibetan Red Hat and his quick-witted CHELA (servant.)This unlikely duo sets out across the Hind, each following his own, private Quest: for Kim it's a red bull on a green field which will make his fortune; for the Lama it's a special river which will grant him ultimate peace.Mutually dependent for philosopical wisdom and street smarts, for phsyical sustenance and moral enlightenment, the pair encounters many stangers and surprising allies on their journey, discreetly underscored by Her Majesty's desire to learn the disposition of certain Rajahs and devious foreigners. No one can be trusted in this land of passion and self-gratification, but there is a legitimate need for an accurate Survey of the subcontinent.Rudyard Kipling's background and jounalistic experiences in India--\\"the Jewel in the Crown\\"--provide vivid inspiration and exhaustive detail for this tapestry of a multi-cultured nation in political bondage. He endows his young protagonist (aged 12-16) with many endearing qualities, but never permits him to forget that he was a Sahib--with a duty to the Great Game of international and internal espionage. Kim forms several unique friendships as he tramps the Grand Trunk, the dusty plains even into the high Hills. To be sure he acquires a formal, Sahib's education, but it is on the road as a willing wayfarer that he accumulates diverse skills in native arts. For young Mister O'Hara is being trained--not as a soldier--but as a chain man for the prestigious Ethnological Survey. Kipling blends narration with clever dialgoue, action with introspective reflection, as old man and boy seek their individual paths in life. Kim represents the best of both (or multiple) worlds--enthusiastically dedicated to her Majesty's illustrious service. A children's classic to be enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I wonder if Kipling's most vitriolic critics have read anything about him (or by him) besides caustic post-colonial dissertations. Surely they can't pretend that they've read KIM with silly labels such as &quot;imperialistic,&quot; &quot;ignorant,&quot; &quot;globalizing,&quot; and &quot;racist.&quot; I advise these misguided flowers to read without agendas.But of course reading without agendas nowadays would so offend our academies that it's absolutely impossible. KIM *is* a simple story, as one reviewer already mentioned, that does not really deal with colonial &quot;assumptions&quot; whatsoever. In fact, I marvel at how people ignore the basic fact that Kim resisted his Sahib identity when we could only sympathize with him. Kim contrasts well with THE JUNGLE BOOK'S Mowgli because he disdains most social groups, preferring above all his lama and &quot;the road.&quot; If anything, his &quot;yearning&quot; toward colonization near the book's end (itself dubiously proven) probably reflects his educational indoctrination, if anything else. Kipling surely wasn't a stupid writer, and it's probably no coincidence that Kim turns to colonialism only after the Sahibs educate and recruit him in &quot;the Great Game.&quot; Whether that's good or bad is irrelevant; Kipling does not justify, advocate or endorse colonialism in KIM. Nor does he waste space needlessly attacking it. Why do people need fiction to contain ideology? Why can't people understand that some stories are about characters and that authors imposing their voices is sometimes unnecessary? &quot;Adult&quot; perspectives in the novel, which critics charge could never come from Kim, come from adult characters. Duh. Kipling, unlike his postmodern butchers, did not write with an agenda.Unfortunately for his reputation, Kipling professed elsewhere that he favored colonialism and the White Man's Burden. Readers, even more unfortunately, approach his books with such prejudices, prepared to pounce on his literature at the slightest provocation and blame him for not explicitly condemning British imperialism. I'm sorry that people hold such depressing views of how fiction should be written.A note on the Penguin edition: I found its CONSTANT &quot;scholastic&quot; footnotes irritating and insulting. I can read a book without being told what Buddhism is, thanks. Then again, all those numbers detract from the story itself and advocate the editor's agenda that this book isn't to be enjoyed at all, but only to be jeered at in a postmodern armpit."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This is a very entertaining novel, though not as good as the best of Kipling's short stories. As an adventure-oriented bildungsroman, Kim is well constructed with its gradual exposure of the ethnic and religous diversity of India, its engaging characters, and good quality of writing. While written as an adventure novel, Kim is also Kipling's prediction of the British Raj would become. The hero, Kim O'Hara, is in many ways an idealization of what saw as the logical conclusion of British India; a hybrid composed of both Indian and British elements. In an ironic way, this is how things turned out in British India. But where Kim is ethnically British with a largely Indian cultural background, the real inheritors of the British Raj were ethnic Indians (of a variety of ethnicities, castes, and faiths) whose outlook is colored strongly by Western influences.How this book is read in a 'post-colonial' era is an interesting question. It would be easy, and wrong, to dismiss this book merely as an Imperialist tract, though Kipling clearly supported British Imperial control. It is even wronger to attack Kipling's racism, though there are unquestionably stereotyped elements present. In many ways, Kim is a celebration of India's ethnic and religous diversity. Probably the most unsympathetic characters in the book are not Indian, but Britishers with provincial outlooks. Kipling's support of the Empire is rather more subtle. It is clear that he viewed the existence of the huge and relatively tolerant polyglot society that was the Raj as the result of relatively benign British rule and protection. This is probably true. Without British overlordship, India is likely to have been a congeries of competing states riven by ethnic and religous divisions. Where Kipling is profoundly misleading is what he leaves out, particularly the economic exploitation India and crucial role India played in the Imperial economy."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is Rudyard Kipling's novel about a white orphan, Kimball O'Hara, in India. It was first published in 1901, and is often considered to be Kipling's best novel. In the novel, Kim befriends a Tibetan Lama and becomes his disciple. Later, the British force him to attend a British school. Afterward, he rejoins the Lama, and becomes involved in political intrigue between Britain and Russia.Kim is noteworthy for Kipling's lush depictions of India, its people, its culture, and its religions. In spite of everything that goes on in this novel, there's no real plot - it's just Kim's wanderings around India. And this is the vehicle Kipling uses to celebrate India. This is well and good, but it isn't all that interesting. The story loses quite a lot of steam after Kim gets into British custody. Perhaps the story holds more allure for those of us who have not been to India (I have, several times).Ultimately, this is about as good a portrayal of India as you can find in a novel. That is what this book should be read for, not its story."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The description claims the Kindle edition has page numbers.

It is a great story with great characters. The only problem is that without an understanding of the history and culture of India/Pakistan, much of the nuance of this story gets lost in translation.

Proper quotes, italics, dashes, but often open quotes are used for closed quotes or apostrophes, and closed quotes for open quotes. The unusual character ' is included as an image rather than as a character, and so does not scale with the other letters. Occasional OCR errors (e.g. zero for capital O) and incorrect extra paragraph breaks. The footnotes in the introduction are not hyperlinked. The footnotes/glossary entries in the main text of the book (of which there are a large number) are hyperlinked, with link numbers rather than linking directly from the word. A nicely linked table of contents. I would prefer it if the book opened at the start of the story, but that's a minor quibble. The text gives a blank line between each paragraph, as well as indenting the first line, and some of the extras could be formatted a little better.Overall, a reasonable edition, let down by poor proofing of the text. It does have copious hyperlinked glossary entries, which is a plus.If you're looking for a Kindle edition of Kim, don't just search for \\"Kim\\". That only finds a few of the many editions.

Kipling's _Kim_ was on the list. Having a passing familiarity with Kipling (his poetry I find a bit offensive, hisThe Jungle Book (Unabridged Classics)was fun, though), I thought I'd give this a try. I was terribly disappointed.First, the language was overwrought - even for late 19th century writing, Kipling is over the top. An excerpt: \\"Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul might be. The seizure came of a sudden. I know. Who should know but I? Wither goest thou?\\" This wasn't vernacular English even in Kipling's day, and frankly was too much - particularly considering the social classes of the speakers. I made allowances for the pro-imperialist, pro-British (and vehemently anti-Indian) tone of the book given the author and time period, although I can see how this would rankle some. The story is also liberally peppered with colloquialisms in Hindi, Urdu and perhaps other languages; while this gives some flavor to the story, it may be a distraction to some. (I sort of enjoyed it.) The greatest obstacle, however, was the glacial pace of the book. Kim - Kimball O'Hara - is the orphaned son of a British soldier who was raised as a native. While guiding a Buddhist lama across India, he comes across his father's old regiment, who take it upon themselves to educate Kim (a \\"proper\\" British education, that is), and recognizing his skills, to recruit him as a spy in \\"the Great Game.\\"This is all well and good, and in many respects creates the formula for the \\"espinonage\\" genre - but the story moved so slowly towards those ends, it was all I could do to muster the willpower to plow through chapter after chapter of young Kim running away from his British school to hang out with the locals, to be pulled back to school, to run away again ... all the while, of course, Kim is learning \\"trade craft\\": disguise, customs, observing details, learning about human nature. It made for painful reading.Why three stars, then? For all its shortcomings and the issues I had in reading through it, Kipling certainly celebrates India: the various cultures, the sounds, sights, flavours and rich diversity are detailed here and make for a veritable smorgasbord of what colonial India must have been like. The racial undertones, its \\"burden of empire\\" and the strict class differences (among Indians as well as English) aside, it is apparent how deeply attached to India Kipling was. This was the book's only redeeming feature, albiet a mighty one. With that said, I can't recommend it. If you have a tooth for Kipling, I'd recommend his stories inThe Jungle Book, which, incidentially, are very different from the Disney production. (No suprise there, I am sure.)"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This book was well-written. The characters are not as well-rounded as I expected although, by Victorian standards, they are. There are places where the writing is almost juvenile - probably the reason the book is often found on lists for young people - and others where the writing is complex enough for adult enjoyment. If I had to rate an age group for which this book would be appropriate, I would say from those that read at a grade five level to age 90. It is a good adventure book for grade school and a good book for adults seeking a little escapism in an unfamiliar time and place - a Victorian spy story to rival the more modern James Bond."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Although I have read tons of literature, I have never read Kipling, but of course have heard of him. This book was a fine adventure tale, but I suppose I was expecting something a little bit more profound and insightful. The novel has a fun plot and plenty of interesting characters, but seems void of any real conflict. Even if I got a biased view, I was looking for some insight into the politics and culture of colonial India at the turn of the century. The events and dialogue in this book all seem to touch things on the surface and at the end of day it didn't make me THINK about things like a good book does. This would be a fun book to read along with your precocious 12 year old, but I wouldn't recommend it to an adult looking for good literature. If your interested in great literary fiction dealing with India, read &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; by Rohinton Mistry..much better."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"&quot;Kim&quot; is a well-deserved classic, a fantastic amalgamation of a Boy's Own adventure tale, an on-the road book (read it with an atlas!) and a fascinating look at the politics of the day. The Great Game is the genesis of all spy novels since, from John LeCarre (who adores it) to Ian Fleming, Ross Thomas, etc. Rich, colorful, thrilling -- only for the smartest of children."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Rudyard Kipling wrote a great half of a book. Then the wheels come off the plot and it runs itself into the ground. A very disappointing finish to an action adventure story. Kipling alternates between philosophical ideas and action, but this mixture eventually becomes both uneven and heavy handed. Bluntly, Kipling ran out of steam.Kim is the story of a white boy (another review said he was indian and white, but although his nursemaid was indian, his mother and father were white) who as an orphan becomes a messanger boy in the city. He delights in mimicry of the different castes.Then he becomes the chela (disciple) of a Tibetan lama who is on a spiritual quest. Kim is entranced with the journey rather than the spiritual quest.Kipling does a wonderful job of describing the sights and sounds of India. The religious philosophy insights are banal, however Kipling's own opinions about religious tolerance are more substantial.On the journey, Kim is again employed as a messanger boy. Now the action adventure side of the story comes to the foreground as Kim's role progresses from messanger boy to something more.This book doesn't live up to its promise in terms of plot, but Kipling's skillful use of character and description remain intact.Another reviewer wrote that there were sequels to Kim written by another author. I haven't read them yet, but a continuation of the action would greatly be appreciated so I'm glad someone wrote them. The sequels are:Murari, T.N.(1988) Imperial Agent. Hodder and Stoughton, UK New English LibraryMurari, T.N.(1989) Last Victory.

But recognised as a 'sahib' he is drawn into the \\"Great Game\\" of imperialism,but his heart is with India and the teachings of the lama....A thin plot of spies and espionage surrounds a book that is much more the India of Kipling's heart; the bazaars, the bustle of life on the road , villages and towns; the plains and the hills and eastern religions customs and philosophies.The \\"thee's\\" \\" thou's\\" and esoteric allusions to Indian customs may lose some readers, but the annotations are superb as is Kipling's imagry of India. Kipling was undoubtably a shameless imperialist, believing in the 'good' the British brought to a 'heathen' class, but anyone reading \\"Kim\\" or indeed many of his short stories,would think the opposite is true. That Kim is of Irish parentage, and that the Catholic Father Victor is much more worldly and wise than the buffoon Bennett-the Church of England priest- goes completely against the patriotic jingoism of the day, and the wide, wonderful , vibrant and exciting world of native Indians contrasts vividly to the narrow ettiquette ridden world of the British colonial where \\"great game\\" intriques supplant the wonder of existence. Kipling also shows huge sympathy with the Lama's Buddhist philosophies and morals.So reading between the lines, one wonders if Kipling's over zealous patriotism was so much of a front that he couldn't maintain when writing of his love of a country;India. In his own life, India gave him everything whilst England gave him misery. It's oft said that the most outrageously pro or anti advocates are closet sympathisers with the cause they profess to support or oppose; who knows ? Was Kipling such a person ?Its this level of surprise in \\"Kim\\" as well as the scenery painted and even the waffer thin sub plot of spying that makes this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Am and have been a Kipling fan for years, so this was a 4th or 5th reread, and I enjoy it more each time."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Rudyard Kipling's \\"Kim\\" is one of my favorite books, and I originally downloaded a free version of it.

It was a joy to read: the Indian words were linked to a glossary in the back, the quotes and titles were formatted in such a way as to pleasantly distinguish them from the text, the text adjusted to font size changes, and overall it was remarkably error-free.Many thanks to the publisher who put in the time and effort for an excellent edition of \\"Kim.\\""},{"Title":"Kim","review":"It's funny, whenever I use those words \\"one of the best novels ever written,\\" I seem to be writing about some book which the Anointed Professors of English Literature never even think about.\\"Kim\\" is a great example of that. I read it first when I was about 13, and loved it. I re-read it as an adult, and got a lot more out of it. For one thing, Kipling knew what he was talking about. While leftist professors would bleat of imperialism, racial oppression, colonialism, deconstruction and the rest, Kipling was actually way ahead of them. He obviously was aware of the British Raj in India, but he rather turned the situation on its head by making his hero a neglected and impoverished English boy.So the novel deals with a situation where the British are \\"oppressing\\" the Indians, and among those \\"Indians\\" is a no-account slum-dwelling English boy --- and his best friend, a wandering Tibetan monk. These two embark on a quest: Kim searching for the regiment of his long-gone father, the monk searching for his mystic river. Along the way, they meet a fantastic and believable cast of characters, painted with a true artist's brush --- the brush of an artist who truly loved India.Another novel I mention in this category isThe Moonstone (Barnes & Noble Classics)which is to my mind superior to almost anything Dickens ever wrote. And then we haveThe Way of All Flesh...that's enough for now!Happy reading to you!"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is an amazing book. No, there isn't any racism in this book. Kim, in a way, is both English and Indian, so he both makes fun of and reveres both nationalities. The author is the same way. Though this book starts out a little slow, don't give up after only the first chapter! This is a beautify written book, with unique characters and believable events. So believable, in fact, that sometimes I wondered if certain things in this book really did happen. However, this book can be hard to understand. I would not recommend reading it aloud, and it is definitely a high-school-level-and-up book. If you don't understand a paragraph when you first read it, don't get frustrated. Keep reading and it will eventually become clear. All in all, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is without a doubt a masterpiece of literature that helped Kipling get his Nobel Prize for literature.Yes, the plot does sem to be moving slowly at times, but one must read the book with 19th century India in mind, and not modern day Hollywood action films. It is said that Kim can be read many times and each time the story appears in a different light. There are many different layers to this book and the action lying at the surface is just that: the surface.

The language is smooth as flowing honey and the Indian words are used with the skill of one born and brought up there (Kipling was later sent to England to complete his schooling).Enjoyable even after years and years.I would recommend to buy the hardcover (Everyman Library) edition. A bargain at Amazon's prices"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This was a FUN book to read, not just for the many adventures undertaken, nor only for the many fine characters (Huree Babu was my favorite), but also for the smorgasborg of different races and societies depicted from an India around the turn of the century.

His understanding and imagination created this fine novel revolving an adventurous boy's forays. Happy reading. . ."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"To be honest, I disdained Kipling as a writer ever since turning away from the Jungle Book movie. When pressed to read his more representative novel &quot;Kim&quot;, however, I was much more impressed. Kipling picks up on the bildungsroman theme in his book about a young white boy growing up in British India. True, the reader feels the heavy intrusion of Kipling in the narrative, such as the caricatured descriptions of ethnic peoples, but one also feels a genuine fondness for India, however patronizingly misplaced.I thought some passages were quite remarkable for a writer at the height of the British Raj, such as the occasional sympathetic treatment of Indians and the allowance of deep relationships between the conquerors and the conquered (e.g., Kim and Mahbub Ali). The feeling of youth is well-given and Kipling succeeds at making the horror of imperialism both remote and romantic."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The tale is a classic adventure story, of Kim, Irish orphan growing up as a street urchin in northern India. It is a colourful picture of a short period in history when East and West met and were intertwined during the British Raj in India. Unromantic lefty dullards will go on about the imperialist tone of the book. But the book tells of an India so gloriously rich and diverse that the British are simply absorbed like conquerors before, one caste among hundreds: Moghuls, Brahmins and Sikhs, Pathans and Tibetans.We are left in no illusions about the political realities of imperial India. We know that the white man is in charge, though they are shown to consist of fools like the Anglican chaplain as well as good men like Colonel Creighton. Like heroes such as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings or Shasta in C S Lewis' A Horse and His Boy, Kim is always aware deep down (and it strengthens him even though at times he hates it) that he is set apart, of a nobler race, because he is a Sahib. Yet this seems perfectly natural in India, a land of myriad castes and classes, from high-born Brahmins to low, despised, Untouchables.The characters are brilliant and amusing: Kim is such a lovable scamp (\\"You - you Od! Thy mother was married under a basket!\\") I find it hard to understand how anyone can fail to be immediately absorbed in his world and his fortunes. Hurree Babu and Mahbub Ali are likeable Indian characters. The Tibetan holy man, whom Kim follows as a disciple, portrayed in such a tender light that for all his scattiness one believes in his holiness, and we understand why Kim follows and loves him like a father.But this is a boy's book, and the female characters are marginal and unsympathetically treated. Most will find the Indian slang and jargon tough going, unless they are willing to skim it over, and it is often necessary to keep a finger on the glossary at the end of the book. Nonetheless, beautifully written, and a Good Read."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is a young boy, a naughty rascal from the streets of Lahore, very much in the tradition of Huck Finn or L&aacute;zaro de Tormes, heroes of the picaresque. He is the child of a dead Irish soldier and a native woman who is addicted to opium, so he is pretty much on his own, wandering around all day and being called &quot;the friend of all the world&quot;. He has been told that he is destined for great things, and that he will meet his fate when he sees &quot;a red bull on a green field&quot;. One day, a mysterious holy man arrives in Lahore and Kim leaves with him. He travels around India with this holy lama, experiencing many adventures in this vast, colorful and dangerous land. Of course he meets his destiny and soon he is playing &quot;the Great Game&quot;, that is, he becomes a spy for the English crown in its war to retain control over India and Afghanistan (yep, trouble goes that far back and more).This is simply a delightful book about an extraordinary hero and his even more extraordinary mentor, the wise lama. If you are attracted by India, this will be a real treat, since it allows you to experience the magic, color, tastes and smells of this interesting nation, in the midst of exciting adventure and spy-games. Kipling was a very good writer who had the trick of writing intelligent books disguised as children iterature. Don't let him cheat you: this is a great novel about a bygone age."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Thirteen-year-old Kimball O'Hara Jr., known as Kim, is the son of an Irish sergeant in the British army stationed in India. Kim's mother, also Irish, died after he was born, and his father died about the time Kim was three, presumably from the effects of alcoholism and opium use. O'Hara left the boy in the care of a half-caste Indian woman of questionable reputation, and so Kim grew up in the streets of Lahore, then part of British India, now in Pakistan. The woman told Kim the words of his father, that he was to look for a Red Bull on a green field and everything would be all right. Sometimes Kim runs errands for his friend Mahbub Ali, a Muslim Afghan horse trader, to Col. Creighton, which are in actuality bits of information for British Intelligence.One day while Kim is playing on Zam-Zammah, a huge cannon outside the Lahore Museum which the natives call the Wonder House, he assists an elderly Buddhist monk who is coming to the museum for information about the location of a special holy river to gain enlightenment. The lama takes Kim as his chela or disciple, and Kim, with his desire for adventure, decides to go with the monk in search of the river. While on their journey, they come across a British army regiment whose flag is a Red Bull on a green field. The two chaplains of the regiment, Mr. Bennett and Father Victor, send Kim to school at St. Xavier's in Lucknow, and to gain merit for good deeds the lama, actually a wealthy abbot, pays for his education. Creighton, a British intelligent agent posing as an ethnician, realizes that Kim, with his ability to blend with the culture, will make an excellent spy, so with the help of Mr. Lurgan, an India-born English trader and the semi-anglicized Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, a Hindu Bengali Babu, Kim learns the \\"Great Game\\" of espionage. Now sixteen, following his three years of schooling, he rejoins the lama so that he can help Huree track down a Frenchman and a Russian who are spying in India. In the process Kim is injured and becomes very ill. Will he survive?While Kim, set in the 1880s and 90s, is a book about a young boy growing up, it is not really a book for children. There are references to opium use, smoking tobacco, and harlots, all quite accurate historically I'm sure, but not for small ears. The language is not too bad, although the \\"h\\" and \\"d\\" words appear once or twice, Hurree has the frequent bad habit of using an abbreviated form of the \\"d\\" word, the name of God is found as an interjection a few times, and the term \\"ba*t*rd\\" occurs once. We did this as a family read aloud, and it required a fair amount of editing. The plot is at times somewhat difficult to follow, primarily because of the descriptiveness and the heavy use of India place names and Hindustani words. But when all that is waded through, there is actually an interesting story with a great deal of adventure and action to it. Perhaps a \\"Junior Classics\\" version might be useful for younger children. It gives a very down-to-earth picture of life in India during the late 1800s and would make a good fictional complement to accompany a study of that country's history."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"'Kim' is a work that could receive very different reviews depending on the biases of the reviewer.Any professor from the English department of my alma mater (Rutgers) would insist that 'Kim' should never under any circumstances receive any praise as it is racist, glorifies imperialism, was writen by a dead white male, and lacks a political philosophy acceptable to a modern progressive liberal. Well, I suppose that it lacks any real political philosophy (except some very general complimentary comments about democracy) and Rudyard Kipling is dead, white and male, but the first two comments are completely wrong and and this sort of review is the voice of ignorance.A staunch traditionalist, conservative would insist that it is a canonical work that should be read by every school child as a superior example of English literature and the epitomy of the written Enlish language. This is equally ill-informed and ill-considered.'Kim' is a wonderful story of an orphan in India (the part that is now Pakistan; Abid-please consider it a gesture of respect that I mention the change in geography) in the late 1800s. Kim is the son of an Irish soldier raised by locals, familiar with the customs and languages of the Hindus and Muslims of the area who gets recruited by the British to spy for them. Kim acts as a guide for a Tibetan Buddhist priest who is on a quest in India, broadening his knowledge of the cultures of his world and giving him an excuse to travel even further. He comes upon his father's regiment, and the officers of the regiment arrange for Kim to attend a 'proper' British school. Throughout the story, a British spymaster is helping Kim receive an education (both formal and in the skills needed to serve the British rule in India) and arranging for Kim to carry messages and run small but important tasks for him.Throughout the book, the only Indian group that is treated with disrespect is Hindus who have sacrificed their own culture's customs in order to get ahead in the British goverment. Frequently, the low opinion of the British held by the Indians (Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist) is mentioned, and is usually pretty funny. The other European powers that are mention in the book are not treated with respect, but that is understandable (at least to me in context; other readers will have to make up their own minds).Kipling's passion for the land he was raised in and his love for the peoples he was raised with is unmistakable, as is his love/hate relationship with the British government (N.B. he was not knighted in a time when most prominent authors were; he was entirely too candid about the British rule in India and the Crown's treatment of her soldiers). The language of the book is a little hard to follow, between regional loan words and the English of the time, but a patient and persistant reader will find the effort rewarded.A great spy novel, read it for yourself and don't trust the critics who speak based on assumptions rather than knowledge."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is a book that I had meant to read for nearly 20 years. When I finally got around to it, I first read the Amazon.com reviews and noted they seemed to divide into two camps. The first camp was overwhelmingly favorable; the other was guardedly favorable. The reviews that were guarded said, in the aggregate, that Kim was enjoyable for various reasons, but that it bore the baggage of racism and imperialism. For these and other reasons, Kim must be seen for what it really was. And there were some reviews were quite critical -- describing Kim as a plotless, meandering exercise in boredom.The Kim that I read had a plot. A common plot. Those who have read Huckleberry Finn would recognize it. It is a coming of age novel placed about 130 years ago.Imperialism and racism.

This social structure is strikingly similar to the historical relationship between the British and the Indians during the Raj. And Kim is caught up in the Great Game, much like the historical Great Game. The British did want to continue to hold India from enemies foreign and domestic and Kim reflects that historical point of view. It was, after all, written during the Raj and within chronological shouting distance of the Game.Racism. Yes. British characters, often presented in most unsympathetic ways, do have a racial stereotype of the Indians. And, the Indians have a racial stereotype of the sahibs. But the Indians are not what they want to seem to the British -- they are much, much deeper. Babu is a Babu -- if his mask is all the reader sees. Strikingly like real life.When caught in the web of current social generalities, Kim is certainly a suspect tome. But Kim is literature. And, as literature, it is a tour de force of language and description and imagery of an India and a Raj long gone. Its main characters are all human and complex and the opposite of stereotyped. The interplay between the values and growth of the lama and the growth and experience of Kim is compelling and warming. When all is said and read, the lama has found his river in the only place it could be found. And Kim, I think, has found himself in the dust of an Indian plain ... an Indian in a Englishman's skin and an Englishman who has the gift of seeing himself as the Indian others see him.If you are interested in India, pre- or post-Raj, do yourself a favor. Settle down with Kim and travel the Great Trunk Road, winter in Simla, and seek the River of the Arrow with your lama. Don't allow modern, political generalities deny you a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This one's not properly formattedfor the KindleDon't bother!It will drive you nutsBut don't overlook the bookKipling is a lot more sophisticated than he looksSome have called this a mystery or thrillerI loved the intricate look at cultureand a little bonusA lama's enlightenment"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Review for Public Domain Books edition of Kim with ASIN: B000JQU7BMThis edition of Kim has been deleted since I first reviewed it in 2010.

He is the man for all opportunities and is called the &quot;Friend of all Mankind&quot;. He is neither Hindu nor Muslim, he is neither Buddhist nor Christian. Given his background as the orphan son of a Irish military man and a local girl he is a little bit of everything.In Kim Kipling personifies all the good of Inida while playing down the contrasts, in particular the religious one; he shows us what India would have been like in an ideal situation of mutual tolerance.Apart from these philosophical considerations, Kim is simply a very well written book. Every passage betrays Kiplings background as a poet and sometimes passages really need to be reread for their beauty. His observations are striking and one realises from time to time that it is not the writers imagination about a period long gone; he was actually part of that period.One thing Kim is not: a childrens book. Like Siddharta ,a child may be the main character, but the book is far to philosophical and aimed observing intricate human behaviour to be of much interest to children. I would even maintain that Kim should not be the first book to read about India.However, one of the best reads I had in a long time."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"It's really, really, annoying to buy a Kindle book that is full of formatting and editorial mistakes. It seems most publishers are so eager to get out e-books of their catalogs that they run them through some automated script and hope for the best. Maybe, just maybe, they'll get around to fixing any potential errors later.In contrast to all those other Kindle e-books, this version is perfect! You know someone has taken the care to make sure it is just right. The text flows beautifully, the poems are all italicized, and the endnotes work as expected (which is really useful). For $0.99, you can't go wrong!Apart from all that, the book itself is fascinating! I'm not completely done with it yet, but I love it so far. I can't believe I haven't read it until now. Well worth the time.Five stars for the book, five stars for the e-book quality.UPDATE: I've finished reading the book; no change to my review."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is a splendid novel by Rudyard Kipling. It's well worth a read.The problem is that there are a lot of Kindle versions of \`Kim' available at the Kindle store. Lots of them are terrible. A very few are good. Unfortunately, the reviews for Kim are amalgamated into one big group of reviews, and so finding the best one to buy is difficult - near impossible. And so I make this review. Well -- and I do have an edition available for the Kindle myself.Since I first made my review of kindle editions of Kim back in 2010, many new editions of Kim for the Kindle have appeared, and many of the old (terrible) ones have vanished from the Amazon catalogue.So I'm updating this review, with information on all the editions of Kim that have appeared since I last updated the review, and I've removed the notes on all those that are no longer available. This review was last updated in January 2012This review comments on each edition I've found, with a live link to the reviewed edition for the good editions and the honourable mentions. I can't link to all of the editions, because of a limit on the number of product links allowed in a review. However, I have given the ASIN for the other editions.First, the ones that have a good quality of text and formatting. All of these have proper typographic quotes and dashes, and italic text where they should. They also have reasonable or good paragraph formatting.Kim (Penguin Modern Classics)ePenguinAn excellent version of the text. Occasional typos, probably only a few more than in the printed book.The footnotes are hyperlinked both ways, so they're easy to follow.This edition also comes with an introductory essay, but opens to that, rather than the start of the actual text of Kim.This text is based on the revised text of the American 1941 Burwash edition, itself based on the English 1937-1939 Sussex edition. It therefore contains a few American spellings - chiefly of words that that take an 's' in British English and a 'z' in American English.$3.32 (list: $11.64)Kim (Penguin Classics)PenguinA nicely formatted edition with lots of extras. Indeed, so many extras that I can't comment on the text, as the sample doesn't actually get to the text itself. Hopefully based on the same clean text as the ePenguin edition ASIN B002RI9KQ8. No illustrations as far as I can tell.$8.55 (list: $11.64)Kim (Vintage Classics)Vintage DigitalA very clean copy of the text. I only found two definite typo in the sample text (Kutu instead of Kulu, and Oh instead of Oh&eacute;). It's also very nicely formatted, with good formatting of chapter starts and paragraphs. Italics, curly quotes and proper dashes, of course. No real extras - a paragraph or two about Kipling is all, really. No illustrations or annotations.$9.99 (list: $13.03)Kim (Modern Library Classics)Modern LibraryA first line indent and no spacing between paragraphs. But poor formatting fo the chapter starts. It has superscript numbers in the text that refer to a glossary at the end, but the superscripts are not hyperlinked. There is an introduction, and a map illustration. This text is based on the original 1901 version.$5.99Kim: Illustrated by J. Lockwood KiplingDurrant PublishingI believe that this is the cleanest version of the text available, i.e. with the fewest typos. It follows the Sussex edition rather than the American Burwash version as the ePenguin version does. So British spelling throughout. Hyperlinks (both ways) are used for the definitions of foreign and strange words - all of Kipling's definitions and lots more.The illustrations by Kipling's father are included at appropriate points in the text. There are ten illustrations altogether, and the cover image is a detail from one of them.No essay about the text though. And the Penguin editions have more footnotes, I think.As you have probably guessed: this is my edition!$0.99Next, some honourable mentions. These are better than most, but still with various flaws:Kim by Rudyard Kipling - Full Version (Annotated) (Literary Classics Collection)G BooksIntroductory notes and a general timeline of Kipling's era, and a few other extras, but no illustrations. Proper quotes, italics, dashes, but often open quotes are used for closed quotes or apostrophes, and closed quotes for open quotes. The unusual character u with macron is included as an image rather than as a character, and so does not scale with the other letters. Occasional OCR errors (e.g. zero for capital O) and incorrect extra paragraph breaks. The footnotes in the introduction are not hyperlinked. The footnotes/glossary entries in the main text of the book (of which there are a large number) are hyperlinked, with link numbers rather than linking directly from the word. A nicely linked table of contents. The text gives a blank line between each paragraph, as well as indenting the first line, and some of the extras could be formatted a little better.$2.99Collins Classics - KimHarperPressThis has quite a nice text, although based on an early edition, without the later minor changes that Kipling made. There are some odd errors in it: A space in the middle of a word (ador ation), extra characters at the end of a word (trunnionsbu) and occasionally an open quote that should be an apostrophe (\`\`Tis).Having said that, it does have italics and typographic quotes and proper dashes. It even has the correct u with macron character. Paragraphs all have a first line indent, even the first in a chapter. But the chapter verses and verse in the text is nicely done. According to the table of contents, it has some extras at the end, but no illustrations, and no extra annotations that I could see. Not too bad an edition, if it wasn't for the weird typos.$1.99Kim (Puffin Classics)PuffinA disappointment. Although with a nice introduction by Susan Cooper, the text is completely missing all its italics. Otherwise, it's quite well formatted, and the text seems very clean - it even has the correct u with macron character. There don't seem to be any extras except for the introduction - no annotations, no illustrations. This would be a good plain (if overpriced) edition, if it wasn't for the missing italics.$4.74 (list: $9.04)A Rip-off edition:Kim by Rudyard Kipling (SUPER ILLUSTRATED)ASIN: B006O0MD3MPublisher: 1901I suppose I ought to be flattered. This copies the text and images from my free edition that's available over at MobileRead (which has Kipling's original definitions, but none of my additional glossary entries), even to the title page which includes the words \\"Durrant Publishing, Norwich, Norfolk, England, 2010\\". Some fancy capitals have been added at the start of chapters, but it's otherwise identical.$0.99And now for all the others. For all these, I downloaded the sample, and compared against both a printed copy and my edition. Not that it usually took very long.

It has adventure, fun, suspense; it makes you think about life and people in different parts of the world. When I first read it - I was sixteen - I wanted to go to India and see all those places and villages. I read it until today with the same pleasure."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"After fifty plus years of reading, I think I can say that Kim is my favorite novel. I'm not sure it is the best novel I ever read, whatever \\"best\\" might mean, and it certainly isn't the most profound, but there is simply no other book I have enjoyed as much or have reread as often. Many other Amazon reviewers have said that they liked the book very much, often for different reasons: some like the \\"Great Game\\" aspect and others enjoy the rich narrative description of India for which the book is justly famous. (A few reviewers found the book \\"difficult\\", apparently because of the language device that Kipling uses when speakers are speaking in languages other than English, or for Kipling's use of unfamiliar words, and others found it boring, a criticism I find nearly incomprehensible. I honestly believe that if you find Kim boring, you just don't like to read fiction, except perhaps at the level of Tom Clancy novels. And don't be put off by those reviews that found the book difficult. I presume these readers were looking for a continuation of The Jungle Book and found an adult novel instead. Kim is much easier reading than the novels of many of Kipling's contemporaries, such as Conrad or James, and is no more difficult than Twain.)At least one other reviewer shares my view that in essence Kim is a coming of age novel, and one of the best, in a league with Huckleberry Finn and A Portrait of the Artist. The Great Game provides the book with the bones of a plot, and Kipling's description of India, much like Twain's description of the Mississippi River environs in Huckleberry Finn, published 16 years before Kim, is the flesh. But the heart of the book is the development of the relationship between Kim and the Red Lama, the fundamental story of two people, one an orphan boy and the other an elderly mystic, finding many of the things they are seeking in caring for and looking after one another.Again, it is hard to avoid comparing Kim with Huckleberry Finn. The core of the latter book is the development of the relationship between Huck and Jim, and it seems likely that Kipling was influenced by the earlier book. Kipling had clearly read and admired Huckleberry Finn, and once referred to its author as \\"The great and God-like Clemens.\\" Not that I find the notion that Kipling was influenced by Twain to in any way diminish Kim. It is an absolutely wonderful book and I envy anyone who hasn't read it that is about to do so. Come to think of it, that's true of both Kim and Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"In all its complexity, this really is a simple book: it is simply an exuberant vision of India.I wanted a book that would give me an English Colonialist view of India. It is a rather hard thing to find: few English Victorian writers of any consequence wrote about India. It wasn't until later, ie, Orwell and Forster, that it became a popular topic, and they wrote with a vastly different attitude. I just wanted to know what an Englishman thought of the \\"jewel in the English colonial crown\\".What I found is exactly what I wanted: so exactly that it caught me off guard. Kipling offers no politics, neither \\"problems of England in India\\" or \\"The White Man's Burden\\". Kim is, quite simply, a vision of India. Exuberant, complex, vibrant, full of energy and life and change. This is Kipling's India. It is a beautiful, mysterious, dangerous, amazing place.There is a hint of mass market fiction here -- the basic structure being a young boy, a prodigy, uniquely equipped to help the adults in important \\"adult\\" matters -- reminds me of Ender's Game or Dune (both books I loved, but not exactly \\"literature\\". But perhaps this isn't either. Such was the claim of critic after critic. But anyway.) Yet in reality it is only a device -- an excuse for Kipling to take his boy on adventures and to immerse us more fully in the pungent waters of Indian culture -- or cultures.As far as the English/Colonialism question goes, perhaps the real reason Kipling drew so much flak is because he deals his English critics the most cruel insult -- worse than calling them evil, or stupid, or wrong, he implies that they just don't matter that much. Kipling's India is a diverse place, with a plethora of people groups in it, divided by caste, religion, ethnicity, whatever. And the English, the \\"Sahibs\\"? Another people group. That's all. They don't dominate or corrupt or really change anything in any profound way; they just sort of become part of the broiling swirl of cultures and peoples that is India.--"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This novel is well-written and an example of good literature, with an interesting plot and an even more interesting list of characters. Its drawback is that it is an inherently and unabashedly imperialistic book, and India (and Indians) are ultimately quite negatively portrayed and stereotyped. Call it a classic, but imperialism is imperialism. And somehow the story of a little British boy &quot;triumphing&quot; over India doesn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Maybe this is the way things were done a hundred years ago, but today, this book wouldn't get past the first reviewer. (Nor should it.) Read it for historical purposes, to see how bad novels used to be.Otherwise, I recommend Laurie R. King's \\"The Game\\", instead -- or anything by her, for that matter. \\"The Game\\" follows Sherlock Holmes and wife Mary Russell in search of Kim, 30 years later."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"OK to start I was completely board through what I read of KIM. Dont be fooled most people who come on to write reviews are history majors and like anything that is historical. Let me tell you that for a normal person KIM will not be all that interesting! I will give Kipling credit for spending much of his life in India, this is apparent in the novel where he shows a vast understanding of the culture but again if you are not a history buff this is not a book for you."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I had heard that Kim was one of the best books of all time. Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it.Have never been so disappointed in anything.

DON'T BOTHER READING THIS."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"If you want to be bored, comfused, and perplexed, you should read this book. I would certainly not recommend it for teens and younger people. It's very confusing dialect and the story has no plot at all. In fact, if you read the preface by the author, he actually says that the book is pointless. Heres what I mean. In one chapter, the chacters sat by the side of the road ALL DAY. Well good for them, but nobody wants to read 39 pages about it. Everyone that I have talked to about this book have all dispised it for it's lack of..well...anything. In fact, I had to sit and force myself to read a chapter. When the author ends every word with a &quot;th&quot; it makes it very hard to understand what is going on. Many adults say that it is supposed to be a &quot;role model&quot; book. Is a 13-year-old boy who smokes and calls people horrible names a role model? I don't think so."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"If you are interested in Indian culture, read it. The language is so thick you have to either trudge through it to 'get it' or skim it and miss it altogether. Very time consuming for such a short novel."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim, by Rudyard Kipling, is a book that can not relate to anyone who is not connected to India today. Kim came out in the 19th century when England was in India. This book appealed to the people back home because they wanted to learn about what their relatives were experiencing down there. In our day, England is not occupying India, so there is no connection at all to India. I think that people would appreciate Kim if they lived in the 19th century, but not now in the 21st.I also think that the plot in Kim is weak. Kim is a son of two Europeans who have died; his father was in the British army, and his mother was a nurse. He is trying to find out is true identity; for even though his skin is brown, and he looks just like an Indian, Kim is of European blood. The book follows Kim and his llama(priest) friend as they journey across India in search of a special river the llama is determined to find. On the way, Kim is found by an English army regiment, and the army, after learning about who Kim really is, puts Kim in school. Kim eventually runs away from school, and becomes a spy for Britain. In the end, Kim and the llama find the special river, and Kim \\"finds\\" himself.Another drawback to people living in this day and age trying to read this book is that the book, even though very well written, is brimming with Indian words Kipling sticks in in just about every paragraph. He says, for example,\\" The old street vender gave Kim a piece of bread(nan) and told him to be off.\\" In reading the book, I found it very hard to read around these \\"road blocks\\" without getting distracted.I do not recommend this book to anyone who has never had any experiences overseas in the land of India."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"If you want to read a book where there is no plot, no action and no humor look no further than Kim. Too bad Kipling spent so many years writing this novel. Just So Stories and the Jungle Book are childhood favorites of mine, Kim just lacks that charming quality in this adult novel. Think Huck Finn meets Pip set in India with no where to go and nothing to do."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Please! I thought kipling was supposed to be a good author.. Until I read Kim.

Glad to have owned it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling's best regarded story set in the confines of \\"The Great Game\\".

I wanted to read the oft-mentioned classic, but found it difficult to get into. A friend had the nine-CD version and loaned it to me.

Quite worth it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Enjoyed Kim more than I did when I tried to read it as a child in middle school. Enjoyed using the kindle because I had, at my finger tips, a dictionary for all the words I didn't recognize. However, would like to have had a more complete glossary of some of the 19th century Indian words."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling's \\"Kim\\" is one of the best books ever written about India in the Ninteenth Century. It is also a very interesting and enertaining adventure story. I have loved it ever since I first read it at about twelve, and on rereading it, for perhaps the fourth time, I find that it has lost nothing. I reread \\"The Idells (sp?) of the King,\\" which I loved at eighteen, at about thirty, and that was a mistake. The same is true of Alfred Noyes' (sp?) poetry. I read \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" at about nine, and reread it at about forty, and it is unbelievable how it had improved! \\"Kim\\" hasn't improved through the years, and Kipling still thinks an English gentleman is infinitely superier to any foreigner, even a Tebitian saint, but at ninty-three I find that the book remains excellent."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"As Amazon lumps together all editions and formats of public domain texts often, this review will highlight the two ways I followed this story. I listened to Ralph Cosham's Blackstone Audio rendering. He handled the accents well of so many Indian and British characters, and the doughty if now politically incorrect Hinglish of clever Babu, the woman of Kulu, and the woman of Shamlegh stand out along with the titular Kimball O'Hara and his lama companion. Among the native speakers, Father Victor, Lurgan Sahib, and Colonel Creighton represent the lively spirit of those who try to remain Kim's betters, no small feat given his enthusiasm for the Great Game. Hearing the unabridged reading in my car each day, I'd follow it, for the terms to look up and another go at what in listening could evade me as to details, foreign terms however translated, and the intricately shifting plot, with re-reading the chapters I'd heard.I used the Penguin Classic edition by Edward Said. His notes were often too terse to please me, but he handled in his extensive, probing introduction the imperialist themes as deftly as would be expected. Contrary to my expectations, Said shares much admiration for the novel's delightful renditions of life on the Great Trunk Road, and he tempers his criticism of Kipling's unquestioning support for the British Empire's control of the Crown Jewel with a warm understanding of what Kipling conveyed so well as one from India.However, Kipling and his characters never ask what alternative to the Victorian hold over India might have offered its millions. Nobody challenges the British except to assert a Russian rival. The Indians serve the Crown, the British--and Irish, a point that Said notably does not single out for analysis--enforce it, and the religious quest that intersects movingly and powerfully as the book reaches its close in slightly awkward but thematically mature manner shifts it off at a parallel to the material ambitions which Kim apparently inherits as his legacy, and as approved by the natives themselves.All this understood, the story entertains and you don't know what will happen next. The machinations of Babu gain particular momentum late in the novel, and they prove worthy of the adventure set in motion by such as Mahbub Ali, Creighton, and the coded secret agents who stretch back before Kim arrives and finds himself soon implicated to advance the interests--never questioned--of the Queen and, post-Mutiny, her willing minions. Kipling's inability to anticipate a few decades on the revolts and the resistance cannot be blamed on him but as Professor Said explains, they complicate more than the author might have comprehended how his own advocacy of imperial strategems implicated him in its telling and its cheerleading.But I wonder if Kipling despite his control of the plot let on to the ultimate insignificance of at least the symbols of such political obsessions to overpower all rivals and all counter-plotters. This scene stands out as representative: \\"The wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped. The theodolite hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books, inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from the gulf.\\" Kim wonders to himself more than once who he is, Irish, English, Indian, and the lingering mood that wraps you up as you follow him hints that Kipling raised in India appears, like his creation, not to be sure either."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Mr. Kipling was born in the year 1865 in Bombay, India but spent his early childhood with his sister Alice in England in foster care. But in his later years, he would begin his journey in the world of literature and his first published work in 1881. He then returned to his birth place after that year and work on a newspaper and later publish more literacy works that would put him on the map. For his novel \\"Kim\\", it would be his most political.In \\"Kim\\", we follow an orphan named Kimball O'Hara who's lived in Lahore, India almost his whole life. But in the story, he is working on a mission for the British and while doing so, he meets a Tibetan Lama who is searching for a legendary river. Kim then is sent to a school in England but is still in contact with his friend over the years. Then whey they reunite, he has been given a government job by retrieving items from Russian agents which could put both of them in danger.\\"Kim\\" is a nice read for anyone who love classic novels. The story starts slow but works up all the way to it's end. The story's main character Kimball \\"Kim\\" O'Hara definitely has a nice blend of Oliver Twist with a few political bits. It's entertaining and very deep, but I wouldn't call it memorable at time.

His exceptional performance should be available for streaming and on CD! I fell in love with India when traveling there in the 70's. Remnants of Kipling's India still existed then and probably still do, to some degree, today. Kipling's deep affection for the country and his respect for all its diversity is woven into a marvelous, colorful tapestry so compelling, that after listening to the book once, I read it. Eager to hear the story again I tried other versions only to be crushingly disappointed. Do yourself a favor; find a cassette player and buy this oneKim (Penguin Classics).

His literary legacy is somewhat complicated; on the one hand today, you're likely to read \\"If--\\" at some point, a poem he himself said had been anthologized near to death, and \\"The Jungle Book\\" has, courtesy of Uncle Walt, become a cultural staple. Conversely, \\"The White Man's Burden\\" has become shorthand for a whole bunch of now-discredited attitudes, and is guaranteed to be brought up in any history class on the late 19th century. Kipling's imperialism was controversial in literary circles in his own day, but popular with the masses; now it's a bit of a millstone, and the focal point of both defences of his (very much worth defending) literary output and the attacks on the same.\\"Kim\\", Kipling's most notable novel for adults (he produced a vast quantity of poems, short stories, and fictions for children in addition), was published in 1905, two years before his receipt of the Prize (indeed, it's generally thought to have been instrumental in clinching it for him). There are quite a few autobiographical elements present, though many modern readers won't recognize them as such on the face of it, as Kipling's youth in India is not a widely known part of his biography (despite how many of his most famous works center on the subcontinent). But, it is true, the imperial poet was born on the frontier, and truthfully was never fully comfortable living in the mother country. Our protagonist, little Kim, is a street urchin, the orphaned son of an army officer and his wife, who both died - he speaks Hindustani (and some other languages), and little English, and mixes freely with the local population, wanting little to do with the British. However, circumstances lead to his being thrust into white society, and we follow Kim as he tries to find his place in the world.This is the novel that widely popularized, though it did not coin, the term \\"the Great Game\\" to describe the little cloak-and-dagger operations between the British and the Russians on the vast Indian frontier. Kim finds himself drawn into the world of espionage intermittently, while also accompanying a wandering Tibetan Buddhist monk on his search for a legendary mystical river. Really, as the foreword to this edition notes, the novel doesn't have much of a plot - it's episodic, dropping and picking up on various elements as it goes along. The characters are the real focus, as well as the setting, and Kipling paints a vivid picture of the India he knew. For all his imperialism, he's quite good at writing characters of a wide range of ethnicities with a good degree of respect. Kim's dilemma, of a native-raised white boy trying to find his place in the Empire, mirrors Kipling's, but Kipling's writing style doesn't really focus too much on internalized issues. One gets the sense that a different writer might have gotten more out of this premise than Kipling does here.All the same, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"In my personal opinion, this Rudyard Kipling classic is one of the finest historical novels ever written. Though it has been made into videos & books for juveniles, it is actually a subtle adult piece of literature. It was Kipling who coined therein the phrase:\\"The Great Game\\". History repeats itself, as now America has replaced England in this spider web set in India & the high mountain passes leading to Central Asia. As always, Kipling helps us to stand back & laugh at our human foibles, while yet being dead serious.Had I the funds, I would have preferred a better quality edition, as I plan to keep this for re-reading. This is a cheap edition, with print too close to the inner margins --- very stiff & annoying to hold open."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Like the Kipling poem that supplied my title, the novel Kim represents a counterpoint of East and West. The two main characters, British orphan Kim and the Tibetan monk, represent polar opposites -- youth and age, worldliness and otherworldliness, intrigue and detachment, Western and Eastern civilizations, religions, and world-views -- and yet they become friends, develop a relationship of mutual respect and help each other accomplish their objectives.Rudyard Kipling is well known as an author of boys' adventure stories, and while Kim can be read as such by younger readers it is much more than that. Traditional views of Kipling, that he was an apologist for the British Empire who despised the \\"lesser races\\" that made it up, are likewise not entirely just. In this novel he brings many threads together, with India a sort of third character -- a complex India with many ethnicities and cultures living in close proximity under the benevolent rule of the British Raj. His encyclopedic knowledge of those many cultures comes out with incredible wealth of detail, as well as frequent use of words borrowed from Farsi, Sanscrit, Hindi, and Arabic, some of which have since become part of the English language, but many of which will be new to the American reader. If you haven't read Kim yet, you should -- it's entertaining and also has a humanistic and moral theme -- that humans are more alike than different, -- just like the Ballad of East and West.This particular version has a helpful Foreword by an English professor that brings out the scholarly view of the work. Type is legible for a paperback of only slightly more than \\"pocketbook\\" size. The only criticism I have of the production of the book is that footnotes at the bottom of each page, properly numbered, would have given an appropriate Victorian feel to the book as well as being much easier on the reader. As it is, all those unfamiliar words have to be looked up in the back of the book, requiring much riffling through pages, and even then, they aren't divided up by chapter, but under page number headings."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"\\"Kim\\" is a timeless classic and the unabridged audio book allowed me to drive while re-living what I've read a couple of times previously. The narration was peerless and the story, of course, is a classic."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"In _Kim_, Rudyard Kipling follows two seekers as they travel about Colonial India.Kim is an orphan, an unusually clever and observant adolescent boy who is well acquainted with street life and dubious business in Northwest India. By virtue of his parentage, however - his father was a British soldier - he has one foot in another world as well. Throughout the book, Kim seeks his identity - will he live the simpler, unencumbered life that he loves, or will he join the world of the Sahibs, the men who rule India? .At the opening of the book, Kim shows kindness to an elderly Tibetan lama and, in the lama's eyes, anyway, becomes his disciple. Kim accompanies the lama on a quest to find a mythical river where the lama believes they will find enlightenment. Eventually, the lama pays for Kim's education; while he is at school, the British groom Kim to become a spy. Throughout the rest of the book Kim travels with the lama, performing his work inconspicuously so as not to disillusion the old and rather oblivious lama. Along the way they encounter all that is good and bad in India. The lama wants to escape the Wheel of Life; Kim notices that \\"by the roadside trundled the very Wheel itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrelling - all warmly alive.\\"The book examines the relative merits of action and inaction; of the worldliness and other-worldliness. \\"What profit to kill men?\\" asks the lama. \\"Very little - as I know;\\" says an old soldier, \\"but if evil men were not now and then slain it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers.\\" Later, the lama tells Kim that \\"To abstain from action is well - except to acquire merit.\\" \\"At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action was unbefitting a Sahib. And I am a Sahib,\\" Kim says, revealing his choice of identity.This is a beautifully written book and a wonderful depiction of life in Colonial India. The Penguin edition has attractive cover art and an excellent introduction and very useful endnotes by Edward W. Said."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Throughout this novel, one senses that R. Kipling was a loyal British subject though he was born in Inda. He believed in the imperial authority of his queen and country and his defence of the British rule in India gave rise to controversy at the end of the 18th century. Interestingly enough, as one progresses through \\"Kim\\", one feels the author's passion for his beloved India, a country he nevertheless believed should be ruled by white men since, in his view, they are superior. In fact natives are routinely depicted as inferiors but Kipling's racial stereotyping was not outrageous more than a hundred years ago.Like Mowgli in \\"The Jungle Book\\", Kimball O'Hara in \\"Kim\\" is a self-reliant and resourceful boy called \\"little friend of the world\\" and the author perhaps equates the brutal indignities he suffered in his boyhood with the humiliations inflicted upon the natives of India."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is the most popular of Rudyard Kipling's novels and has received both critical acclaim and negative reviews over the years. Both assessments are valid to some degree. On the positive side, Kipling has written what is acknowledged to be the best description of colonial India ever created by a native or a foreigner. Much of the negative commentary on the book has come from the intertwining of the story of a boy and a holy man each seeking his dream (good) with the political and military intrigues of the \\"Great Game,\\" the political rivalry among European powers over the middle and south Asia.The book begins with Kim, a young boy, living on the streets of Lahore in what is now Pakistan but was then a part of British India. His father was an Irish soldier but Kim is clearly a street-wise Indian. He bears some resemblance to Dickens' character, Dodger, but is not as dishonest (although he is not above deceit and trickery to get what he wants). He meets a lama from Tibet who is seeking a river. Kim has his own goal following a dream that tells him to seek a red bull on a field of green. Together they set off to find their goals with Kim acting as the chela (disciple) of the holy man.This beginning is promising enough, but one problem for the non-native Indian is the extensive references to Indian concepts, terms and especially religious references. Despite this flaw (for the non-Indian reader at least) the adventure is colorful and the characters the two meet along the way make for both humor and interesting situations.But Kim also is involved with a somewhat mysterious horse trader cum spy, Mahbub Ali who gives him a message to deliver pertaining to some planned military action. Kim delivers the message and eventually comes across a British military camp where he sees a flag bearing a red bull on a field of green. Kim is intrigued by this discover and in an attempt to learn more he is collared by a chaplain attached to the group and falls into the their hands. Determined to make a civilized person out of Kim the chaplain arranges for Kim to attend school. The lama, distraught by the loss of his chela comes to agree to pay for Kim's education believing that it is best for him to learn the white man's ways. The pair are reunited as the story draws to a close there is a more or less suitable ending. But the intrusion of the Great Game scenario into the story, even though it adds the amazing character, Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, does distract from what should be the main idea, the evolving love and relationship between a young boy and a old man, each seeking his dream.I rate Kim at 4 stars because it really is worth reading although some readers will skim through some parts that are too esoteric for Westerners."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kiplying's Kim is perhaps the best of all of his novels. It is a taught espionage story and at the same time a commentary on the class relationships between the English and the Indians in Victorian India. It's also an excellent historical example of the perceptions of Victorians on their Indian subjects and their fears of Russian competition. It's also just a fantstic story."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"this is first time i came across a book formatted so that its become unreadable."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Other reviewers are correct when they complain that this book is extremely difficult to read; it is however brilliant.You need a map of India and some knowledge of the Indian caste system to truly understand it. I had the map but admit that Kipling's use of slang when referring to certain characters was maddenning.The odd assortment of charcters are great but Kim is the star of the show. Kim, an orphaned son of Anglo parents, is raised on the streets of Lahore where he befriends an old Tibetan Lama. Kim accompanies the Lama on his serach for a mystical river.Along the way they come across the regiment in which Kim's Father served. Kim is adopted by the regiments two chaplains who turn Kim over to Colonel Creighton who runs a sophisticated spy system. Kim is sent to an English speaking Catholic school.The allure of the road to Kim is too enticing and during school holidays Kim goes on adventures with the likes of his friend the part time Afgahn horse trader and part time spy for the British.Kim completes his education both in the school and on the road and he becomes an important member of the spy system.Kim seems to benefit from the experience of everyone he touches and in turn evereyone Kim encounters seem to be better off by the experience.His relationship with the lama is truly special and transforms Kim from street urchin into a compassionate young man whose strength keeps the Lama alive as they travel the Himalayas.Kim is a truly delightful book if you are up to the challenge."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Each time I read \\"Kim\\" it's new and more enjoyable than previously. When I was barely a teen, it was an exciting adventure. Twenty years later it was an intriguing history. Now thirty years later it is Indian culture, faith, friendship, and loyalty. I hope I and \\"Kim\\" continue to change, and always for the better. I eagerly await what is in store at the next reading, and there will be one, just as there is a River of the Arrow."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I am a former peace corps voluteer - I adored this tape - Kim is sort of an Indian Huck Finn who wanders India as Kipling juxtaposes the cacophony of the marketplace, the scholar, the mountains, the long road, the train, the letter writer, the Irish soldiers, the boys school, the lama, the English priests, the dialects, the landscapes, the individual personalities, the stereotypes. and a richly developed collection of spies - against the continuing thread of the Lama's unworldly search for serenity and ultimate fulfillment. Kipling doesn't try to give answers - he just presents life in India as he loves it. But Sam Dastur's reading makes it a masterpiece! His wonderful rendition of all the sounds and voices and dialects just brings all the people vibrantly alive. I only wish it would come out in CD so I could get it for my friends who don't do audio tapes."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Rudyard Kiplings' &quot;Kim&quot; is so utterly enchanting it, in some ways, defies description. It is a tale of personal growth, filial love, and the joy of life set amidst the Indian sub-continent in the time of the British Raj. Kim O'Hara, an orphaned Sahib, cunning and street-wise, and of India in all but blood, embarks upon a journey with a Tibetan lama in search of spiritual cleansing. Kim matures under the lama's patient guidance and, in turn, gives his heart to his mentor. The two support each other unconditionally through the passages they both must make.In time, Kim's parentage and talents are &quot;discovered&quot; by the British and he is drafted and trained to be a participant within the Great Game; a political battle between Russia and Britain for control of Central Asia. Lama and student seek their disparate goals together as they traverse the plains of India, hike Himalayan foothills, and discourse along the way.I found myself completely rapt by the book and longing to return to it. The characters are splendidly wrought and the descriptions of India and its' people enthralling. Though previous reviews tell of difficult reading, I found it nothing of the sort. One must orient themselves to the vernacular employed, but this isn't in any way trying for those attuned to historical reading. Some previous knowledge of the Great Game and the British Raj would also be helpful. Be that as it may, with remarkable ease the reader is absorbed and transported by this tale to wander India, late 19th century, with Kim and his Tibetan holy man amidst the intrigue of colonial rivalry and the mysticism of Eastern belief. Rudyard Kiplings' &quot;Kim&quot; has rightfully earned a place among my favorite novels of all time. There is no higher praise by which I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"I truly could not decide whether or not to give this book a 4 or a 5. It is so good, with such imagery, and vivid descriptions using vocabulary that slightly makes you want to pick up a dictionary and check to make sure what the words mean, but then you dont want to stop reading! if i did give it a 4, then i would definitely do it only because it was so good i couldn't put it down to make sure i understood it! This book is not at all slow, Rudyard Kipling doesn't waste time on excessive descriptions, yet takes just a little bit of time to make sure the reader really gets where he is coming from. A truly great read."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The United States needs a modern-day Kimball O'Hara or two if it is ever to be successful in thwarting future large-scale terror attacks. The likelihood of that happening is few-and-far-between.This Rudyard Kipling classic has recently found its way on to US military officer reading lists, and this review will approach the novel from that perspective. As cultural understanding and sensitivity crawls its way up the priority list for military personnel serving abroad, there are few better or more enjoyable ways to appreciate the issue than reading \\"Kim.\\"The main character is a British orphan about thirteen years of age when the story begins who has been raised on the streets of Lahore in present-day Pakistan. He speaks fluent Hindi, understands various dialects and, perhaps most important of all, intimately understands the kaleidoscopic whirl of religions and cultures that travel and trade along the northwest border of British India. He takes to the road as a disciple or \\"chela\\" of a wandering Tibetan priest in search of a mythical holy river with healing powers. Along the way, he has a chance encounter with his deceased father's old army regiment and his identity is revealed. The army sends him to a prestigious English language Catholic school in the south, but his potential value is quickly gleaned by a member of the British secret service, which is engaged in a cloak-and-dagger contest with the Russians as their two spreading empires converged along the Hindu Kush in the last decades of the 19th century.There are a number of ways to analyze or appreciate Kipling's writing and the complex narrative he creates. One is historical. The author grew up in India and sets the story on a timeline that would have exactly equated with his own youth in the British colony. The sights, sounds, phrases, references, and personalities in \\"Kim\\" are entirely authentic. The volume I read included footnotes that explained the arcane expressions and places. Without this helpful aid much of the story would have been lost (to me at least), so it is worth checking to see if the volume you are buying has notes or a glossary.Another angle on the story is what is says about modern human intelligence operations. The leading British intelligent agent in the novel, Colonel Creighton, recognizes that Kim has language, culture skills, and local street smarts that simply cannot be taught in any academy. He is lucky that Kim begrudgingly accepts his \\"obligation\\" as a Sahib (white man) and agrees to help Britain in its game of wits with the Russians - and it happens to offer him the freedom and adventure he desperately craves.So, whether one is interested in 19th century India and Pakistan or simply enjoys a good spy novel, \\"Kim\\" is as fine a book as can be recommended."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Others have reviewed the book, and I will only add that I found Kipling's character portrayals detailed and beautiful while his philosophical discussions are deep and provide rich ground for thought.The main point of my review which I wish to make, however, is that this is an excellent edition of the book to read. Kipling includes a large number of Indian words, terms, and phrases that are completly unknown even to a well-read American audience. The footnotes in this edition, therefore, are indispensible to gaining a clear understanding of what is going on."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"My grandfather gave me KIM when I was 8 years old; I read it when I was a teenager, and hated it. Too strange, too obtuse. Then I read it again when I was in my thirties and had traveled a bit.

The plot's only boring if you don't pay attention, and hey- don't get mad 'cause kim went to school in the middle of the book- it's supposed to be somewhat like kiplings life ( read the short story Baa Baa Black sheep, you'll see ). it's not about a little british boy overcoming India either. there's nothing british about kim but his blood, and if you can't see past that, you're more racist than you accuse kipling of being. I loved the book. I found the plot adventurous, the protagonist easily likeable, and the vernacular not too confusing- for what it was (and I read it in my junior year of public high school). I also thought the characters weren't just stereotypes. (by the way, you shouldn't presume to know more about a culture you've never experienced than a writer who had spent his life immersed in it.) in short, if you have any sense of adventure, you'll be in love with this book. if, however, your eyes rarely leave the confines of this computer screen, the entire book may be a wholly foreign and confusing thing to you."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This is a book which I first read whilst still at school and I am in my '60's now.
