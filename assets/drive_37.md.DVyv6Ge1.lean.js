As the abuse continued, and as she was forced to see her abuser over and over again in social situations, she struggled with self-doubt, panic attacks, nightmares and the weight of whether or not to tell her terrible secret. It wasn't until a traumatic series of events showed her the cost of silence that she chose to speak out-in the process destroying both her family and the last of her innocence. Through her personal diary, written during the years of her abuse, Erin Merryn shares her journey through pain and confusion to inner strength and, ultimately, forgiveness. Raw, powerful and unflinchingly honest, Stolen Innocence is the inspiring story of one girl's struggle to become a woman, and a bright light on the pain and devastation of abuse. Stolen Innocence is written with conviction and clarity.

According to author James Deetz, the past can be seen most fully by studying the small things so often forgotten. Objects such as doorways, gravestones, musical instruments, and even shards of pottery fill in the cracks between large historical events and depict the intricacies of daily life. In his completely revised and expanded edition of In Small Things Forgotten, Deetz has added new sections that more fully acknowledge the presence of women and African Americans in Colonial America. New interpretations of archaeological finds detail how minorities influenced and were affected by the development of the Anglo-American tradition in the years following the settlers' arrival in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620. Among Deetz's observations: Subtle changes in building long before the Revolutionary War hinted at the growing independence of the American colonies and their desire to be less like the British. Records of estate auctions show that many households in Colonial America contained only one chair--underscoring the patriarchal nature of the early American family. All other members of the household sat on stools or the floor. The excavation of a tiny community of freed slaves in Massachusetts reveals evidence of the transplantation of African culture to North America. Simultaneously a study of American life and an explanation of how American life is studied, In Small Things Forgotten, through the everyday details of ordinary living, colorfully depicts a world hundreds of years in the past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jtOeEfcB33oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Placer gold deposits of Nevada, (Geological Survey bulletin)","description":"A Reprint of the Original US Geological Survey Bulletin 1356.

By 1929, the technology was greatly advanced beyond the fragile craft and the sputtering engine of the Wright Brothers. The ultimate tribute to them was the fact their aircraft, its engine and its controls proved to be the foundation for aviation. In 1932-35, technology and pilot skill breached weather's wall with the ability to fly instruments. A breakthrough flight control system, first demonstrated in 1929, had to be deconstructed to put the pilot into the knowledge loop.

More than two thousand years ago, when the ancient Greeks first pondered what constitutes \\"the good life,\\" happiness was considered a civic virtue that demanded a lifetime's cultivation. Not just mere enjoyment of pleasure and mere avoidance of suffering, true happiness was an achievement, not a birthright. Now, in an age of instant gratification and infinite distraction, history professor Richard Schoch takes a refreshingly contemplative look at a question that's as vital today as ever: What does it mean to be happy? Schoch consults some of history's greatest thinkers -- from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas to Buddha -- in his quest to understand happiness in all its hard-won forms. Packed with three thousand years' worth of insights, many long forgotten, The Secrets of Happiness is a breath of ancient wisdom for anyone who yearns for the good life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=quT7A0ujjbwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Don't Sweat the Small Stuff Workbook: Exercises, Questions, and Self-Tests to Help You Keep the Little Things From Taking Over Your Life","description":"For the millions who have read \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\", this inspiring new workbook has been designed to help put the book's principles into practice.

Barber clearly outlines altruism's impact on the individual, then extrapolates his findings to encompass the world at large.- Booklist... provides a well written, accessible, and much welcomed discussion of moral beliefs and moral behavior from an evolutionary perspective. The insightful discussion of kindness and cruelty will stimulate debate, and provide an excellent introduction to these issues for the nonspecialist and an excellent review for students of evolutionary thinking. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in human morality. -David C. Geary, Professor and Chair, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of MissouriWhat do mutual grooming, politeness, priestly celibacy, military heroism, car insurance, and overwork have in common? All are probable examples of the recently discovered evolutionary mechanism called reciprocal altruism. Put simply, the concept means, You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours. Although rare in animals, reciprocal altruism colors much of human emotion and social behavior. Over the course of our evolutionary history we humans have developed a great variety of social contracts ranging from food-sharing among hunter-gatherers to observing the rules of the road in contemporary society. In a lively, fascinating discussion that explores the behaviors of bees, bats, and humans in various normal and deviant social settings evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber explains the evolutionary basis of these wide-ranging phenomena.Beginning with Darwin's theory, Barber shows how the original notion of a dog-eat-dog world where survival of the fittest is the only rule must now be modified by the new findings on altruism. In bees, for example, the workers evolve without reproductive ability and exist only for the good of the hive and the propagation of the queen bee's genes. In addition, vampire bats will spontaneously share food through regurgitation, evidently so that the favor will be returned when food sources are scarce.In humans, reciprocal arrangements depend on trust, so moral emotions, like guilt, embarrassment, resentment, and pride, have evolved to guard against the temptation to cheat, which would destroy the basis of trust on which so much depends. The evolution of such emotions may also lead to exceptionally self-sacrificial behavior in some individuals, whether this takes the form of priestly celibacy, a soldier jumping on a hand grenade to save his buddies, or the donation of a kidney. Barber brings the revealing insights of evolutionary psychology to these examples and more, and delves into related issues including sex differences in kindness, new approaches to rehabilitating criminals, the connection of kindness to health, and the political manifestations of altruism in the environmental movement.Full of stimulating ideas expressed in lucid prose, Kindness in a Cruel World presents a compelling case that the desire to help others and the spirit of cooperation are fundamental to our human evolutionary inheritance.Nigel Barber, Ph.D. (Portland, ME), formerly an assistant professor of psychology at Birmingham-Southern College, is now a freelance writer and researcher, and the author of Why Parents Matter: Parental Investment and Child Outcomes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=whQ54h9Uvi8C&dq=Kindness+In+A+Cruel+World:+The+Evolution+Of+Altruism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terrors of the screen","description":"Discusses the history, techniques, characters, and plots of horror films from around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FA93QgAACAAJ&dq=Terrors+of+the+screen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beads to Buckskins, Vol. 3","description":"HAWK S WAY Collection Volume 3: CALLEN, ZACH, BILLY Re-experience these three fan-favorite stories from New York Times bestselling author Joan Johnston Hawk s Way: Callen previously published in December 1994 as The Headstrong Bride Hawk s Way: Zach previously published in May 1995 as The Disobedient Bride Hawk s Way: Bill previously published in June 1996 as The Temporary Groom In Hawk s Way: Callen, rancher Sam Longstreet has planned the perfect revenge against his enemy: to woo and wed the man s daughter.

My agent told me on the phone that you were looking for actors who could do animal movements, but she didn t tell me what the film was about,  said Will.  It s King Kong,  said the producer.  You mean a remake of the 1933 film?   Yes.   What s the role I m being considered for?   It s Kong.  And so began an extraordinary few months in Will s life as he joined fellow actor and make-up artist Rick Baker to become the one of the  guys in the ape suit , striding through miniature jungles, wrestling a giant rubber snake, running amok in Manhattan and scaling the World Trade Center. Inside the suit it was fearsomely hot, the special contact lenses made him dizzy and he frequently had to insert a tube through the gorilla mask in order to breathe. But the illusion was perfect: audiences never knew that the highly publicized, forty-foot tall, mechanical Kong that had cost millions of dollars to develop only got a few seconds of exposure, and that on screen for the rest of the movie were Rick and Will, clad in rubber and bear-hide. Inside King Kong is Will s journal of his experiences on the set in 1976.

Students are faced with a disconnect between the algorithmic and informal attitude to mathematics at school, versus a new emphasis on proof, based on logic, and a more abstract development of general concepts, based on set theory. The authors have many years' experience of the potential difficulties involved, through teaching first-year undergraduates and researching the ways in which students and mathematicians think. The book explains the motivation behind abstract foundational material based on students' experiences of school mathematics, and explicitly suggests ways students can make sense of formal ideas. This second edition takes a significant step forward by not only making the transition from intuitive to formal methods, but also by reversing the process- using structure theorems to prove that formal systems have visual and symbolic interpretations that enhance mathematical thinking. This is exemplified by a new chapter on the theory of groups. While the first edition extended counting to infinite cardinal numbers, the second also extends the real numbers rigorously to larger ordered fields. This links intuitive ideas in calculus to the formal epsilon-delta methods of analysis. The approach here is not the conventional one of 'nonstandard analysis', but a simpler, graphically based treatment which makes the notion of an infinitesimal natural and straightforward. This allows a further vision of the wider world of mathematical thinking in which formal definitions and proof lead to amazing new ways of defining, proving, visualising and symbolising mathematics beyond previous expectations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z56eBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Foundations+of+Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emerging Tribe: Gay Culture in","description":"Reviving the Tribe creates a rich and brutally honest portrait of contemporary gay men's lives amidst the seemingly endless AIDS epidemic and offers both autobiographical self-examination and a relentless critique of current sexual politics within the gay community. Fearlessly confronting the horrors experiences by surviving gay men without giving way to hopelessness, denial, or blame, Reviving the Tribe offers an inspiring blueprint for the gay community which faces a continuing spiral of disaster. In Reviving the Tribe, Author Eric Rofes argues that a return to the interrupted agenda of gay liberation may provide long-term motivation to keep gay men alive and spur rejuvenation of new generations of gay culture. By interweaving social history, psychology, anthropology, epidemiology, sociology, feminist theory, and sexology with his own journey through the epidemic, Rofes provides a moving and compelling argument for stepping out of the \\"state of emergency\\" and embracing a life beyond disease. He boldly offers a plan for community regeneration focused on restoring mental health, reclaiming sexuality, and mending the social fabric of communal gay life. Rofes asks unspoken questions lurking in gay men's minds and suggests answers to these questions, hitting such controversial topics as: gay men's sex cultures of the 1970s why \\"educated\\" gay men continue to become HIV-infected changing forms of gay masculinity the opening of new sex clubs and bathhouses leaving \\"rage activism\\" behind links between the Holocaust and AIDS unacknowledged roots in the feminist movement of gay men's AIDS response mass denial of chronic trauma among gay men The refusal to confront the ever-intensifying manifestations of AIDS has seriously endangered the foundation of contemporary gay communities. Rofes argues that many gay men suffer from the \\"disaster syndrome,\\" a psychologically determined response that defends individuals against being overwhelmed by traumatic experience. In Reviving the Tribe, he provides a radical critique of contemporary gay political culture and suggests alternatives which offer the opportunity to face history, grapple with decimation, and regenerate communal life. Cautioning that an honest analysis of recent gay history and urban cultures promises neither to stop gay men's suffering nor to end continuing HIV infections, Reviving the Tribe provides gay men with a clear lens through which they might scrutinize their lives, come to a new understanding of the epidemic's impact on their generation, and redirect activism. This courageous and inspiring work brings Rofes'commanding intellect and twenty years of grassroots gay activism to bear on the challenging task of reconstructing gay life in the new mellennium.

Donald R. Hickey explores the military, diplomatic, and domestic history of our second war with Great Britain, bringing the study up to date with recent scholarship on all aspects of the war, from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. The newly expanded The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict, Bicentennial Edition includes additional information on the British forces, American Indians, and military operations such as the importance of logistics and the use and capabilities of weaponry. Hickey explains how the war promoted American nationalism and manifest destiny, stimulated peacetime defense spending, and enhanced America's reputation abroad. He also shows that the war sparked bloody conflicts between pro-war Republican and anti-war Federalist neighbors, dealt a crippling blow to American Indians, and solidified the United States's antipathy toward the British.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ik6Vi82gLagC&dq=The+War+of+1812:+A+SHORT+HISTORY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stalemate","description":"A classic of Holocaust literature from  one of the great masters of the short novel.   The New Yorker In the Vilna Ghetto during World War II, Nazi Commandant Schoger demands that all children be sent to the death camp. When Abraham Lipman pleads with him to spare their lives, Schoger reconsiders, and tells Lipman there will be a chess match between himself and Lipman s only surviving son, Isaac, a chess prodigy. If Isaac wins, the children will live, but Isaac will die. If Isaac loses, the children will die, but Isaac will live. Only a draw will save the ghetto from this terrible predicament. The chess game begins: a nightmarish contest played over the course of several evenings, witnessed by an audience impotent to act, staking the lives of their children on a stalemate. This is a moving story of a father and a son who shame their cruel perpetrator with their dignity, spirit, and extraordinary courage. Stalemate speaks to the power of humor even under the direst circumstances. As a parable that gives voice to the unspeakable, Stalemate is an antidote to despair.  Gripping . . . a truly memorable work.

George, Miami Dade Community College The first book devoted to the history of African Americans in south Florida and their pivotal role in the growth and development of Miami, Black Miami in the Twentieth Century traces their triumphs, drudgery, horrors, and courage during the first 100 years of the city's history. Firsthand accounts and over 130 photographs, many of them never published before, bring to life the proud heritage of Miami's black community. Beginning with the legendary presence of black pirates on Biscayne Bay, Marvin Dunn sketches the streams of migration by which blacks came to account for nearly half the city's voters at the turn of the century. From the birth of a new neighborhood known as \\"Colored Town,\\" Dunn traces the blossoming of black businesses, churches, civic groups, and fraternal societies that made up the black community. He recounts the heyday of \\"Little Broadway\\" along Second Avenue, with photos and individual recollections that capture the richness and vitality of black Miami's golden age between the wars. A substantial portion of the book is devoted to the Miami civil rights movement, and Dunn traces the evolution of Colored Town to Overtown and the subsequent growth of Liberty City. He profiles voting rights, housing and school desegregation, and civil disturbances like the McDuffie and Lozano incidents, and analyzes the issues and leadership that molded an increasingly diverse community through decades of strife and violence. In concluding chapters, he assesses the current position of the community--its socioeconomic status, education issues, residential patterns, and business development--and considers the effect of recent waves of immigration from Latin America and the Caribbean. Dunn combines exhaustive research in regional media and archives with personal interviews of pioneer citizens and longtime residents in a work that documents as never before the life of one of the most important black communities in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=12ikjgEACAAJ&dq=Miami&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The System : The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point","description":"Taking as an example the Clinton health care reform initiative, the authors show how a policy that aimed to please everyone ended by satisfying no one due to pressure groups, political gamesmanship and the inertia of the American 'system'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o1uzoQEACAAJ&dq=The+System+:+The+American+Way+of+Politics+at+the+Breaking+Point&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","description":"Floyd Schneider, veteran missionary and Bible teacher, presents a real-life approach to sharing the Good News.

Boyle exploring the first scientific and recreational forays into LSD and its mind-altering possibilities In this stirring and insightful novel, T.C. Boyle takes us back to the 1960s and to the early days of a drug whose effects have reverberated widely throughout our culture: LSD. In 1943, LSD is synthesized in Basel. Two decades later, a coterie of grad students at Harvard are gradually drawn into the inner circle of renowned psychologist and psychedelic drug enthusiast Timothy Leary. Fitzhugh Loney, a psychology Ph.D. student and his wife, Joanie, become entranced by the drug s possibilities such that their  research  becomes less a matter of clinical trials and academic papers and instead turns into a free-wheeling exploration of mind expansion, group dynamics, and communal living. With his trademark humor and pathos, Boyle moves us through the Loneys  initiation at one of Leary s parties to his notorious summer seminars in Zihuatanejo until the Loneys  eventual expulsion from Harvard and their introduction to a communal arrangement of thirty devotees students, wives, and children living together in a sixty-four room mansion and devoting themselves to all kinds of experimentation and questioning. Is LSD a belief system? Does it allow you to see God? Can the Loneys  marriage or any marriage, for that matter survive the chaotic and sometimes orgiastic use of psychedelic drugs? Wry, witty, and wise, Outside Looking In is an ideal subject for this American master, and highlights Boyle s acrobatic prose, detailed plots, and big ideas. It s an utterly engaging and occasionally trippy look at the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness, as well as our seemingly infinite capacities for creativity, re-invention, and self-discovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STNkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Voice Of The Dolls","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3AKXtOQDulkC&dq=The+Voice+Of+The+Dolls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conures","description":"Green cheek conures are small parrots that also go by the name green cheek parakeet.

New revelations in physics and biology suggest that we re about to find out! A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that our universe works like a Consciousness Computer. Rather than the number codes of typical software, our Consciousness Computer uses a language that we all have, yet are only beginning to understand. Life s reality code is based in the language of human emotion and focused belief. Knowing that belief is our reality-maker, the way we think of ourselves and our world is now more important than ever! For us to change the beliefs that have led to war, disease, and the failed careers and relationships of our past we need a reason to see things differently. Our ancestors used miracles to change what they believed. Today we use science. The Spontaneous Healing of Belief offers us both: the miracles that open the door to a powerful new way of seeing the world, and the science that tells us why the miracles are possible, revealing: why we are not limited by the \\"laws\\" of physics and biology as we know them today. Once we become aware of the paradigm-shattering discoveries and true-life miracles, we must think of ourselves differently.

(George Brandes maintained that \\"one must recognize with amazement that it holds its own in this comparison.\\") Next is a discourse by \\"Judge William\\" in praise of marriage \\"in answer to objections.\\" The remainder of the volume, almost two-thirds of the whole, is the diary of a young man, discovered by \\"Frater Taciturnus,\\" who was deeply in love but felt compelled to break his engagement. The work closes with a letter to the reader from Taciturnus on the three \\"existence-spheres\\" represented by the three parts of the book.

He inherited an economically sick country when he assumed the post of General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in March 1985. In an effort to jump-start the Soviet economy, he has implemented comprehensive internal domestic and external foreign policy changes under the framework of Perestroika and Glasnost. However, because of the years of Soviet government centralization, hyperbureaucracy and inflexibility, Gorbachev's reform programs have not met expectations. To what extent can Gorbachev's policies gain acceptance and succeed? What are the fundamental factors influencing his economic programs? To what degree might his reforms be reversible? The answer to these questions will shape the future of the Soviet Union and determine how the West formulates its foreign policy strategy in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XW6rtgAACAAJ&dq=The+Gorbachev+Revolution:+Will+its+economic+reforms+succeed%3F+(USAWC+Military+Studies+Program+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Weight Management","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5VuQEACAAJ&dq=Pregnancy+Weight+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of Synanon: A California Utopia","description":"\\"Based on extensive primary sources and interviews with former members, The Rise and Fall of Synanon explores how the institution evolved in the context of American social, political, and economic trends.

In neighboring Thailand, a small band of Buddhist monks harbors refugees from Burma inside their modest temple in the slums of Bangkok. The monks and refugees are all natives of the Burmese Mon State. All have the same residential status in Thailand: illegal. Under surveillance, and overwhelmed by the needs of their charges, the monks reach out to international aid agencies in Bangkok for help in ministering to the tortured, the wounded, the diseased, and the orphaned. Singing to the Dead recalls a Catholic lay missioner's work alongside the Mon Buddhist monks of Bangkok. For more than two years, Victoria Armour-Hileman was a go-between for the monks, interceding with the world outside their temple walls for everything from a cornea transplant for a land mine victim to money to buy shoes for barefoot orphans. At the same time, Singing to the Dead details an aid worker's ongoing education: how to weave through an embassy bureaucracy, how to stave off burnout, how to pull money out of thin air at the eleventh hour, when to trust and when to be cautious, when to kowtow, when to pray. As the centuries-old conflict between Burma and its Mon people worsens, police raids on the temple in Bangkok increase. Refugees have never been safe, but now even the monks' unofficial immunity seems tenuous. When one of the monks is threatened with repatriation to Burma and possible imprisonment and torture, Armour-Hileman begins the desperate race to secure a new home country for him. She knows that these final efforts are as selfish as they are humanitarian, for what kind of God, and what kind of universe, will she believe in if she fails?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cEyTCkD7sqoC&dq=Singing+to+the+Dead:+A+Missioner%27s+Life+among+Refugees+from+Burma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fairies and Chimneys","description":"Collection of poems about fairies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ddEEAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rising Above the Violence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IbcKu9Lr9UMC&dq=Rising+Above+the+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","description":"Pritchard has experience in both the technologies that many consider competing architectures for creating distributed software solutions.

Du Bois. A controversial title of its time, the novel chronicles the complex interactions between Northern financing and Southern politics as it follows the story of free-spirited Zora, child of a Southern swamp, and her romance with Yankee-educated Bles, who will eventually face the opportunity to claim political power through corrupt means. In the middle of it all is the silver fleece, a crop of cotton rich with meaning and symbolism. In the tradition of other incendiary novels that explore market forces at the turn of the century, such as Frank Norris s The Pit and Upton Sinclair s The Jungle, The Quest of the Silver Fleece was seen as an  economic study  by Du Bois, yet it was also a romantic and otherwordly saga, loosely based on the Greek myth from which it takes its name. Using literary conventions to expose and oppose America s views on race, Du Bois presents a sprawling and provocative work that continues to engage readers and inspire debate among literary scholars today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p6mB3uqvvmkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xFIYAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nuclear Witnesses: Insiders Speak Out","description":"Contains taped interviews with sixteen individuals relating their experiences with nuclear power, events that have caused them to become opponents to this energy source","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=93hiHQAACAAJ&dq=Nuclear+Witnesses:+Insiders+Speak+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seeing Beyond the Wrinkles: Stories of Ageless Courage, Humor, and Faith","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2R4zRlf1qY8C&dq=Seeing+Beyond+the+Wrinkles:+Stories+of+Ageless+Courage,+Humor,+and+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manuscript Found: The Complete Original (Religious Studies Center Specialized Monograph Series, V. 11)","description":"The eminent historian Richard Bushman here reflects on his faith and the history of his religion. By describing his own struggle to find a basis for belief in a skeptical world, Bushman poses the question of how scholars are to write about subjects in which they are personally invested. Does personal commitment make objectivity impossible? Bushman explicitly, and at points confessionally, explains his own commitments and then explores Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon from the standpoint of belief. Joseph Smith cannot be dismissed as a colorful fraud, Bushman argues, nor seen only as a restorer of religious truth. Entangled in nineteenth-century Yankee culture including the skeptical Enlightenment Smith was nevertheless an original who cut his own path. And while there are multiple contexts from which to draw an understanding of Joseph Smith (including magic, seekers, the Second Great Awakening, communitarianism, restorationism, and more), Bushman suggests that Smith stood at the cusp of modernity and presented the possibility of belief in a time of growing skepticism. When examined carefully, the Book of Mormon is found to have intricate subplots and peculiar cultural twists. Bushman discusses the book's ambivalence toward republican government, explores the culture of the Lamanites (the enemies of the favored people), and traces the book's fascination with records, translation, and history. Yet Believing History also sheds light on the meaning of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon today. How do we situate Mormonism in American history? Is Mormonism relevant in the modern world? Believing History offers many surprises. Believers will learn that Joseph Smith is more than an icon, and non-believers will find that Mormonism cannot be summed up with a simple label. But wherever readers stand on Bushman's arguments, he provides us with a provocative and open look at a believing historian studying his own faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M23UI7CogvkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ecstasy of Enlightenment: Teaching of Natural Tantra","description":"The Ecstasy of Enlightenment is an inside look at the spiritual world of Tantra--one of the most sophisticated, alluring, and controversial forms of Buddhism.

Can we choose who to love? Is romantic love rational? Can we love more than one person at a time? And can we make ourselves fall out of love? In On Romantic Love, Berit Brogaard attempts to get to the bottom of love's many contradictions. This short book, informed by both historical and cutting edge philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, combines a new theory of romantic love with entertaining anecdotes from real life and accessible explanations of the neuroscience underlying our wildest passions. Against the grain, Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all. And love isn't even always something we consciously feel. However, love -- like other emotions, both conscious and not -- is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice. This engaging and innovative look at a universal topic, featuring original line drawings by illustrator Gareth Southwell, illuminates the processes behind heartbreak, obsession, jealousy, attachment, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEiPBQAAQBAJ&dq=Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology of Achievement: Six Keys to Personal Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dUIbAQAAMAAJ&dq=Psychology+of+Achievement:+Six+Keys+to+Personal+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Jerusalem","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Theory and Practice of Psychiatry","description":"Based on years of teaching psychiatry to medical students and residents, this single-authored textbook offers a conversational yet detailed guide to modern psychiatric theory and practice. Exploring various approaches to psychiatric disorders - including neurobiology, dimensional personality assessment, behavioral science, and psychodynamic and cognitive theories - it lucidly illustrates each approach's strengths and weaknesses and suggests how clinicians can interweave them in working with patients. Using clinical vignettes and recent research findings to illustrate the connections between phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment, it covers all of the major psychiatric disorders and includes tables listing their DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. The book offers balanced coverage of subjects that receive scant attention in other introductory textbooks, including the limitations of the DSM-IV categorical approach to psychiatric diagnosis, controversies surrounding the dissociative disorders and \\"recovered memories,\\" and the prescription of stimulant medications to children with suspected attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Later chapters provide practical guidelines for estimating a patient's risk of suicide and violence and for assessing competence to consent to medical or psychiatric treatment. In eschewing a dry recitation of clinical syndromes for an engaging discussion aimed at teaching the reader how to \\"think psychiatrically,\\" the book will appeal to medical students, psychiatric residents, mental health clinicians, and primary care physicians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BDDRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piet Mondrian","description":"Dutch painter Piet Mondrian died in New York City in 1944, but his work and legacy have been far from static since then. From market pressures to personal relationships and scholarly agendas, posthumous factors have repeatedly transformed our understanding of his oeuvre. In The Afterlife of Piet Mondrian, Nancy J. Troy explores the controversial circumstances under which our conception of the artist's work has been shaped since his death, an account that describes money-driven interventions and personal and professional rivalries in forthright detail. Troy reveals how collectors, curators, scholars, dealers and the painter's heirs all played roles in fashioning Mondrian's legacy, each with a different reason for seeing the artist through a particular lens. She shows that our appreciation of his work is influenced by how it has been conserved, copied, displayed, and publicized, and she looks at the popular appeal of Mondrian's instantly recognizable style in fashion, graphic design, and a vast array of consumer commodities. Ultimately, Troy argues that we miss the evolving significance of Mondrian's work if we examine it without regard for the interplay of canonical art and popular culture. A fascinating investigation into Mondrian's afterlife, this book casts new light on how every artist's legacy is constructed as it circulates through the art world and becomes assimilated into the larger realm of visual experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FG-KMQEACAAJ&dq=Piet+Mondrian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spokesmen for God","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6ZfvwEACAAJ&dq=Spokesmen+for+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Modify Volkswagen Bus Suspension, Brakes and Chassis for High Performance (SpeedPro Series)","description":"The complete practical guide to modifying VW Bus (Transporter) T1 to T5 suspension, brakes and chassis for maximum performance.

The ghost of a witch and the parson who sent her up for trial and is now tormenting himself ... crimes, orgies, and the Devil in person.\\" - \\"Illustrated London News\\" Samuel Fleming, an aging priest, is tormented by doubts on the case of Joan Flower and her daughters Margaret and Philippa, whom he helped condemn to death as witches in 1618. Were they guilty? Was justice done? Did he do all he could to save their souls? The spirit of Joan Flower appears to him and tells him that she has been rejected by both Heaven and Hell and is condemned to wander the earth. She unfolds a story of horror, telling how she and her daughters became witches, participated in orgies at the witches' sabbath with the Devil himself, cast spells to kill and torment their enemies, and eventually faced trial and execution. As Samuel listens, he tries desperately to find some way to save the witch's soul. And the stakes are high: for as the witch tells her horrifying tale, Samuel realizes that hers is not the only soul in jeopardy, and if he fails, he may be joining her in Hell! Hilda Lewis (1896-1974), a prolific author of historical fiction, ranked \\"The Witch and the Priest\\" (1956), based on the real-life case of the Witches of Belvoir, as her own favourite among her many novels.

From tireless marketers to pandering politicians, the forces of modernity have lulled us into lazy categorizations of people, erasing the natural nuances of being human. We are all now accustomed to being reduced to a demographic man, woman, black, white, old, young. But while these factors may inform our lived experience, what if there is something more fundamentally important that determines our behavior? Bob Raleigh, founder of PathSight Predictive Science, argues that biological instincts are the most foundational determinants of our behavior. PathSight has pioneered a new model that draws on the latest findings in neuroscience, data science, and behavioral science to classify people in five distinct groups, depending on what they instinctively care about most: nurturing, fairness, loyalty, authority, or purity. Their data, drawn from large-scale studies with over 50,000 participants, show that people who share the same instinctual patterns will engage the world in extremely predictable ways, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, income, and education. Knowing the impact that instinct has on behavior has all kinds of advantages. You can tailor any communication to make it maximally effective for a particular audience. You can strive to empathize with a person you ve always found mystifying. And of course, understanding what truly makes you tick is an invaluable step on your journey to self-discovery.

Its intention is to connect these secondary movements and figures with the primary forces of the century, and to supply a background in American history for the Prohibitionists and the Pente-costalists; the diet-faddists and the dealers in mail-order Personality; the play censors and the Fundamen-talists; the free-lovers and eugenists; the cranks and possibly the saints. Sects, cults, manias, movements, fads, religious excitements, and the relation of each of these to the others and to the orderly progress of America are the subject. The subject is of course as timely at the beginning of the twenty-first century as when the book first appeared in 1928.

Beginning in the 1980s, thousands of failing state-owned enterprises worldwide have been turned over to the private sector. But public opinion has turned against privatization. A large political backlash has been brewing for some time, infused by accusations of corruption, abuse of market power, and neglect of the poor. What is the real record of privatization and are the criticisms justified? 'Privatization in Latin America' evaluates the empirical evidence on privatization in a region that has witnessed an extensive decline in the state's share of production over the past 20 years. The book is a compilation of recent studies that provide a comprehensive analysis of the record of and accusations against privatization, with important recommendations for the future. Seven countries are investigated: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. This book will be vital to anyone interested in the privatization debate but especially to those involved in civil service reform, corporate governance, economic policy, finance, and anticorruption efforts. 'Privatization is important but controversial. While economists typically favor it, others are skeptical. This book provides strong scientific evidence that privatization has been beneficial for many Latin American countries, although some privatizations failed and some groups in society lost out. As usual, the devil is in the details: how privatization is carried out and what reforms accompany it are crucial to its success. The book is definitely an invaluable contribution to the privatization debate.' --Oliver Hart, Andrew E.

All 19 chapters have new references and cutting-edge material that will prepare psychiatrists and residents to treat patients with compassion and skill. The book offers the following features: * Each chapter integrates new neurobiological findings with psychodynamic understanding so that clinicians can approach their patients with a truly biopsychosocial treatment plan.* Excellent writing and an intuitive structure make complicated psychodynamic concepts easy to understand so that readers can grasp the practical application of theory in everyday practice.* The book links clinical understanding to the new DSM-5? nomenclature so that clinicians and trainees can adapt psychodynamic thinking to the new conceptual models of disorders.* New coverage of psychodynamic thinking with relation to the treatment of patients on the autism spectrum addresses an increasingly important practice area.* Posttraumatic stress and dissociative disorders have been combined to allow for integrated coverage of primary psychiatric disorders related to trauma and stressors. A boon to clinicians in training and practice, the book has been meticulously edited and grounded in the latest research.

But while much has been written about Nostradamus's predictions and their validity, little is known of the man. This definitive biography by bestselling historian Ian Wilson reveals the man behind the legend for the first time. Tracing Nostradamus's life from his early years to his skillful treatment of Black Plague sufferers, his flight from agents of the Spanish Inquisition, and his career as an advisor to the king of France, Nostradamus separates fact from fiction and reveals a complex figure who, whether or not he could see future events, was indelibly marked by those of his own time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jqvcAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decision At Leyte","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z83xPwAACAAJ&dq=Decision+At+Leyte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","description":"This text presents a definitive treatise on discrete-time signal processing.

This transformation occurs against the backdrop of the psychological struggle between the individual's role as a member of that black collective, and the opportunity, secured from the federal government, to advance and integrate into the larger society, thereby fulfilling the ?American Dream?.

A former assistant to Richard Avedon, she has published her work to wide acclaim over the past twenty-five years. As seen in this extraordinary book, Wilson's subjects range from legendary West Texas cattle ranches to impoverished Plains Indian reservations to lavish border-town cotillions. Also featured are compelling portraits of artists who are associated with the region, including Donald Judd, Ed Ruscha, and Sam Shepard. The unforgettable images in That Day, most of which are previously unpublished, tell sharply drawn stories of the people and places that have shaped, and continue to shape, the nation's most dynamic and unyielding land. Text from Wilson's journals accompanies the photographs, recalling her personal experiences behind the camera at the moment when a particular image was captured. With her incisive eye, Wilson casts a fresh light on the West--a topic of enduring fascination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BJTBCwAAQBAJ&dq=Land+and+Light+in+the+American+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","description":"An instructional resource and inspirational guide to daily life describes each step on the path to spiritual enlightenment and explains how to practice everyday morality, meditation, wisdom, and compassion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PzCF2_VfeN0C&dq=How+to+Practice+:+The+Way+to+a+Meaningful+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dardedel: Rumi, Hafez & Love in New York","description":"A most unusual novel is Manoucher Parvin s Dardedel: Rumi, Hafez, and Lovein New York.

By all the laws of probability, King Harold ought to have won the battle of Hastings without difficulty and to have enjoyed a peaceful and enlightened reign.

They were the biggest and brashest icons that New York, and possibly America, has ever produced--magnificent giants that became intimately familiar around the globe. Their builders were possessed of a singular determination to create wonders of capitalism as well as engineering, refusing to admit defeat before natural forces, economics, or politics. No one knows the history of the towers better than New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton. In a vivid, brilliantly researched narrative, the authors re-create David Rockefeller's ambition to rebuild lower Manhattan, the spirited opposition of local storeowners and powerful politicians, the bold structural innovations that later determined who lived and died, master builder Guy Tozzoli's last desperate view of the towers on September 11, and the charged and chaotic recovery that could have unraveled the secrets of the buildings' collapse but instead has left some enduring mysteries.

Are you aware that the Southern Railway once used half of the railroad tunnels in the state? Indiana's first railroad, built in Shelbyville, was only a mile long, but in 1847, completion of a major steam railroad from Madison to Indianapolis made the state's capital a center of transportation. Unlike canals, railroads could be built just about anywhere. Southern Indiana's quickly growing network of rail lines was able to haul tons of goods at low cost, and enabled settlers to travel great distances in a single day. Railroad Depots of Southern Indiana takes the reader on a journey through the towns and cities that shape Indiana's railroad lore.

Living Language new terms serie. Project management & controlling \\\\ Anglo Russki slovar upravlenie projektami","description":"Nineteenth-century readers had an appetite for books so big they seemed to contain the whole world: immense novels, series of novels, encyclopaedias. Especially in Eurasia and North America, especially among the middle and upper classes, people had the space, time, and energy for very long books. More than other multi-volume nineteenth-century collections, the dictionaries, or their descendants of the same name, remain with us in the twenty-first century. Online or on paper, people still consult Oxford for British English, Webster for American, Grimm for German, Littr  for French, Dahl for Russian. Even in spaces whose literary languages already had long philological and lexicographic traditions-Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin-the burgeoning imperialisms and nationalisms of the nineteenth century generated new dictionaries. The Whole World in a Book explores a period in which globalization, industrialization, and social mobility were changing language in unimaginable ways. Newly automated technologies and systems of communication expanded the international reach of dictionaries, while rising literacy rates, book consumption, and advertising led to their unprecedented popularization. Dictionaries in the nineteenth century became more than dictionaries: they were battlefields between prestige languages and lower-status dialects; national icons celebrating the language and literature of the nation-state; and sites of innovative authorship where middle and lower classes, volunteers, women, colonial subjects, the deaf, and missionaries joined the ranks of educated white men in defining how people communicated and understood the world around them. In this volume, eighteen of the world's leading scholars investigate these lexicographers asking how the world within which they lived supported their projects? What did language itself mean for them? What goals did they try to accomplish in their dictionaries?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hiy7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Year of Marriage: Enhancing the Success of Your Marriage Right from the Start -- And Even Before It Begins","description":"Rabbi Dr. Abraham J.

Gone are the days of frequent firsthand contact with the president. Now, the press sees the president only at tightly controlled and orchestrated press conferences. In addition, Thomas sees a growing -- and alarming -- reluctance among reporters to question government spokesmen and probe for the truth. The result has been a wholesale failure by journalists to fulfill what is arguably their most vital role in contemporary American life -- to be the watchdogs of democracy. Today's journalists, according to Thomas, have become subdued, compromised lapdogs. Here, the legendary journalist and bestselling author delivers a hard-hitting manifesto on the precipitous decline in the quality and ethics of political reportage -- and issues a clarion call for change. Thomas confronts some of the most significant issues of the day, including the jailing of reporters, the conservative swing in television news coverage, and the administration's increased insistence on \\"managed\\" news. But she is most emphatic about reporters' failure to adequately question President George W. Bush and White House spokesmen about the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, and on subjects ranging from homeland security to the economy. This, she insists, was a dire lapse. Drawing on her peerless knowledge of journalism, Washington politics, and nine presidential administrations, as well as frank interviews with leading journalists past and present, Thomas provides readers with a rich historical perspective on the roots of American journalism, the circumstances attending the rise and fall of its golden age, and the nature and consequences of its current shortcomings. The result is a powerful, eye-opening discourse on the state of political reportage -- as well as a welcome and inspiring demand for meaningful and lasting reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lixOlrqPeqoC&dq=Watchdogs+of+Democracy%3F:+The+Waning+Washington+Press+Corps+and+How+It+Has+Failed+the+Public&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Song of Longing: AN ETHIOPIAN JOURNEY","description":"\\"A rich, descriptive account. . . .

This 'Queen of the Seas' was even more magnificently luxurious than the Titanic and unlike her, a remarkable salvage operation was achieved some sixty years later by two young and relatively inexperienced divers. In this book one of these divers tells the story of the disaster and the remarkable salvage work that he and his partner Alec Crawford undertook. After the war salvage attempts were abortive and written off as impossible until Simon Martin and Alec Crawford took a lucky trip to Foula in 1973. They were soon making plans to locate the undivable wreck and salve its extremely valuable non-ferrous metal. The story is a combination of treasure hunting and remarkable diving operations, the excitement of pin-pointing the wreck, diving and discovering the massive wreckage. In all they salvaged nearly 250 tons of valuable metal. The story was first told in 1980 and is reproduced now just as it was originally written, although an introduction and postscript have been added.For Simon Martin the dive was the greatest achievement of his life, but for Alec Crawford it was a stepping stone to greatness. Today he stands at the peak of his profession having successfully carried out a salvage operation which no-one else in the world could even have attempted - working with his own patented systems he located the wreck Persia in almost 2 miles depth of water and lifted millions of gold, silver, diamonds and jewels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dIIqAQAAIAAJ&dq=Other+%22Titanic%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Win at Super Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Games","description":"Offers tips on how to conquer the challenges presented by Drakkhen, Final Fight, Ultraman, Super Mario World, and other games for the sixteen-bit video game system","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OewtHQAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Win+at+Super+Nintendo+Entertainment+System+(NES)+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinfolk: Unsung Heroes","description":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse is about anger over the loss of what the shapeshifting Garou hold dearest: Gaia, the Earth itself.

Egan leads us on an unconventional, freewheeling tour: from America's oldest continuously inhabited community, the Ancoma Pueblo in New Mexico, to the high kitsch of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where London Bridge has been painstakingly rebuilt stone by stone; from the fragile beauty of Idaho's Bitterroot Range to the gross excess of Las Vegas, a city built as though in defiance of its arid environment. In a unique blend of travel writing, historical reflection, and passionate polemic, Egan has produced a moving study of the West: how it became what it is, and where it is going. \\"The writing is simply wonderful. From the opening paragraph, Egan seduces the reader. . . . Entertaining, thought provoking.\\" --The Arizona Daily Star Weekly \\"A western breeziness and love of open spaces shines through Lasso the Wind. . . .

Dickens's own story is one of rags to riches; from bankruptcy, prison and enforced child labor in his youth to a life of fame and fortune in adulthood, yet one that was overshadowed by guilt and secrecy. His life seems to echo the plots of his epic novels: indeed he was strongly influenced by personal experience and his stories brim with references to the places and characters he knew and the preoccupations that haunted his life. At a remarkably young age, Dickens achieved the public respectability, wealth and international fame he had craved during his impoverished childhood. However, his road to personal happiness was a far less successful one. Scarred by the memory of his father's bankruptcy, he experienced continued anxieties over money and he often found himself supporting members of his family financially. Dickens, a writer who celebrated domestic harmony and familial affection in his work, had also to brave the shame of public anger when he separated from his wife of over twenty years for his secret mistress, Ellen Ternan. As a strong supporter of social reform, Dickens's writings frequently addressed issues of contemporary concern. In Dickens - Public Life and Private Passion, Peter Ackroyd highlights the reality of life in the Victorian era and the great landmarks and events of the time, all of which were to be profound influences on Dickens's life and work. Dickens was a mercurial character, with enormous vitality, wit and humor, yet he also lived a sense of loss and longing that constantly reiterated itself in his work. He died having achieved success and riches he aspired to, while still harboring the deep sadness he had experienced all is life. Illustrated with contemporary images and photographs, Ackroyd presents a fascinating introduction to his best-loved and his time.

Do you remember events differently from how they really happened? Where do your superstitions come from? How do morals evolve? Why are some people religious and others nonreligious? Everyone has thoughts and questions like these, and now Andrew Newberg and Mark Waldman expose, for the first time, how our complex views emerge from the neural activities of the brain. Bridging science, psychology, and religion, they demonstrate, in simple terminology, how the brain perceives reality and transforms it into an extraordinary range of personal, ethical, and creative premises that we use to build meaning, value, spirituality, and truth into our lives. When you come to understand this remarkable process, it will change forever the way you look at the world and yourself. Supported by groundbreaking research, including brain scans of people as they pray, meditate, and even speak in tongues, Newberg and Waldman propose a new model for how deep convictions emerge and influence our lives. You will even glimpse how the mind of an atheist works when contemplating God. Using personal stories, moral paradoxes, and optical illusions, the authors demonstrate how our brains construct our fondest assumptions about reality, offering recommendations for exercising your most important \\"muscle\\" in order to develop a more life-affirming, flexible range of attitudes. You'll discover how to: Recognize when your beliefs are altered by othersGuard against mental traps and prejudicial thinkingDistinguish between destructive and constructive beliefsCultivate spiritual and ethical ideals Ultimately, we must always return to our beliefs. From the ordinary to the extraordinary, they give meaning to the mysteries of life, providing us with our individual uniqueness and the ability to fill our lives with joy. Most important, though, they give us inspiration and hope, beacons to guide us through the light and dark corners of the soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iM1iFdvzyQMC&dq=Why+We+Believe+What+We+Believe:+Uncovering+Our+Biological+Need+for+Meaning,+Spirituality,+and+Truth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seismic Design of Buildings and Bridges for Civil and Structural Engineers","description":"Everything civil and structural engineers in California need to prepare for the seismic design topics of the Special Civil Engineering Exam and California Structural Engineering Exam.

What begins as a tender and intimate attachment between two young girls deepens in adulthood into something complex and perilous, as Lara's life spins in increasingly erratic circles while Angel's passionate devotion to her remains undiminished. It is a feverish and impenetrable relationship, of reckless master and willing slave, one forged to shield both Angel and Lara from the harshness of their surroundings, as well as from the far greater terrors of the self. It is a relationship that will end in terror for the young women, and for their families.

The achievements of science and technology in the previous century are unparalleled in history. They provide the potential for the solution of all the problems faced by the planet, and equally for its total destruction. Allegedly scientific theories are being used to \\"prove\\" that criminality is caused, not by social conditions, but by a \\"criminal gene.\\" Black people are alleged to be disadvantaged, not because of discrimination, but because of their genetic make-up. Similar arguments are used for poor people, single mothers, women, and so on. Of course, such \\"science\\" is highly convenient for right wing politicians intent on ruthlessly cutting welfare. In the field of theoretical physics and cosmology there is a growing tendency towards mysticism. The \\"Big Bang\\" theory of the origin of the universe is being used to justify the existence of a Creator, as in the book of Genesis. For the first time in centuries, science appears to lend credence to religious obscurantism. Yet that is only one side of the story. A growing number of scientists are becoming discontented with the old outlook. The rapid rise of the theory of chaos and complexity is one of the most significant developments in science at the present time. Many of the ideas expressed by this new trend are strikingly similar to the theories of dialectical materialism worked out by Marx and Engels over 160 years ago. A significant part of this present work is devoted to an explanation of the relationship between Marxist philosophy and the new theories. Will this encounter provide the basis for a new and exciting breakthrough in the methodology of science?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GF7MAEACAAJ&dq=Reason+in+revolt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","description":"Badger is so old that he knows he must soon die, so he does his best to prepare his friends.

In this book Karen Linn shows how the banjo - despite design innovations and several modernizing agendas - has failed to escape its image as a ''half-barbaric'' instrument symbolic of antimodernism and sentimentalism. Caught in the morass of American racial attitudes and often used to express ambivalence toward modern industrial society, the banjo stood in opposition to the ''official'' values of rationalism, modernism, and belief in the beneficence of material progress. Linn uses popular literature, visual arts, advertisements, film, performance practices, instrument construction and decoration, and song lyrics to illustrate how notions about the banjo have changed. Her text traces the instrument from its African origins through the 1980s, alternating between themes of urban modernization and rural nostalgia. She examines the banjo fad of bourgeois Northerners during the late nineteenth century, African-American banjo tradition and the commercially popular cultural image of the southern black banjo player, the banjo in ragtime and early jazz, and the white Southerner and mountaineer as banjo player.''Well written and well researched; Linn has amassed an impressive amount of data, and she uses it effectively. . . . This is an excellent book that should be of interest to not only historians, folklorists, and musicologists but also the banjo player and the general reader.''--Charlie Seemann, Journal of Southern History ''An absolute must read for anyone interested in the banjo.''--Five Stringer ''Concise, well-supported, and provocative. . . . The clearest voice of revelation regarding American's most misunderstood instrument.''--Bob Fulcher, Journal of Country Music ''An intriguing analysis of the role of the banjo in recent American culture and society. . . . Highly recommended.''--R. D. Cohen, Choice ''Uses everything from sentimental novels and escaped slave posters to Felix the Cat cartoons and magazine advertisements to create impressive cultural history of what the author calls the 'idea of the banjo.' . . . Linn's wonderful book is scholarly without being jargoned, serious without being tedious. . . . A book for dipping into, underlining, reading aloud in snatches, and opening repeatedly.''--Rachel Rubin, Banjo Newsletter","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ra35uzp5gJQC&dq=That+Half-Barbaric+Twang:+THE+BANJO+IN+AMERICAN+POPULAR+CULTURE+(Music+in+American+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If You Are Afraid of Heights","description":"It s hard for anyone to go about his or her day without crossing a bridge, scaling a ladder, or climbing an exterior stair case.

Kasimir Czerniak was an enigmatic Polish aristocrat whose passage into manhood at the age of twelve was determined by his ability to hold a heavy sword over the neck of a puppy without dropping it. He served in World War II as a spy, became a millionaire in England, and later retired to Switzerland, where he lived in comfort with his dog, Anna Karenina the third. And then, one day, he vanished without a trace. All that remained of his life was a mysterious old trunk full of his papers: mostly correspondence with family members in need of advice. The Wisdom of Uncle Kasimir presents these weird and wonderful findings, as compiled by Kasimir's grandniece and nephew. Uncle Kasimir's advice is never what you'd expect (his English is a little unreliable, and it's not uncommon for him to mistake a headache for a haddock) but it's always helpful-if hilariously unorthodox.

Rather, as David Brady demonstrates, poverty is the result of politics. In Rich Democracies, Poor People, Brady investigates why poverty is so entrenched in some affluent democracies whereas it is a solvable problem in others. Drawing on over thirty years of data from eighteen countries, Brady argues that cross-national and historical variations in poverty are principally driven by differences in the generosity of the welfare state. An explicit challenge to mainstream views of poverty as an inescapable outcome of individual failings or a society's labor markets and demography, this book offers institutionalized power relations theory as an alternative explanation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tsrNBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notable Kin : An Anthology of Columns First Published in the NEHGS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VDNnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Notable+Kin+:+An+Anthology+of+Columns+First+Published+in+the+NEHGS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rude Giants (Book and Audiocassette Tape) (Paperback)","description":"From the World's No. 1 Storyteller, James and the Giant Peach is a children's classic that has captured young reader's imaginations for generations.

From September 11, 2001 to May 2, 2011, Osama Bin Laden evaded intelligence services and special forces units, drones and hunter killer squads. The Exile tells the extraordinary inside story of that decade through the eyes of those who witnessed it: bin Laden's four wives and many children, his deputies and military strategists, his spiritual advisor, the CIA, Pakistan's ISI, and many others who have never before told their stories. Investigative journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy gained unique access to Osama bin Laden's inner circle, and they recount the flight of Al Qaeda's forces and bin Laden's innocent family members, the gradual formation of ISIS by bin Laden's lieutenants, and bin Laden's rising paranoia and eroding control over his organization. They also reveal that the Bush White House knew the whereabouts of bin Laden's family and Al Qaeda's military and religious leaders, but rejected opportunities to capture them, pursuing war in the Persian Gulf instead, and offer insights into how Al Qaeda will attempt to regenerate itself in the coming years. While we think we know what happened in Abbottabad on May 2, 2011, we know little about the wilderness years that led to that shocking event.

W.K. Wimsatt's assumption is that practice and theory of both the past and the present are integrally related-that there is a continuity in the materials of criticism-that a person who studies poetry today has a critical concern, not merely a historical interest, in what Aristotle or Plato said about poetry. He regards the great perennial problems of criticism as arising not by the whim of a tolerantly pluralist choice, but from the nature of language and reality. With profound learning and insight, Wimsatt treats almost the whole range of literary criticism. The first group of essays deals with fallacies he believes are involved in prevalent approaches to the literary object. The next two groups face the responsibilities of the critic who defends literature as a form of knowledge; they treat various problems of structure and style. The last group undertakes to examine the relation of literature to other arts, the relation of evaluative criticism to historical studies, and the relation of literature not only to morals, but more broadly to the whole complex of the Christian religious tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l0YoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'll Never Tell","description":"From Catherine McKenzie, the instant bestselling author of The Good Liar, comes a riveting domestic suspense in the vein of Liane Moriarty that sees five siblings forced to confront a tragedy they thought was buried long ago.

Richard Felson argues that this type of violence is rarely the result of sexism or hatred against women and that sexism may actually inhibit violence against women. He cites research suggesting that the motives for violence against women are similar to the motives for violence against men: to control, to gain retribution, and to promote or defend self-image. These motives play a role in almost all violence, regardless of gender. Using a comparative method to determine how violence against women differs from violence against men, Felson illustrates not only that violence against women is less frequent than violence against men but also that our culture and legal system treat it more harshly. Contrary to the claims that the courts blame the victim in cases of violence against women, the author shows that the tradition of protection of women sometimes produces the opposite effect, and that it is due process and not sexism that makes, for instance, rape cases seem biased against women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvmOQgAACAAJ&dq=Violence+and+Gender+Reexamined+(Law+and+Public+Policy:+Psychology+and+the+Social+Sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Killing Spring: A Joanne Kilbourn Mystery","description":"Gail Bowen, winner of the 1995 Arthur Ellis Award for best crime novel for her last Joanne Kilbourn mystery, A Colder Kind of Death, is back  with her most daring mystery to date. In the horrifying opening paragraph of A Killing Spring, Reed Gallagher, the head of the School of Journalism at the university where Joanne Kilbourn teaches, is found dead in a seedy rooming house. He is dressed in women s lingerie, with an electric cord around his neck. Suicide, the police say. A clear case of accidental suicide. But for Joanne, who takes on the thankless task of breaking the news to Gallagher s wife, this death is just the first in a series of misfortunes that rock her life, both professional and personal. A few days after Gallagher s death, the School of Journalism is vandalized  its offices and computers are trashed, and homophobic graffiti are sprayed everywhere. Then an unattractive and unpopular journalism student in Joanne s politics class stops coming to school after complaining to an unbelieving Joanne that she s being sexually harassed. Clearly, all is not as well at the university as Joanne had thought. Nor is all well in her love life after the casual racism of a stranger drives a wedge between Joanne and her lover, Inspector Alex Kequahtooway. To make matters worse, Joanne is unceremoniously fired by her best friend from the weekly political panel on Nationtv, which she s being doing for years. Badly shaken by these calamities, Joanne struggles to carry cheerfully on. Action, she knows, is better for her than moping.

Within these remarkable women and men are poignant, outrageous stories drawn from the edge of life. But fear of career backlash and reprisals have made them reluctant to talk to outsiders about their experience. Now Echo Heron, New York Times bestselling author of Intensive Care, draws truths far stranger than fiction out of her colleagues--and allows the nurses to speak to us in their own words. Ranging from inspiring to tragic to outrageously funny, these narratives are real life medical dramas as experienced by nurses across the country--each practicing in a variety of specialties, including cardiac care, labor and delivery, burns, the ER--even a nurse who works in dolphin care. Tending Lives portrays a penitentiary nurse responsible for orchestrating a murderer's execution; a stroke victim who rose out of his depression when his nurses began telling him jokes; and, perhaps the most riveting testimony, the moment-by-moment memories of several nurses who served in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing--gripping accounts that give us new perspectives on the horror and heroism of that nightmare day. Pediatric nurses, psychiatric nurses, home-care nurses, intensive care nurses--all with distinct voices and unique stories to tell. Filled with both tears and laughter, and charged with the issues that afflict nursing care today, Tending Lives is a gripping, moving, inspiring book, a fitting tribute to a noble profession.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=veQKZJxZZMAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Workbasket & Home Arts Magazine April 1984","description":"The WORKBASKET magazine inspired readers for sixty-one years.

In this provocative book, Ramesh Srinivasan describes the internet as both an enabler of frictionless efficiency and a dirty tangle of politics, economics, and other inefficient, inharmonious human activities. We may love the immediacy of Google search results, the convenience of buying from Amazon, and the elegance and power of our Apple devices, but it's a one-way, top-down process. We're not asked for our input, or our opinions only for our data. The internet is brought to us by wealthy technologists in Silicon Valley and China. It's time, Srinivasan argues, that we think in terms beyond the Valley. Srinivasan focuses on the disconnection he sees between designers and users, producers and consumers, and tech elites and the rest of us. The recent Cambridge Analytica and Russian misinformation scandals exemplify the imbalance of a digital world that puts profits before inclusivity and democracy. In search of a more democratic internet, Srinivasan takes us to the mountains of Oaxaca, East and West Africa, China, Scandinavia, North America, and elsewhere, visiting the  design labs  of rural, low-income, and indigenous people around the world. He talks to a range of high-profile public figures including Elizabeth Warren, David Axelrod, Eric Holder, Noam Chomsky, Lawrence Lessig, and the founders of Reddit, as well as community organizers, labor leaders, and human rights activists.. To make a better internet, Srinivasan says, we need a new ethic of diversity, openness, and inclusivity, empowering those now excluded from decisions about how technologies are designed, who profits from them, and who are surveilled and exploited by them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=br74DwAAQBAJ&dq=In+This+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Castaway","description":"Greg and Tess MacAvoy are one of four prominent Nantucket couples who count each other as best friends.

Some of the men and women in Spirit Seizures dwell contentedly on the surface of life, even making a science or an art of what they see around them. But many of the characters in these stories see sometimes calmly, sometimes with agitation beneath life's surface, beyond sun's light. The title story tells of a psychic women, pregnant with her second child, who welcomes over her farmer husband's objections the visits of an older couple desiring a s ance with the spirit of their dead daughter. Spirits are also summoned in \\"Rocking on Water, Floating in Glass,\\" when a woman consults the shade of Sarah Bernhardt to help her decide whether to leave her refuge in a dark antique shop and reenter the world of the living. The husband in \\"Ramon; Souvenirs\\" recalls his wife's obsession with pueblo culture and her ambitious courtship of the impotent Indian elder who she hopes will initiate her into native spiritual mysteries. But the greatest desire of La B te, a spectacularly obese model painted by the French impressionists, is to herself become a perfect object, viewed and adored for her form, not her crude essence. Mrs. Grant in \\"With Wings Cross Water\\" is painfully isolated from the surface of her family's life by her fears of terminal illness, of what lies beneath her skin. And Mrs. Gump, the reverend's housekeeper, prays and cleans the house furiously, hoping to obliterate all traces of the worldly beauty that distracts her employer and her artist son from the hereafter. Written with humor but often poignant when they reveal the veins of longing that run through men and women, the stories in Spirit Seizures follow the elusive currents that link us to the eternal, the fluid boundaries that wash between love and mourning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYVWAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Gift of Stories: Discovering How to Deal With Mental Illness","description":"Stories by people diagnosed with a mental illness with which they have learned to live.

Bound to be widely read and much discussed, The Elm and the Expert, written in Jerry Fodor's usual highly readable, irreverent style, provides a lively discussion of semantic issues about mental representation, with special attention to issues raised by Frege's problem, Twin cases, and the putative indeterminacy of reference. The book extends and revises a view of the relation between mind and meaning that the author has been developing since his 1975 book, The Language of Thought. There is a general consensus among philosophers that a referential semantics for mental representation cannot support a robust account of intentional explanation. Fodor has himself espoused this view in previous publications, and it is widespread (if tacit) throughout the cognitive science community. This book is largely a reconsideration of the arguments that are supposed to ground this consensus. Fodor concludes that these considerations are far less decisive than has been supposed. He offers a theory sketch in which psychological explanation is intentional, psychological processes are computational, and the semantic properties of mental representations are referential. Connections with the problem of \\"naturalizing\\" intentionality are also explored. The four lectures in The Elm and the Expert were originally delivered in Paris in the spring of 1993 to inaugurate the Jean Nicod Lecture series. The Jean Nicod Lectures are delivered annually by a leading philosopher of mind or philosophically oriented cognitive scientist. The 1993 lectures marked the centenary of the birth of the French philosopher and logician Jean Nicod (1893-1931). The lectures are sponsored by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) as part of its effort to develop the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science in France.

Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hasty Marriage","description":"COULDN'T HE PRETEND JUST A LITTLE?

The author argues that what underlies Edwards' writings is a radical shift from the traditional Western metaphysics of substance and form to a new conception of the world as a network of dispositions: active and abiding principles that possess reality apart from their manifestations in actions and events. Edwards' dispositional ontology enables him to restate the Augustinian-Calvinist tradition in theology in a strikingly modern philosophical framework. A prime example of Edwards' innovative reconstruction in philosophical theology is his conception of God as both eternal actuality and a disposition to repeat that actuality within God and also through creation. This view is a compelling alternative to the traditional Western doctrine of God as changeless actuality, on the one hand, and the recent process theologians' excessive stress on God's involvement in change, on the other. Edwards' achievement was that he saw dynamic movement as essential to God's own life without compromising the traditional Christian tenets of God's prior actuality and transcendence. The author of this volume also explicates the way in which Edwards' dynamic reconception of reality informs his theories of imagination, aesthetic perception, the knowledge of God, and the meaning of history.

But while abilities to communicate improved, Palmer shows how other technologies simultaneously shrank admirals' windows of decision.

Can an unregulated airline industry be profitable? Is air travel safe? While economic regulation provided a certain stability for both passengers and the industry, deregulation changed everything. A new fare structure emerged; travelers faced a variety of fares and travel restrictions; and the offerings changed frequently. In the last fifteen years, the airline industry's earnings have fluctuated wildly. New carriers entered the industry, but several declared bankruptcy, and Eastern, Pan Am, and Midway were liquidated. As financial pressures mounted, fears have arisen that air safety is being compromised by carriers who cut costs by skimping on maintenance and hiring inexperienced pilots. Deregulation itself became an issue with many critics calling for a return to some form of regulation. In this book, Steven A. Morrison and Clifford Winston assert that all too often public discussion of the issues of airline competition, profitability, and safety take place without a firm understanding of the facts. The policy recommendations that emerge frequently ignore the long-run evolution of the industry and its capacity to solve its own problems. This book provides a comprehensive profile of the industry as it has evolved, both before and since deregulation. The authors identify the problems the industry faces, assess their severity and their underlying causes, and indicate whether government policy can play an effective role in improving performance. They also develop a basis for understanding the industry's evolution and how the industry will eventually adapt to the unregulated economic environment. Morrison and Winston maintain that although the airline industry has not reached long-run equilibrium, its evolution is proceeding in a positive direction one that will preserve and possibly enhance the benefits of deregulation to travelers and carriers. They conclude that the federal government's primary policy objective should be to expand the benefits from unregulated market forces to international travel.

He was regarded by later Greeks as a contemporary of Homer. Three works survive under Hesiod's name: (1) \\"Works and Days,\\" addressed to his brother. In it he gives us the allegories of the two Strifes, and the myth of Pandora; stresses that every man must work; describes the accepted Five Ages of the world; delivers moral advice; surveys in splendid style a year's work on a farm; gives precepts on navigation; and propounds lucky and unlucky days. (2) \\"Theogony,\\" a religious work about the rise of the gods and the universe from Chaos to the triumph of Zeus, and about the progeny of Zeus and of goddesses in union with mortal men. (3) \\"The Shield\\" (not by Hesiod), an extract from a \\"Catalogue of Women,\\" the subject being Alcmena and her son Heracles and his contest with Cycnus, with a description of Heracles' shield.

Deborah Tannen revolutionized our thinking about relationships between women and men in her #1 bestseller You Just Don't Understand. In That's Not What I Meant!, the internationally renowned sociolinguist and expert on communication demonstrates how our conversational signals voice level, pitch and intonation, rhythm and timing, even the simple turns of phrase we choose are powerful factors in the success or failure of any relationship. Regional speech characteristics, ethnic and class backgrounds, age, and individual personality all contribute to diverse conversational styles that can lead to frustration and misplaced blame if ignored but provide tools to improve relationships if they are understood. At once eye-opening, astute, and vastly entertaining, Tannen's classic work on interpersonal communication will help you to hear what isn't said and to recognize how your personal conversational style meshes or clashes with others. It will give you a new understanding of communication that will enable you to make the adjustments that can save a conversation . . . or a relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TaEk73XyCmUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","description":"FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY EDITION - WITH A NEW PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR Here is the Naked Ape at his most primal - in love, at work, at war.

He maintains that the shift began in 1952 with the establishment of the first modern pension fund by General Motors. By 1960 it had become so obvious that a group of young men decided to found a stock-exchange firm catering exclusively to these new investors. Ten years later this firm (Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette) became the most successful, and one of the biggest, Wall Street firms. Drucker's argument, that through pension funds ownership of the means of production had become socialized without becoming nationalized, was unacceptable to the conventional wisdom of the country in the 1970s. Even less acceptable was the second theme of the book: the aging of America. Among the predictions made by Drucker in The Pension Fund Revolution are: that a major health care issue would be longevity; that pensions and social security would be central to American economy and society; that the retirement age would have to be extended; and that altogether American politics would increasingly be dominated by middle-class issues and the values of elderly people. While readers of the original edition found these conclusions hard to accept, Drucker's work has proven to be prescient. In the new epilogue, Drucker discusses how the increasing dominance of pension funds represents one of the most startling power shifts in economic history, and he examines their present-day Impact. The Pension Fund Revolution is now considered a classic text regarding the effects of pension fund ownership on the governance of the American corporation and on the structure of the American economy altogether. The reissuing of this book is more timely now than ever. It provides a wealth of information for sociologists, economists, and political theorists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dcmOtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Pension+Fund+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of the Theory of Markov Processes and Their Applications (Dover Books on Mathematics)","description":"This graduate-level text and reference in probability, with numerous applications to several fields of science, presents nonmeasure-theoretic introduction to theory of Markov processes.

In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a skeleton crew attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. Their survival, and the survival of the men they left behind, depended on their small lifeboat successfully finding the island of South Georgia--a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean. In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+Incredible+Voyage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nigger of the Narcissus","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8BaAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snowy Torrents: Avalanche Accidents in the United States 1972-1979","description":"The present mortality as a result of snow avalanches exceeds the average mortality caused by earthquakes as well as all other forms of slope failure combined.

Still, Microsoft technologists often regard software development as more of a craft than a rigorous process. Given the mission-critical nature of today's software solutions, however, such an approach is vital to ensuring that high-quality projects are delivered on time and within budget. It is possible to create software in a controlled manner without sacrificing productivity or flexibility, says Enricos Manassis. All it takes is a solid grasp of process, methods, and technology. While many books plumb these topics individually, \\"Practical Software Engineering\\" is unique in that it focuses on the intersection of all three. Each chapter explores development issues from the standpoint of: The Rational Unified Process (RUP)Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)The Microsoft .NET platform Through end-to-end coverage of a working application, the book's tutorial shows practitioners how to tap the .NET platform--as others have harnessed the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)--to develop complex enterprise solutions.

His quest for the root of the matter led him beyond the bounds of the conventional in all his musical, written, and visual pieces. The resulting expansion of the definition of art -- with its concomitant emphasis on innovation and invention--earned him a reputation as one of America's most influential contemporary artists. Joan Retallack's conversations with Cage represent the first consideration of his artistic production in its entirety, across genres. Informed by the perspective of age, Cage's comments range freely from his theories of chance and indeterminate composition to his long-time collaboration with Merce Cunningham to the aesthetics of his multimedia works. A composer for whom the whole world -- with its brimming silences and anarchic harmonies -- was a source of music, Cage once claimed, \\"There is no noise, only sounds.\\" As these interviews attest, that penchant for testing traditions reached far beyond his music. His lifelong project, Retallack writes in her comprehensive introduction, was \\"dislodging cultural authoritarianism and gridlock by inviting surprising conjunctions within carefully delimited frameworks and processes.\\" Consummate performer to the end, Cage delivers here just such a conjunction -- a tour de force that provides new insights into the man and a clearer view of the status of art in the 20th century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FP7g3Zz27bgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land","description":"The second book in Moberg's classic Emigrant Novels series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9RbJwAEACAAJ&dq=Unto+a+Good+Land&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Step-by-Step Book About Ferrets","description":"Contains practical advice on how to care for ferrets, including selecting the right ferret, housing, feeding, health care, and breeding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rvssLYzxeiAC&dq=A+Step-by-Step+Book+About+Ferrets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","description":"This book shows how you can break the damaging connection between emotional pain and overeating to uncover your true, natural self by shedding the false skin of unhappiness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vO-8XEtzwUwC&dq=Losing+Your+Pounds+of+Pain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Omega Prodigy","description":"This otherworldly thriller combines mystery, action, and science fiction to relate the adventures and intrigues of 10-year-old Alicia Thompson.

Chapters on genetic approaches to protein kinase functions, the MAP kinase pathway, and cyclin-dependent kinases have been completely updated and new topics covered in depth are: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling, JAK-STAT signalling, suppression of tyrosine kinases by the SOCS family proteins, the TGF? superfamily, and the involvement of protein kinases in response to DNA damage. Throughout, emphasis is placed not on individual kinases, but on the functional aspects of the whole system and the relationship between processes and molecules.

Jensen offers a revolutionary look at the brains of teenagers, dispelling myths and offering practical advice for teens, parents and teachers. Dr. Frances E. Jensen is chair of the department of neurology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. As a mother, teacher, researcher, clinician, and frequent lecturer to parents and teens, she is in a unique position to explain to readers the workings of the teen brain. In The Teenage Brain, Dr. Jensen brings to readers the astonishing findings that previously remained buried in academic journals. The root myth scientists believed for years was that the adolescent brain was essentially an adult one, only with fewer miles on it. Over the last decade, however, the scientific community has learned that the teen years encompass vitally important stages of brain development. Samples of some of the most recent findings include: Teens are better learners than adults because their brain cells more readily \\"build\\" memories. But this heightened adaptability can be hijacked by addiction, and the adolescent brain can become addicted more strongly and for a longer duration than the adult brain. Studies show that girls' brains are a full two years more mature than boys' brains in the mid-teens, possibly explaining differences seen in the classroom and in social behavior. Adolescents may not be as resilient to the effects of drugs as we thought. Recent experimental and human studies show that the occasional use of marijuana, for instance, can cause lingering memory problems even days after smoking, and that long-term use of pot impacts later adulthood IQ. Multi-tasking causes divided attention and has been shown to reduce learning ability in the teenage brain. Multi-tasking also has some addictive qualities, which may result in habitual short attention in teenagers. Emotionally stressful situations may impact the adolescent more than it would affect the adult: stress can have permanent effects on mental health and can to lead to higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Dr. Jensen gathers what we ve discovered about adolescent brain function, wiring, and capacity and explains the science in the contexts of everyday learning and multitasking, stress and memory, sleep, addiction, and decision-making. In this groundbreaking yet accessible book, these findings also yield practical suggestions that will help adults and teenagers negotiate the mysterious world of adolescent development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0q5ZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High-Yield&#8482; Comprehensive USMLE Step 1 Review (High-Yield Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctsf3eQTVd8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","description":"This introduction to bookkeeping for beginning business students demonstrates the use of financial statements, the ledger, the two-column general journal, and other journals normally used in business operations.

But, hidden behind General Dumas's swashbuckling adventures was an even more incredible secret: he was the son of a black slave who rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our own time.

How to Use Symptom Phenomena to Generate Solutions","description":"In the United States, some populations suffer from far greater disparities in health than others. Those disparities are caused not only by fundamental differences in health status across segments of the population, but also because of inequities in factors that impact health status, so-called determinants of health. Only part of an individual's health status depends on his or her behavior and choice; community-wide problems like poverty, unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, poor public transportation, interpersonal violence, and decaying neighborhoods also contribute to health inequities, as well as the historic and ongoing interplay of structures, policies, and norms that shape lives. When these factors are not optimal in a community, it does not mean they are intractable: such inequities can be mitigated by social policies that can shape health in powerful ways. Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity seeks to delineate the causes of and the solutions to health inequities in the United States. This report focuses on what communities can do to promote health equity, what actions are needed by the many and varied stakeholders that are part of communities or support them, as well as the root causes and structural barriers that need to be overcome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AIKPDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Problem+is+the+Solution!+How+to+Use+Symptom+Phenomena+to+Generate+Solutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","description":"Lists and defines words and terms in over seven hundred subject areas including nature, science and technology, domestic life, arts, language, and institutions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYg2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Random+House+Word+Menu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Ben (Juvenile Series)","description":"Working to save the mules in their Kentucky community from being butchered at the cannery, twelve-year-old Scrappie and his friend Red Mule see their cause vindicated when tractors get stuck in the river mud and only mules can pull them out.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DEEdNgAACAAJ&dq=Old+Ben+(Juvenile+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Missing in Action","description":"Dirty.

These activities disguise the overall size of the government, cause overconsumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. This paper analyses such activities in FSU countries, with particular emphasis on two case studies (Azerbaijan and Ukraine). The paper's policy conclusions point to the need to increase energy prices, combined with a strengthening of safety nets to protect the poor, better enforcement of payment discipline, and more efforts to achieve fiscal transparency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWO3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Energy+pricing+in+the+Soviet+Union+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Honorable Correspondent","description":"The freighter Twanee unloaded her cargo at a secret harbor on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf and then hurriedly steamed away. The Twanee s luck until then had been very good; on several occasions its Greek captain had seen Iraqi aircraft and was certain they had spotted him, yet he d been spared. But that night, after reentering international waters, a missile attack sank the Twanee with all hands aboard. The disappearance of the Twanee complicated things for Sarah Tillinghast, an English investigative reporter, as the ship had been a clue within a fragmented tale of unusual goings-on in the Gulf War. Sarah s assignment began with a tip from a quirky whistleblower employed by France s hyper-secretive counter intelligence service, SEDCE. The war between Iraq and Iran lasted eight years, killing one and a half million people. Neither side could point to any tangible gains when it ended. To the arms merchants, including governments who kept the warring parties supplied, it had been a period of great prosperity. In that war, Saddam Hussein was friend to the Western Allies and many others as well, while Iran and its hostage taking leadership were anathema to nearly all. The exception was Count Bertrand  Bobo  de Bossier, head of SEDCE, a brilliant out-of-the-box thinker. Bobo constructed and implemented policies at odds with those of the others, whom he chose to keep uninformed of his views and doings. And since there was virtually no separation between Bobo s personal and professional life, he also excluded his best friend and partner, his subordinate and lover, and his elected superiors. Sarah, whose pursuit of this story leads her to Bobo and his friends, is left to try and piece it all together. But what she discovers poses great risk both for her and the man she fell in love with along the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T89NCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Castle Dangerous (Tales of my landlord)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BZEmHAAACAAJ&dq=Castle+Dangerous+(Tales+of+my+landlord)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cooking of Vienna's empire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xsQ1swEACAAJ&dq=The+cooking+of+Vienna%27s+empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knights (Internet Linked Discovery)","description":"In medieval times, knights were the most powerful soldiers on the battlefield.

Campbell writes about his life growing up poor in Amite County, Mississippi, during the 1930s alongside his older brother, Joe. Though they grew up in a close-knit family and cared for each other, the two went on to lead very different lives. After serving together in World War II, Will became a highly educated Baptist minister who later became a major figure in the early years of the civil rights movement, and Joe became a pharmacist who developed a substance abuse problem that ultimately took his life. Brother to a Dragonfly also serves as a historical record. Though Will's love and dedication to his brother are the primary story, interwoven throughout the narrative is the story of the Jim Crow South and the civil rights movement. Will is present through many of the most pivotal moments in history--he was one of four people who escorted black students integrating the Little Rock public schools; he was the only white person present at the founding of the SCLC; he helped CORE and SNCC Freedom Riders integrate interstate bus travel; he joined Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign of boycotts, sit-ins, and marches in Birmingham; and he was at the Lorraine Motel the night Dr. King was assassinated. Will's accomplishments, however, never take the spotlight from his brother, and as his relationship with Joe evolves, so does Will's faith. Featuring a new foreword by Congressman John Lewis, this book brings back to print the combined lives of Will Campbell--Will the brother and Will the preacher.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BHlQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Hayes of Windsor and his descendants","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Satchel guide to Europe,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wcvdGQAACAAJ&dq=A+Satchel+guide+to+Europe,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The book of three","description":"Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper to a famous oracular sow, sets out on a hazardous mission to save Prydain from the forces of evil.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PKnI7BGANMIC&dq=The+book+of+three&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Succulents in your garden","description":" Designing with Succulents is inspiring, practical, and complete a treasure for any gardener who loves these otherworldly beauties.

In marked contrast to the stereotypical depictions of Victorian women in literature and on television, Draznin reveals a woman seldom seen: the stay-at-home housewife whose activities were not much different than those of her counterparts today. By exploring her daily activities, how she cleaned her home, disciplined her children, managed her servants, stretched a limited budget, and began to indulge herself, one discovers the human dimension of women who lived more than a century ago. While most studies of this period consider values, aspirations, and attitudes, this book concentrates on actions, what these women did all day, to provide readers with a new perspective on Victorian life. Late-Victorian London was a surprisingly modern city with a public face of well-lit streets, an excellent underground railway system, and extended municipal services. In the home, gas stoves were replacing coal ranges and household appliances were becoming more common. Having both money to spend and a strong incentive to buy the new laborsaving devices, ready-to-wear clothing, and other manufactured products, the middle-class matron's resistance to change gave way to a rising consumer culture. Despite her nearly exclusive preoccupation with home and family, these urban women became agents for the modernization of Britain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EdgMLML7DZUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Flashes, Hormones, and Your Health (Harvard Medical School Guides)","description":"What you should know about menopausal hormone therapy--from the renowned Harvard doctor who is one of the pioneers conducting the latest research in the field Recent news stories on the safety of menopausal hormone therapy (also known as hormone replacement therapy, or HRT) have raised public awareness and sparked a national debate.

Over the decades, however, the film s reputation has undergone a reevaluation, and both critics and fans alike have come to appreciate Marnie s many qualities. In Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie, Tony Lee Moral investigates the cultural and political factors governing the 1964 film s production, the causes of its critical and commercial failure, and Marnie s relevance for today s artists and filmmakers. Hitchcock s style, motivation, and fears regarding the film are well-documented in this examination of one of his most undervalued efforts. Moral uses extensive research, including personal interviews with Tippi Hedren and Psycho screenwriter Joseph Stefano as well as unpublished excerpts from interviews with Hitchcock himself to delve into the issues surrounding the film s production and release. This revised edition features four new chapters that provide even more fascinating insights into the film s production and Hitchcock s working methods. Biographies of Winston Graham the author of the novel on which the film is based and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen provide clues into how they brought a feminist viewpoint to Marnie. Additional material addresses Hitchcock s unrealized project Mary Rose and his efforts to bring it to the screen, the director s visual style and subjective approach to Marnie, and an exploration of the  real  Alfred Hitchcock.

Provides profound insights into our perceptions of reality, telepathy, mutants, and parallel universes ? Reveals the occult influences on the Nazis and introduces the alchemist Fulcanelli and the work of Charles Fort and Gurdjieff ? Over Half a Million Copies Sold This groundbreaking, international bestseller, first published in 1960, couples profound insights into the hidden history of humanity and our perceptions of reality with the scientific evidence that supports the existence of paranormal activity, telepathy, and extraterrestrial communications. The first book to explore in depth the Nazi fascination with the occult, Pauwels and Bergier also broke new ground with their study of pyramidology, alchemy and its close kinship with atomic energy, and the possibility of a widespread mutation of humanity that would herald the dawn of a new age for the earth. Their study of secret societies, starting with the Rosicrucians, suggests that such changes are actively being pursued in the present day by a  conspiracy  of the most spiritually and intellectually advanced members of the human race. The Morning of the Magicians also explores the anomalous events collected by Charles Fort, the work of Gurdjieff, and the history of the mysterious Fulcanelli, who was widely believed to have manufactured the philosopher s stone--which provided the Nazis the motive for mounting an intensive search for him during their occupation of Paris. Much more than a collection of strange facts defying conventional wisdom, this book remains a sophisticated philosophical exploration of repressed phenomena and hidden histories that asks its readers to look at reality with ever  awakened eyes.

Thrilled by the challenges of her education, yet repressed by the school atmosphere, she began writing letters home and to the friends she felt lonely for----passionate letters that reveled in bubbling and irreverent mischief and declared the affectionate intensity of the budding poet. Later, after her death at the age of fifty-five, friends and relatives exchanged misunderstandings of the woman they had known----and of the poetic treasure that they had no sure way of evaluating. Out of these sixty-six imagined letters, Judith Farr, herself a poet and Dickinson scholar, has created a brilliant novel, which, written in the language of Emily Dickinson s contemporaries, lays out the entire emotional spectrum of her life. We see the young Emily groping toward poetic expression. We share the bewilderment of her teachers and friends as the girl reacts with the ingenuity of genius to people, books, and events. We marvel at her private letters  To a Mysterious Person.  We smile with her at the confusion of others as they struggle to keep up with the poet s imagination, at those who try to  correct  her mode of expression. We share the experience of the first man to take her photograph. We watch her die, dreadfully and prematurely. When we are done, we have shared in a wondrous mystery, for we are the only ones allowed to know who Emily Dickinson was: these letters are written to us. As Diane Wood Middlebrook has written,  This work of fiction---meticulously researched, delicately attuned to the language of the times---provides an explanation more persuasive than any biography ever will, of what happened to the girl on the brink of womanhood to make her the person who wrote those poems. A startling good read.

Most of these instructional efforts have been directed either at the mathematical basis of the technique or at its practical application as embodied in the several large, formal computer codes available for performing Monte Carlo transport calculations. This book attempts to fill what appears to be a gap in this Monte Carlo literature between the mathematics and the software. Thus, while the mathematical basis for Monte Carlo transport is covered in some detail, emphasis is placed on the application of the technique to the solution of practical radiation transport problems. This is done by using the PC as the basic teaching tool. This book assumes the reader has a knowledge of integral calculus, neutron transport theory, and Fortran programming. It also assumes the reader has available a PC with a Fortran compiler. Any PC of reasonable size should be adequate to reproduce the examples or solve the exercises contained herein. The authors believe it is important for the reader to execute these examples and exercises, and by doing so to become accomplished at preparing appropriate software for solving radiation transport problems using Monte Carlo. The step from the software described in this book to the use of production Monte Carlo codes should be straightforward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EJsACAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering License Review","description":"A Completely New Book.

Now, in the powerful prose sequel to the Academy Award winning Road to Perdition, Collins breaks bold new ground in an epic tale of family secrets and heartbreaking betrayal -- a story of love, loss, and family worthy of The Godfather. It's 1942, and -- from the Atlantic to the Pacific -- the world is torn apart. Ten years earlier Michael O'Sullivan accompanied his gangster father on the road, fleeing from the mobsters who killed his mother and young brother. After an idyllic upbringing by loving adoptive parents in a small Midwestern town, Michael is now deep in the jungles of Bataan, carrying a tommy gun like his father's, fighting the Japanese. When brutal combat unearths deep-buried feelings of violence and revenge, Michael returns to the homefront a battle-scarred veteran of twenty-two, ready to pick up his old war against the Chicago Mob. Suddenly, Michael \\"Satariano\\" must become one of the enemy, working his way quickly up to the trusted side of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's heir, putting himself -- and his soul -- in harm's way. Leaving behind his heartbroken childhood sweetheart, the war hero enters a limbo of crime and corruption -- his only allies: Eliot Ness, seeking one last hurrah as a gangbuster, and a lovely nightclub singer playing her own dangerous game. Even as Michael embraces his father's memory to battle the Mob from within -- leaving bodies and broken lives in his wake -- he finds himself sucked into the very way of life he abhors. In a parallel tale set in 1922, Michael O'Sullivan, Sr., chief enforcer for Irish godfather John Looney, is about to become a father. The bidding of Looney -- and the misdeeds of the ganglord's crazed son Connor -- put the happy O'Sullivan home at risk. Both Michaels reach a crossroads of violence and compromise as two tales converge into the purgatory of good men trapped in bad lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zRL8kbbR4UAC&dq=Road+to+Purgatory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method","description":"What is science?

Few countries have suffered more from the convulsions and bloodshed of twentieth-century Europe than those in the eastern Baltic region.

The Glass Wall features an extraordinary cast of characters contemporary and historical, foreign and indigenous who have lived and fought in the Baltic, western Europe s easternmost stronghold. Too often the destiny of this region has seemed to be to serve as the front line in other people s wars. By telling the stories of warriors and victims, of philosophers and barons, of poets and artists, of rebels and emperors, and of others who lived through years of turmoil and violence, Max Egremont sets forth a brilliant account of a long-overlooked region, on a frontier whose limits may still be in doubt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Y8gEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indian Peoples of Eastern America: A Documentary History of the Sexes","description":"This fascinating collection of primary source materials provides a unique introduction to the woodland Indians who inhabited Northeastern America in the region bordered by the Carolinas, the Great Lakes, and the maritime provinces of Canada.

In addition, extracts from the works of Boyle, Newton, Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz, Kelvin and others show the historical context of ideas about gases, energy and irreversibility. In addition to five thematic essays connecting the classical kinetic theory with 20th century topics such as indeterminism and interatomic forces, there is an extensive international bibliography of historical commentaries on kinetic theory, thermodynamics, etc. published in the past four decades. The book will be useful to historians of science who need primary and secondary sources to be conveniently available for their own research and interpretation, along with the bibliography which makes it easier to learn what other historians have already done on this subject.

The story begins with the Enterprise stuck in an anomaly, warping both space and time so that for every minute the ship is trapped, a month goes by in normal time. The only piece of equipment that can get the ship safely home has been stolen by gangsters in the Dixon Hill holodeck program. Captain Picard, as Dixon Hill, ventures into this San Francisco world to confront the ruthless crime boss and retrieve the crucial item. Soon after, the first of a series of murders on the Enterprise occurs and the murder weapon is found to be a revolver . . . from 1941 Earth. Who is behind the murders? All the clues are given. All the suspects are given. Readers will be engrossed in trying to figure out the answer . . . but only the very clever will guess the murderer's true identity before the final chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mu9Jqw7qsaMC&dq=A+Hard+Rain+(Star+Trek+The+Next+Generation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lunch Box Trivia: Over 75 Tear-Out Fun Facts About the Bible & Other Cool Stuff (Lunch Box Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QkDhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lunch+Box+Trivia:+Over+75+Tear-Out+Fun+Facts+About+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pony Express (Cornerstones of Freedom)","description":"An introduction to this important early form of postal service.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uIdWAAAACAAJ&dq=Pony+Express+(Cornerstones+of+Freedom)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","description":"This book sets forth a set of truly controversial and astonishing theories: First, it proposes that below the surface of the earth is a biosphere of greater mass and volume than the biosphere the total sum of living things on our planet's continents and in its oceans. Second, it proposes that the inhabitants of this subterranean biosphere are not plants or animals as we know them, but heat-loving bacteria that survive on a diet consisting solely of hydrocarbons that is, natural gas and petroleum. And third and perhaps most heretically, the book advances the stunning idea that most hydrocarbons on Earth are not the byproduct of biological debris (\\"fossil fuels\\"), but were a common constituent of the materials from which the earth itself was formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The implications are astounding. The theory proposes answers to often-asked questions: Is the deep hot biosphere where life originated, and do Mars and other seemingly barren planets contain deep biospheres? Even more provocatively, is it possible that there is an enormous store of hydrocarbons upwelling from deep within the earth that can provide us with abundant supplies of gas and petroleum? However far-fetched these ideas seem, they are supported by a growing body of evidence, and by the indisputable stature and seriousness Gold brings to any scientific debate. In this book we see a brilliant and boldly original thinker, increasingly a rarity in modern science, as he develops potentially revolutionary ideas about how our world works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b17dBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Walk In Autumn's Mist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CaDqr0zTs0MC&dq=A+Walk+In+Autumn%27s+Mist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Macmillan World Atlas","description":"What makes one atlas better than another?

Do we have the right to forgive ourselves, whether we ve committed a crime or offended a friend? Can a prisoner be free? Are they any less free than those of us with a mortgage to pay or a school-run to do? As his students discuss these knotty problems, West struggles with his own inherited guilt: his father, uncle and brother all spent serious time in jail. Was it inevitable that one day he would have to spend time inside too? Moving, sympathetic, wise and frequently funny, The Life Inside is an elegantly written and unforgettable book.

I have assumed the reader to have some under standing of the structure of the brain, of basic neurophysiology, and of modern behavioral techniques. It has been written for students in graduate programs in psychobiology, physiological psychology, and the neurosciences, but it also should be of interest to some medical students and to others with catholic interests in the biology of behavior. In the first chapter, I review the structure of the limbic system and in subsequent chapters consider the behavioral effects of lesions and stimulation of components of the limbic system. Supplement information derived from recording the electrical signals of the brain is included where it seems appropriate. The final chapter presents a perspective of the limbic system related to brain stem mechanisms and the neocortex. Understanding the behavioral contributions of the limbic system presupposes under standing how the limbic system interacts with other systems of the brain. v Preface vi Even though there is only one chapter overtly devoted to theoretical issues. various biases of mine influence all chapters. Anyone reading the book with a critical attitude will soon be aware of them. I would like to alert the reader to some of them ahead of time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=35bbBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garfield and the mysterious mummy (Planet reader chapter books)","description":"When Garfield and Odie accidentally get locked in the museum one night, strange things start happening.

Sixteen months later, having served on the line in one of modern history s ugliest wars, he returned home physically whole but emotionally wasted, his youthful idealism forever gone. A Rumor of War is far more than one soldier s story. Upon its publication in 1977, it shattered America s indifference to the fate of the men sent to fight in the jungles of Vietnam. In the years since then, it has become not only a basic text on the Vietnam War but also a renowned classic in the literature of wars throughout history and, as the author writes, of \\"the things men do in war and the things war does to them.\\" \\"Heartbreaking, terrifying, and enraging.

Moving beyond Mary Ellison's 1972 landmark regional study of Lancashire cotton workers' reactions, R. J. M. Blackett opens the subject to a new, wider transatlantic context of influence and undertakes a deftly researched and written sociological, intellectual, and political examination of who in Britain supported the Union, who the Confederacy, and why. The American Civil War had a profound effect on Britain's political culture; no other event during that period -- not in Poland, Hungary, Italy, or British colonies -- compared. Blackett argues that the traditional historiographical assessments of British partisanship along class and economic lines must be reevaluated in light of the nature and changing contours of transatlantic abolitionist connections, the ways in which nationalism framed the debate, and the effect that race -- among other issues -- exerted over the British public's perception of conditions in America.

Picking up a bad customer can leave the driver in a vulnerable position, and erring even once can prove fatal. To protect themselves, taxi drivers must quickly and accurately assess the trustworthiness of complete strangers. In Streetwise, Diego Gambetta and Heather Hamill take this predicament as a prototypical example of many trust decisions, where people must act on limited information and judge another person's trustworthiness based on signs that may or may not be honest indicators of that person's character or intent. Gambetta and Hamill analyze the behavior of cabbies in two cities where driving a taxi is especially perilous: New York City, where drivers have been the targets of frequent and violent robberies, and Belfast, Northern Ireland, a divided metropolis where drivers have been swept up in the region's sectarian violence. Based on in-depth ethnographic research, Streetwise lets drivers describe in their own words how they seek to determine the threat posed by each potential passenger. The drivers' decisions about whom to trust are treated in conjunction with the \\"sign-management\\" strategies of their prospective passengers both genuine passengers who try to persuade drivers of their trustworthiness and the villains who mimic them. As the theory that guides this research suggests, drivers look for signs that correlate closely with trustworthiness but are difficult for an impostor to mimic. A smile, a business suit, or a skullcap alone do not reassure drivers, as any criminal could easily wear them. Only if attached to other signs a middle-aged woman, a business address, or a synagogue are they persuasive. Drivers are adept at deciphering deceitful signals, but trickery is occasionally undetectable, so they must adopt defensive strategies to minimize their exposure to harm. In Belfast, where drivers are locals and often have histories of paramilitary involvement, \\"macho\\" posturing often serves to deter would-be criminals, while New York cabbies, mostly immigrants who view themselves as outsiders, try simply to minimize the damage from attacks by appeasing robbers and carrying only small amounts of cash. For most people, erring in a trust decision leads to a broken heart or a few dollars lost. For cab drivers, such an error could mean losing their lives. The way drivers negotiate these high stakes offers us vivid insight into how to determine another person's trustworthiness. Written with clarity and color, Streetwise invites the reader to ride shotgun with cabbies as they grapple with a question of relevance to us all: which signs of trustworthiness can we really trust?

During the later years of life, many people devote energy to a process of spiritual awakening and self-discovery. Yet their family, friends, clergy, and the helping professionals who work with them are not always prepared to understand or deal with the spiritual concerns of their clients. Aging and Spirituality provides a unique, far-reaching overview of this long-neglected field. Divided into four independent but interwoven sections, this landmark book covers the spiritual realm with scientific rigor and deep human understanding. Aging and Spirituality comprehensively surveys the issues of spirituality, from the groundwork of basic definitions to detailed assessments of the role spirituality plays in the lives of the elderly and suggested directions for further research. This book's unique approach combines scholarly research and practical nuts-and-bolts suggestions for service delivery. By drawing from many disciplines and professions, it offers fresh perspectives to even those practitioners already familiar with the most effective spiritual techniques their own field can offer. Aging and Spirituality answers such common questions as: What are the spiritual needs of people later in life? Is there any solid evidence that prayer changes things? How is spirituality related to physical and mental health? Does spirituality matter when people know they are dying? How can we measure spiritual wellness and assess the outcomes of activities intended to enhance it? Will attention to spirituality aggravate or alleviate the losses--of friends, family, health, youth--that so often occur during old age? Aging and Spirituality provides a much-needed resource for health care professionals, clergy, social workers, and counselors working with geriatric clients. By integrating spiritual issues into the theoretical framework of social gerontology, Aging and Spirituality will help you understand the scientific foundations, practical applications, and public policy implications of spirituality for older adults.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fFNS4_Ft_NAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serial Communications Developer's Guide - Second Edition","description":"When PCs and peripherals began showing up with USB ports in the late 1990s, many predicted that legacy serial (COM) ports would soon be obsolete. The predictions were wrong. While most standard peripherals now use USB, serial ports are the interface of choice for devices that require simple programming, long cables, operation in harsh environments, or basic networking capabilities. Serial ports are more versatile then ever due to developments such as USB virtual COM ports, the .NET SerialPort class, enhanced microcontroller USARTs, and new wireless interfaces. Serial Port Complete Second Edition is a completely revised and updated guide to programming and interfacing to COM ports, USB virtual COM ports, and serial ports in embedded systems. Author Jan Axelson shows how to:   Access COM ports using the SerialPort class in Microsoft s .NET Framework.   Program embedded systems for serial-port communications.   Design and program USB devices accessed as virtual COM ports.   Upgrade RS-232 designs to USB with no changes to host software or device firmware.   Design circuits for electrically harsh environments.   Create serial networks of embedded systems and PCs.   Use serial ports in wireless links. Example code is provided for PCs and embedded systems in both Basic and C/C#. The author maintains a website with articles, program code, and other links of interest to developers of serial-port applications (janaxelson.com).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dlyfBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recipes for Life: From the Kitchens of Healthy Choice Foods","description":"Best-selling author Dan Buettner debuts his first cookbook, filled with 100 longevity recipes inspired by the Blue Zones locations around the world, where people live the longest.

The journey carries you from the privileged world of Park Avenue to nineteenth-century Lithuania, turn-of-the-century Chicago, a contemporary Israeli kibbutz, and the timeless world of New York City's Lower East Side. Journey's end occurs in the Jewish year 5743 on Manhattan's Upper West Side, just crosstown and a lifetime away from where Paul Cowan's complicated, halting trip toward faith begins. Paul Cowan grows up unaware that he is a descendant of rabbis. In one generation five thousand years of religion and culture have been lost. Like millions of immigrant families, Lou and Polly Cowan pay for the prosperity with their pasts. When they die in a tragic fire, Paul begins a search for that part of his parents that had perished in America. The quest for an ancestral legacy by the American, Paul Cowan, becomes a rite of passage for the Jew who emerges Saul Cohen. Relatives like Jacob Cohen, the used cement bag dealer, and Modie Spiegel, Sr., the mail order magnate, come to life in the author's warm and touching recreation of an odyssey through immigrant America. - Jacket flap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tqygq6wL_KkC&dq=An+Orphan+in+History:+Retrieving+a+Jewish+Legacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning Russian","description":"Whether you're planning a trip to Russia or adding a second language to your resume, this book will help you to: recognize and read Cyrillic letters; pronounce Russian words like a native; ask for directions, order dinner, and conduct business; and hold your own in a conversation.

Her crew were lazily enjoying this respite from the arduous labor of rowing up stream. Three miles below them lay the Marjorie W. herself, quite ready to sail so soon as they should have clambered aboard and swung the long boat to its davits. Presently the attention of every man was drawn from his dreaming or his gossiping to the northern bank of the river. There, screaming at them in a cracked falsetto and with skinny arms outstretched, stood a strange apparition of a man. \\"Wot the 'ell?\\" ejaculated one of the crew. \\"A white man!\\" muttered the mate, and then: \\"Man the oars, boys, and we'll just pull over an' see what he wants.\\" When they came close to the shore they saw an emaciated creature with scant white locks tangled and matted. The thin, bent body was naked but for a loin cloth. Tears were rolling down the sunken pock-marked cheeks. The man jabbered at them in a strange tongue. \\"Rooshun,\\" hazarded the mate. \\"Savvy English?\\" he called to the man. He did, and in that tongue, brokenly and haltingly, as though it had been many years since he had used it, he begged them to take him with them away from this awful country. Once on board the Marjorie W. the stranger told his rescuers a pitiful tale of privation, hardships, and torture, extending over a period of ten years. How he happened to have come to Africa he did not tell them, leaving them to assume he had forgotten the incidents of his life prior to the frightful ordeals that had wrecked him mentally and physically. He did not even tell them his true name, and so they knew him only as Michael Sabrov, nor was there any resemblance between this sorry wreck and the virile, though unprincipled, Alexis Paulvitch of old...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EozCCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lemonade (50 Series)","description":"Shares recipes for traditional scratch lemonades--including strawberry-rhubarb lemonade, tea-monade, and watermelon lemonade--as well as libations containing curacao, peach schnapps, and Southern Comfort.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GPwhv1w3ncC&dq=Lemonade+(50+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muskrat: a Surprise Bid for the America's Cup","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R-FJAAAACAAJ&dq=Muskrat:+a+Surprise+Bid+for+the+America%27s+Cup&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly","description":"Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly by Kathleen Anne Barret released on Jul 25, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XFVuGq5FwzEC&dq=Milwaukee+Summers+Can+Be+Deadly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Henry VI, Part 1 (Arden Shakespeare Third) (Pt. 1)","description":"Shakespeare's rich exploration of kingship, politics and war and of fathers, sons and coming of age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ioeGdWEpP8C&dq=King+Henry+VI,+Part+1+(Arden+Shakespeare+Third)+(Pt.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The descendants of Capt.

The Kokopelli name and image are everywhere, adorning everything from jewelry, welcome mats, T-shirts, and money clips to motels, freeway underpasses, nature trails, nightclubs, and string quartets. Kokopelli evokes mystery and wonder, ancient ceremonies and?spirituality, Mother Earth and the purity of nature. But what exactly is Kokopelli? Just how Native American is this ubiquitous flute player? In this fascinating book, the distinguished scholar of Hopi culture and history Ekkehart Malotki describes the development of the Kokopelli phenomenon in American mass culture from its beginning to Kokopelli?s present status as pan-Southwestern icon. He explores the figure?s connections with the Hopi kachina god Kookop l  and Maahu, the cicada, and discusses how this rock-art image has been appropriated and misunderstood. Kokopelli sheds light on a little-understood aspect of Hopi culture and testifies to the continuing power of Native cultures to spark the popular imagination and interest of outsiders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qqOgjiqa7R4C&dq=Kokopelli:+The+Making+of+an+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paintings from The Frick Collection.","description":"Over 350 paintings by the greatest European artists in one stunning volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TbUzAQAAIAAJ&dq=Paintings+from+The+Frick+Collection.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Millie in the Meadow","description":"As Millie the cow watches, an artist paints pictures of some of the other meadow creatures--and finally a picture of her as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=btsJAAAACAAJ&dq=Millie+in+the+Meadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval warfare","description":"The study of medieval warfare has developed enormously in recent years. The figure of the armoured mounted knight, who was believed to have materialized in Carolingian times, long dominated all discussion of the subject. It is now understood that the knight emerged over a long period of time and that he was never alone on the field of conflict. Infantry, at all times, played a substantial role in conflict, and the notion that they were in some way invented only in the fourteenth century is no longer sustainable. Moreover, modern writers have examined campaigns which for long seemed pointless because they did not lead to spectacular events like battles. As a result, we now understand the pattern of medieval war which often did not depend on battle but on exerting pressure on the opponent by economic warfare. This pattern was intensified by the existence of castles, and careful study has revealed much about their development and the evolving means of attacking them. Crusading warfare pitted westerners against a novel style of war and affords an opportunity to assess the military effectiveness of European methods. New areas of study are now developing. The logistics of medieval armies was always badly neglected, while until very recently there was a silence on the victims of war. Assembled in this volume are 31 papers which represent milestones in the development of the new ideas about medieval warfare, set in context by an introductory essay.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wlsPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After Disclosure: A Non Offending Parent Reflects on Child Sexual Abuse","description":"This book helps professionals to make informed, research-based assessments of risk, offering strategies for supporting and educating families within which sexual abuse has occurred.

She argues that, in the 1920s, the form and content of writings by figures as disparate as W. E. B. Du Bois, T. S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, and Nella Larsen were shaped by anxieties regarding immigration, migration, and intraracial breeding. English's interdisciplinary approach brings together the work of those canonical writers with relatively neglected literary, social scientific, and visual texts. She examines antilynching plays by Angelina Weld Grimke as well as the provocative writings of white female eugenics field workers. English also analyzes the Crisis magazine as a family album filtering uplift through eugenics by means of photographic documentation of an ever-improving black race. English suggests that current scholarship often misreads early-twentieth-century visual, literary, and political culture by applying contemporary social and moral standards to the past. Du Bois, she argues, was actually more of a eugenicist than Eliot. Through such reconfiguration of the modern period, English creates an allegory for the American present: because eugenics was, in its time, widely accepted as a reasonable, progressive ideology, we need to consider the long-term implications of contemporary genetic engineering, fertility enhancement and control, and legislation promoting or discouraging family growth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4oElv1qBPokC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back in Baby's Arms","description":"Still grieving over the death of her beloved husband, Wayne, in a boating accident, Maddie finds her life changed forever when she encounters a mysterious stranger, rescued from a storm at sea, who can remember nothing of his previous life, until the man begins to uncover disturbing clues to his past.

Did you know that eating oatmeal actually isn't a healthy way to start the day? That milk doesn't build bones, and eggs aren't the devil? Even the most health conscious among us have a hard time figuring out what to eat in order to lose weight, stay fit, and improve our health. And who can blame us? When it comes to diet, there's so much changing and conflicting information flying around that it's impossible to know where to look for sound advice. And decades of misguided \\"common sense,\\" food-industry lobbying, bad science, and corrupt food polices and guidelines have only deepened our crisis of nutritional confusion, leaving us overwhelmed and anxious when we head to the grocery store. Thankfully, bestselling author Dr. Mark Hyman is here to set the record straight. In Food: What the Heck Should I Eat? -- his most comprehensive book yet -- he takes a close look at every food group and explains what we've gotten wrong, revealing which foods nurture our health and which pose a threat.

P. Morgan, one of the most powerful and enigmatic financiers in history, from bestselling author Frederick Lewis Allen. Celebrated as a titan of industry by some and decried as a monopolizing robber baron by others, John Pierpont Morgan was without a doubt a dominant player in American finance at the turn of the twentieth century. He founded U.S. Steel, a conglomeration of leading steel and iron producers, which was the nation s largest coast-to-coast railroad system, and the first company to be worth more than $1 billion. Morgan was also instrumental in developing the Federal Reserve after working with political leaders to prevent a potentially devastating fiscal crisis in 1907. Indeed, he was a driving force in the modernization of American business, and the effects of his acumen and foresight continue to resonate today on Wall Street and beyond. Additionally, known for his displays of wealth and power, Morgan was a prominent figure of the New York society scene a member of the original one percent as well as a notable art connoisseur with a sizable collection now housed in Manhattan s lavish Morgan Library & Museum, once his own private library. In this meticulously researched and comprehensive biography, Frederick Lewis Allen, former editor of Harper s magazine and author of Only Yesterday, delves into the life and character of a fascinating, multidimensional man. Allen also probes the evolution of the business landscape during Morgan s lifetime, when giant corporations with unparalleled economies of scale began to absorb and replace smaller competitors.

An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BULLFIGHT","description":"Tsugami, the editor-in-chief of a newspaper in war-scarred Osaka, agrees to sponsor a bullfight.

Nonlinear Pricing sheds much needed light on the principles behind this innovative view of reality and provides clear explanations of how it is employed to predict-at least partially-the unpredictable. Beginning with an incisive introduction to the topic, May presents the roots of nonlinearity through the examples of calendrics, geometry, and music. He then illustrated the application and integration of various nonlinear technologies, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, fractal imaging, and nonlinear dynamics, to such essentials as trading strategies, asset allocation, risk management, and derivative pricing and hedging. Along with practical methodologies and a wealth of real-world examples, this comprehensive resource contains a glossary of terms, a bibliography and in-depth information on: * Fractal analysis-power law distributions, fractional Brownian motion, and their relationships * The Hurst Exponent-the KAOS screen and its practical implementation * Resonance-time domain versus frequency domain, Brownian motion, and the Gaussian distribution * Advanced concepts-Soros's Reflexivity, non-equilibrium economics, kernel of theoretical nonlinear pricing, May's Law, resolution and resonance Written by one of the few practitioners using this breakthrough methodology to trade the markets successfully, Nonlinear Pricing fills an important niche in investment literature.

He thus refutes the view of 'nonpreferentialists,' who interpret the clause as allowing such aid provided that the assistance is not restricted to a preferred church. For this new edition, Levy has added to his original arguments and incorporated much new material, including an analysis of Jefferson's ideas on the relationship between church and state and a discussion of the establishment clause cases brought before the Supreme Court since the book was originally published in 1986.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=drQ0DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films","description":"Edited by major contributors to the field, this text summarizes current or newly emerging pulsed laser deposition application areas.

Authorities such as the Surgeon General of the USA and the Royal College of Physicians in the UK have declared that nicotine is as addictive as heroin and cocaine. This book is a critique of the nicotine addiction hypothesis, based on a critical review of the research literature that purports to prove that nicotine is as addictive drug. The review is based on a re-examination of more than 700 articles and books on this subject, including animal and human experimental studies, effects of \`nicotine replacement therapies', and many other relevant sources. This review concludes that on present evidence, there is every reason to reject the generally accepted theory that nicotine has a major role in cigarette smoking. A critical examination of the criteria for drug addiction demonstrates that none of these criteria is met by nicotine, and that it is much more likely that nicotine in fact limits rather than facilitates smoking.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=za0PBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jungle Book","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HvJaAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaching Poetry: Perspectives and Responses","description":"This wide-ranging introduction to poetry blends theoretical considerations with a thorough introduction to the elements of poetry, offering alternative perspectives from which to approach and engage with a poem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ki_7wAEACAAJ&dq=Approaching+Poetry:+Perspectives+and+Responses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adorno on Music (International Library of Sociology)","description":"Unpacks Adorno's critique of popular culture in an engagingly, looking at the development of theories of authority, commodification and negative dialectics.

Picking up a bad customer can leave the driver in a vulnerable position, and erring even once can prove fatal. To protect themselves, taxi drivers must quickly and accurately assess the trustworthiness of complete strangers. In Streetwise, Diego Gambetta and Heather Hamill take this predicament as a prototypical example of many trust decisions, where people must act on limited information and judge another person's trustworthiness based on signs that may or may not be honest indicators of that person's character or intent. Gambetta and Hamill analyze the behavior of cabbies in two cities where driving a taxi is especially perilous: New York City, where drivers have been the targets of frequent and violent robberies, and Belfast, Northern Ireland, a divided metropolis where drivers have been swept up in the region's sectarian violence. Based on in-depth ethnographic research, Streetwise lets drivers describe in their own words how they seek to determine the threat posed by each potential passenger. The drivers' decisions about whom to trust are treated in conjunction with the \\"sign-management\\" strategies of their prospective passengers both genuine passengers who try to persuade drivers of their trustworthiness and the villains who mimic them. As the theory that guides this research suggests, drivers look for signs that correlate closely with trustworthiness but are difficult for an impostor to mimic. A smile, a business suit, or a skullcap alone do not reassure drivers, as any criminal could easily wear them. Only if attached to other signs a middle-aged woman, a business address, or a synagogue are they persuasive. Drivers are adept at deciphering deceitful signals, but trickery is occasionally undetectable, so they must adopt defensive strategies to minimize their exposure to harm. In Belfast, where drivers are locals and often have histories of paramilitary involvement, \\"macho\\" posturing often serves to deter would-be criminals, while New York cabbies, mostly immigrants who view themselves as outsiders, try simply to minimize the damage from attacks by appeasing robbers and carrying only small amounts of cash. For most people, erring in a trust decision leads to a broken heart or a few dollars lost. For cab drivers, such an error could mean losing their lives. The way drivers negotiate these high stakes offers us vivid insight into how to determine another person's trustworthiness. Written with clarity and color, Streetwise invites the reader to ride shotgun with cabbies as they grapple with a question of relevance to us all: which signs of trustworthiness can we really trust?

He didn't know that the forest-wandering race called the Drevnya drew their powers from sexual magic, nor that suppressing their emotions and sensuality could be fatal for them. But Perian, the Drevnya Adept raised by abusive human parents who tried to destroy her magical heritage, is more than he bargained for. Her dreams of a voice calling her from the darkness of the void lead both of them into danger they never imagined and a future they don't want. In the distant east, a towering evil has escaped imprisonment in the eternal void of the Everdark, and it is their destiny to seek it out and destroy it before it destroys their world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h6BnGQAACAAJ&dq=DREAMS+OF+DARKNESS:+The+Everdark+Wars,+book+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against the American grain","description":"A New York Review Books Original An uncompromising contrarian, a passionate polemicist, a man of quick wit and wide learning, an anarchist, a pacifist, and a virtuoso of the slashing phrase, Dwight Macdonald was an indefatigable and indomitable critic of America s susceptibility to well-meaning cultural fakery: all those estimable, eminent, prizewinning works of art that are said to be good and good for you and are not. He dubbed this phenomenon  Midcult  and he attacked it not only on aesthetic but on political grounds. Midcult rendered people complacent and compliant, secure in their common stupidity but neither happy nor free. This new selection of Macdonald s finest essays, assembled by John Summers, the editor of The Baffler, reintroduces a remarkable American critic and writer. In the era of smart, sexy, and everything indie, Macdonald remains as pertinent and challenging as ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=157G81896fkC&dq=Against+the+American+grain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CPA Review: Financial","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1pspAQAAMAAJ&dq=CPA+Review:+Financial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's bedtime stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Legerdemain: A Facsimile from the 1797 Third Edition of Encyclopedia Britannica","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zd0uAQAAIAAJ&dq=Legerdemain:+A+Facsimile+from+the+1797+Third+Edition+of+Encyclopedia+Britannica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","description":"In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prizewinning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to  seize the trident  by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie  s special and widely hailed literary mastery. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Robert K. Massie's Catherine the Great.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LUSXbXK-Ue8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Idoms and Phrasal Verbs (McGraw-Hill ESL References)","description":"Learn the language of Nebraska . . .and 49 other states With more entries than any other reference of its kind, McGraw-Hill s Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs shows you how American English is spoken today.

Van Middledyk advanced Puerto Rican historiography by building on the works of Brau, Coll y Toste, and Acosta, and by consulting early Spanish chronicles. A librarian at the Free Public Library of San Juan, Van Middledyk possessed knowledge of and access to considerable primary source material. His history is sympathetic to the Indians and highly critical of Spanish colonial administration. Coming in the wake of American military occupation, the book sought to explain and justify control of the island by the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6WsxgRbhlaAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird Talk","description":"A gorgeously illustrated tribute to birds of all kinds and the fantastic, funny, fascinating things that they do.

Written by activists with decades of experience organizing in grassroots anticapitalist struggles against white supremacy, the book established itself as an essential reference point for revolutionary nationalists and dissident currents within the Marxist-Leninist and anarchist movements. Always controversial within the establishment left, Settlers uncovers centuries of collaboration between capitalism and white workers and their organizations, as well as their neocolonial allies, showing how the United States was designed from the ground up as a parasitic and genocidal entity. As recounted in painful detail by J. Sakai, the United States has been built on the theft of Indigenous lands and of Afrikan labor, on the robbery of the northern third of Mexico, the colonization of Puerto Rico, and the expropriation of the Asian working class, with each of these crimes being accompanied by violence.

In The Little Book that Beats the Market a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone  knows  it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market. As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition,  Mr. Greenblatt says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His  Little Book  is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.

It is both the classic inner-city hospital and a unique amalgam of history, insanity, beauty, and intellect. When Danielle Ofri enters these 250-year-old doors as a tentative medical student, she is immediately plunged into the teeming world of urban medicine: mysterious illnesses, life-and-death decisions, patients speaking any one of a dozen languages, and overworked interns devising creative strategies to cope with the feverish intensity of a big-city hospital. Yet the emphasis of Singular Intimacies is not so much on the arduous hours in medical training (which certainly exist here), but on the evolution of an instinct for healing. In a hospital without the luxury of private physicians, where patients lack resources both financial and societal, where poverty and social strife are as much a part of the pathology as any microbe, it is the medical students and interns who are thrust into the searing intimacy that is the doctor-patient relationship. In each memorable chapter, Ofri s progress toward becoming an experienced healer introduces not just a patient in medical crisis, but a human being with an intricate and compelling history. Ofri learns to navigate the tangled vulnerabilities of doctor and patient not to simply battle the disease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c_YQD9aGK3UC&dq=Singular+Intimacies:+Becoming+a+Doctor+at+Bellevue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Enemy, My Self","description":"A respected Israeli journalist, fluent in Arabic and often mistaken as a compatriot by Palestinians, decides to experience Arab life in Israel firsthand by posing as a Palestinian","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-HOFAAAAIAAJ&dq=My+Enemy,+My+Self&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blue Spaders at the Battle of Ap Gu, 31 March-1 April 1967","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Si22AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Blue+Spaders+at+the+Battle+of+Ap+Gu,+31+March-1+April+1967&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God sent a man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Smart But Feeling Dumb","description":"Provides case histories to illustrate the clinical psychiatrist's account of new breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of the learning disorder, dyslexia, and offers advice for family, teachers, and doctors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7R5DYgEACAAJ&dq=Smart+But+Feeling+Dumb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analytic Number Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Vol. 177)","description":"Some of the central topics in number theory, presnted in a simple and concise fashion.

During that brief time, while working for the Farm Security Administration (previously the U.S. Resettlement Administration) photographing the consequences of the Great Depression, he refined a hybrid style that combined documentation with sly personal comment. He delighted in traveling incognito as an artless photojournalist, but with the independence to satisfy his own artistic designs. Walker Evans: Lyric Documentarypresents these seminal images for the first time as a comprehensive, cohesive body of work, in chronological order. These are prime examples of Evans's alchemy, his seemingly effortless transformation of mundane fact into sweeping lyricism. They not only define his mature style, but also offer a path for artists of future generations. Evans has been called the most important American artist of his century, and the impact of his vision reaches well beyond the province of photography. With texts by John T.

Jones, Cleveland Ballet Dancing Wheels, Zab Maboungou, David Dorfman, Marie Chouinard, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, and others, have helped establish dance as a crucial discourse of the 90s. These dancers, Ann Cooper Albright argues, are asking the audience to see the body as a source of cultural identity   a physical presence that moves with and through its gendered, racial, and social meanings. Through her articulate and nuanced analysis of contemporary choreography, Albright shows how the dancing body shifts conventions of representation and provides a critical example of the dialectical relationship between cultures and the bodies that inhabit them. As a dancer, feminist, and philosopher, Albright turns to the material experience of bodies, not just the body as a figure or metaphor, to understand how cultural representation becomes embedded in the body. In arguing for the intelligence of bodies, Choreographing Difference is itself a testimonial, giving voice to some important political, moral, and artistic questions of our time.

Production figures cannot be confirmed but it is thought that around 440,000 were built between 1971 and 1985. As this was a bad time for British Leyland most of the profits went into the car division and few changes were made. Even when Land Rover became a separate operating division in 1978 it took until 1983 for a replacement to be produced. Not every market took to the new vehicles so the Series III remained in low volume production until 1985. This is a book of contemporary road and comparison tests, specifications and technical data, off-road reports, long terms tests, driver's reports, plus advice on buying a used example. Types covered include: 4 & 6-cylinder, 2.6 station wagon, SWB, V8, LWB, Diesel, Pick-up, 3/4 ton, 3S Station Wagon, 3-9D, County.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jr8IPQAACAAJ&dq=Land+Rover+Series+III:+4x4+Performance+Portfolio+1971-1985&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter Panini's Children's Guide to the Hawaiian Islands","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1r67ZwEACAAJ&dq=Peter+Panini%27s+Children%27s+Guide+to+the+Hawaiian+Islands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","description":"Gathers photographs of people living in the United States and Europe, as well as victims of political unrest in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Far East","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S6NnQgAACAAJ&dq=In+Times+of+War+and+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver Cities: Photographing American Urbanization, 1839-1939","description":"Readers new to the book will find a richly illustrated cultural history of American photography, with familiar names and newly discovered figures.

A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trade, Plunder and Settlement Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480-1630","description":"Traces the maritime expansion of England through descriptions of a multitude of sea voyages from 1480 through 1630.

For her it has been a second home. A one-time resident who returns there, this native-born Mississippian has found Italy to be an enchanting land whose culture lends itself powerfully to her artistic vision. Some of her most acclaimed work is set there. Her American characters encounter but never quite wholly adjust to the mysteries of the Italian mores. Collected here in one volume are Spencer's six Italian tales. Their plots are so alluring and enigmatic that Boccaccio would have been charmed by their delightful ironies and their sinister contrasts of dark and light. Spencer is grounded in two bases Italy and the American South. Her characters too, mostly southerners, rove in search of connection and fulfillment. In The Light in the Piazza (a novella which has become both Spencer's signature piece and a Hollywood film) a stranger from North Carolina, traveling with her beautiful daughter, encounters the intoxicating beauty of sunlit Florence and discovers a deep conflict in the moral dilemma it presents.  I think this work has great charm,  Spencer has said,  and it probably is the real thing, a work written under great compulsion, while I was under the spell of Italy. But it took me, all told, about a month to write.  In Knights and Dragons (another novella and a companion piece to The Light in the Piazza) an American woman in Rome and Venice struggles for release from her husband's sinister control over her. Spencer sets this tale in the cold and wintry dark and here portrays the other face of Italy. In  The Cousins,   The Pincian Gate,   The White Azalea,  and  The Visit,  Spencer shows the exceptional artistry that has merited acclaim for her as one of America's first-class writers of the short story. The Light in the Piazza may long be the work for which she is most recognized. In 2005, the Lincoln Center s Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City staged a musical adaptation of this novella. The production brought together the talents of Adam Guettel (music and lyrics) and Craig Lucas (book), while director Bartlett Sher made his Lincoln Center debut. That year the musical won six of the eleven Tony awards it was nominated for. It was thereafter produced on stages across the globe and eventually returned to Lincoln Center in 2016 for a reunion of its original cast as a benefit concert.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rtjKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creepshows (Illustrated Movie Guide)","description":"Pays tribute to film and television adaptations of Stephen King's novels, including \\"Carrie,\\" \\"Misery,\\" \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" and \\"The Green Mile,\\" with commentary from behind-the-scenes figures and from King himself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gD7qwAEACAAJ&dq=Creepshows+(Illustrated+Movie+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Being rude (A children's book about)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GcZKswEACAAJ&dq=Being+rude+(A+children%27s+book+about)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reptile Diseases","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A.D.D. the Natural Approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G0lJtAEACAAJ&dq=A.D.D.+the+Natural+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","description":"The ultimate CCNA prep resource, practice exams, expert coverage, and more The CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Certification Kit, 2nd Edition contains the CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Deluxe Study Guide, 2nd Edition and the CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Review Guide, 2nd Edition covering the revised version 3.0 ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA Composite exams, 100-105, 200-105, and 200-125.

Automotive Cheap Tricks & Special F/X II is a compilation of step-by-step instruction by Craig Fraser, one of the greatest forces behind the popularization of automotive custom painting. In fact, Special F/X II far exceeds its predecessor, F/X I, in superior design, nearly double the content (31 chapters, including 11 introductory sub-chapters and a comprehensive glossary), and size (212 pages). The subtitle, Learn How to Paint Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles, Musical Instruments, Surfboards, and R.C. Cars, really says it all, and lives up to its promise with some of the most cutting-edge work dissected for your reference and execution. This amazing visual smorgasbord tutors on how to achieve stunning graphics, special effects, murals, pinstriping, and more for beginners and pros. It s especially fascinating how perceptually difficult effects (bullet holes, fire, water droplets, old school flames, and tons more) and textures (alligator and dragon skin, chrome, cheetah fur, faux f/x, and many others) are so easily rendered with stencils, freehand shields, a variety of tapes, vinyl, and even a torch! It almost seems as if the author gave away too much, like a magician who would surprisingly reveal his secrets with impunity. Fraser was thoughtful enough to include enough editorial and instruction for newbies that includes a Back to Da  Basics chapter, and some great articles on self-promotion, the zen of custom painting, how to photograph your artwork (the importance of this cannot be overstated), the paint and equipment you ll need to get started, and the business of custom painting. In great, painstaking detail throughout, the book also addresses critically essential information on the proper sequences and steps to working with urethanes and clearcoats, among other things. The fact that improper methods can lead to catastrophic results on, say, a $100,000 vehicle makes this book even more important. Chapters include: Flamin  Out A Killer Skull (skull and flames on a motorcycle tank), Steampunk Guitar (mind-blowing; gorgeous), Formula Drift (classic graphics with stunning results), Dragon Drums, Da Kine Surf-Tiki (Craig proves that you, too, can paint a bitchin  surfboard), Rice Fink (sure to be a big favorite), RC Car (you better read this before you attempt one), Donkey Frog, and Homage A Giger (H.R., that is). Automotive Cheap Tricks & Special F/X II is beautifully printed in full color and on heavy paper stock, and it s obvious that the publisher spared no expense in producing it. At $34.95 this volume is a steal. And it is, without question, the new gold standard for books on automotive custom painting and will remain so for years to come.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z2W8BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Uncover Your Past Lives (Llwellyn's How to Series)","description":"Have you ever experienced a feeling of d j  vu . . . or had recurring dreams of a particular place or time . . . or felt instantly close to some person?

He is best remembered as the prime editor and creator of the two Books of Common Prayer of 1549 and 1552, and these indeed stand at the head of Anglican liturgical identity and tradition. Their influence and importance cannot be overstated. This book seeks to offer a survey of his growth and development as theologian and leader of the church through the lens of his written work: not only liturgy, but also homilies, correspondence and official doctrinal statements. This volume introduces Cranmer as a churchman, theologian and liturgist whose original contribution to Anglican spirituality in its earliest, formative moments cannot be underestimated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=92mmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Deryni","description":"Charissa, a full-blooded Deryni trained in the disciplines of sorcery and necromancy, threatens the rulership of Kelson and the life of his chief advisor Morgan, in a special revised edition of the classic fantasy novel, which includes a special introduction by the author.

She is the doctor for and spiritual guardian of a band of hunters who live at the edge of a great Wall of ice in what was once Colorado. In the country of the Trappers, books are hand-copied so that knowledge may be preserved, but the technology described in their precious pages is mostly lost to their fur-clad readers, despite Catania's attempts at scientific treatment and the Trappers' careful husbanding of ancient metal tools. As a resurgent population moves west and north from the more settled places that had once been the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States, they drive tribesmen-Cree, Arapaho, and more-before them. On the run and desperate to find new homes, the tribes slaughter entire populations to claim their lands. The Trappers are innocent of this until Jack Monroe, banished years before for murdering a fellow Trapper, arrives, urging them to flee their ancestral home, the Trappers do not listen until nearly too late, until the first enemy arrows have found their marks. The southern flight of the surviving Trappers is a journey through time as well as space. From a frozen northland where summer lasts two chilly weeks through a burgeoning forest where the Trappers taste their first beef to a gulf coast where warm breezes carry exotic scents and sounds; from a primitive life of hunting and trapping to the luxurious Gardens, where people can still weave and make paper, to a bustling trade mart where man-beasts created by unnatural science tread the dirt streets, Catania is shocked to recognize that the proud Trappers have spent generations clinging to civilization with their fingernails. The journey into the warm lands will change Doctor Catania Olsen, mind, heart, and soul. She will gain and lose a love, see great wisdom and greater folly, witness amazing miracles and terrifying science, and, most surprising to herself, become a mother. Finally, she will have to choose between her people and her freedom.

Its impact on the thought, worship, and actions of Catholics worldwide was enormous. Benefiting from a half century of insights gained since Vatican II ended, this volume focuses squarely on the ongoing aftermath and reinterpretation of the Council in the twenty-first century. In five penetrating essays, contributors examine crucial issues at the heart of Catholic life and identity, primarily but not exclusively within North American contexts. On a broader level, the volume as a whole illuminates the effects of the radical changes made at Vatican II on the lived religion of everyday Catholics. As framed by volume editors Lucas Van Rompay, Sam Miglarese, and David Morgan, the book's long view of the church's gradual and often contentious transition into contemporary times profiles a church and laity who seem committed to many mutual values but feel that implementation of the changes agreed to in principle at the Council is far from accomplished. The election in 2013 of the charismatic Pope Francis has added yet another dimension to the search for the meaning of Vatican II. The contributors are Catherine E. Clifford, Hillary Kaell, Leo D. Lefebure, Jill Peterfeso, and Leslie Woodcock Tentler.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j2C0CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brotherhood","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker must stem the tide of the raging Clone Wars and forge a new bond as Jedi Knights in a high-stakes adventure set just after the events of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The Clone Wars have begun. Battle lines are being drawn throughout the galaxy. With every world that joins the Separatists, the peace guarded by the Jedi Order is slipping through their fingers. After an explosion devastates Cato Neimoidia, the jewel of the Trade Federation, the Republic is blamed and the fragile neutrality of the planet is threatened. The Jedi dispatch Obi-Wan Kenobi, one of the Order s most gifted diplomatic minds, to investigate the crime and maintain the balance that has begun to dangerously shift. As Obi-Wan investigates with the help of a heroic Neimoidian guard, he finds himself working against the Separatists who hope to draw the planet into their conspiracy and senses the sinister hand of Asajj Ventress in the mists that cloak the planet. Amid the brewing chaos, Anakin Skywalker rises to the rank of Jedi Knight. Despite the mandate that Obi-Wan travel alone and his former master s insistence that he listen this time Anakin s headstrong determination means nothing can stop him from crashing the party, and bringing along a promising but conflicted youngling. Once a Padawan to Obi-Wan, Anakin now finds himself on equal but uncertain footing with the man who raised him. The lingering friction between them increases the danger for everyone around them. The two knights must learn a new way to work together and they must learn quickly, to save Cato Neimoidia and its people from the fires of war. To overcome the threat they face they must grow beyond master and apprentice. They must stand together as brothers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MDY_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Bible: Spirit Filled Life Bible for Students, New King James Version (Bible Nkjv)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aquarium Fish Breeding (Pet reference books)","description":"Describes the fundamentals of fish breeding for the hobbyist","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YwtJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Aquarium+Fish+Breeding+(Pet+reference+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil War Medicine: An Illustrated History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I1JqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Civil+War+Medicine:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Their Correct Use (Reference)","description":"A guide to correct forms of address in speech and correspondence.

It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter s teachings his Bible is their  book of strange new things.  But Peter is rattled when Bea s letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea s faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5HOBAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truth","description":"This priceless and inexhaustible resource is the ultimate synthesis of \\"science, philosophy and truth, \\" of \\"reason, wisdom and faith, \\" and of \\"past, present and future.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LialKe6xZpgC&dq=Truth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composition: Models and Exercises 7","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9HF5PgAACAAJ&dq=Composition:+Models+and+Exercises+7&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman","description":"Perpetua's Passion studies the third-century martyrdom of a young woman and places it in the intellectual and social context of her age.

It is structured in three sections: design and function, which considers how bishops  palaces and houses differed from the palaces and houses of secular magnates, in their layout, design, furnishings, and functions; landscape and urban context, which considers the relationship between bishops  palaces and houses and their political and cultural context, the landscapes and towns or cities in which they were set, and the parks, forests, and towns that were planned and designed around them; and architectural form, which considers the extent of shared features between bishops  palaces and houses, and their relationship to the houses of other Church potentates and to the houses of secular magnates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sf8nDwAAQBAJ&dq=Counties+of+England+Past+and+Present+Hb+(Counties+of+England+Past/Prese)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooper's Wife (Harlequin Historical Series #485)","description":"Cooper's Wife by Jillian Hart released on Sep 24, 1999 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BSqv8--c5HwC&dq=Cooper%27s+Wife+(Harlequin+Historical+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Syntagma of the evidences of the Christian religion: Being a vindication of the manifesto of the Christian Evidence Society, against the assaults of the Christian Instruction Society","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vuIUPn2nT88C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","description":"Details America's shift from industrial production to providing services and information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VF5nAAAAIAAJ&dq=Megatrends+-+Ten+New+Directions+Transforming+Our+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The African Mask","description":"Twelve-year-old Layo, a Yoruba girl living in the area of eleventh-century Africa which is now Nigeria, attempts to reject the man who has been chosen to be her husband.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9yPUK4kz36sC&dq=The+African+Mask&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Swallow's Nest: A Feminine Reading of the Psalms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7noX69-XiQMC&dq=The+Swallow%27s+Nest:+A+Feminine+Reading+of+the+Psalms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","description":"This is perhaps the most complete, detailed and readable story of manned space-flight ever published.

In the last thirty years, however, revision has become an art form of its own, with tales intentionally revised to achieve humorous effect, send political messages, add different cultural or regional elements, try out new narrative voices, and more. These revisions take all forms, from short stories to novel-length narratives to poems, plays, musicals, films and advertisements. The resulting tales paint the tales from myriad perspectives, using the broad palette of human creativity. This study examines folktale revisions from many angles, drawing on examples primarily from revisions of Western European traditional tales, such as those of the Grimm Brothers and Charles Perrault. Also discussed are new folktales that combine traditional storylines with commentary on modern life. The conclusion considers how revisionists poke fun at and struggle to understand stories that sometimes made little sense to start with.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ntjPM0SqsKwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","description":"The author recalls his long career as a U.S. Senator, sharing his thoughts on the role of a public servant, the importance of having convictions, the appropriate role of faith in public service, and accepting responsibility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c5V3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Square+Peg:+Confessions+of+a+Citizen-Senator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truck Stop (Author and Artist Series)","description":"In his fresh, insightful essay, Bryan Di Salvatore describes the trucker's view of the world: \\"You step into a car; you scale a truck.

The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about. The Little Schemer introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas. The Seasoned Schemer informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases. The Little LISPer has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese. The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bLT4DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Little+Schemer+-+4th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SPORTING LIFE: THE JOURNALS","description":"In his 40-year career, Iooss has covered major sporting events and taken countless portraits of top personalities.

It is organized more like a teaching aid than a reference manual in that to learn basic administration techniques, you are challenged to work through a set of guided tasks rather than to read through descriptions. There is a list of additional reading material in Appendix B that you can reference if you wish to delve deeper into any of the topics covered in this book. This book is intended for beginners in the world of Oracle database administration. It will take you through a set of tasks, starting with creating a database to using some of the Oracle database tuning, and backup and recovery utilities. Those experienced with Oracle databases will recognize that a workbook covering the topic of database administration will be an extremely useful introduction for the beginner, but it cannot be used as a deep study of the Oracle database environment. After working through this book, you will have been launched into the exciting and interesting (sometimes nerve-racking) world of database administration, but it will take years of experience to become a senior database administrator. Who this book is for This book is intended for anyone who needs a quick and detailed introduction to Oracle database administration tasks. It is not the intention of this book to provide an in-depth study of the Oracle database server. The foundation for this book was developed to supplement the Introduction to Oracle Database Administration class in the Database Track at Columbia University's Computer Technology and Applications (CTA) program in New York City. The book's sidebars and answers often reflect questions that students have asked in class. The student body entering the CTA program range from those who have years of experience in the IT field but no experience with Oracle, to those with absolutely no experience in IT and even no experience with PCs. The Introduction to Oracle Database Administration class is offered as an elective in the fourth and final term of the CTA program's curriculum. So, while it is geared for beginners with little or no previous experience with Oracle database administration, it is expected that the reader will have some experience working with an Oracle database. The reader should be comfortable with relational database concepts as well as SQL. If you are unfamiliar with any of these subjects, refer to theOracle SQL Interactive Workbookin the Prentice Hall Oracle Interactive Workbook series. What you'll need There are software as well as knowledge requirements necessary to complete the exercise sections of the workbook. Software Oracle 7.3.4, 8.0, or 8i. Access to the WWW. Note that prior to beginning the workbook labs, you should already have installed the Oracle Server software (it will make it easier to get through the labs if you do not install the default database, however) and the Net8 or SQL*Net components. Since the instructions vary greatly depending on the platform, you should consult your Oracle documentation (Installation Guide and Getting Started) for installation information. Oracle 7.3.4, 8.0, or 8i You can use either Oracle Standard Edition or Oracle Enterprise Edition. Since you will be performing actions that may affect other databases, you should not work through the tasks in this book in an environment where there are critical data, programs, etc.! Since Oracle frequently improves and changes its products, new versions are released all the time. However, the concepts covered in this book are fundamental to the Oracle RDBMS (hereafter called the Oracle Server) and are unlikely to change significantly in the near future. Even if your version of the database is slightly different than the one listed here, you should still be able to make use of this book. The tasks and descriptions represent core issues of Oracle Server architecture and are therefore universal to all three versions of the Oracle Server. There are occasional notes to point out a specific issue regarding a specific version. Additionally, you should be familiar with SQL*Plus, the tool supplied with the database to interact with it in a command-line fashion. Access to the WWW You will need access to the Internet and the WWW so that you can access the companion Web site for this book through-- http://www.phptr.com/scherer Here you will find the files that are necessary for completing the exercises. Knowledge To complete the exercises, you should be familiar with relational database concepts and understand what an Entity Relationship Diagram is. You should also be comfortable using SQL to access and manipulate database objects such as tables, constraints, sequences, and so on. If you are not familiar or comfortable with these subjects, then it is recommended that you refer to the Oracle SQL Interactive Workbook in the Prentice Hall Oracle Interactive Workbook series. You should also feel comfortable working in your operating system's command-line environment. How this Book Is Organized The intent of this workbook is to teach you about Oracle database administration by presenting you with a series of tasks and challenges, followed by detailed solutions to those challenges. At times, an individual task acts as a complete unit of work, while other tasks are developed through a series of simple actions. Each chapter has a series of labs that introduce topics. The labs are composed of tasks, which are typical to the daily work of a database administrator. Beyond the labs, topics are further explored through questions and answers. What follows is the common layout of the chapters: Chapter Objectives A list of subjects the chapter will cover. Chapter Text An overview of chapter subjects. Lab Objectives A list of subjects the lab will cover. Lab Text An introduction to the lab subject, occasionally including steps that prepare the Oracle Server for the exercises. Exercises Questions that require hands-on interaction with the Oracle Server. The exercises will guide you through learning the subject introduced in the lab text. Exercise Answers Answers and discussion of the exercise subject. Self-Review Questions Multiple-choice questions to review lab material. Test Your Thinking Project questions to supplement the lab material. Depending on the breadth of the subject, a given chapter may have more than one lab, and a given lab may have more than one set of exercises. The exercises are not meant to be closed-book quizzes to test your knowledge. On the contrary, they are intended to act as your guide and walk you through a task. You are encouraged to flip back and forth from the question section to the answer section so that, if need be, you can read the discussions as you go along. The chapters and their exercises must be completed in sequence as the material in later chapters builds on what is presented earlier. Chapter 1, \\"The Database Administrator's Job,\\" introduces you to the world of database administration. Chapter 2, \\"Creating Your Database,\\" walks you through the steps of manually creating your own database. Chapter 3, \\"Oracle Networking: Configuring Basic Net8/SQL*Net Components,\\" guides you through setting up the components necessary for remote users to connect to your database over a network. Chapter 4, \\"Tablespaces,\\" teaches you how to create and manipulate tablespaces, and introduces you to logical storage constructs. Chapter 5, \\"Segments and Extents,\\" provides a more in-depth look at these higher level logical storage constructs, which were introduced in Chapter 4. Chapter 6, \\"Data Blocks,\\" examines data blocks, the smallest unit of Oracle storage. Chapter 7, \\"Redo Logs,\\" teaches you the basics of how redo logs operate and how they are written to. Chapter 8, \\"Datafiles,\\" describes how to view information about and manipulate datafiles. Chapter 9, \\"User Creation,\\" teaches you how to create and alter user accounts. Chapter 10, \\"Privilege and Resource Groups,\\" introduces you to the concepts and effects of privileges, roles, and resource limits and shows you how to assign them to user accounts. Chapter 11, \\"Auditing,\\" examines Oracle's mechanism for recording different types of database activity for purposes of maintaining database security and/or keeping records of billable activity. Chapter 12, \\"Rollback Segments,\\" presents a study of the use and operation of rollback segments and how they provide an Oracle database with read-consistency and \\"undo\\" information. Chapter 13, \\"Locking,\\" guides you through exercises that demonstrate the importance of Oracle locking mechanisms and introduces you to the concepts of data \\"consistency\\" and \\"concurrency.\\" Chapter 14, \\"Logical Backup and Recovery,\\" covers logical data backups and recoveries using the Oracle-provided import (IMP) and export (EXP) utilities. Chapter 15, \\"Physical Backup and Recovery,\\" teaches you about different types of database failures, walks you through a simulation of a physical database failure and recovery, and explains the importance of archiving your redo log files. Chapter 16, \\"Application and SQL Optimization,\\" provides a look at optimizing standalone and application SQL code through Oracle-provided facilities such as AUTOTRACE, SQLTRACE, and TKPROF. Chapter 17, \\"Database Tuning and Optimization,\\" presents an introductory look at the other side of tuning an Oracle database by showing you how to gather information about and, if necessary, tune your memory and disk I/O through the use of the Oracle-provided utilities, UTLBTAT.SQL and UTLESTAT.SQL. About the companion web site The companion Web site is located at http://www.phptr.com/scherer Here you will find two very important items: Files you will download for specific tasks in the workbook. Answers to the Test Your Thinking questions. Also, check the Web site for periodically updated information about the book. IMPORTANT notes about COMPLETING THE exercises Complete the chapters and exercises in the order they're given. If the labs, exercises, and steps are not done in their proper sequence, you may have to start from the first chapter and work your way back into the material. This is similar to performing these tasks in a real-world environment. Database administration is less forgiving than application coding. In database administration, you cannot simply recompile your code and try the application again. If you leave out a step, you may lose a portion of the database in a way that is unrecoverable--losing your work. The only exception to this is Chapter 3, \\"Oracle Networking: Configuring Basic Net8/SQL*Net Components,\\" which can be completed after all of the other chapters. In Chapter 2, you will learn about the command SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE. After successfully completing Chapter 2, you should, from then on perform a SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE on your database before rebooting or shutting down your computer. For Chapters 2, 3, 13, 15, and 17, you should allocate enough time to finish from beginning to end. It can take from 45 minutes to a couple of hours to complete the exercises in each chapter. The other chapters will flow better if you complete them in one sitting, but it is not as critical to your database if you are unable to do so. Check off the steps as you complete them. The most frequent error students make in the CTA course is not following each step, no matter how insignificant it seems. Learn to walk before you run. If you think there's a better way to accomplish an activity, don't try it out until you've completed the entire Oracle DBA Interactive Workbook. Some of the steps are in the text and some are explicitly in the exercises. If you check off each step as you go along, you will be more inclined to perform each task, and will have a way to trace whether you've missed a step if you run into trouble. The questions require you to think like an Oracle DBA. For example, you may be asked to look into an Oracle-provided script and report what you think it will do based on the information in the script. In another example, you may perform an exercise to make the database freeze. You're then asked to figure out what the problem is and what the next step should be to fix the problem, based on the knowledge that you've gained by that point in the book. Of course, the solution is given to you, but do your best to consider the problem before reading the provided answer. In either case, make your solution to the problem fall within the scope of the problem set in the chapter. This will be good practice for your work as a DBA, when you will be required to stay focused under pressure. For those completing the tasks in Windows, you should have administrative rights to the machine where the database is located.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EzcGAAAACAAJ&dq=Oracle+DBA+Interactive+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suitable for Framing","description":"A Miami crime reporter contends with a brutal murder and a backstabbing colleague in this  entertaining  mystery from the Edgar Awardnominated author (Booklist).

Written in two versions, male and female (both available in Vintage International), which are identical save for seventeen crucial lines, Dictionary is the imaginary book of knowledge of the Khazars, a people who flourished somewhere beyond Transylvania between the seventh and ninth centuries. Eschewing conventional narrative and plot, this lexicon novel combines the dictionaries of the world's three major religions with entries that leap between past and future, featuring three unruly wise men, a book printed in poison ink, suicide by mirrors, a chimerical princess, a sect of priests who can infiltrate one's dreams, romances between the living and the dead, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R7RDDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+the+Khazars:+A+Lexicon+Novel+in+100,000+Words+(English+and+Serbo-Croatian+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethics & the Early Childhood Educator: Using the Naeyc Code","description":"What is ethics? Where does it come from? Can we really hope to find any rational way of deciding how we ought to live? If we can, what would it be like, and how are we going to know when we have found it? To capture the essentials of what we know about the origins and nature of ethics, Peter Singer has drawn on anthropology, evolution, game theory, and works of fiction, in addition to the classic moral philosophy of such thinkers as Nietzsche, Kant, and Confucius. By choosing some of the finest pieces of writing, old and new, in and about ethics, he conveys the intellectual excitement of the search for answers to basic questions about how we ought to live. From the debates of Socrates and the profound writing of Rousseau to Jane Goodall's reflections on the ethics of chimpanzee kinship and Luther's commentary on the Sixth Commandment (thou shalt not kill), this engaging reader offers a complete and thorough introduction to the fascinating world of ethical debate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UglxQgAACAAJ&dq=Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Superheroes, Milestone Comics, and Their Fans (Studies in Popular Culture)","description":"What do the comic book figures Static, Hardware, and Icon all have in common? Black Superheroes, Milestone Comics, and Their Fans gives an answer that goes far beyond  tights and capes,  an answer that lies within the mission Milestone Media, Inc., assumed in comic book culture. Milestone was the brainchild of four young black creators who wanted to part from the mainstream and do their stories their own way. This history of Milestone, a  creator-owned  publishing company, tells how success came to these mavericks in the 1990s and how comics culture was expanded and enriched as fans were captivated by this new genre. Milestone focused on the African American heroes in a town called Dakota. Quite soon these black action comics took a firm position in the controversies of race, gender, and corporate identity in contemporary America. Characters battled supervillains and sometimes even clashed with more widely known superheroes. Front covers of Milestone comics often bore confrontational slogans like  Hardware: A Cog in the Corporate Machine is About to Strip Some Gears.  Milestone's creators aimed for exceptional stories that addressed racial issues without alienating readers. Some competitors, however, accused their comics of not being black enough or of merely marketing Superman in black face. Some felt that the stories were too black, but a large cluster of readers applauded these new superheroes for fostering African American pride and identity. Milestone came to represent an alternative model of black heroism and, for a host of admirers, the ideal of masculinity. Black Superheroes, Milestone Comics, and Their Fans gives details about the founding of Milestone and reports on the secure niche its work and its image achieved in the marketplace. Tracing the company's history and discussing its creators, their works, and the fans, this book gauges Milestone alongside other black comic book publishers, mainstream publishers, and the history of costumed characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z75PoTDIXHkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Receipts from the Charleston Junior League: Hors D'Oeuvres, Savories, Sweets","description":"The third Charleston Junior League cookbook reveals more secrets of the city's legendary hospitality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fH5b1D2AIV4C&dq=Party+Receipts+from+the+Charleston+Junior+League:+Hors+D%27Oeuvres,+Savories,+Sweets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward, Hoppy, and Joe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jRJsNAAACAAJ&dq=Edward,+Hoppy,+and+Joe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Africa Speaks","description":"In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, pianist Randy Weston and bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik celebrated with song the revolutions spreading across Africa. In Ghana and South Africa, drummer Guy Warren and vocalist Sathima Bea Benjamin fused local musical forms with the dizzying innovations of modern jazz. These four were among hundreds of musicians in the 1950s and '60s who forged connections between jazz and Africa that definitively reshaped both their music and the world.Each artist identified in particular ways with Africa's struggle for liberation and made music dedicated to, or inspired by, demands for independence and self-determination. That music was the wild, boundary-breaking exultation of modern jazz. The result was an abundance of conversation, collaboration, and tension between African and African American musicians during the era of decolonization. This collective biography demonstrates how modern Africa reshaped jazz, how modern jazz helped form a new African identity, and how musical convergences and crossings altered politics and culture on both continents.In a crucial moment when freedom electrified the African diaspora, these black artists sought one another out to create new modes of expression. Documenting individuals and places, from Lagos to Chicago, from New York to Cape Town, Robin Kelley gives us a meditation on modernity: we see innovation not as an imposition from the West but rather as indigenous, multilingual, and messy, the result of innumerable exchanges across a breadth of cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gduqiA16Ng8C&dq=Africa+Speaks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To understand the Bible look for Jesus : the Bible student's guide to the Bible's central theme","description":"Believing the fundamental Christian claim that the purpose of the Bible is to present the Savior, Geisler focuses on Christ as the unity and unfolding message of the whole of Scripture. Christ is the tie between the Testaments, the content of the canon, and the unifying theme within each book of the Bible. This book is basic to both Bible study and preaching and serves as an excellent guide to the Bible's central theme. It encompasses far more than a study of types and the Old Testament prophecies. Each chapter takes seriously the affirmation of Jesus:  Everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled  (Luke 24:44). Related to Geisler's central thrust - that Christ is the clue to the whole Bible - is the clear assertion concerning the inspiration of Scripture and the deity of Christ. Chapter topics include: (1) Christ Is the Key to the Bible; (2) Christ in the Old Testament; (3) Christ in Both Testaments; (4) Christ in Every Section of the Bible; (5) Christ in Each Book of the Bible; (6) The Word of God; Personal and Propositional.

A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Whack On the Side of the Head","description":"This is the 25th anniversary edition of the creativity classic by Dr. Roger von Oech.

After 9/11, the United States made one of the most secretive and dangerous deals in its history the evidence against the powerful Saudis who coordinated the attack would be buried and in return, King Faisal would promise to keep the oil flowing and deal with the conspirators in his midst. But when the king s own nephew is discovered funding ISIS, the furious President gives Rapp his next mission: he must find out more about the high-level Saudis involved in the scheme and kill them. The catch? Rapp will get no support from the United States. Forced to make a decision that will change his life forever, Rapp quits the CIA and assembles a group of independent contractors to help him complete the mission. They ve barely begun unraveling the connections between the Saudi government and ISIS when the brilliant new head of the intelligence directorate discovers their efforts. With Rapp getting too close, he threatens to go public with the details of the post-9/11 agreement between the two countries. Facing an international incident that could end his political career, the President orders America s intelligence agencies to join the Saudis  effort to hunt the former CIA man down. Rapp, supported only by a team of mercenaries with dubious allegiances, finds himself at the center of the most elaborate manhunt in history.

Chapter I contains some special results regarding characteristic roots and vectors, and partitioned submatrices of real and complex matrices, as well as some special theorems on real and complex matrices useful in multivariate analysis. Chapter II deals with the theory of groups and related results that are useful for the development of invariant statistical test procedures, including the Jacobians of some specific transformations that are useful for deriving multivariate sampling distributions. Chapter III is devoted to basic notions of multivariate distributions and the principle of invariance in statistical testing of hypotheses. Chapters IV and V deal with the study of the real multivariate normal distribution through the probability density function and through a simple characterization and the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution and their optimum properties. Chapter VI tackles a systematic derivation of basic multivariate sampling distributions for the real case, while Chapter VII explores the tests and confidence regions of mean vectors of multivariate normal populations with known and unknown covariance matrices and their optimum properties. Chapter VIII is devoted to a systematic derivation of tests concerning covariance matrices and mean vectors of multivariate normal populations and to the study of their optimum properties. Chapters IX and X look into a treatment of discriminant analysis and the different covariance models and their analysis for the multivariate normal distribution. These chapters also deal with the principal components, factor models, canonical correlations, and time series. This book will prove useful to statisticians, mathematicians, and advance mathematics students.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WgzjBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating With Antiques: Confidently Combining Old and New","description":"Shares the secret of combining antiques with new furnishings, and discusses arrangement, fabrics, styles, lighting, and texture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=69L1PAAACAAJ&dq=Decorating+With+Antiques:+Confidently+Combining+Old+and+New&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The aquarian gospel of Jesus the Christ: The philosophic and practical basis of the religion of the aquarian age of the world and of the church ... remembrances, known as the Akashic records","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yHlCAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oil for the lamps of China (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":""}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-866134f4"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/37.md","filePath":"drive/37.md"}'),W={name:"drive/37.md"},_=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(x)]))}});export{D as __pageData,_ as default};
