It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.I love Jane Austen.

Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice.

Anyone who has a love of the islands, especially Maui, will enjoy the early 20th century accounts of events that took place. The infantile detail she pays attention to, enhances the beauty of the book. It makes you long for the inner peace of living such an idyllic life.Thanks, Paul M.

Although this autobiography was written by a European after our dubious disturbance in these islands, Armine captures the feel, the smell, the magic, and the beauty of Hawaii in the early 1900s. Raised by a father with a great sense of adventure and love of his daughter and Hawaii, Armine lives a charmed existence and details it beautifully for us to escape to. If you have been to Maui, you will particularly love to read it with a map or memories in hand, to even better picture what she paints on the canvas of her book."},{"Title":"Born in paradise","review":"My mother has a copy of this book. I read it and found out that Armine and I have alot in common. We were both born in Hawaii, she on Maui, me on Oahu, but moved to Maui when I was 2 years old. We both have alot of fond childhood memories of the islands, events and our family and friends over there. She met royalty, grew up on a 10,000 acre ranch called Haleakala (pronounced hale-a-ka-la) Ranch situated on the volcano of the same name. It is now Tedeschi Winery (they make pineapple wine!)The book mainly tells the story of a white child growing up in paradise amongst hawaiians, portuguese, japanese, chinese, koreans, and other people of different races. She took pride in being called a &quot;paniolo&quot; (hawaiian for cowboy).Excellent book for everybody!"},{"Title":"Born in paradise","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's not great literature by any means but if you are one of those who have been Shanghaied by Hawaii (as Jack London put it) then you probably will enjoy it too. A large share of the appeal is dreaming about living in Maui before the strip malls, the bumper-to-bumper traffic, the golf courses, gated communities and crowded beaches turned complete paradise into paradise with strip malls, traffic and golf courses. The book covers her life from the age of about four until the age of twenty-nine.Armine von Tempski was fortunate to have been born into a family of means. Her father was manager of the 34,000 acre Haleakala Ranch and her mother was the daughter of the British minister to Hawaii (James Wodehouse). They seemed to know everyone who was anyone. A source of pride for Armine was that one of her father's best friends was Lorrin Thurston, an important figure in Hawaiian history indeed but the chief architect of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy so, as much as Armine admired him, he is considered a villain by many today. She does not mention that Thurston was 1/3 owner of the ranch. Armine does not involve herself in politics in this book and she obviously loved the Hawaiian people, especially the paniolos who worked on her father's ranch, and she respected their beliefs and customs. But she was also a product of her times.It's a bit late to do anything about it but it is unusual for an autobiography to rarely give the author's age or the dates when events occurred. Born in Paradise was published in 1940 so the events she described were her memory of them some thirty to forty years later. Perhaps this is why some of the time lines seem confused. For example, Von Tempski recounts a trip to Haleakala with her father when she discovers what turned out to be Hawaiian burial sites inside some of the cones and she describes this as though she were perhaps a teenager at the time. In fact, a paper by the anthropologist, Kenneth Emory, gives the date that he received information from Armine as being 1920, when her father was no longer manager of the ranch (and couldn't ride) and she would have been 28 years old (could Emory's date be wrong?). She also says that her father took her mother to the ranch when they were married but they were married in 1891 and he did not manage Haleakala Ranch until 1898 or 1899 by most accounts. Likewise, she tells of many incidents on the ranch when she was four or five but it would not have been on the Haleakala ranch but perhaps the ranch her father bought in Makawao with his brother (Erehwon cattle station). It's very confusing because she goes into such detail of the ranch and its workers from that period, however, can find no references that indicate that her father was manager of the ranch before 1898. Maybe she never thought that a hundred years later anyone would care if the stories were chronologically correct.For anyone interested in examining primary and secondary sources for dates as I did, go to the Library of Congress web site called Chronicling America where you can do keyword searches of Hawaiian newpapers from 1860-1922. There are hundreds of entries for Louis von Tempski and events mentioned in the book. For example, you can see that the Wirth's Circus was in Maui in January of 1896 when Armine would have been 4 years old. Other on-line sources are Men of Hawaii, edited by Sidall (short bio on Louis), Makawao cemetery records, Our Hawaii, a book by Chairmain London (who became good friends with Armine) about her and her husband's (Jack London) 1907 visit to Hawaii with a long section on their visit with the von Tempskis (available for free from Amazon), a scathing 1916 letter from Jack London to Armine saying that of the thousands of amateur manuscripts he had read hers was the sloppiest one he had ever seen and (even though he still loved her) she should be embarrassed for sending him such rubbish.Needless to say, I would not have spent as much time as I did scouring the internet for additional information if I did not become interested in this family. Through Armine's stories, I felt as though I knew them."},{"Title":"Born in paradise","review":"It took a long time for this book to get here but it finally arrived and my husband is reading it and loves it.

Watson should be highly praised, and Brill Eerdmans is commented, is a rare reference in depth on the subject.In five integral Chapters he takes you in a fast and masterful scholarly erudition from the Bible, an ancient world Book, to Modern Hermeneutics and Interpretation, in a logical and thoughtful order, not sacrificing the vivid details for the textual instructional target. Continuing in chapter II; in Collection of Biblical books, and their Canon, criteria of canonicity, it delves in chapter III, elaborating (100 pages), on the OT & NT Versions (Syriac Vetus Syra & Pesitta to Arabic & Slavonic), and their history. The author got time and space, to even include some Patristic quotations, and review the witness of some of the most ancient and trustworthy Alexandrian texts: Alexandrinus, Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, and last century great discoveries of oldest bible papyri, in Egypt.Serious but Legible Book:A criterion for deciding on such a scholarlya book, is to check few subject enteries to find answers for your queries.Q: I was curious to see if any book of the genre ever mentioned the proto- Canaanite script.A:The answer may be found on page 83: \\"The oldest alphabetic script, however was found in 24 inscriptions from the Sinai peninsula, and according to many scholars, can be dated around 1400 BCE, but which could well go back to 1800 more or less. These Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions were written in a consonantal alphabet derived from Egyptian hieroglyphic writing by the acrophonic system.\\"Now, you could ask your own questions and find out if you are satisfied with the answers!Book for Scholars?Barrera Hebrew bible scholarship speaks for its merits, and his editorial work in \\"Qumran Cave 4. IX: Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Kings,\\" is a scholarly break-through.Professor Barrera took a challenge of availing such biblical scholarship to all interested on a vital subject, lay and and scholars, and excelled. Although this encyclopedic, up to date, reference book on the subject that guides the specialized through, deserve praise, yet the hard back price is beyond the reach of the lay, even the paperback edition is relatively costly, as a text bookBarrera, Julio Trebolle:Julio Trebolle Barrera, a member of the Dead Sea Scrolls International Editors, is a Spanish professor of Hebrew/Aramaic, who translated, authored and edited many books from Qumran and on Biblical and literary criticism to contemporary hermeneutics. His book \\"A 'Canon within a Canon': Two Series of Old Testament Books Differently Transmitted, Interpreted and Authorized,\\" Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995, is a fine witness to this book.His diversified though in depth expertise, that enriched his scholarly career, while his Biblical and other linguistic tools, supported by a wealth of unparalleled information, available to few of the Dead Sea Scrolls experts, grant him a unique authority in this field."},{"Title":"The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible: An Introduction to the History of the Bible","review":"Right from the start, this book is interesting. It aims to \\"build bridges between fields of study which used to be connected at the beginning of modern criticism but which the demands of specialization have increasingly separated\\" (p 8).To give an example: under the section on Hellenism, Judaism and Christianity, there is an overview of the History of Religions theory, and the problems with it: \\"(mystery religions) were not so widespread as had been thought, and did not have the missionary character attributed to them. And most important of all, they did not reach the peak of their development until the 2nd century\\" (p 31).There is an overview, also, of all current research into the Old Testament, including the most recent scholarship. The Qumran material is gone into, with explanations to why recent studies no longer emphasize sharp distinctions between normative, official, and marginal Judaism.I was especially impressed with the section on books, oral transmission, and the ancient world. While the \\"codex became the best travelling companion for the missionary\\" (p 99) for the Christian, the roll was kept in Judaism. The bible was never meant to be read in private in a low voice, \\"but to be declaimed in a loud voice and even accompanied by psalmody in a liturgical assembly\\" (p 105). Oral transmission was paramount in the Torah. Even today, there are Jews who can recite the Torah from memory.Also it's very helpful that after each section, such as hermeneutics, there is a list of the books for further study.The research from so many different fields is included that I can hardly go into them all. Some issues discussed: the lectory didaskalos, who made sure the text was faithfully copied, Jerome, Augustine, the Gnostics, all the different varieties of the bible, from the old Syriac version to every other copy and the Vulgate, and odd bits of information such as the fact that Coptic did not become a written language until the need to translate the bible in 200 AD.Anyone with any interest in biblical studies would find this book invaluable."},{"Title":"The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible: An Introduction to the History of the Bible","review":"Professor Julio Trebolle Barrera succeeds in many aspects of \\"The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible: An Introduction to the History of the Bible\\"; however, when he steps outside the parameters he lays down at the beginning of this work, his assertions are weakened and in some places contradictory.First the good, and there is a great deal of it: Barrera makes the case that biblical scholars need to be inter-disciplinary - part linguist (at least tri-lingual, ideally in Aramaic-Hebrew / Greek / Latin), part textual critic, part literary critic, and part historian - rather than viewing it from a narrow field of interest. He proposes that, in this work at least, personal opinion and theology will be set aside to avoid the obvious pitfalls of disagreement, and to more readily develop objective conclusions. It's within this framework that Barrera really shines.His discussions on biblical languages and the history of the texts are extraordinary. Among the many topics covered are how alphabets developed, the challenges of writing in the ancient world, the impact of the different mediums on research (papyrus rots easily outside desert climates), the role of oral transmission and why translations are so very important in recovering what the originals might have looked like. Barrera's explanation of the role and the place of the LXX is excellent and sheds much needed light on how it developed and why it's so important in helping to recover the Hebrew behind it - different and in some cases superior to the MT - which wasn't completed till almost 1200 years later. In the chapter on canonicity, Barrera again shines, explaining that the collection of writings was never viewed as a single monolithic book in the ancient world, as it often is in the modern world. He also explains that studying the bible out of the context of a Tradition (Jewish or Christian) is a mistake since Tradition is what formed and shaped it.Most of the weaknesses of Barrera's work are minor ones and show up primarily in the last chapter, \\"Hermeneutics: Text and Interpretation\\". Through the first four chapters the author had managed fairly well to steer clear of opinion, but here Barrera's arguments are lightly tinged with bias. Perhaps it's unavoidable given the subject of the chapter. He does try to keep balance, but making a blanket statement that the Church Fathers were the \\"persecuted who became the persecutors\\" is a bit much. He refers to the Jews as having decided to keep apart from the pagan Greek world but then implicates Christians (who embraced Greek philosophy and reason as a tool to convert pagans) for marginalizing Jews. Puzzling.Another weakness - more an annoyance, really - is that Barrera tries desperately to walk the fence and not offend any creed; he is especially nice to Islam and Judaism, but he is critical at times to Christianity, especially Catholicism - which he made an obvious effort to not even refer to by name (the words Catholic or Catholicism are not in the index, and I think only once or twice used in the book, as if by slip of the tongue); it is called the \\"Great\\" church or the \\"Grand\\" church. However, he is not much kinder to Protestantism (which is also not in the index - Islam is, though) but at least he refers to it by name. It's just amazing that a book about bible history would make such an effort to not use the word \\"Catholic\\" - is it the name or the idea that is so offensive?There is also a noticeable lacuna in Barrera's list of disciplines that need to be brought to bear on biblical studies: other very good bible scholars would have mentioned archaeology and geography as extremely important to understanding the bible. One of the valid criticisms of the critics, especially of the 18th and 19th century rationalists, is that they never actually visited and studied the places of the bible. How can critics make judgments on the historicity of events based wholly on the text without seeing the places described? Barrera never addresses this.Not a weakness of Barrera, but an admitted weakness of biblical criticism in general that the author does comment on, is the extent of subjectivity involved. Barrera says that some conclusions are necessarily \\"more art\\" than science; and that speculation based on intuition are sometimes valid as a last resort. This is not a mind-blowing revelation; and it's not to say that because of this subjectivity no biblical criticism is useful. It's that there are limits to what it can answer, but Barrera, being an academic, thinks criticism reigns supreme. He portrays Christianity - and then mostly Catholic Christianity - as muddying the waters by the \\"tensions\\" and \\"problems\\" in reconciling OT, NT and Tradition. I respectfully disagree: Catholicism, properly understood, is the one thing that brings clarity - as evidenced by Barrera's own conclusion: that after the back and forth of renaissance humanism, the reformation, the enlightenment, and modernism, post-modern criticism needs to come back to a balance between the mysteries of the bible (faith) and reason. How utterly Catholic.Lastly, I have to comment on the typos, misspellings, wrong word usage and awkward grammar that are encountered on nearly every other page in this book. Whoever proof-read this material needed another pass or three through it. That aside, this a very worthwhile read for anyone interested in the history of the text of the bible."},{"Title":"The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible: An Introduction to the History of the Bible","review":"Julio C. Trebolle Barberra's translation work at hand is currently a condensed material of various disciplines in the study of the Hebrew and Christian bible. Ranging from textual and linguistic discussions, finally setting the last chapter to the study of hermeneutics, the book draws the rich and vast biblical disciplines that is often underestimated by an uninitiated readers.Despite the dated work itself, the book in review provides sufficient foundational studies for any readers whose interest to pursue Biblical studies, references and materials related to both the Hebrew and the Christian scriptures and interpretation. I recommend any readers, despite a Muslim myself, to learn the knowledge based on a pure academic scholarship, not simply on speculative or polemic discourse, a trap hole often fell to not just co-religion or non-religionists, but in fact for any academic disciplines."},{"Title":"Adventures in Africa","review":"In 1997, Gianni Celati, well-known Italian literary figure since the nineteen sixties and author of fiction, essays and translations, embarked on a journey into West Africa, accompanied by his friend, the film maker Jean Talon, with the intention to research the work of the traditional Dogon healers, based in the Malian \\"Centre for Traditional Medicine\\" in Bandiagara. Traveling unaccompanied into a world they did not know much about, not able to communicate except in the lingua franca of the educated, French, they negotiated their way through the country with local people for transport, guides and accommodation. It is as Celati confesses \\"a comedy of errors, delays, misinformation, and wandering about, as contacts are unfindable, means of transportation are unreliable, and complications arise at every turn\\". Celati's observations and musings have been published as \\"Adventures in Africa\\", based on a series of notebooks (nine altogether) that he kept like a travelogue during the trip that took them beyond Mali also to Senegal and across the border to Mauretania.It took me quite a while to get into the spirit of Celati's writing: jottings also in terms of unfinished sentences and thoughts... much is left to our own knowledge or imagination. His description of daily details of their first days of wandering through Bamako, Mali's capital, and traveling to other cities en route to Bandiagara, the centre of the Dogon region, can be anything from tedious to repetitive to slightly funny and ironical. Only when they finally reach their intended destination do the short information snippets unfurl into a more comprehensive account of their experiences and encounters. Even then, Celati is more concerned with his \\"stinginess\\" and his frustrations with the people around him than much else. Still, amidst all these ramblings we can detect gems of observational clarity, astute depiction of individuals and their demeanour in their Dogon context. While the original objective of the trip, to prepare for a documentary on the Dogon healer, does appear to become questionable, the visit itself is extended beyond Mali's borders. Eventually Celati relaxes into the local rhythms and attitudes that make him feel closer to the locals than to the other tourists they encounter... and he has wonderful comments about those as well as the would-be experts expats and anthropologists. Celati gives a detailed caricature of the \\"tourist\\", somebody innocently bumbling along in a foreign environment where he perceives everybody as a kind of trader, \\"starting with less than ten years old\\". He also gives himself the aura of the \\"writer on vacation\\", writing in more or less hospitable surroundings, losing himself in the colours and atmosphere of the locale, losing his sense of time...While I found \\"Adventures in Africa\\" overall, despite its weaknesses spelled out above, a worthwhile read, I cannot really recommend it highly to readers who are not already familiar with this region of Africa, unless they are willing to undertake much background research themselves first. Other than the interesting introduction by Rebecca West into Celati's writing history and some context for the book, the reader is left very much to his own devices to follow the itinerary, place the towns and villages, visualize the people and landscapes. There are no maps, no explanation of local terms, no background information to historical and socio-political context, no images of what the book is describing. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Adventures in Africa","review":"Maybe there are two ways of writing about travel. First, you write about startling things or things that other people normally might not notice. Second,you present a somewhat ordinary world but you do so in high-flown prose that---because of the quality of the writing---carries the reader along no matter what. This journalistic travel book seems one that a publisher might have picked up ONLY because the writer is well known. It is neither well written nor particularly acute in what it sees and reports. Too often there is a grim habit of stereotype, and always there is a languid sense of a prose style that suggests little more than some jottings in a loose-leaf along the way. A Graham Greene brings heart, keen perception, and inspiration to his \\"Journey without Maps\\" into Africa, and may other writers encounter people who remain in your mind. Celati just putters along."},{"Title":"Adventures in Africa","review":"I ordered two copies for gifts and one for myself to share.

We thought that it was rather dull throughout almost the whole book. One reason that we might have thought that it was dull is because, the book is written like a journal. We haven't ever read a book written like a journal before, and I don't like that style of writing. That could have had an impact on us not liking the book, or just simply because we didn't like the way it was written. Also, the story line was not too interesting. Each journal that he would write each day would just tell about what he did that day. It is like reading a book about a person that sits at home all day. The main character was a tourist in Africa, and would meet new people and travel to different places. Most of the day's he would do the same thing. We found this book to be very repetitive, and we find that pretty boring about books. He would always tell about how he would go to this river and watch all the people bathe. He would do that everyday for a long period of time, and it just got old. After that he would go to a cliff and climb it everyday. Most days though, he would take a tour bus somewhere. While he was in Africa he made many friends, sometimes it was hard to keep them straight. His friend Jean, was his best friend, they went almost everywhere together. This book isn't the best book, and we wouldn't recommend it unless you like to read other peoples' journals. We just didn't find it interesting at all.

Perfect reading on the train or in the throne room (bathroom to the common folk).My verdict: Buy this and some of the other Men's Health Life Improvement guides and give them out as stocking stuffers or as part of the holiday grab bags.

The next day he sees two rabbits. On the tenth day he sees ten holes in the lawn with rabbit ears sprouting happenstance. On the sixteenth Robert finds sixteen rabbits making double-decker peanut butter and radish sandwiches in the kitchen. On the twenty-fifth Robert gets just the book he wants at the library even though twenty-five rabbits are in line in front of him.And so it goes, all the way to the twenty-ninth when Robert sees twenty-nine rabbits with suitcases tiptoeing down his driveway and out of sight. On the last day of April Robert does not see a single rabbit. But that night....So what is the point of this little book about rabbits and Robert? Will your child notice that the story begins on April Fool's Day?Perhaps as a teacher you want to reinforce numbers and counting and distinguishing among the multitude of rabbits in the larger gatherings. Perhaps you want to duplicate some of the pages (all?) and have each child color one, then line them up around the room to practice counting 1-30. (The pages resemble coloring book pages.)Perhaps you want to practice anticipating and predicting what happens at the very end when night comes.This book about Robert and the rabbits is a little gem of possibilities."},{"Title":"The April Rabbits","review":"I taught kindergarten/1st grade for 10 years.

Of course it became a classic because it has fantastic contributions to the field. You really want me to go into it? Ok, but just a glance: in a nutshell, it is an application of the transaction cost theory to the FDI explanation: firms setup overseas business to internalise transaction costs of the intermediate goods markets, transforming these costs in bureaucratic costs, diminishing the uncertainty and promoting control over activities. It is particularly a very good explanation to the internalization of R&D activities, case which is largely discussed by the authors.

So many of our patients today use CAM, so it is important to know the affects. The chapter, &quot;How to Practice Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine&quot; addressed many of these ideas.

It's &quot;Volume Two&quot; of a trilogy, but does not have to read along with the companion volumes. Like his other two works on childhood, this interesting work, again, introduces his ideas and promotes a compassionate understanding of the lives of children.Separation anxiety, anxious attachment, and other phenomena of attachment are well-known and accepted reactions now - we expect it from our pets as well as our babies - but at one time, were less well understood (and anticipated.) This work, lucidly and compassionately, lays it out for the reader. The book is divided into three sections, and in a well-organized and deeply accessible fashion, Bowlby proceeds. The Sections are &quot;Security, Anxiety, and Distress,&quot; &quot;An Ethological Approach to Human Fear,&quot; and finally, &quot;Individual Differences in Susceptibility to Fear: Anxious Attachment&quot;.Bowlby uses his own prior clinical work and that of others to support his assertions. The father's role, the role of anger and fear, and many other factors are discussed. This is a scholarly study, and has much to tell readers. It's thoroughly readable and interesting, not only for its subject but because Bowlby can tell a story and hold the reader's interest through-out. Not a &quot;how-to&quot; or a quick fix - rather, a deeply sensible and basic study. Highly recommended for parents, teachers, clinicians."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"Bowlby is a clear and cogent thinker who takes time to look at an important issue in tremendous detail. Taking into account much previous research and theorizing, he accepts and refutes a wide body of work in making his point. You may not agree with all of his conclusions (I may not agree with all of his conclusions), but this is not a book to be discounted lightly. Should be required reading for anyone interested in the fields of psychoanalysis and child development."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"Bowlby is one of my favorite psychologists because his theory reflects real life tightly, very applicable. If you are a psychology major or interest in intricated mother-child relationship and its influence on later life, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"This book is very neat in its specifics about the effects of absence when a mother is not in a child's life and the roles and effects of mother figures as well. Myself dealing with abandonment issues from my mom and my mother figure in my life, this book really assists in identifying the issues caused from the absent parent. Though the book doesn't offer any real advice as to deal with these problems that arise, it identify's the issues and allows you to further your research in progression. The writing style used can get rather complex though, be prepared for that. I agree with everything provided in this book and recommend it to anyone who's interested in either the psychological effects of absence of a parent, or seek to identify it themselves."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"Separation: anxiety and Anger. If we want to understand the anger of the teens and twenty - somethings and adults, read this book. without attachment it is not possible to formulate a supportive society."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"The three books in Bowlby's trilogy on Attachment, Separation and Loss need to be read a whole. Using the studies and case histories of children being separated from their mothers and important others, in a wide range of circumstances from separations of only a few minutes, through separations of several weeks on up to prolonged and permanent separation due to divorce and death, Bowlby outlines a new way of understanding neurosis, psychosis and optimal, healthy functioning.Using the lens of a Darwinian analysis, and the case histories written up by psychoanalysts spanning decades, he compares and contrasts his new theory with that of previous psychological thought, especially the psychoanalytic tradition.I found his analysis penetrating and illuminating. It sets the stage and formulates the hypotheses for further research. Much of that research has now taken place and has borne out Bowlby's theories. Not all of it, of course.Because Bowlby's attachment theory became and continues to be such a foundational analysis for so much that has followed in its wake, from evolutionary psychology to child development to psychotherapy, it is a must read for anyone interested in these and related fields."},{"Title":"Separation: Anxiety And Anger (Basic Books Classics,) Volume 2","review":"As an MFT graduate student, first hand accounts are important. For the price, add depth to your research writing as the theory intended. Bowlby makes separation axiety, child anger and anger clear.

Worth a lot more too me than I paid."},{"Title":"The Yellow Music Kill","review":"hmmmmm,the title of this book sounds promising does it not? this story is about an ex-olympic sailing champnamed matt larkin (circa 1974) who is a cross between a rock star and casanonva. matt is wandering aroundlooking for some adventure and he finds it when a woman from the state department(!?) asks matt to go tothe people's republic of china to drop off a transmitter/radio with a signal device in it. the signal deviceis meant to help a chinese big wig get out of china once the big guy was in the ocean hiding on a boat(sorry,the story is a bit convoluted). on his journey,matt meets some various chinese people and of course somepretty ladies(ooh,la la). i thought the author did a good job of describing revolutionay china during thistime period and poor matt,he gets attacked a couple times( although athletic,he is no kung fu master!)but,matt is determined to finish his mission and get the radio to the right person. does he do it?...um,sort of.i won't spoil the end for those who have not read it.if i may return to the unusual title of the book,\\"the yellow music\\" is what red china called our rock/pop musicand the \\"kill\\" part connects back to the fact that a couple characters in the book die before the end. an okstory."},{"Title":"Field manual for water quality monitoring: An environmental education program for schools","review":"This book has many typographical errors and some scientific errors as well. Intended to reach a nonscientific audience, the authors have oversimplified many topics to the point of giving incorrect information. Nonexpert secondary teachers, for whom the book is intended, will not be well-served and will convey incorrect information to their students if they rely heavily on this volume to the exclusion of other scholarly references in the areas of limnology, zoology, entomology, and general biology. Other general guidebooks, such as the Golden Guides or National Audobon Series provide better information, although not tailored for an educational purpose. Teachers should use this book with caution with respect to the scientific material. Although the science-in-action concept is pedagogically appealing, there are too many errors in this book. With a thorough editing by a knowledgeable expert, this could be a useful tool for the high school classroom."},{"Title":"Irish Eyes (Palisades Pure Romance)","review":"...this book was a welcome gift in the midst of the hormonally-charged, so-called &quot;teen romance&quot; books girls my age are usually exposed to.

I really didn't know what I was going to get when the book arrived, so I can't say that I was disappointed or thrilled either way. It really is his personal story, not a history of his products, though these are brought up now and again throughout the book. Given that there isn't any book like this on the subject, I plan to keep it, but it doesn't always read well. Often it seems that when reading a new chapter you feel as though you read the same thing in the previous chapter, which you did... Sometimes it is a little hard for the reader to keep the timeline straight as the story sometimes reverses course. I would have liked some more plant photos or photos of the family homes perhaps, but I imagine these are things that may not really exist. I suspect it was difficult to gather up as much as the author was able to uncover this long after his death. Probably would have needed to write this book in the mid 1950's to find people who could tell you more about Mr. Hornby.If you are interested in personal biographies of those who invent and tinker or are a fan of the products that came from this company, you'll find it interesting enough to ignore the flaws."},{"Title":"The Toy Maker: The Life & Times of Inventor Frank Hornby","review":"The Toy Maker: The Life and Times of Inventor Frank HornbyVery interesting book for the fans of Meccano, Hornby trains and Dinky Toys although there is a major error, the farm tractor on the cover is not a Meccano product."},{"Title":"Bay Area Thomas Bros Map","review":"Thomas Bros' map books are legendary. I've seen copy cat books, but none compare for accuracy, detail, and organization. The book format is both an asset and a hindrance.

He has gotten into some graphic novels and of course, Garfield but has not really jumped into large novels. While this is not a very long book, he started reading it on his own, without being asked. (We homeschool so I set aside reading time, and we all read here at night.) Then he came home and read again! This morning I told him that he could read as long as he wanted before starting his schoolwork. Well, he finished the book! You may think he just put off school, and while that may be, it's not like him to do so. He just devoured this book! He's not much for reviews yet, but he said that it was cool, strange and funny. He did say that it lagged a bit in areas, but he's looking forward to the other titles available.

I haven't read it in a while but I would really reccomend it for anyone or their kid. It was a truly enchanting and humerous book."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"A nice, quick, clever little bit of fun. The adult book this most reminded me of was The French Lieutenant's Woman, with the intruding, self-conscious author and the characters who will not do what they are told. There is no closest children's book that comes to mind; a warped Grimm, or a twisted King Arthur perhaps, but nothing else. Certainly, Feiffer has written a children's masterpiece. Difficult to describe, hard to tell, it is, perhaps like The Little Prince, the story of a man on a quest to find ~ though he doesn't realise it ~ himself and, in the process, change and mature his character. Like all the best children's (and adult's) books, there is no preaching, and the reader has no idea, till he's finished, that he has read a wise book."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"This book is capable of altering your life, and that of the children you read it to. It is approachable, and funny at the beginning, and moves to an involving (while still funny) morality tale with useful lessons and vocabulary.

It has an interesting flow of characters a lively narrator and hilariously funny pictures. All who I have recommended this book to, loved it. the only problem that I have found with it is the ending. He stops making every one laugh. I thought that he was sort of like Peter Pan and would always be funny. But he turned serious. Still it is absolutely awesome, A must read."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"In the beginning Roger is a prince, but not a normal prince. Roger has a strange effect on people. If he gets too close to a person, they could die laughing. When J. Wellington Wizard tells Roger to go on a quest, Roger asks, \\"Isn't a quest where you have to go somewhere or find something?\\" J. Wellington says that he sees him entering the Forever Forest, and tells him to take a sack of magic powder, and whenever he sees someone, to dust a little on himself, so that Roger can turn into a thing, maybe even a leaf. Then, whoever he is near won't laugh. Roger sets out on his quest, gets stuck in the Forever Forest, and meets a lot of new people, such as little Lucille, Andrew, and Tom. Some are evil and some are nice. Roger hates it in the Forever Forest, but he knows it will get better and he will be the happiest man on earth.This was a very funny book to read because the author pretended that he doesn't have control over his book, such as when, in chapter 5, Night of the Frogs, he says that he was just trying to fool Tom because chapter 5 is really called Tom. Tom is a character who is supposed to leave on page 9 but he refused. The author always talks about how Tom can walk in and out of the book, and come back at the perfect time. I thought this book was hilarious, engaging, and thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"I can't tell you how many times I've read this book. When I first started reading it, I was disapointed because it seemed like a total toddler's book. But the more I read, the more absorbed I became. So many things happen so quickly that you want to keep reading just to find out what's coming next. Jules Feiffer doesn't write like other writers; he plays around with his work, and you can tell he was having a good time writing this book. And although the book is very fun and light reading, I think there are also some hidden meanings and life lessons to be learned from it. I plan to read this book many times more. I also think this book would appeal to the \\"Phantom Tollbooth\\" audience, and vice versa."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"When I first read this delightful book, I immediately reread it to experience the joy and wit again.

The characters are engaging, and the writing is enjoyably casual.It's about a prince who makes everyone happy, a princess so beautiful she turns anyone who looks at her into stone, a clumsy giant, and a hunter who shouldn't even be in the book but stays in it despite the author's protests.It's a quick read, very fun.

The reason: Roger is near. He stars in A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears by Jules Feiffer, which is a wonderful and hilarious fiction book. It is about a prince, Roger, who makes anyone laugh for no reason when they are within a half-mile of him. The sorcerer, to make the problem stop, sends him on a quest.This book is extremely funny, but only half as entertaining for the older readers. The king, King Whatchamacallit, messes up with his words so much, that it may get a tad old after a while. However, when you hear of the characters and how they act and are described, you can't help but laugh. The book is also very creative. For example, how creative is turning into a stick and throwing yourself, then having a friend look for you? Or for a super time (without drugs) have someone walk within 1/2 mile from you? As you can see, this is a fantastic book.But of course, some people are never happy. They may think that this book isn't detailed enough. That isn't quite true. The details are just more spaced out. This makes the book a little more exciting. And for the details that aren't so clear, which is quite close to impossible, the little sketches will help. Sure, maybe not everyone would like the fact that it has pictures, but those pictures really add a lot to the story line. It adds details that could take paragraphs, maybe pages to express in words. There is no way that either could take away from such a fun and wonderful book."},{"Title":"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears","review":"There are some very funny things in this book, but also some very serious themes about right, wrong, honor, tolerance, forgiveness, and love.

And that day has finally come with the release of Charge of the Tigers -- I wept, I laughed, I could not put it down! The story moves fluidly, the plot is riveting, and, for you ladies out there, the romantic plotline crafted by Mr. Vera puts Danielle Steel AND Jackie Collins, COMBINED, to shame!

Oh and the part where he \\"shoots\\" McCandless and later admits he would have shot him for real if he had too?

SHARPE'S TIGER, although an adventure in itself to be read at any period in the SHARPE series, is another wonderful way to introduce readers to Richard Sharpe, the best damn soldier ever in the British Army, now or ever!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Sharpe's Tiger A Pleasant Return to IndiaBy Kristin BattestellaAfter reading the less than stellar Sharpe's Fury, I returned to the Sharpe novel series by Bernard Cornwell at its chronological beginning. 1997's Sharpe's Tiger is a pleasant return to Indian locales and colonial drama.Long before his rise to fame against Napoleon, Sharpe was an ignorant Private serving under then Colonel Wellesley during the invasion of Mysore. It's 1799, and Private Sharpe suffers cruelly at the hands of the wicked Sergeant Hakeswill and the corrupt Captain Morris. After being tricked and provoked by Hakeswill, Sharpe is flogged. General Harris intervenes, sending the despondent Sharpe and Lieutenant Lawford undercover in Seringapatam Sharpe must infiltrate the Tippoo's forces, rescue lost intelligence Colonel McCandless, battle man eating tigers, and learn how to read.A lot happens in Sharpe's Tiger. Some of it can feel like a retread from Cornwell's earlier novels, mostly in recreating the animosity and vile character of Obadiah Hakeswill, but the touch of India forgives any redundancy from the author. It's been some time since I've read books like Kim and Gunga Din, so it's been a pleasant change of pace to read of the red coated, lowly Sharpe getting dusty and thinking desertion in the heat of India. And fortunately, we have plenty of Sharpe, unlike some of the other recent books in the series. The beginning of the novel is almost exclusively from his perspective, so we have plenty of time to get to know and love young Sharpie. Towards the end of the book, however, we again get head hopping from Cornwell, but I can forgive the detached thoughts of the Tippoo because we've got our fair share of Dick Sharpe.As much as I like Sharpe and his issues and relationships, it is refreshing to read Sharpe as a man alone. He warms to Lieutenant Lawford eventually, but this uppity officer and ignorant Private don't bond like Sharpe and Harper later do. I miss Harper, but I like seeing Sharpe so stripped of all that we love about him later. I dare say, he isn't even as charming. He's raw and talented, but Sharpe's got a lot to learn about how to be a soldier. Although Richard is the best thing in town for the Widowed Mary Bickerstaff, I'm kind of glad we don't have too much romance or bedroom action in Sharpe's Tiger. We're just getting to know young Sharpe; he's learning about himself. For folks beginning their reading here, you're just meeting Sharpe all together. Cornwell uses the relationship with Mary to show the budding sensitivity in Sharp, but we also get allusions to some brothels, too. We can't have our hero completely loveless! As often as Cornwell can lay on the history a bit thick, Sharpe himself represents a good hunk of the history from the time. The Tippoo's Tiger elite versus sepoys siding with the British, the French putting their hands in the pot-Sharpe himself is conflicted between his mission for the army that flogged him and the French Colonel Gudin who treats him with respect unaware that Sharpe is really spying on the Tippoo.Naturally, when reading Sharpe's Tiger you can see its influence on the 2006 telefilm Sharpe's Challenge. The plots to blow the western wall, Sharpe's undercover work, and his captivity all end up part and parcel in Challenge. When reading the book, I felt familiar with it already from Challenge, even though the film is supposedly a composite of the entire India trilogy: Tiger, Triumph, and Fortress. Some parts of Tiger are very different, though, with more developed secondary characters and tighter battle sequences. And of course, there's plenty of tigers on the page. Challenge made a few iffy changes by updating the storyline to post Waterloo, but I'm curious now to see how it took from Triumph and Fortress. Of course, just my luck that I don't currently have the middle book in the trilogy!I broke from reading Tiger over Christmas, but was eager to return. Despite my praise, however, I must admit the novel is not as stellar as the original Sharpe books. Cornwell lapses into some lazy writing again. Instead of describing things subtly or from one point of view, we get one or two omnipresent sentences with way too many thats and prepositional phrases. This is attached to that, from which there is this, that goes to this, of which there was that man. I get it. Sometimes I think Cornwell tries too hard, or over researches and feels the need to tell every detail ever. If you set up the palace, I can imagine what Seringapatam is like. I don't need paragraphs of characters waiting and looking around describing things. Get on with the good stuff.Sharpe's Tiger is by no means a perfect book, but where prequels can be hit or miss, Cornwell has succeeded here. Although he tries too hard, treads too stereotypically on the Hindu versus Muslim aspects, and historically stretches the end down to Sharpe versus the Tippoo, all in all Tiger is a pleasant read. Whether you enjoy books dealing with colonial or Imperial India, or you're a bit tired of Sharpe's Napoleonic antics, Sharpe's Tiger is a fine place to join in the Sharpe series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"When I checked this book out of the local library, my favorite librarian looked concerned. Based on her knowledge of my reading habits, she was dubious that I would like Sharpe's Tiger. Knowing her reading tastes, I soon realized that the book is far too bloody, raw, and unrestrained for her delicate sensibilities. If you like your adventure stories to be pretty antiseptic in protecting you from grisly reality, this book won't be for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy feeling like you are there and experiencing the story, you'll adore Sharpe's Tiger.The year is 1799. The place is Mysore in India. Richard Sharpe is a relatively untested private who is good at thinking and acting quickly. After Sergeant Bickerstaff dies, Sharpe becomes first in line to marry his beautiful widow, a half-Indian half-English woman, Mary Bickerstaff. But that's a dangerous thing to do because one of the officers and a sergeant have designs of Mrs. Bickerstaff for immoral purposes that will bring some money to them as well. Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill sets Sharpe up to make a fatal blunder, and Sharpe falls for the plot. As a result, Sharpe is at risk of losing his life.While this is going on, Colonel McCandless who leads the British military intelligence activities has learned a crucial secret for successfully seizing Seringapatam, the well-defended Mysore seat of the Tippoo who is the most fierce and determined enemy of the British in India. Before Colonel McCandless can pass on the secret, he is captured by the Tippoo. McCandless's only hope now is that his emergency plan to secure a rescue will work.Sharpe is drafted for a suicide assignment to pretend to be a deserter and infiltrate Seringapatam in an attempt to free the Colonel before the siege begins. His potential reward is to earn Sergeant's stripes so that he can be free of Hakeswill's authority. The story suddenly goes from army boredom to taut suspense as Sharpe's life is continually hanging in the balance.The story provides a wealth of details about the British and East India Company armies at the time and the life of the independent Indian leaders. You'll also learn a lot about battle strategy and tactics of the time.Richard Sharpe is a truly extraordinary hero for being cool under fire, resourceful, and quick to gain an advantage. He also has the perspective of a general without the rank and authority to do much more than lead his own steps when no superior officers are around.The book is filled with exciting action, intriguing challenges, and brooding evil. Naturally, you'll be rooting for Sharpe to drive out those who are doing or want to do wrong. But the good versus evil isn't that clear. The Tippoo isn't a bad ruler: He's just the enemy of Richard Sharpe.Although the book is somewhat simplistic in its morality, I think you'll enjoy a break from all of those books written today about anti-heroes.I especially liked the glimpses of the young Arthur Wellesley before he became the famed Duke of Wellington.I am looking forward to reading more books in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Chronologically, this novel (copyrighted 1997) is the first in the series of novels about Richard Sharpe. It does not cover his early life (covered to some extent in \\"Sharpe's Regiment\\"), or his actual beginnings in the British Army, but starts somewhat abruptly with Private Sharpe serving in the 33rd's Light Company in India and contemplating desertion. It introduces the beginnings of Sharpe's contact with the odious Sergeant Hakeswill, a cowardly bully who becomes Sharpe's personal troll, riding his shoulder to torment him in later novels in the series.Hakeswill wants Sharpe's woman Mary (the widow of another sergeant), for his own evil purposes. Hakeswill conspires with Captain Morris, who is in need of money, to get rid of Sharpe on trumped up charges. Sharpe survives what might have been a death sentence when his lashing is stopped at 202, and he is sent off on a special mission. The woman eventually catches a bigger fish and goes her own way, free of both Sharpe and Hakeswill. She was not Sharpe's first woman (see \\"Sharpe's Regiment\\"), and will not be the last.The main plot concerns the defeat of the Muslim Tippoo at Seringapatam in 1799. The Tippoo ruled the Hindu state of Mysore, thanks to his late father's conquests, and was siding with the French. Various fictional characters and actions have been created to provide a place for Private Sharpe. The author has provided a map of Seringapatam, and his Historical Note at the end of the novel gives some of the actual history. Some unknown person did end up with the Tippoo's jewels, enough to retire in considerable comfort.Sharpe is ambitious and ends up a sergeant at a relatively young age. He will also discover that trolls are difficult to kill, and tend to hang onto a person once they have found someone to torment. Like most books in the Sharpe series, I would rate this novel PG-13 based on content."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Sharpe's Tiger is the first chronologically (although not the first written) in Bernard Cornwell's acclaimed Richard Sharpe series. In Sharpe's Tiger Private Richard Sharpe is in India fighting with the 33rd Regiment. His regimental officer is inept, and his sergeant is the evil Hakeswill, but overall Sharpe is happy. Then, his woman catches the eyes of his superiors and Sharpe is set up for death. He is tricked into hitting an officer and sentenced to a brutal flogging. Yet, despite the flogging Sharpe is saved by his colonel Arthur Wellesley and sent on a secret mission with a young officer named Lawford. Sent to a impregnable fortress controlled by the Tippoo, Sharpe must battle British and native forces to complete his mission. Failure means hideous death, but success could lead him to more wealth than he could possibly imagine. Once again Bernard Cornwell writes a rolicking adventure. By taking Sharpe back to the beginning, Cornwell brings an added dimension to his classic character. It is interesting to see Sharpe grow and mature as a soldier. Overall, I highly recommend this volume of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Ever since Cornwell's first Sharpe book, fans have wanted to know the complete story of Sharpe beginning his climb up the ranks of the Brittish army.

It seems to show more of the vulnerability that is encased in the young Richard Sharpe. The battles in India also add to the readers understanding of Brittish colonialism. After completing this novel I could not help but eagerly await the next Sharpe novel &quot;Triumph&quot;."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":".After having read the Starbuck serie (Civil War) from B. Cornwell, i had great expectations. To my great delight, the same feeling of plunging in the middle of an historical battlefield seized me after a few pages, making me forget about (every bloody thing I had to do in) my new house for a few hours.SHARPE'S TIGER is the first in the serie (of about 12) in chronological order. Even though Mr. Cornwell does'nt write them this way, if you want to appreciate the historical flavor and Sharpe's career in Her Majesty's army, you want to read them chronologically.The reader looking for nice fancy figures of speech will be left unsatisfied. Political correctness is also left in the closet. It is blunt, direct cannon-fodder daily life we are looking at and it is written that wayYou may disrespect these incompetent officiers, having bought their grade, you will probably hate Sgt. Hakeswill, the potence saved maniac. you will feel pity for Mary and the destiny traced for her.One thing is sure, we will all finish that book with the smell of gunpowder floating around us and a smile in the historical note about general WellingtonAll rights reserved to The Reviewer Provided by courtesy to Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"The publisher should be ashamed of the shoddy proofreading.

I have read many of them, although not in the chronological order. When I got my hands over this book I was thrilled. But then I got to the part when he made up verses of the \\"Koran\\".This is not a real review, I have not completed the book because of that, but I felt I should at least state the mistake in it.I pride myself for being open minded. I didn't object to the fact that the enemy were a Muslim. There were and are some incredibly stupid ones in history, it is human nature, but I could not go any further from the page where the made up verse was. I rated three, even though I suspect I would rate it more if I could complete it, I can't. It may sound silly to you, but I was offended.I know it is fiction, but one of the things I like about Cornwell is how much research he puts in his books, I wish he made sure everything was correct in it, we muslims, do read other books too."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"What do I say about this overhyped waste of paper?Well, the history, clearly, has been meticulously researched, and great pains have been taken to write the characters actions, etc., around the known historical facts in such a way as to not mislead anyone. This is why I'm giving this 2 stars, instead of 1. I will give a point for good research. That said:I don't think the characters are particularly well drawn, not even Sharpe himself. The 'villians' in particular were melodramatic and unbelievable.I kept thinking that the whole thing read like an old DC comic book. Not that they were bad--but they WERE simplistic, and so is this.I got sucked into this by a fanatic Sean Bean fan who made me watch several of these movies last weekend--which has strained our friendship, let me tell you. I decided to read a couple of the books, thinking maybe there would be something more to the books--those ridiculous movies, not even the substantial attractiveness of Mr. Bean could overcome. Alas, it's clear to me now that it's the attractiveness of Mr. Bean, and not the quality of Mr. Cornwell's writing that have all these 'Sharpie' people captivated. Imagining Mr. Bean as you read helps, but not enough. Not enough.If you're looking for good information about the battle of Sera-who-sis and the Tippy-toodle, this might be the book for you. Otherwise, I recommend you give the whole series a pass. I say that having read the next two, and neither of them get any better. I refuse to waste any more time on this crap. I'll re-read Patrick O'Brian!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Product was exactly as described in Amazon.com and seller shipped it promptly.Great service."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Cornwell is a talented writer-- crisp and engaging, with some sparkling dialogue and characterizations (though not of the protagonist). His Sgt. Hakewill is an absolute delight as the over-confident buffoon/sadist (\\"Says so in the scriptures\\"). He carries the story along briskly, giving a believable account of everyday life and the brutality of war 200 years ago. All of that got me eagerly through the first three novels (India), with gradually diminishing returns until I lost interest after the fifth, Sharpe's Prey.A major shortcoming is the failure to put local events in the context of the Napoleonic wars. But the fatal problem was the plotting. Repetitive, often shallow and sometimes preposterous, with some plot lines left hanging. I also thought he did a poor job of developing the rather unlikable hero.I was pained to see the book jacket comments comparing Cornwell to O'Brian. Not even close, at least for those who have had the time to lose themselves in O'Brian's 7,000 page dense, unconventional, often amazingly satisfying story of the friendship between an English post captain and his Irish/Catalan physician/naturalist/spy. Forester (Hornblower) and Pressfield (Gates of Fire) are also first rate historical novelists. Not so the talented Mr. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I love historical fiction. I've read Hornblower straight through, I'm reading Aubrey-Maturin, and I am constantly on a lookout for historical fiction that matches this caliber. When I saw the popularity of the Sharpe series, I was excited. A book from the same era, basically the same concept as Hornblower, and on land. Seemed like a great premise and I was hoping to get hooked. Unfortunately, the book was just far too simplistic. Just like one reviewer said, the characters are simple. They are melodramatic and cliche. There is absolutely no complexity to their personalities, it was like a Disney movie. Many of the sentences were poorly constructed and full of unrealistic dialogue. Historically, the action was just too unrealistic. I went on to the second book in the series suspecting maybe I was just in a bad mood when I had read the first. By the end of the first paragraph, my heart had sunk. The only internal turmoil I have encountered so far seems to have been taken straight from The Red Badge of Courage, only it is far more poorly written. Again the characters are Disney-like and childish. For a better alternative, I would recommend reading Aubrey-Maturin. It is far mroe realistic, in the actions, dialogue, and behavior."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This book was a breath of fresh air and a great begining to the Sharpe's in India series. I was disapointed with the last two novels (Sharpe's Trafalgar &amp; Sharpe's Prey). I had missed Sharpe's Tiger for some reason and just picked it up and was VERY pleased.The story of Sharpe as a private under Haskwell, and the Tippoo was just plain first rate reading on a par with the best of the Sharpe series. No slow storyline, no useless characters, just action, adventure and plotting on a high note.Like Sharpe we find ourselves respecting his foes and wishing a better fate for them. This is the joy of the story.In an old comic (King Conan #7) the barbarian says &quot;It is good for a man to have brave enemies so he can remember them after he has slain them.&quot; We see that same respect from Sharpe and the British Army in this battle. It will make you want to march with Sharpe (in text) through India.Buy it!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I really have to hand it to all the positive reviewers for this series and this book in particular; you are right. Sharpe is outstanding and I can't wait to read more of the series. After months reading positive reviews of some of the earlier books in the series (and by earlier I mean those that were published first in time) I decided to give Cornwell a go. What I expected was a rip roaring adventure and I was not disappointed. In fact, I was esctatic! Believe everything good you read about Sharpe's Tiger: the book is fun without being light. Cornwell includes some very helpful maps and his prose is extremely colorful. He is particularly good at describing battle scenes and dialogue. Expect to finish this book at record time; its not short, its just that you will want to read just one more exciting chapter.

I found this a fast-moving, slashing story and one has the impresion that it is carefully researched. I read my encyclopedia's entries on the siege and battle of Seringapathan and as far as I could tell the book is all right, except that the fictional characters are not mentioned in the article. (: We all know of Arthur Wellesley but some of us did not know of Baird. In the Brittanica article on Baird we find: &quot;In the defeat of Col. Baillie's force by Hyder Ali, Baird was taken prisoner, and remained a prisoner for four years. After a short interval at home he returned to India in 1791 and took part in the campaign against Tippoo. After serving at the Cape of Good Hope he returned to India, and took part in the last war against Tippoo. Maj. Gen. Baird stormed Seringapatan and became master of the place where he had so long been a prisoner. He was bitterly disappointed when the command of the place was given to Sir A. Wellesley...&quot; So nice to learn accurate history from rip-roaring fiction.

His hesitation towards flogging, his experiences with superiors, the first meeting of Arthur Welsely, and the dogged contempt the soldiers seem to have for him.You will find that Cornwell, one of my favorites, has seen that Richard Sharp is incomplete until we know the man that was behind the character we know and love.The story is fantastic, the realism of battle intense, the picture that is painted of the massive fortress/city of Seringapatam, is one of a daunting, massive and impregnable in the classic thought.You are there for the forlorn hope leading the charge, and discharging your weapon at the determined defenders. You are there in the confines of the city at the mercy of the insanely powerful Tippo Sultan.Historically speaking the battle takes place pretty much as Cornwell describes. With his help you are able to participate in person."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I read all of the original Sharpe series in the eighties and thought that the series had come to it's natural conclusion with Sharpes Waterloo in 1990. I was very suprised to see Sharpes Devil a couple of years later and to my mind this was a book too far in the series. Cornwell was always writing other books at the same time including the excellent Redcoat aas well as the nautical thrillers. When he started the Starbuck chronicles I was delighted and followed Nates adventures in the same manner as I had Sharpe's. Then, after the Sharpe series had been shown on tv Cornwell abandoned \\"The Starbuck Chronicles\\" mid-series (after four books)and resurected Sharpe. Not to sound too cynical but the only reason for this betrayal of fans who had bought the new books and were following Starbuck could only have been money...Cornwell betrayed and sacrificed the Starbuck fans for a newer and more lucrutive market...the new Sharpe fans worldwide who came to the books after the tv series. In order to continue to cash in along came all the new books each one inserted in a different period of Sharpe's career. If you have read the original series you won't recognise Sharpe's description in the new books..because it's Sean Bean!...Thanks Bernard, how's the yacht?"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I was particularly taken by this books clear and easy to read style, coupled with a story that flowed effortlessly.

The Sharpe series was universally excellent, even his contemporary thrillers were good, and A.Mack is not known as a lover of contemporary thrillers. The writing is excellent on this work. The charachters and the action is portrayed superbly. When I first bought this book I had read most of the Sharpe series and had also read the Warlord Chronicles. Cornwell wrote the books set in India after most of the books which were set later, when Sharpe-watchers had given up on new Sharpe material, and it did not disappoint. It needed to be written because Sharpe often described Hakeswill and Captain Morris in the Peninsula, and readers wanted to hear about Sharpe's days in India, about which he was reticent in the Peninsula. Indeed the only objection which I have is to the cover. A different edition has a picture of an elaborately carved rifle on the front, and I believe this to be superior to the one displayed.PS- This book gave me two of my greatest ambitions- to visit India, which I have subsequently done with my latest girlfriend, and to drink three bottles of wine at one sitting, as Morris did, which I have just embarked on the process of achieving...."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Do not credit them coves what say Cornwell is another Patrick O'Brian because he ain't, not if it was ever so.

I liked \\"Sharpe's Tiger.\\" It's easy to read, fast moving, authentic in detail, and describes a real historical event, apparently with a substantial degree of accuracy. Cornwell knows his business, at least well enough to fool me.The story revolves around the siege of Seringapatam in central India in 1799. Sharpe is a 22-year old private in the army, unlettered, crude, and brutal -- but also quick thinking and a natural leader. Reprieved from a flogging for misconduct, he is sent on a spy mission to Seringapatam to gather information about the defenses of the city before the British attack it.Arthur Wellesley, the future Wellington, England's greatest soldier, is a character and is portrayed as cold as Lucifer. In fact, perhaps the most memorable feature of the book is the picture it gives of the appalling conditions of servitude for British soldiers in 1799. The French and the Indian Maharajahs, by contrast, are more humane in many respects.I like to read series in their chronological order and I liked \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" well enough to now proceed onward to the next in the series.

There is nothing literary about his novels--how could there be when you are pounding out two books a year? But the author's journalistic background serves him well with clean, compelling prose that is knitted together to tell an exciting adventure. And Sharpe's Tiger is a cut above the author's usual solid fare. Think Kipling without the racism.Richard Sharpe is a splendid anti-hero. Irreligious and occasionally amoral he is tough, with an instinct for self preservation and an eye to getting ahead. Sgt Obadaiah Hakeswill is a slithering villain worthy of Dickens and the setting of colonial India with its man-eating tigers and elephants bedecked \\"en bijoux\\" is rousingly exotic. A well rounded cast of minor characters includes officers both good and bad and a Tipoo who is Britain's enemy solely because he has what they want and isn't inclined to role over when they snap their fingers.This is my first Richard Sharpe novel and I look forward to others. Having read the Saxon Chronicles and the Grail Quest series I realize Cornwall can be uneven--the former should have wrapped up long ago and the latter lagged in spots. Not surprising when you have nearly 50 books to your credit but Sharpe's Tiger is the writer at his best and as good an adventure as you are likely to read.

I'm hoping 'Sharpe's Triumph' will be a bit better."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"After reading several of Bernard Cornwell's other novels, I finally decided to take the plunge into Cornwell's longest series to date, the Sharpe Series. \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" is the first novel in the Series' chronology, and it sets the table by creating one heck of a character in Sharpe and also giving him some heroic exploits, to boot.It's 1799, and Richard Sharpe is a Redcoat with the rank of private in the King's Army in India. The British, desperate for trade and Empire, wage war against the dastardly Muslim overlord, the Tippoo. Capitalizing on the native Hindu population's less-than-enthusiastic support of this outsider, a Scottish colonel obtains critical information about the defenses of the Tippoo's city-palace-fort, Seringapatam. Just before he is able to return to British lines with the vital news, Colonel McCandless is captured and thrown into the Tippoo's dungeons.At the same time, Sharpe dreams of escape, both from the dead-end life in the British army and also from the corrupt, brutal thumb of Sergeant Hakeswill. (Fans of Cornwell's other works will recognize Hakeswill's type -- a loathesome combination of hypocrisy, strength, and iron will, coupled with the small-yet-vital benefits of rank.) But some of Sharpe's superiors recognize that there is a spark in Sharpe that separates him from the rest of the soldiers, and Sharpe is charged with staging a desertion in an attempt to infiltrate the Tippoo's dungeons and learn what McCandless knows. A risky proposition, under the best of circumstances, but even more so with the Tippoo.For the Tippoo has two ways of dealing with those who displease him . . . like spies. First, he could put you in the hands of his \\"jetti,\\" the Hindu strongmen who kill prisoners with brutal feats of strength. Or, worse, the Tippoo could throw you to his tigers. A more horrifying end for an Englishman from the stews of London cannot be imagined.All this is set among the siege of Seringapatam, and Cornwell once again reminds us that he is second to none when it comes to writing a riveting, clear, concise battle scene. Tactics and strategy are as compelling as the chaos of the battlefield in Cornwell's hands, and this siege gives him plenty of opportunity to \\"have some fun\\" on the battlefield. Fortunately, Cornwell is equally in command of daily life in 1799 India, as his characters ring true as people of their time and cultures (even the Tippoo, who may be a villain, isn't all bad), and Cornwell describes the heat and beauty of the Indian landscape vividly.Hardly an epic, \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" is what Graham Greene might call an \\"entertainment.\\" This does not belittle or trivialize the work in any way -- a great book doesn't have to necessarily be \\"Great Literature.\\" Without a doubt, after \\"Sharpe's Tiger,\\" I'm going to be diving into all of Sharpe's exploits as soon as possible. Check it out."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I have heard of this series, and have watched bits and pieces of the BBC programs based on the books but finally I decided to try this - the first book chronologically in the series. I have also heard a lot about the author. Let me say that just after reading the first chapter, I am hooked. My throat feels parched from the long grueling march in the Indian desert and already I am wary of vultures, who come to pick at bodies who died both by combat and also disease and misfortune. Already I look forward to the panic of battle to ease the weariness of the long, hard march. My mind turns to the spoils of war and the looting that is promised thru victory.The characters here are razor sharp defined (aha a pun! and stand out very clearly in my mind. The action is tense and extremely well depicted. The minutiae of life as a British foot-soldier in India serves to place the reader there. Its amazing how Cornwell can deliver a fully flushed out character in such a short amount of time - take the vile Sgt. Hakeswill - just a few pages in and I despise him as much as Sharpe and his men do.The book opens with Private Richard Sharpe considering his options. To stay in the army, or to run and seek his fortune in India. I gather from the series that he will eventually become the famed or infamous Sgt Sharpe but I think that is in books to come. This book was written as a sort of prequel and everyone seems to agree its ok to start with this one. Cornwell seems to strike a good balance in the background of the battles and politics - enough so you understand the role of the British, the French and the Indians but not so much to bore the reader or slow down the pace of the book. There is a scene in the first chapter, the British are preparing for the charge of the Sultan's army, and just then the author cuts to a scene of the Sultan on the ridge above the battle with his French military advisor. My first thought was ahhh get back to the battle - but this scene was just long enough to give us an idea of what \\"the enemy\\" is thinking and planning - and then back to the battle and it is short and bloody and not very full of honor. I give very few 5 stars - if this is your sort of thing - what are you waiting for?The battle for India awaits."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series of historical fiction traces the adventures of Richard Sharpe through India and Europe through the Napoleonic wars. Sharpe begins life as an orphan of a prostitute and joins the army as a private to avoid a worse fate. Over the course of 24 novels and short stories, we follow his adventures, promotions, successes and failures. We also gain a ground-level perspective on the Napoleonic wars and insight into the life of a 19th century soldier through a compelling and gripping character.Sharpe's Tiger is the first in the series historically, and is probably my favorite thus far. It did an amazing job of making the life of a British soldier in India in 1799 real to me. Written as a prequel to provide background on Richard Sharpe during his time in India, it ends up being one of the more vivid and memorable of the novels.Sharpe is a private in the occupying British army in Mysore, India. He ends up with a mission to infiltrate Seringapatam where he ends up prisoner. He ends up encountering colorful characters such as the Tipu Sultan and Colonel Arthur Wellesley who will be important throughout this series of historical fiction.I'd recommend this novel to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction. Just be careful as it is easy to get hooked and end up reading the next 23 books in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Cornwell's \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" is a great book. I couldn't put it down. Its bad guys aren't all bad, and the good guys aren't all good - and you're never quite sure where the main character (Sharpe) falls in that spectrum.Lots of action, descriptive narrative, be sure you get more than just the first of these books, since as soon as you finish this one, you're going to jump right back on Amazon and order the rest of the series!! (like I did)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I really liked this book as Cornwell seems to present blunt and realistic descriptions of life of the average enlisted man. A really good read. Take this book to the airport and you wont worry how delayed your flight is."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"The character of Richard Sharpe was first introduced to readers in 1981 through the wonderful novel, Sharpe's Eagle. That excellent book recounts the exploits of Sharpe and his squad of \\"Chosen Men\\" during the Battle of Talavera in Spain 1809. In the years since, Cornwell has written more than 20 Sharpe novels to great acclaim. With Sharpe's Tiger he has created a worthy place to begin a wonderful journey with Sharpe. This book introduces us to Sharpe at the very beginning of his life in the British Army of the early 1800s. In this book Sharpe is not a brash lieutenant trying to prove that he belongs as a commoner among the aristocratic ranks of British officers. Here he is a simple private trying to survive a sometimes boring, sometimes deadly mission to expand and bring order to Britain's holdings in India while fighting powerful native forces. Unforgettable characters we will see in later books (The evil Obadiah Hakeswill; the honorable Hector McCandless; the naive but brave William Lawford; and of course, Arthur Wellesley, who will become Wellington) are introduced for the first time here as we learn how Sharpe became the man that captured an eagle at Talavera and rose from the ranks to become a famous British officer. Read this book if you like adventurous historical fiction with great characters and interesting settings. I guarantee you will want to read the whole series by the time you finish three chapters."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This is the first Sharpe series book that I read, and it won't be the last -- I plan to follow the series in chronological order (although that's not the order in which Cornwell wrote them).Richard Sharpe is an infantry grunt who joined the British army to avoid jail for his crimes. Beaten down by his sergeant, trudging through southern India in England's ubiquitous (woolen) redcoat, he first considers fleeing the army but is soon framed for a whipping after encountering his first firefight. Events and a sympathetic officer contrive to launch Sharpe into a spy mission to rescue a British officer who is in the custody of the Tippoo of Mysore -- the man whose kingdom the British are trying to topple in order to control southern India and who has planned a surprise for the British for their impending attack on his fortress.Cornwell keeps the action flowing, uses his viewpoint characters well and has vast knowledge of both his general historical subject as well as the tactics, arms and daily life of the British army in the Napoleonic era. Sharpe is a common soldier with a strong will to survive and an appreciation of loyalty and bravery, not a super-heroic James Bond with old weapons. And Cornwell doesn't pull his punches regarding the darker aspects of British imperialism. This is accessible writing that flows, unlike other historical novelists who write with an eye for the arcane. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I've been hearing about the Sharpe Series for years now and on an impulse the other week I picked up \\"Sharpe's Tiger,\\" chronologically the first book in the series but not the first one written. I'm really pleased that I did.After a somewhat slow start, the book gains momentum and it's full speed ahead through to its thrilling finale. Sharpe is one of those characters that appeals to both men and women - he's a swashbuckling action hero with a sexy sort of charm. The novel is steeped in vivid depictions of battle, historical milieu, and a colorful cast of characters that includes one of the most dastardly villains I've come across in several years. Certainly not for the faint of heart, Cornwell's descriptions of battle carnage are brutal.I look forward to picking up the next installment. Great summer reading!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This was my first experience with Bernard Cornwell, and I was most satisfied! Sharpe's Tiger is the first chronologically in the career of Richard Sharpe. He is a private in the British army and the action takes place in India around 1799. Cornwell is a good writer, and the story is superb. There are shades of Indiana Jones, as Sharpe is a resourceful and immensely likeable hero. There is adventure, suspense and superb characterizations. It was one of the most fun books I have read in a while, and I can't wait to read the next installment. Highly recommended for anyone who likes history or adventure."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Sharpe's Tiger moves along at a cracking pace and captures the life of times of soldiers in that era very well.

This one was as consistently good as the rest of the series. I recommend all the Sharpe books.

But they are incredible mind-candy and difficult to put down. There's also a heck of a lot of them, and given that they weren't written in a chronology synchronous with the chronology of Sharpe's exploits, it takes a little running around to read them in order.Having begun with Sharpe's Tiger, it seems to me to be the best place to start - introducing the reader to Sharpe himself, the execrable Obadiah Hakeswill, Mr. Lawford, and Wellington. It is interesting to see how Cornwell starts to lose track of certain details as the novels skip around in time, but he's written so much that it is certainly hard to keep track of everything.I have a sneaking suspicion that Bernard Cornwell is another nom-de-plume for Stephen King, given the prolixity of his work and the none-too-subtle repetitive patterns of each book. I won't know for sure until Richard Sharpe comes out in favor of abortion and against nuclear energy. If the authors are one and the same, then Mr. King has found another way to extract my hard earned money.Anyway - great entertainment!

Not perfect (I doubt anyone associated with the British Army in 1800 would have to be instructed what a bucket in a cell was for), but a very well crafted novel.My kid is mesmerized, and I am impressed all over again (read these 15 years ago) by the novel and astonished at how much more I get out of an audiobook than reading the same thing. Hearing it is a richer experience, you have more time to make associations, more dimensions of input in tone and accent to build the illusion upon.I highly recommend this audiobook.I had listened to one of Cornwell's \\"Captain Aubrey\\" stories a few months ago: different book, different reader.

Even so, as a private in the Light Company of the 33d Foot, he's only seen one armed engagement (a few shots fired in the fog in Flanders) and now, marching across southern India to take part in the British assault on the walled capital city of Tippoo Sultan, he's thinking seriously about deserting. It's 1799 and Britain is consolidating its first real hold in India. Napoleon is pinned down on the Nile and the few French troops acting as advisors and allies to the Sultan don't have much hope even of survival, much less success. Sharpe has more personal problems, in the form of the venal Sgt. Hakeswill, who is determined to remove Sharpe permanently and an incompetent major who fears Hakeswill. The machinations of the two result in Sharpe being flogged, but he's pulled out of his punishment before it kills him by Col. Arthur Wellesley, assistant commander of the army, who requires his services as an infiltrator and spy. It's a complex plot but Cornwell tells it all very adroitly, and with a minimum of literary invention (true military history being often more dramatic than fiction), and the reader will be drawn deeply into an exciting and entirely believable story, at the end of which Sharpe will have sewn stripes on his sleeve, aided greatly in the capture of the city, and earned the respect of a young officer. Chronologically, this is the first Sharpe novel in the series and if you want to follow our hero's career properly, this is where you should start."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"It's 1799 in India, and Sharpe is 22, a private and thinking of deserting. His arch enemy, Hakeswill, is making his life a misery, and he is bored of the army routine of \\"hurry up and do nothing\\". Provoked into striking Hakeswill, Sharpe is flogged. After only part of the sentence is carried out, he's then offered a special assignment. From then on we are taken on a fast and furious action-packed ride based around the Siege of Seringapatam, with Sharpe joining Lieutenant Lawson on a mission to infiltrate the enemy to seek information and free Lawson's uncle who has been captured by the Tippoo.Cornwall makes no effort to gloss over the privations and unfairness of army life, particularly for the rank and file, and spares no detail of the blood and gore of the events leading up to the siege and the final battle itself. Chronologically, this is the first episode of the Sharpe saga, and is based on real-life events, and the author openly acknowledges where he has altered proceedings giving as his reason \\"... fictional heroes must be given suitable employment\\".This is a well-written and researched book, with loads of local colour and much 19th Century cant to evoke the atmosphere of the times. Its fast paced action gets you hooked into the storyline right from the first page, and I found myself unable to put it down. Admittedly, Sharpe's attitude towards women is definitely not PC, but does reflect both his character and the prevailing attitudes of the times, and we are provided with some glimpses of his softer side.If you're looking for a pacey adventure based on historical fact, then I recommend \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" as a great introduction into an engrossing series.

Cornwell has a chapter in the back of each book that tells you what part of the book is historical fact and what part he inserted his characters in.

Wonderful characters, great history, compelling action, and all-in-all one of my all time favorite authors.

The rest you have to read, i don't want to spoil the plot, just know its a great read from a great author.This is the first of a series of books set in India (Tiger, Triumph, and Fortress) all of which are fantastic.

The book begins with Richard Sharpe as a private in the British Army in India preparing to march on Seringapatam, to do battle with the Tipoo Sultan. The imagery is classic Cornwell. The brutality and the fascination of war are vividly portrayed. His command of the actual history is excellent as the reader will appreciate from the post-script and his characters have been injected into actual historical events with remarkable skill. Here the reader will meet the young Arthur Wellesly (he who will one day vanquish Napoleon as the Duke of Wellington) and other historical figures. Some actual historical details remain murky and Cornwall's sheer audacity in assigning to Sharpe a pivotal role in the conclusion of the siege (I wont reveal the specifics) deserves as crisp a salute as do Sharpe's fictional exploits on the field of battle."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This was a wonderful book that I enjoyed a great deal!

I am not a fan of multiple formula novels churned out by lazy writers, and I was suspicious of this series.But Cornwell has done something different here. He has taken real events, from the career of Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). Then he has inserted the character of Richard Sharp, a canny ex-thief ranker in the British Infantry. One of the men Wellington was to describe as &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot; after Badajoz. From the viewpoint of Sharpe we see the business end of the British Army, a worms eye view of the rise of Wellesley and the Indian and Peninsular campaigns.What you are getting is real history fleshed out with a cracking good story.

I am new to the series, but if the first three books are any indication (The India Trilogy), I will read them all.The author, Cornwell, is a perfect blend of great storyteller and excellent writer. Cornwell's discription of the siege of Seringapatum is beautifully rendered. The reader can feel the heat and exaustion, hear the swish of saber and whine of bullets. Often, in books that deal with military history, the reader may find himself slightly confused as to troops movements and tactics, but not here. Cornell is such a fantastic action writer, that it is all crystal clear. The reader can sense the flow of action, picture the battlefield perfectly, and understand the reasons behind the decisions; and all without hampering the surge of action.The characters in the novel are particularily well drawn. This is a story with great villians and enemies. Especially enjoyable is Sharpe's nemisis in the novel, the horrid Obadiah Hakewill, Sharpe's sadistic sargent. I also like the author's portrait of The Tippoo Sultan. while it would be hard to call it a sympathetic portrait, Cornwell takes pains to write this enemy in truthful, fascinating strokes.Just a great piece of work and one of the few books I have read lately that have kept me up all night reading. Onward, Mister Sharpe!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Just finished the Kindle edition. I was saddened to see a good author's craft ruined by truly horrible editing. The publisher screwed this one up so bad it was painful to read. The book is full of errors that should have been caught in the most superficial edit. I suppose that PerfectBound and Harper Collins simply scanned a printed copy of the book, pushed the electronic result through a spell checker, and published it. There are fifteen places where the scanner obviously misread \\"the\\" and got \\"die\\". Because of the lack of an edit, that's how it was published. And that's only one example.Publishers have a duty to their authors and readers to faithfully reproduce the author's work. When they fail the author loses fans and, presumably, money. To have to pay ten dollars for a book that looks like it cost almost nothing to publish reflects on the greed of the publisher."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"Whether you're a longtime fan of Sharpe, or a newcomer, this s excellent story is as good as any in the long-running series. Longtime fans will love to finally get the details on some of the longstanding background material (Sharpe's infamous lashing, the Sultan Tippoo's jewels, Lt. Lawford's teaching him to read, etc.), while newcomers will find themselves at the chronological start of the series. Set in 1799, the book finds Sharpe a lowly private serving in Mysore in Southern India, as the 33rd Rifles are part of a large force seeking to destroy the Muslim ruler of Mysore. Cornwell does his usual masterful job of showing the unpleasant life of a common soldier on the march in a scorching distant land. It is a life so unpleasant, and rife with injustice (most of it at the hands of Sharpe's longtime psychopathic nemesis, Sgt. Hakeswill and the pliant and corrupt drunk Captain Morris), that Sharpe is weighing the pros and cons of deserting.The first half of the book establishes all this, as well as Sharpe's romantic relationship with a half-caste woman (one of the main points of contention between he and Hakeswill), and as well as the larger background. The Sultan's army is melting backward to hole up in the island fortress of Seringpetang, where they hope to hold out until the monsoon season forces the British to retire from the field. However, there is intrigue afoot, as a French advisor to the Sultan whispers encouraging words from Napoleon (then in Egypt), while a top Hindu advisor is the subject of the advances of a British spy. The British spy learns news of vital importance, if the fortress is to be conquered, but is thrown in jail before he can get the news out.Meanwhile, Sharpe has been suckered into an act of insubordination which seems certain to doom him. Fortunately, his fair-minded superior Lt. Lawford insists on Sharpe accompanying him on a suicide mission to rescue the spy. The second half of the book is this James Bondish mission, as the duo make their way to Seringpetang in the guise of deserters, and join the Sultan's unit of European mercenaries. From there, there's lots of tension, as Sharpe and Lawford try and maintain their disguise while proving themselves and trying to locate and free the spy. The book climaxes with the British assault on the fortress, as Sharpe and Lawford try and get the critical information out the the British in time.It's all great stuff, and Cornwell has such command of his material and characters that it just flows smoothly. That's perhaps part of the advantage of writing the books out of chronological sequence, he knows the characters so well that everything feels pitch-perfect. Sharpe is, well... Sharpe. Gritty, angry, crafty, and brutal. Hakeswill is menacing and madly violent. Col. Wellesley (later Duke Wellington of Waterloo fame) is priggish, snippy, and cold. The Sultan is cruel, and yet brave. Based on historical events, the book is packed with intrigue, action, a vivid setting, and is a great adventure."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This is the first Sharpe novel I've read and what a mistake it was to wait so long. My general avoidance of fiction, especially of the serial nature, caused me to foolishly ignore this series. Sharpe's Tiger was a mixed blessing: Yes, I loved the book, but as another reviewer warned, I am now addicted. Thankfully, I picked the right book to start with, this being the first chronologically in Sharpe's military career.Now, rather than go into detail about the plot and characters (which have been adequately covered in other reviews) I wanted to underscore how impressed I am with the historical accuracy. Cornwell has been first rate in his attention to detail and in describing the conditions of military life in the British Army of the period, even in drawing distinctions between regular army regiments and those of the British East India Company.But even more impressive is the amount of research that must have gone into writing such a novel. With historical fiction you always have people such as myself looking for errors and making pedantic statements like, &quot;But the 52nd Regiment of Foot was never involved in the attack on Java&quot;. But Sharpe's Tiger, and presumably the rest of the series, is meticulously researched. Probably not one person in 10,000 has heard of the battle of Mallavelly (the only reference I have found is in Vol.4 of Fortescue's History of the British Army which is, sadly, long ago out-of-print) yet Cornwell presents a robust picture of this engagement.Being particularly interested in the Peninsular War (the setting for many of the other Sharpe adventures), I was elated to finally discovered what so many fans of Cornwell had known for a long time: The Sharpe series, like Hornblower, is sure to be a classic of this genre."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"This first series installment introduces us to protagonist Richard Sharpe, an orphan from the gutter whose only shot in life is as a lowly private in the British Army, and whose only real skill is fighting. Sharpe does have related skills and virtues - honesty, wit, courage, initiative and resourcefulness among them - which is why the time spent with him in each book is so enjoyable.Sharpe reports to the diabolical Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill, who exists primarily to cheat and scheme money out of his subordinates, and secondarily to torment them for sheer enjoyment. Hakeswill lusts for Sharpe's girlfriend and wants to sell her to a brothel owner, and so trumps up a scheme to have him flogged to death.But Sharpe is saved when he gets tapped to accompany an officer on a dangerous mission: finding a high-ranking British spy who has reconnoitered the defenses of Seringapatam. This is the stronghold of the fabulously wealthy Tippoo Sultan, the main obstacle to British rule of southern India.Sharpe and Lt. Bill Lawford, good-hearted but nave, find themselves swapping roles across class lines as they work their way towards the imprisoned Colonel McCandless, impersonating British deserters. Sharpe has more street smarts and finds himself in the unusual position of giving an officer orders.All Cornwell's distinctive touches are found here - the luxury and misery of India, the fabulous wealth and huge harems of the powerful, the dreary lives of the British rank-and-file, and the exquisite tortures meted out by cruel rulers, who might have prisoners torn apart by sadistic musclemen or fearsome tigers. Cornwell pays meticulous attention to 19th century siege warfare.In some ways he is even more compelling a character than Patrick O'Brian's Jack Aubrey: Aubrey, from gentry, has some natural allies, but Sharpe's natural state in life is alone, back to the wall, with no allies but the converts he makes as he serves side by side with them. Sharpe's ingenious but totally plausible improvisations allow him to, whatever the day is, seize it. The Sharpe books are delightful."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"It never ceases to amaze me how a story so full of historical detail can be so consistently entertaining. 'Sharpe's Tiger' has the series' protaganist, Richard Sharpe, serving as a lowly private in India in 1799 and infiltrating the stronghold of the Tipoo Sultan before the arrival of the British army. Many factors contribute to Cornwell's remarkable novel, but the one that stands out is the character of Obidah Hakeswill, an antagonist so loathsome he is sure to go down as one of the great literary villans of all time."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"...because that's the highest the counter allows. If not, I'd give it a 20. My introduction to Richard Sharpe, the character came through the TV movies aired here on PBS. My introduction to Mr. Cornwell's books came through this novel. Last spring, while at Gatwick Airport, I saw the hardcover displayed in a bookstore. Facing an 8 hour flight watching movies I'd already seen and disliked I decided &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot; was the better investment of time. It certainly was. Since then, I've read all of the Sharpe novels. I am always impressed, and as a novelist myself, more than a little envious of Mr. Cornwell's gifts. He melds fascinating historical details with blood and thunder adventure featuring a flawed, yet undeniably heroic protagonist. In this particular genre, Mr. Cornwell has no peers. I'm hooked on &quot;Sharpie&quot; for life."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I have read the Warlord Chronicles and the first of the Grail Quest series and found both of them fantastic fast-paced fun. Bernard Cornwell is absolutely brilliant at writing historical fiction that has both gripping story lines and breathtaking action. He is a master at changing tone at a moment's notice, giving plenty of time for the odd piece of romance or comedy whilst never getting bogged down and deviating too much from the important bits.In Sharpe's Tiger, chronologically the first of the score of Sharpe novels, Cornwell has our hero a dashing, raw recruit of the 33rd regiment in India. At the island fortress of Seringapatam, the Tippoo, enemy of the British, is holed up plotting an alliance with the French to remove the British from his lands forever. When a senior British officer is captured, Sharpe is given the task of saving him, as a way out of the huge number of lashes he has just been given as punishment for striking an officer. The sentence is the result of the utterly odious Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill's incessant victimisation of the soldiers beneath him - Sharpe being his least favourite.And there the fun begins. Firstly the infiltration of the fort, then the discovery of the captured officer and then the escape. Except Sharpe cannot do anything the easy way. In fact the beauty is that he seems to go out of his way to find the trickiest route, causing as much mayhem as he does it. It is a credit to Cornwell that Sharpe never suspends belief for the sake of more amazing thrills. Everything he allows Sharpe to do is possible and in some instances, probably rather close to a re-enactment of some courageous derring-do of a real-life British soldier 200 years ago or so. It is the adroitness of Cornwell's writing that he manages to carry this off with such aplomb. If you like this sort of thing, then I think it safe to say there is no better than Mr. Bernard Cornwell.And now onto Sharpe's Triumph (I am doing them in chronological order, you see, I believe that to be the best way.)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"After having read the Starbuck serie (Civil War) fromB.

I don't get it -- I read Cornwell's Agincourt right before this book, and they're almost identical books. Pretty much the same characters in the same situtation -- just 300 years apart. The same lead character, the same female companion, the same strong leader, the same completely evil villian.....it really lacks creativity for me. The good are completely good, and the evil are completely evil -- I've seen more balanced characters in a Steven King novel. On top of that, the coincidences in this book are outrageous. How many times can the hero and the villian happen to accidently run into each other all over India?I enjoy learning about the British army and their battles in India, but the writing seems very lazy and schlocky to me."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I must admit that I love Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. The characters are always memorable, the story interesting(and based partly on fact), and the battle scenes very exciting. This isn't the first Sharpe book I've read, but it's the first in chronological order, and that made it even more of a pleasure to read. Richard Sharpe is only a private in his early 20's in this one, and his tough but likable personality and incredible bravery are fully intact, so you'll be cheering for Sharpe in no time. Obadiah Hakeswill, Sharpe's nastiest enemy, and one of Cornwell's best characters, plays a significant role in this book which makes it even more interesting. Just like the other Sharpe novels, as soon as you finish it you'll immediately want to read the next one. So be warned: Sharpe becomes an addiction very quickly.

However, I read Sharpe's Tiger and was blown away. I quickly burned through his Indian campaign and read Trafalgar. And I must say it was quite an introduction.

It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of the Tipoo Sultan, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides a more serious account of the Tipoo life and character is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander.

There is also a large bit of sneaking around the enemies lines and Sharpe must even pretend to be a traitor to his country. This book is jam packed with excitment, intrigue, and fun.

Richard Sharpe is young, scared, in India and has to do what is called &quot;dessert&quot; his own regiment to infiltrate the Sultan's domain to get information for the English army so that they can overcome the Sultan and have a victory that is well executed and well planned. Most of the English believe that Sharpe has turned traitor so that he can penetrate the domain of the Sultan who does have tigers in the city and Sharpe does have his mooments with the Tigers, and he has his moments where he is taught to read in prison with the bible, and taught to love a woman who is another mans wife, who he gives some of the sultans illegal jewels. He learns that he can be used as a man to get the job done in a fight, and he learns that he can be used as a pawn and he learns that he can learn to survive on his own if he has to and not to rely on the army if he gets himself in situations that he cannot handle. We see the boy who is the ruffian and a child of the gutter come to life, we see the boy become a man, and we again see the brilliant writing of Bernard Cornwell who has thrilled millions with the stories of Richard Sharpe! I look forward to his next book and hope if you are a fan of Sharpe that you will read this volume. The character of Richard Sharpe becomes more of a man than the child that he was who joined the British Army to overcome poverty and a penniless existence, its the story of a character who learns to read the bible and makes a friend of the officer who teaches him to read it, its the man against the tiger, and the tiger loses. Its the man who takes gold and jewels to survive and better himself its the story of a beloved character by Bernard Cornwell as a young man, who develops into the Colonel who defeats Napolean at Waterloo its the story of Richard Sharpe who came out of the gutter and became an officer and a leader of men, its the story of a man who will rise in the ranks to be an officer and a &quot;sometimes&quot; gentleman.

In this one, we meet Richard Sharpe as he is on his first real campaign as a soldier. He is a Private and is involved with the conquest of India. This book is obviously intended for young teen male readers as it is heavy on the military arts, combat, explosions, and adventures and is very light on the romance side. Sex is abundant, but is handled in a very discreet way without much explanation as something that just takes place and is not really discussed.We are introduced to our hero and find out that he is being picked upon because one of the women who accompany the army on its march is his, but the wicked Sergeant of his company lusts after her and is trying to find ways to discredit Sharpe and take over his woman. The book is full of stereotypes which include, in addition to the crazy Sergeant; the drunken officers; the gallant but rough-edged enlisted men; the gentlemanly enemy officer; and many more.The novel's plot is also quite straightforward and after the first chapter or so, you can predict pretty much exactly what will happen. By the end, Sharpe is the hero and gets promoted (in two armies no less!); he shows up his officers as being vastly superior to them; and manages to be in the midst of all the important action without really being even scraped.Another way in which you can tell that this is a novel for young readers is the pacing. Sharpe becomes a deserter, and within four days is inducted into the opposing army, manages to become a hero in that one and gets a medal and a promotion. Three days later he completely turns around the situation in favor of the British and is promoted again while managing to kill tigers; strongmen; soldiers; and even some high ranking officers and officials. All of this while being tutored on how to read; made a confidant of Generals and Colonels; and catching the eye and attention of many high ranking officers. Wow.In all, I do not want you to get the impression that this is a bad book. It is not since it is aimed at a very specific audience. For those readers this book will be very captivating. The pacing is quick, the adventures interesting, and the resolution of everything within the 380 pages of the book seem plausible enough. The writing is highly competent and while the characters do not really develop in any sensible way through the course of the book, that will likely not be noticed by the intended audience. I would certainly recommend it to the same age of teen readers who enjoy reading Alexander Kent, or the Hornblower series as this series is the same idea, just taking place on land."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Tiger : Richard Sharpe and the Siege of Seringapatam, 1799 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #1)","review":"I recently read this book and it was amazing.From start to finish i never got bored.

And reasonably light going. And therein lies its strength; Mr Hickman does not take himself too seriously and he has a sense of humour. This makes him readable and human - I am far from being a tree-hugging eco-warrior (as I'm sure you've guessed) but I found that his explanations were quite reasoned. He admits to failures (he is unwilling to wash his wife's reusable tampons) but he is willing, and gives most things a try.He admits that his wormery is not a success and that giving up television is not easy and not fun at all. He does do an eco holiday though, and enjoys it.Good on you, Leo! I like your failures. And I like your humanity."},{"Title":"A Life Stripped Bare: Tiptoeing Through the Ethical Minefield","review":"This is a great introduction to ethical living. It is easy to read and very amusing.

Well worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"A Life Stripped Bare: Tiptoeing Through the Ethical Minefield","review":"Calling this book \\"A Life Stripped Bare\\" is an insult to the hundreds of thousands of people who lost literally everything to natural disasters in 2005.This is a pop media journalist's narration of his own bland foray into \\"living ethically.\\" There is not a single suggestion in the book that any moderately environmentally-aware person has not heard a dozen times; buy organic, local food; try to get rid of your car; don't eat meat; avoid chemicals.

It is a fascinating insight into the thinking and values systems that shaped our country in its early days. I don't think I ever really understood how the religious values of the early New Englanders led to many of the principles our country was built on. To those who have trouble understanding why the early leaders of our country were so compelled to sacrifice so much to create a new and independent country here in America, this is the answer. Why John and Abigail Adams were willing to sacrifice almost their entire married life and the rearing of their children for these principles, one can only understand upon reading this book. These were not men set upon a search for glory or power, but men with a vision that they believed in with all their souls. The unifying beliefs of the people led them to accomplish what the great minds of Europe felt was totally irrational and impossible. This book is an answer to a question many didn't know to ask."},{"Title":"B-25 Mitchell - Walk Around No. 12","review":"Excellent coverage of all B-25 variants.

It is a valuable addition to my library. The book is a good overall reference for the B-25 A through J aircraft, from prototype to J model."},{"Title":"B-25 Mitchell - Walk Around No. 12","review":"Author-illustrator Lou Drendel supplies an up-close-and-personal view of World War II's Mitchell bomber in this 1997 Squadron/Signal release. Few American bombers took on so many different missions and configurations than North American's versatile twin as borne out by this nicely-done 'Walk Around' entry.The B-25 served with the USAAF, USMC, RAF, RAAF and a host of other services. Likewise it evolved from a conventionally-armed medium bomber to a low-level strafer equipped with devastating combinations of .50-calibers, bpmbs, rockets and sometimes cannon. While Drendel covers all the various models, the emphasis is on the H model gunship and the J model bomber.The book features 80 pages of images: half b&w; half color. Almost all the b&w; photographs are vintage shots showing various B-25s in service. With one exception, all the color imges are of warbird models. I was somewhat surprised Drendel didn't use more wartime color shots. Don Greer contributes four pages of color profiles.If you're a bomber buff, B-25 WALK AROUND should appeal to you. It offers up lots of clear, well-captioned photos including many close-up detail shots of every aspect of the Mitchell airframe, engines, armament, etc. All in all, a colorful tribute to a colorful - and war-winning - aircraft! Recommended."},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"This is the most useful book I have ever owned. Where other self-help classics catch a piece of the internal puzzle, Sills somehow sees the greater picture. Most importantly, Sills understands that basic human truth-- that what we are is sometimes our greatest blessing and sometimes our greatest curse. The book offers understanding and practical advice for finding balance, rather than offering abstract notions for &quot;fixing&quot; some personality flaw. Buy this book and Scott Peck's The Road Not Taken, and you won't need any other self-help book in the store"},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"Judith Sills' astonishing EXCESS BAGGAGE will make you think the author has been spying on you. In describing the five major personality types, she provides such a wealth of detail that you'll find yourself gasping or whooping as you recognize yourself, your family members, friends and colleagues.Best of all, she provides real, concrete ways to \\"get out of your own way\\" and modify your behavior in a variety of situations. The lessons can be difficult (isn't change always hard?), but are well worth applying if you're interested in making fundamental changes.HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in learning more about themselves and others. The advice Sills offers comes from years of counseling experience, and is provided in a nonsensical, easily understood way that maximizes your chances of putting these lessons to work in your own life."},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"The BEST self help book I have ever read.

More often than not we tend to paint an inaccurate picture of ourselves far removed from reality and that is the real stumbling factor in our way to be better humans. The more we understand the accurate pattern we all project to others and to ourselves, we better we will be in realizing the &quot;excess baggage&quot;, the emotional load we throw at others.I was pleasantly surprised at the way this book analyzes and portrays the human behavioural patterns. It has three simple steps to make you feel more worthy of living - identify the pattern you are protraying for yourself, identify the real you and make corrections to make them together. The author must have gone through rigorous research and observations before writing this book and made our tasks simpler to look at a mirror, of our own reflections. I initially got the book from the library but decided to own it for my own reference, and for others."},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"This book is by far the BEST, most enlightening self-help book I have ever read. After digesting its contents, I felt as if a veil were lifted from my eyes. Excess Baggage made me analyze my personality and discover how to identify self-imposed burdens and stop making myself and my loved ones crazy! The theme woven throughout its pages is that we all trip over our own personalities and unconsciously make life harder than it has to be. It probes the reader by presenting an array of specific personality profiles along with their baggage. For example: being a perfectionist is an asset in the career arena, but the strong inner drive to have everything go just perfectly is a liability in social settings. The natural, unconscious tendency is to try to control ALL variables in life, which creates rigidity and grates on the nerves of the people in our lives. Dr. Judith Sills hits the nail on the head with this doctrinal truth: our greatest weaknesses are always the flip side our our greatest strengths. But Excess Baggage is not just a diagnostic manual -- it is the prescription for recovery! Practical and very detailed exercises are outlined to teach the perfectionist how to &quot;let go,&quot; the worrier to take risks, the intensely emotional to tone down, the angry to replace his core with love, and so on. Studying this book and applying Dr. Sills' advice has been the most liberating event of my adult life. This new awareness and the changes it has produced make me feel like, in the words of the author, I have &quot;taken off a pair of shoes two sizes too small&quot;! Excess Baggage should be in the library of every person interested in improving the very essence of his being"},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"I have read many self help books, but none so thorough and dead-on as this one! Most self help books may only offer one or two major insights, but there was one on almost every page in this book. It is a quick read with little psychology lingo to stumble over, but you will be amazed st how much of yourself you see in this book. I felt like it was written just for me, and yet I was also able to recognize the personality types of my parents, spouse, child, mother in law, etc. and it filled in the blanks on many, many things about their behavior. I literally found myself taking notes from this book, there was so much great info that I didn't want to forget any! I checked this out from the library, but I will be buying it soon. If there was one thing I wish the author would have added, it would be a few pages on how others might (constructively) deal w/each personality type, but that is a very minor comment because the book is so great overall. I will read anything else this author publishes, her observations are so astute!"},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"I was not expecting to find such an accurate description of myself in this book, but as I read on I did and I was amazed at how Stills hit the mark dead on. I pondered her assessment of my behavior and her suggestions on fixing things for days. I've also used the book to help understand other people. Self-help books are meant to bring about a stronger sense of self-awareness and if you're reading this and need a tool to help you start finding out who you are, READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"This book is awful. It's extremely superficial. Sills basically takes all human behavior, crams it into one of six rigid categories, and then spends the entire book describing each category, one by one, with a token bit of advice at the end of each description. She does not go into any real detail about any of them, and I found myself thinking that I could be every single one of them. This is sort of the psychologist's version of reading a horoscope. She also reads the book herself, and has obviously gone to the Overly Dramatic School of Reading. Lots of annoying drama and schtick. It's like being locked in an elevator with your overbearing Jewish aunt. Finally, she has a slight lisp, which over time, will drive you up the wall."},{"Title":"Excess Baggage: Getting out of Your Own Way","review":"Well, if you are able to be objective, it can.

It is one of the most eye-opening self help books ever. To realize that you really are 'text-book' is shocking. My best friend agreed with most of what was said about my type, something she has always known, but never told me. It's okay, I probably wouldn't have taken it well anyway, if she did.

Let me tell you...I saw myself in EVERY chapter! There were parts that wasn't me, but a bit here and there. When I got to the chapter on Rage, I decided before reading it that it wouldn't fit me at all, but I would read it anyway...boy was I surprised! As I read it, I started seeing people from my past who had hurt me, or wronged me, and I began to feel the emotions popping up...I am just now starting my letters to get rid of the rage I was so sure I didn't have. And then I will start to work on the other items I identified with in the book.

Depicts and explains the homophobic image of homosexuals as a small, self-interested group, favoring their own, commanding a disproportionate world influence. Relates homophobia to other oppressed groups, including Jews as self-interested and cliquish, and African American males as sexual predators.

The diet has nothing to do with Greek food. The author is Greek, so there is the connection. In a nutshell, he lost his weight by going on a liquid fast. The author is also a doctor, so he should know better than to promote fasting as a way to lose weight. Most physicians will advise you not to fast to lose weight. The author also advises you to drink diet soda. This is bad advice on several points. First being with the proliferation of diet sodas since the 1980s, the obesity rate in the US skyrocketed. Also, as a physician he should be fully aware of the dangers of aspartame. If you want to be inspired to lose weight, then you will enjoy reading this book. But don't fast to lose weight.

However, the book came across to me as an attempt to appeal to the masses and sort of put the credit to God on the back burner or off to the side or in the shadows and I can't be as inspired by that as a christian or for that matter, before my salvation. I did learn some great insights from Dr. Nick but I am a believer in the power of God to do everything and that just didn't come accross in this book. So with regret I say this book is a testament to Dr. Nicks' great triumph over the \\"Idolotry\\" of food as he said in his interview, but it just didn't get me to go along. I hope he will in the future let his faith be more prominent in his story telling and trust in our Lord for the results more than his publisher.

I enjoyed his humourous accounts but also cried at the pain he felt for his suffering, his feelings of humiliation during his earlier years. I loved every minute of reading this and all the personal photos he shared. I think it's amazing that he also answered several of my emails personally.

I have to admit that the title grabbed me right away; in particular the words fat and diet. I am a sucker for diet books and have read too many to name here but this book truly offers something new, fresh, and inspiring. As I read about Dr. Nick's life, I felt as if I was listening to an old friend share his struggles and knew instantly this was a man who could relate to my weight challenges. The guts of the book revolve around his 7 pillars of weight loss. This is where the magic begins but what he has to offer isn't in a pill, potion or even a particular diet. It is a unique thought process, a paradigm shift that is more valuable than anything that can be found in a bottle. Maybe some of you veteran dieters can relate but I was pretty good at following a plan for a few months and losing the weight but then I would turn around and gain it right back and then some! Let's face it, all the diets take the weight off but this plan actually gives you the tools you need to keep it off for good, to lose those pounds and not find them ever again! I define success as doing 100% of what you are capable of and this book gives you the resources to be a healthy success. If you are open to changing the way you see the world and in the process, changing the way you look in it, you will not be disappointed.

People want to know how my life has changed since this this miracle of weight loss -- the natural way! -- took place.I like to tell them just to read my book \\"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb\\" (shameless plug, shameless plug!) to find out the details, but I tell people there are others out there who have lost even MORE weight than I have with unbelievable success stories to tell as well.One such story is that of Dr. Nick Yphantides. Don't ask me to pronounce his last name because I haven't got a clue (LOL!). I think I'll just refer to him as Dr. Nick for the remainder of this review thank you very much. And that's okay with him, too! :)While I weighed 410 pounds when I started livin' la vida low-carb to lose weight on January 1, 2004, Dr. Nick weighed 467 pounds when he literally began his weight loss journey on March 31, 2001. His weight loss story was indeed a LITERAL journey because he decided to take a one-year sabbatical from his job as a medical doctor and travel around the United States to all of the major league baseball stadiums to keep his mind occupied with something he enjoyed while he went through his weight loss plan.Needless to say, losing 270 pounds without the use of drugs or surgery is reason enough to write a book about it. In fact, Dr. Nick says he doesn't know anyone else who has lost as much weight naturally as he did and was even invited to speak on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. to share his insights on nutrition and weight loss with a Congressional committee.The ideas he shared with those Congressmen became the groundwork for his book entitled My Big Fat Greek Diet. Just as my \\"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb\\" title is a play on words with a popular mainstream music hit by Ricky Martin, Dr. Nick took the name of a blockbuster movie to create his unique title.But once you get past the title of the book and you start reading about this former morbidly obese doctor's incredible and miraculous transformation, you WILL be inspired to lose weight yourself. You can tell Dr. Nick has a deep heartfelt desire now to help others reach the same weight loss success that he did as evidenced by this quote from the end of the Introduction to his book.\\"If you don't have your health, you don't have anything. Being overweight or obese is unhealthy, and it will take years off your life span. Please, please do something while there's still time. You won't regret it.\\"After you read about the pain and anguish that Dr. Nick went through from a humbling airplane incident to his brush with cancer, you will realize that this man of God truly desires the best for everyone who comes into contact with his story. He even decided to create a web site at HealthSteward.com to provide a support system for people who want and need to lose weight. Dr. Nick knows how hard it is and wants to help others find the success that he did.The first half of My Big Fat Greek Diet details what it was like living in the skin of an obese man and then overcoming that enormous weight problem forever.But in the second half of the book, Dr. Nick outlines his 7 Pillars Of Weight Loss And Maintenance that will be the foundation for people to apply to their own lives to create their own weight loss miracle. To bring about genuine and lasting weight loss, here are the seven things that Dr. Nick believes need to happen in YOUR life before weight loss can happen:1. Make your plan a permanent lifestyle change.2. Cut your calories down.3. Eat the right kinds of foods.4. Exercise often to burn excess calories.5. Create a fun distraction while losing weight.6. Allow others to keep you accountable.7. Continue on the plan to keep the weight off forever.While Dr. Nick came at his weight loss from an entirely different perspective and program than I did, I cannot disagree with most of those pillars of weight loss he created. Other than the cutting calories pillar, I can see compatibility with livin' la vida low-carb in those recommendations of his regardless of which method for weight loss you choose. You will have to read each of these incredible accompanying chapters to Dr. Nick's pillars to garner further insight into what he means with each one. And Dr. Nick throws in poignant examples from his own experience to drive home the point.Taking the issue of weight loss surgery head-on, Dr. Nick warns people about the inherent dangers of choosing the gastro-intestinal bypass surgery that has become so commonplace these days. While it has been an effective tool for many morbidly obese people, there are better options that he believes can help people without the risks involved with surgery. Speaking as a medical professional, Dr. Nick advises against weight loss surgery and urges his patients to only choose it as a \\"last resort.\\"WOW, what a GREAT book, Dr. Nick! My Big Fat Greek Diet certainly brought back a lot of memories for me as I so easily could relate to your suffering as an obese man on his way to an early grave. That was me, too!Praise God we were both able to overcome and find our way out before it was too late. I pray that this book will encourage people to look at themselves in a new way and realize that change needs to come. Let God give you the strength you need to get started the right way -- RIGHT AWAY! You will not be disappointed, I promise!THANK YOU, Dr. Nick for writing My Big Fat Greek Diet. You are a brother in Christ and a member of my weight loss brotherhood as well. It is an honor to have had the opportunity to read your book and I wish you continued success in maintaining your weight forever. May you and your beautiful new wife Despina find love and happiness for all the days of your life. God bless you, my friend!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I love this guy's story! Now we weren't nearly as heavy as this guy was, but it inspired us to realize that if he could do it then so could you! He was in a place that so many people are today with their weight. He was consuming way too many calories; thus, it was causing havoc on his health, and he knew he needed to do something about it before it caused him his life.We actually tried his diet and had split results. My husband was able to do very well on it. I, on the other hand, did not do so well. I didn't like mixing soda pop with the protein powder. I'm not much of a carbonated drinker and didn't care for it all that much. My husband is a big diet soda pop fan so he loved this diet!It is a great book and very inspirational. You will be so compelled reading this book that you will want to read it as fast as you can!We both recommend this book!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This book is very inspirational, whether you need to lose weight or not. It is a great read abd keeps your attention from beginning to end. Without being in-your-face about it, he makes it clear that faith and family are very important to him. He makes it clear that he had to take drastic measures, while outlining sensible plans that work for anyone."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This isn't a typical \\"diet\\" book, which I like. I've read enough diet books in my life to understand the basic concepts. Instead, this book chronicles one person's journey, including the heartache associated with being obese as well as the triumphs of losing signficant amounts of weight. It has been surprisingly motivational - I find myself thinking of the story throughout the day when I struggle with something, telling myself that if he did it, I can certainly do it too. I would definitely recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Having heard the author speak on a local radio station, I wanted to read this book. What a delightful surprise! It is very well written, exciting to read, and along the way you learn not only about the author's 250-pound loss in 8 months on a liquid 800 calorie-a-day diet, but his philosophy. You also learn about the shame that goes with being grossly overweight and the food addiction that so many suffer. Dr. Nick is a doctor in a health clinic in San Diego who after suffering testicular cancer and being cured, decides his weight problem requires taking a sabatical. After giving due notice, he takes a year away from his medical practice, and as a diversion attends baseball games all over the United States including the 2001 World Series. The book has plenty of documentation and photographs and when finished, I felt like I was a personal friend of his. I highly recommend this book whether you need to lose 10 pounds or 200 pounds. You will be inspired!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"wonderful book, easy reading, proves that all of us can do thngs to make ourselves better, without confusion or complications. I started to push myself back from the table, and I workout for one hour 5 days a week. I have had to put 4 new holes in my belt, and can comfortably wear pants and shirts that i could not 3 years ago. His book just reaffirms what we all know, but I a way that is truthful and direct. No lectures, just good stories from the heart. Buy it, read it, git it done, for yourself."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I've tried everything and I seem to gain instead of lose.Was giving up until I saw Nick's story on CNN.Bought the book and it is great!I need to lose alot of weight and I have a brother and his wife that are twice my size that I reccomended the book to.I'm in alot of pain 24/7 so I hope that this book and following his steps will help me.Thanks, Nick! You are an inspiration!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Dr. Nick's book is not a diet, but a heart-warming and inspirational story with a road map to a healthy life. Reading his story was a life-altering experience for me. Here was a man who had to step on two scales to register his own weight! A physician, Dr. Nick dug his heels in and set out to lose his excessive weight during a one-year sabbatical wherein he visited baseball parks accross the country. He survived on nothing but protein shakes and managed to take off over half of his weight! The book entertains the reader with his story during the first half, offering honest and sometimes heart-breaking details of his difficult journey. The second half of the book is devoted to instructing the reader on how he/she can attain the same success. It is not a quick-fix fad diet, but a sure-fire plan for living a healthy life, free of the toxins of obesity and over-eating. Dr. Nick is careful not to promote the use of ultra-low calorie diets and liquid diets to attain permanent success. He explains how we must change ourselves inside, before we can acquire and maintain the body we want on the outside. Once we resolve the problems that make us overeat, we will do not need a highly regimended meal plan to lose weight. Dr Nick's plan is the only sensible solution to obesity out there! I will never buy another fad diet book! God bless you, Dr. Nick."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I was so delighted when I read Dr. Nick's book. My 30+ years of battling food and fat have lead me down many paths of dieting and attitudes toward food. This book brought together the major principals I've embraced through the years: low-glycemic eating, paying attention to hunger/fullness, importance of exercise, the belief that gastric bypass is not the answer for me, and especially that the body is a gift from God--it's His temple. Dr. Nick is real. He's honest and candid in his book, which makes it entertaining; it reads very quickly. It's SO NICE to read a diet book written by someone who has been very large, not someone who lost 20 lbs. This book is very empowering, encouraging, and has changed my life."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Even though I love all things Dr. Phil, I could not get into his diet book, or watch him helping people diet on T.V. I think it's because for all his wanting to help, he hasn't been in that \\"Twilight Zone\\" of obesity where you know even if you lose 100 pounds you are still going to be obese!Dr. Nick on the other hand, has been there, after he lost 100 pounds, from the pictures, it's still hard to tell, only he knew what he had been through and how far he had to go. He addressed the reasons we eat, the demons as I call them. I have had gastric bypass, but still battle with the demons that made me overeat in the first place. He addressed those problems in a sensitive way that did not scare me off as Dr. Phil did with his more \\"In your face\\" attitude. I think fat people are sensitive as it is, and when someone gets into our face aggresiviely, well meaning or not, it makes us want to hide more of ourselves and eat more, reinforcing that we can't do it, it's too hard, and we are some kind of losers for not being able to overcome our problem. I felt that Dr. Nick spoke to me as a friend and by being there himself, it's easier to hear what he has to say, and more importantly, believe that it can be done.I read this book in one sitting, it is written in an easy style to read, he doesn't beat you over the head or talk down to you or make it sound like it is only a program that someone in special circumstances can be successful at. I am finding success with his kind words, and have recently signed up to be part of his Health Steward program for more kind words of encouragement from other people who are like me.If nothing else, I love reading books about people who have overcome impossible circumstances to great success. Against all odds sort of thing. This is one of those touching books that anyone could read and benefit from, not just the obese."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"THANKS FOR STARTING OFF WITH RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO FIX WHAT IS WRONG MENTALLY OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MIGHT BE LOST TO DISAPPOINTMENT. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HALF THE BATTLE IS THE BRAIN AND THE OTHER IS LACK OF MOTIVATION ON MY PART. NO YOU CAN'T JUST EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH HEALTHY RESULTS. MODERATION AND EXERCISE NEED TO FIND A WAY INTO MY LIFE IF I'M TO HAVE A HEALTHIER OVERALL WELL BEING WITH A LONG RANGE WEIGHT LOSS SUCCESS STORY AS WELL AS KEEPING THE WIGHT OFF. I HAVE TAKEN OFF WEIGHT SO MANY TIMES AND HAVE PUT IT BACK ON. I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WILL HELP ME STOP THE YO YO HABIT AND GET ME ON TRACK TO KEEPING THE WEIGHT OFF. THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE HONEST."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This is an unusually thorough discussion of the fundamentals of weight loss by a physician who successfully used these 'Seven Pillars of Weight Control' himself, and who communicates his theories in a concise and readable way. This is not a specific diet, like the Mediterranean Diet, but a step by step how-to book. I recommend this book to anyone, particularly those with previously disappointing result, as a scholarly and believable 'diet book.' He includes his own story and his frustrations and disappointments. There are some before, during, and after photos. I enjoyed his recounting of his personal story and plan to give some away at Christmas to some of my larger relatives and friends. Buy it, you'll like it!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I understand from reading an interview with Dr. Nick that he would have liked this book to be called \\"My Big Fat Greek Miracle\\" This would have been a better name for the book as I did not take this as a diet book, but a piece of inspiration for all of those searching for happiness with their body. The story he tells is one that every obese person has gone through at one time or another. His seven pillars of weight loss is sound advise and a solution for your health and future. The reader needs to keep the message in mind and not the how. Not everyone can take off work for a year and watch baseball games, but everyone can get healthy with the seven pillars. This book is a great reader as well. I got it on Friday from Amazon.com and burned through it by Sunday That was three weeks ago and now I am back on my diet and working on my body at the gym and I weighed 425! Thanks Nick, through this work you gaves us hope back."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I have read every diet book out there. I have NEVER come across a diet book that tells a inspirational story of a DOCTER who has lost over 200 pounds. Dr. Nick speaks from experience, he's been there, he's felt the humilation of being over weight. In this book he gives you 7 steps you need to take before you start your journey. Like \\"LIKE YOURSELF\\".Not only does he talk about losing weight but he takes us on a journey of those 8 months he was traveling, saving a womans life during a Cubs game, seeing the aftermath of 9/11. He is NOW the Skinny man with the BIG HEART! It's a must Read for anyone who has ever struggled with his/her weight!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This story has some inspiration and motivation in it for many, I am sure. But for a physician who writes--more than once--that \\"diets don't work,\\" then why did he undertake a DRASTIC 800-calorie-a-day-nothing-but-liquid-protein-shakes DIET to lose the weight he writes about??????And while he promises early in the book to write more about liquid protein shake diets, his very scanty page about it in the back provides no substantial information.And while bravo for him that he could take a year off work and go motoring around the country to take his mind off his self-induced drastic diet, it's certainly nothing practical the rest of us can follow.And his 7 Pillars? Written after he lost his weight, certainly not what he followed while on his drastic diet.On the plus side, reading his story does make it easy to think that if he did it, so can others."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I feared this was just another diet book (and I have them all) but was happily wrong. The first half detailing Dr. Nick's weight loss is personal, compassionate, filled with adventure and loaded with humor. I couldn't put the book down!The second half has really changed my life. I view my relationship with food totally differently making more conscious, responsible decisions as a result of Dr. Nick's 12 Pillars. He has helped me see how my life is out of balance and that the weight is only a symptom, not the problem.I lost 16 pounds in 12 days quite easily as a result of getting my head on straight. For the first time I have confidence that I will lose all of my excess weight (I was scheduled for weight loss surgery!) and keep it off with the inspiration of this terrific book.I met Dr. Nick and his entire family at a book signing. He is one great guy and deeply committed to helping each person lose their weight and get healthy. Consider him to be your personal coach and be prepared to fall in love with this book!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This is a very motivational book. Nick's story is interesting, unique and well worth the price of the book by itself. But in Part 2 he gives the reader his 7 Pillars for success and that is a real bonus. For me it was great to have a book that speaks to guys more than gals. Even so it will motivate even the most die hard food addict regardless of gender.No quick fixes here, just good common sense. No elaborate theories or difficult to read, scientific language. If you need motivation to lose weight go out and get this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I was already fortunate enough to have heard about Dr. Nick's journey into weight loss since the local television stations and newspapers were covering this story. He used to be known as \\"the big doctor with the big heart.\\" I was excited to hear that he had written a book about his adventure across the country in his conversion van. Dr Nick decided to walk away from his job and to do what most could just dream about, to travel all 50 states and to visit all the baseball parks in a single season, while losing weight and beginning his lifetime of healthy living.The book is broken down into 2 major parts.1. A \\"journal\\" with photos not only talking about where he went but how he was feeling. He spoke about how he felt when he was starting including a \\"last supper\\" and depressing weigh in on the first day. Next were the way his body felt after a couple of days on the diet and how much he just wanted to give up. As his journey became easier, it was apparent that he was much more confident (not afraid to have his friends eat in front of him). He began to exercise while on the road and how that felt for someone who had not exercised regularly. Finally, he comes home on Thanksgiving Day and eats for the first time and his family sees him for the first time in months. Included in there are very candid feelings, so truthful, that I cried because I could relate.2. His Seven Pillars. He realized what he did that was successful and put it into a plan. It isn't rocket science. No magic pill, no exercise in a bottle. He doesn't tell you eat this way and you will lose weight. He happened to lose the weight quickly on a liquid diet but then the tough part began...maintaining the loss. The Seven Pillars are guidelines to help you make your own plan of attack to make you the best that you can be. They can be used with any \\"diet\\" plan. It can be used whether you have 20 lbs to lose or over 250lb like him.What makes Dr Nick stand out is that he is not a doctor who says eat like this and you will lose weight. He is a person who set out to do it himself, who happens to be a doctor. I believe that has more credibility than Dr Atkins. He made his living caring for those who could not afford healthcare. I'm sure that it was difficult for him to openly express the humiliation and embarrassment that he felt in the early days of his journey but I am so glad that he did.I am now preparing to start my own journey. Although I cannot take time off the same way that he did, I am going to do my own version of a \\"sabbatical\\" to get me started."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Dr. Nick eloquently and very personally captured the essence of the miracle of weight loss in this book. He identifies from the beginning of the book that his endeavor was not going to be simple or easy. He shares the difficulties of his journey, which were many. Lightheartedly he shares many humorous events as well as sorrowful moments along the way. He projects the hope of a changed outlook and perspective whereby the seemingly impossible becomes undoubtedly possible and how the rewards of losing excess weight far outweigh the difficulties faced. He portrays weight loss to be a journey of unspeakable fulfillment: a not-to-be-missed event in the life of an obese individual. He places the reality of freedom from captivity to food within reach of every obese individual. His testimony is one of hope, a lesson to all of us whether we are obese or whether we struggle in some other way to have victory in our lives regarding fulfilling our own responsibility for health and well-being. As a nurse, I desire my patients and their significant others to know the lifechanging lessons found in this book. His story is radically miraculous and is certainly a page-turner, as it shreds the traditional, shoebox ideas of how weight loss should be done and instills the reader with the hope of the possibility of changed, victorious living that every obese individual CAN have."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I just finished reading My Big Fat Greek Diet last night, and I must say that it is the most profound message that I have read...ever.Dr. Nick has overcome a Herculean task and has shown to everyone who has ever had a weight problem that - no matter how much you have to lose - you can do it!Unlike most \\"diet books\\", this book connects with both men and women, explores many popular options available to acheive your goals, and inspires the reader to make a paradigm shift in their outlook on weight loss. This is the key to success! There are plenty of books that show you \\"HOW\\" to lose weight and \\"WHAT\\" to do to get there, this book answers the \\"WHY\\" we should lose weight. If you are overweight, buy this book. It is a pleasure to read and an inspiration to anyone who has ever struggled time and time again with the humiliation and pain of being obese."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Finally, Someone who understands the pain and humiliation of being obese. This is not another book by someone who has never had a weight problem trying to tell obese people how to lose weight. Follow Dr. Nick through his incredible weight loss journey week by week. Truly an inspiration to anyone who has a lot to lose or even just a little to lose. I read this book in one sitting. It is just too good to put down. This book gave me the hope and will to try \\"one more time\\". I truly believe I can to it this time. Thanks, Dr. Nick."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This book is mildly amusing but totally unrealistic for 99.9% of the population. Save your money, I'll give you the summary of the book. Stop eating altogether, just drink protoien shakes, take the summer off from work and go to every city in the US and watch a baseball game to take your mind off how fricken hungry you and work out all the rest of the time. The guy has a great success story after losing a billion pounds but that's about it. There you go, no charge."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Not only entertaining but encouraging for anyone who wants to lose weight.Very good suggestions for anyone no matter what age or genter."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I found the book at a local second hand store on their free pile one morning while taking my walk. I felt drawn to the book and promply picked it up and took it home .As I read I felt a kinship with the author. He knew/knows the heartache of being overweight. I could identify with him and the trials that he has experienced. I found too that the book made me feel that I too could accomplish great things, as the author had done. I too so appreciated the fact that he turned his life over the to Lord and knew from where his success really came. I am sharing the book with a friend and when I get it back I am rereading it."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"When I bought this book, I thought that it was going to be a combination of an overview of the mediterranean diet and how Dr. Nick lost all of his extra weight by using the Mediterranean diet, but it is not.I figured that I would be disappointed, but started to read it anyway - it turns out that this is a wonderful book full of his experiences with losing over 200 pounds on an extremely difficult diet - the challenges, the mood swings, the emotional support / the lack of emotional support that he had to deal with. The family stories were touching - Greek families are very close to one another, and his family seems to exude that warmth. These things, combined with all the trips to the baseball parks made it alot of fun as well as some interesting reading.If you are looking for diet recipes, plans, etc - this is not the book - if you are looking to share an experience (with a problem that many of us have or have had), then definitely read this book. It is very inspiring and touches your heart. It makes you think alot!I read this book - cover to cover in 3 days, I really enjoyed it.Thank you Dr, Nick!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I loved this book. I believe that I would have liked it even if I were not fighting weight problems. It is entertaining and educational in ways that few books are. Frankly, I generally do not believe that a book can be educational if it is not also entertaining. This is a difficult standard to meet, but Dr. Nick has done it.Unfortunately, it will be hard to duplicate his method Of weight loss because few of us can take a year or so away from employment--even for life saving therapy.I see that used copies are selling very cheap here at Amazon making the ultimate combination--education, entertainment, and value. Order several copies of this book to use as gifts."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Found the book very helpful and interestinghad a friend read it as well and they thoughtthe same"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Let me start with the obvious problem. I fully expected this book to be about losing weight via the Greek or Mediterranean Diet. It was hard to tell that this isn't the case from the Kindle Store, but it's not at all. It's about a (actually common) liquid diet for morbidly obese people. In fact, the author often suggests that he blames his Greek heritage or the Greek lifestyle for his obesity. On the contrary, his weight problem stemmed from HIM overindulging on, as he even admits in the book, bacon cheeseburgers and stadium hot dogs. Considering that Americans have a much greater number of overweight individuals than does Greece, and that obesity was rare in Greece prior to the introduction of the Standard American Diet, it's pretty safe to assume that one's Hellenic heritage is not to be blamed. I found that offensive and the title of the book to be misleading.My second issue with the book is that the author doesn't follow his own \\"7 Pillars\\" of dieting to lose weight. He basically fasted for 8 months on a liquid protein diet that consisted of only 800 calories per day while consistently claiming that \\"diets do not work.\\" That's odd. A liquid diet is, after all, a diet. And it's not even that surprising that he lost weight on the diet. It's surprising that he stuck with it, as he's a doctor and such a diet is extremely unhealthy when followed for a long period. Most morbidly obese individuals placed on such diets by their physicians only stay on them until they are no longer considered obese. Why did he stick with this diet once he only had 30 pounds to lose? It's nonsensical and unhealthy. Yet, I'm not surprised, as though he may be a doctor, he's not a dietitian.Along this line, he seriously suggests people take a sabbatical to lose weight ... you know, because most people have the resources to do that. You don't need to take a sabbatical to follow a liquid or any diet. In fact, I'd assume that a doctor who consistently proclaims his devotion to the sick would simply take his mind off food by burying himself in his work or devoting time to a free clinic. Be that as it may, the sabbatical worked for him, but it's not realistic.A, perhaps nitpicky, issue I had was the self-indulgent air of the book's inner story. All the good doctor ever wanted to do was help the infirm and sick, and he was \\"born to help\\" the injured in 911, and be sure to read about him saving the life of an older woman at a baseball game or when he donated his hair to a kid with cancer. Those are great things, of course. Egoism is not, and that is how the writing felt to me, especially considering it had nothing to do with his weight loss.Since I found the book utterly useless to the majority of people, I could only give it 2 stars. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because it's written well enough and could be an inspirational (though not informative) story for those seeking to lose a lot of weight."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I found Dr. Nicks story incredibly genuine and insightful. This is not a diet book as much as it is an accounting of an original and deliberate attempt to reclaim and rediscover life.Dr. Nick's affirmation of his faith and interpersonal relationships throughout his road trip make this very human and personal story with which even football fans can relate."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"DO NOT think that I simply stumbled onto this. Well, OK, I did when I least expected it, but this wasn't the first I'd heard of Nick Yphantides (pronounced Eee-fahn-tee-dees) or as people call him, Dr. Nick. I'd heard his testimony on \\"Focus on the Family\\". So did that set me up? I don't know. I really don't care either! What I DID know was that when I found, \\"My Big Fat Greek Diet\\", it was MINE!!! Yeah, I'm overweight. But I loved Nick's story, and I really, REALLY love baseball! He experiences this journey with an awesome God!I just wondered if Dr. Dobson overhyped the book, or was this going to be something good. I kept wondering if this would be something good. Nah, it wasn't good, it was GREAT! Small illustration: A lot of people enjoy Kellogg's Frosted Flakes. There is a lot that can be said about Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, right? But only Tony the Tiger sums it up perfectly. Tony says, \\"They're GGGGRRRREEEAAATTTT!!!\\" That's how I sum up this book. I flipped through the pages from the Last Supper (that's classic!) at Ruth's Chris Steak House with his dad and brothers, to his pilgrimage to all 30 Major League Baseball stadiums to see baseball games. The baseball games started with the L.A. Dodgers. Wow! He talks about the hunger pains. He makes you laugh. But he RIPS himself wide open, to let us see what was really going on. Amazing! You feel the humiliation when he relives stepping on the scales naked, and discovering that he weighed 467 pounds. He vividly tells of the temptation to get Garlic Fries Qualcomm in San Diego, or the carnal desire to tie up the Dodger Dog vendor in Dodger Stadium and take all his food! I laughed my tail off. But I also realized that he was making this drastic change. There was a point to drinking protein shakes, and it was a lifetime change! OH, and you know how everybody has a fish story at some point or another? Wait to hear this fish story! Real fish, true story. It just goes to show you how God's hand was in on this THE WHOLE WAY!Nick encourages us. For example, eat to live, don't just live to eat. When he was obese, he lived to eat, now he eats to live, by eating the right foods, at the right time, and for the correct reasons! I believe his seven pillars of weight loss and maintenance are vital, and it starts with pillar #1: Change the way you see before you change the way you look. What a statement! What a true statement. Beyond the pillars, he also gets very real. He explains the pros and cons (and they are mostly cons, people) of so-called Gastric bypass surgery. Nick sees Gastric Bypass as a last resort. The bottom line is simple. You have to want to lose weight, and keep it off, and make a LIFETIME CHANGE!So hey! You might not want to read this. So don't read it, and live a dull, boring life with nothing else to lose. Either that, or like myself, you see TREASURE in this man's life, and you want a piece of it!! If that's you, then grab that sucker, and don't let go. Nick had the help of his family and friends, but most importantly, he had his Heavenly Father on his side. So do we, and if we ask, we just might recieve. You ready to ask? Dr. Nick Yphantides is a Big Fat Greek Miracle. He's also wonderfully blessed! I am wonderfully blessed to have been led to such a testimony. Thank you, Dr. Nick!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Interesting in how he lost weight. We all do not have the money to do as he did. But it had to be hard for him to hold to what he had started. same as any diet. The change first has to be in your mind and heart before it will become part of your outsides. Believe first see results later."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"then you are looking at the wrong book. If you are looking for a book that tells you how to lose weight then look no further. If you are looking for a book that will get you inspired to lose weight this is THE ONE!!The 7 Pillars of weight loss are pretty much common sense, but somehow we tend to forget what they are. The steps are writen in such a way that anyone can undertand them. There is not a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo, just time tested and proven steps to take the weight off and keep it off forever."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I just finished the book for the second time. I have never been so motivated to do something. Well written, interesting and funny. If you have a weight problem, read this book."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"If you have stuggled all your life with overweight as I have on and off this will be the last book you will ever need to buy.I read this book and I have been on my change of lifestyle since Jan.10th,2005 I have lost 100lbs. doing a liquid protein diet like Dr.Nick did with no solid food for almost 3 months now I feel great.Listen folks, this man knows he has been there he talks to you in this book like you are one on one with him. I would recommmend it to anyone who is overweight and doesn't know what to do or what way to turn to.This book is the creme de la creme of all diet books.You will never regret a penny spent on this book I promise you.Trust me on this one.If Dr. Nick and Ol'Bubba can do it so can you."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I learned about this book through some friends who, like me, have struggled with weight for a very long time. I bought the book with some reluctance. Like most people with weight and body \\"issues,\\" I've probably read every diet book out there. When I began reading Dr. nick Yphantides' book, I realized quickly that this isn't a \\"diet\\" book. Instead, it was and is the most inspirational, funny, sad, touching, and yes- helpful guide to finally losing that weight that so many of us hold onto for far too long.There are several things about \\"Dr. Nick\\" and this book that so profoundly influenced me that I feel compelled to share. First, as a former 467-pound man who has successfully not only lost weight but also drastically changed his outlook on life, this man is one who can truly say he's \\"been there.\\" He knows at a core level the deep pain of obesity and the struggle that every overweight person lives with. Unlike reading \\"diet\\" books by folks who may have had a few pounds to lose, this man has lost over 267 pounds! He can say without hesitation that he's \\"been there.\\" And his life today is filled with great things that he (and God, of course) has made happen. That's an inspiration, for certain.Second, as I said earlier, this isn't a diet book-It's a personal story/journey and a \\"game plan\\" for helping you to lose weight. You won't find lists of \\"what to eat\\" or daily menus in this book. Instead, you'll learn some basic tenants, or \\"pillars' that helped Dr. Nick be successful in changing his life. I think these are so important, for without changing our attitudes, or \\"the way we see\\" as Dr. Nick puts it, nothing else will change.Finally (although I could go on for days about more things that moved me in the book) I'm always a little leery about \\"diet book\\" authors' motivations. The weight loss industry is chock-full of people virtually rubbing their hands together and jumping on the bandwagon to cash in with yet another diet book. (But as I said, this isn't a \\"diet\\" book!). What really impressed me is that Dr. Nick consistently shares that one of the things he's most proud of in life: in his medical career, he's never had a patient with private insurance. He has made a career out of helping the most needy in his community. That says a lot for this man's motivation for writing this book! He truly wants to share what he's learned and to motivate and help other people to become healthy and live the life that we all deserve to live.Thank you, Dr. Nick! I'm very excited about the possibilities ahead!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Since reading Dr. Nick's book and seeing how he has openly shared his story, I have made my own decision to get on the path to healthy eating. I don't have as much weight to lose as he did, but there is one thing that anyone who has had a weight problem knows, the feelings of shame and the comments people make about someone heavy, are pretty much all the same. The pain is great and that in itself can be a cause for over-indulging and the unfortunately, the food does not mask the pain but it only gets worse. The seven pillars in his book and the desire to change from the inside out are what motivates me. My hope is that I can be another example of how to properly treat my body and to be able to control what I eat, not letting what I eat to control me and keep me in the ever vicious circle of losing and regaining. What a cycle that needs to be broken! I would recommend this book to anyone who has experienced the yo-yo syndrome of dieting and wants to look at food in a different way. Dr. Nick has shared his experience to help others - God bless him for that!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I enjoyed Dr. Nick's book. Where there is a will there is a way. I especially learned something new about observing thin people eat vs. fat people eat. I do this all the time now. Amazing how they take longer to consume less.If he can loose 267 pounds I should be able to loose the 150 I need to loose. I need all the inspiration I can get.Great read for those with over 100 pounds to loose."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews that this book isn't so much a diet book as a great read that happens to be about weight-loss.This book has everthing going for it:1) A doctor's first-hand account of a 270 lb. weight-loss success.2) A baseball fan's \\"radical sabbatical\\".3) A great sense of funny.4) A peppering of Greek culture.5) An honest look inside the world of the 470 lb. man.6) The compassionate truth about eating, exersize, weight-loss.7) Enjoyable writing style.The author tells an inspirational and fun story of his cross-country baseball/weight-loss adventure that's an easy read. He doesn't hold back or sugar-coat the truth when he describes the \\"bad old days\\" of junk food and embarrassing/humiliating situations. The mix of compassion, humility and determination is disarming and heartwarming. I never thought I'd call a diet book a great read, but this book really is. This was the first time in years that I felt a book gave me more than my money's worth."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I just ordered another copy of this book to give as a gift. After devouring it in 24 hours, I found it to be an inspiration for those that are ready to come to the point of getting drastic about weightloss. \\"My Big Fat Greek Diet\\", which is a perfect title, will not only motivate you to lose weight, even if you are not Greek, but will enable you to overcome any weakness because of the principles Dr. Nick has discovered. His warmth and caring are shown on every page and his openness about his life and journey make this book a remarkable read."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I started reading the book with enthusiasm but soon bogged down with what seemed to me to be the rather tedious descriptions of the day to day baseball games the author attended during the time frame encapsulated in the book. I applaud the author for finding what worked for him and sticking to his sabbatical journey but myself got pretty bored with the story. A baseball fan would perhaps enjoy it more than I did. There are some 'big picture' principles that are very good and transferrable to anyone seeking control over appetite but there was for me a lot to wade through to get to the 'good stuff',"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I thought at first this would be a detailed step-by-step manual for losing the equivilent of 2 people from an obese frame. WOW, was I wrong -- it is so much more than that! This inspirational story (and it takes ALOT to inspire me) really forces an overweight person to view how they see themselves, but it is not guilt ridden. Instead Dr. Yphantides writes with compassion and understanding about our weight problem and our culture's issues with food. He doesn't dwell on why you should lose weight nor what you should eat -- you know that already!If you need to lose weight -- a little or (like me) a LOT -- buy this book. It is a page turner, PLUS you'll want to keep it as you explore the life changing steps that you will hopefully be inspired to undertake. He doesn't focus on spirituality, but instead engages with realistic expectations.

I gave it to 5 other people to read"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I bought the audio as well as written book, because I hoped that the liquid diet idea might be a change from yo yo diets. The key for him, in my opinion was that he started exercising. When you figure out how long you exercised to only lose 200 calories, for example...... it will help you not to go through the drive through and chow down that big mac before you get to the next stop light.....okay maybe a slight exaggeration.The audio book is quite good but does have tantillizing descriptions of foods he loved, which is a trigger for most food addicts.His approach to changing his life forever is very logical. He took time off from the routine that had never helped him to find success. Then he told what he was going to do---humiliation if he failed--and doctors have huge egos-so that would have helped him stay on the diet. Then he had a partner with him on the trip so he couldnt eat in front of him. altho hisdad/partner tried to ply him with food at times, which was torture. Lastly, he was able to focus on finding pleasure in new things, so his deprivation didnt seem as great. He has strong Christian beliefs and it would have helped me to hear more about how he prayed and took strength from God. Would have loved to know what kind of plastic surgery he had afterward, but that is probably saved for the sequel, which i am sure i will buy!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I found the story of his journey a worthy read and the practical advice on all the various diets very beneficial.

At my heaviest I was somewhere around 361lbs. During the previous year I had blown out both my knees while trying to work out so I was very depressed and didn't if I could ever loose the weight I needed to. Then a dear friend gave me a copy of Dr. Nick's book. I told her that I didn't really feel like reading it because it would be like all the other \\"diet\\" books out there. She assured me that I would love the book and to \\"please just read it\\". Folks, let me tell you, without a doubt, this has been one of the best books I have ever read. Here's a guy I could totally relate to. I didn't care that he was a huge baseball fan ... what hit me was how real this guy is from chapter to chapter. Dr. Nick opens his heart up and shares from the depth of his soul. Dr. Nick is a man who is deeply in love with Jesus and know's where his strength comes from and his mission is to share that hope with millions of people around the world suffering with obesity. Read the book ... then read it again. You will be so blessed. Dr. Nick also has a web site support group that you can join. All the information is found at the back of the book. I pray you will be as blessed as I was after reading this treasure!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Great book and an easy read.

Instead of another diet book with gimmicks and quick fixes, it shows the way that anyone, no matter how much over weight they are, can achieve their ideal, healthy weight. Full of practical, common sense information, based on science and not hype. Anyone desparate to lose weight and thinking their situation is hopeless can't help but be inspired by the story of Dr. Nick. And if you love baseball then the book can't miss. But don't just think of it as a diet book. It's truly an inspirational story and a good read for anyone."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Move your heavy hinies over Dr. Phil, Oprah, Zone-ers and South Beach fanatics! Dr. Nick is the new and deserved winner in the weight-loss book battles. (Or, at least he should be!) Don't let the funny title fool you. This can be a life-changing book. Dr. Nick has been there, he's fought the mental and physical battles and he's found the way to do this for real -- and for good. As he tells us in so many entertaining and heartfelt ways throughout this easy read, it's not just about losing the weight, it's about never finding it again. Dr. Nick has written an honest and emotionally transparent account of his own incredible journey back to health and vitality -- giving us his inspired and gifted insight each step of the way. Through his companion website, [...], Dr. Nick has also created a unique and powerfully effective \\"family\\" of other people who are themselves at various stages in their own personal journey to a healthy physical and mental destination. Dr. Nick's own personal involvement and commitment to empowering others to do what he himself has done is nothing short of miraculous. Warning: If you're thinking about buying this book, do not do it lightly. It will change the way you think about food and eating forever."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This book was different than other diet books. At the beginning you get to see what he went through. Then he tells you how he lost all the weight. There were a lot of things he said that made so much sense. It certainly makes you think."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I, too, had lots of weight to lose. I read this book last night (yes, one night) and found the validation in how I took the pounds off. Additionally, the Seven Pillars is THE tool I'll be using for the rest of my life; strangely enough, I modified my cooking methods (which tracks with the book info) for my significant other at the same time I started my liquid diet. As a result, his weight came down 35 pounds, his LDL cholesterol dropped over 30 points and his knees aren't bothering him the way they usually do in the cold weather. Dr. Nick's way does work, but you have to WANT to lose the weight and keep it off. Which means, it's time to go to the gym!!!"},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I have read several diet books and tried several diets. What I liked about Dr. Nick's is it is a no-nonsense, don't have to buy anything special, the way it really is book. He shows an easy way to calculate how many calories your body uses and tells you how to set up a plan to succeed. When I get to feeling weak I just look at his pictures and see what he has done in 8 months. His book is about lifestyle change and retraining your mind and body. He also answers his e-mails."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book written by Dr. Nick. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants/needs/decides to lose some weight and get healthier.As an atheist I was a little apprehensive at first as I know Dr. Nick is a man of devout faith and I wrongfully assumed his book would be used as a soapbox to promote religion. This was nothing of the sort. It was merely one man sharing his journey, using the tools he has aquired, and sharing his experiences and words of wisdom with the rest of us.While yes Dr. Nick does have strong faith and it's evident in this book, in no way does his faith overshadow the nutritional messages presented in the book but more so works in the authors favor to achieve his ultimate goal. Dr. Nick uses common sense, a cool reasonable approach, a positive attitude, a lot of humor, medically sound data and science to become a better, stronger, healthier individual. Theists, agnostics and atheists alike can appreciate that.While reading this book, I was never made to feel less of a person for lacking a God belief (a rarity these days in any book written by a Christian). There was something very endearing about the way this book was written, the word \\"Heartfelt\\" comes to mind. Whether faith be used to move mountains or be used to take off pounds I have come to realize the importance and positive effects of such belief systems in many peoples lives.Dieting is never easy. It's a difficult and painstaking process so it's nice to see that Dr. Nick is someone we can all commiserate with no matter what the stripe (theists, agnostics, and atheists alike). He truly has been there so we can learn from his experiences. This *how to* book is a wonderful, humorous way to make the weight loss process much more simplified and a little less of a shot in the dark. I followed the advice and lost weight almost effortlessly.Dr. Nick and his common sense approach made a fan out of me. If more theists were like Dr. Nick truly this world would be a better place."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"If you're sick and tired of diet rhetoric and at the end of your \\"diet rope\\" then stop everything and BUY THIS BOOK! I would add to not stop reading it until you're through, but I don't have to since you won't be able to put it down anyway. Dr. Nick's book, My Big Fat Greek Diet, is truly the answer to all of us diet junkies' prayers.It is rare to find a book that can tug at both your heart strings and your funny bone at the same time; that is vulnerable and revealing, yet inspirational and empowering all at once. For all this to come from a NON-Fiction book about a 467lb man who watches baseball for eight months and sips protein shakes instead of food...well it's a Greek miracle!Dr. Nick lovingly reveals every humiliating aspect of his journey to good health, and in doing so, he makes his readers a part of his sadness, despair, happiness and ultimate success. You finish this book wishing he were your doctor, and more importantly, your friend. His struggles and setbacks are beautifully intertwined with the triumphs he experiences, and at no point do you ever feel sorry for him. Instead, he instills a sense of awe and inspiration as you read about this gentle, compassionate man who slays his own dragons and wins the day (complete with a Princess)!As if this weren't enough, Dr. Nick continues his crusade for your health by introducing and explaining his \\"Seven Pillars for Weight Loss\\" in a manner that is anything but condescending and full of encouragement. Most importantly, it is realistic. You're not going to read about the 'magic pill,' the perfect diet or the exercise move that will fix your fat in seven minutes. In fact, the only product endorsement at all (if you can call it that) is for the YMCA! What he does offer is the kind of support and encouragement that so many of us lack and desperately need. He becomes your own personal champion, and it's because he walks the walk that you feel inclined to trust him, and not let him down.I can't begin to explain how refreshing it was to read a book that doesn't preach, doesn't ridicule and doesn't downplay the difficulties that come with finding a healthier path. This book is not simply a book about weight loss - My Big Fat Greek Diet is about the personal and spiritual growth that comes when you're shrinking the right way, for the right reasons.If you're serious about getting healthy, and wouldn't mind dropping a few pounds while you're at it, then add this book to your library at once! It will be the last diet book you ever read, and one of the best investments you'll ever make."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"I have purchased countless diet and weight loss books. I have read them all, but this one has inspired me to change my lifestyle and how I view myself. As Dr. Nick states in his book, \\"You have to change the way you see, before you can change the way you look.\\" That is my mantra. His humor and warmth as he describes his journey is relatable. I had considered gastric bypass surgery, but I could not find peace within myself to walk that path. However, I knew I had to make a change, since I was weighing in at 323lbs on a 5'3\\" frame. I was miserable physically and emotionally. So I did research and took my current lifestyle into consideration and decided to join a program called HMR and since August 23rd I have lost 23lbs and I am learning a whole new way of viewing nutrition. I read parts of Dr. Nick's book on a daily basis for support and encouragement. One day when I was perusing Dr. Nick's website, I discovered his weight loss tool was the HMR program as well. That doubled my commitment level to myself. Thank you Dr. Nick for writing a book that didn't preach. Thank you for being humble and sensitive. Your book is changing my life."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"Great book, very down-to-earth and also very funny at times. Dr. Nick has LIVED many of the fat jokes that we have all heard. Most of us can relate, so its even more inspiring to take off the weight.As many reviewers have noted, this is NOT a traditional diet book filled with recipies, calorie counting or even excercise techniques. I think Dr. Nick realizes that by the time you've gotten his book, you already can cook low-fat or fill out a diet journal. For those truly overweight (as Dr. Nick was) a radical approach is presented: Liquid protein (a la EAS or MetRX etc) shakes. To me it sounded logical since Oprah did it back in '88 the same way (weigh?). She looked great, but couldn't keep it off. In his book, Dr. Nick addresses how he is now maintaining the weight with intelligent food choices and excercise. For myself, I have always said \\"give me a chance; once I have it off, I'll keep it off\\". I just have always been looking for a way to take it off.Dr. Nick starts his journey in April and ends in Oct/Nov. of the same year, losing over 260 pounds. WOW! Since he is a baseball fan, he decides to go visit various ballparks across the country. He has taken pictures at each ball park to show us the progress of his weightloss. As a baseball fan, I actually wish he had actually given us a mini-review of each ballgame/ballpark maybe in a separate section of the book. Maybe he can add that to his website, www.healthsteward.com.Anyway, anyone who is looking to just get down to a manageable level to take back control of their bodies, I heartily recommend this book. At 39, I am far too young to feel this old. Anyone that feels the same way should check out this book. Go to his website and take a look. Just Dr. Nick was enough to inspire me. On his website, Dr. Nick has about 60 people (myself included) that are documenting their progress. Take a moment and check it out. BUY THIS BOOK! Thanks Dr. Nick."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"What a great book! Finally a diet book that takes you onto the emotional rollercoaster of weight loss rides, and leaves you inspired, full of hope, and believing you can successfully change your life and weight at the same time. The book takes you into the heart and mind of one of the most humble and compassionate doctors San Diego County has ever known. In the Intro, Dr. Nick says, \\"...I can't guarantee that you'll be successful after you read this book, but I can guarantee that you'll be inspired and have the tools to finally do something.\\" I was a little skeptical when I read this, but after reading the book I am inspired, motivated, losing weight, and beginning to change the way I see myself.I had lost a large amount of weight 8 years ago. I put it all back on, and then some. The emotional impact of the weight loss/gain was significant. I lived in the 300-pound-plus world, with all of its drawbacks, embarrassments, health issues, and I had lost hope that I would ever lose the weight again. Losing hope is a terrible place to be. Then I stumbled onto this book. It has been said that, \\"faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\\" This book helped put substance back into my hope of living at a normal body weight. It took me on a journey with evidence of the things I hope to see in my life. And finally I have read a weight loss book-and I've read them all-where someone actually understands how it feels to be overweight, and then takes those feelings and gently guides you onto the path of weight loss success.On a lighter-more serious note, I nominate Dr. Nick Yphantides, M.D., for the position of Surgeon General of the United States of America. Who could be better qualified to lead this nation out of the obesity epidemic we are in."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"What an inspirational book. Wonderfully written!

His story is so similar to so many of us who do not know know else to turn. This book does not describe a diet in depth, but it does provide the inspiration ans insight that some of us need in order to suceed.As Dr. Nick tells us, \\"You have to the way you see before you change the way you look.\\" I strongly recommend this title for anyone who has the drive and will but needs the inspiration to boost their weightloss goals."},{"Title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"The story of Dr. Nick's weight loss journey was incredibly honest and genuine. I truly enjoyed this book and could not put it down.The book, broken into three parts, was entertaining, inspirational and educational. I can say that I've read many other diet books and this is not your typical. In fact, it really is NOT a diet book. It reads more like a great human interest story and by the end I was thinking to myself, \\"Hey, I need to do some of these things too!\\"You will not find detailed food exchanges, medical jarjon or impossible rules to follow. You will find a heartwarming story of a guy that took charge of his life and made incredible changes to his physical self while at the same time showing his heart for his family, friends and even strangers.The best part for me was laughing and crying with Dr. Nick's experience as an overweight guy...it is about time one of the \\"experts\\" can not only discuss the medical side of obesity but also the social and emotional pains too.Great book!"},{"Title":"Exotic Appetites: Ruminations of a Food Adventurer","review":"I recently read Calvin Trillin's Feeding a Yen. Exotic Appetites is the brainiac version. Although this seems to be intended as an academic work, it is sprinkled with personal anecdotes and references from popular culture. This makes it readable for anyone interested in food.Heldke considers food from every angle. What is exotic food? Is food that is exotic to one person or culture exotic to another? When does it stop being exotic? (Pizza used to be considered exotic in America.) How do we change food when we take it out of its \\"native habitat\\"? Do we somehow endanger it?With references to Calvin Trillin, Wayne's World, Sara Paretsky, Pierre Bourdieu, Tony Hillerman, and Jane & Michael Stern, among others, this is a wide-ranging look at food adventuring. Try it!"},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"This book underlines the fact that many have proclaimed for hundreds of years. Jesus is the greatest teacher ever. He did not try to impart everything He wanted them to know by direct instruction. He used the questioning method and allowed the disciple to hear and be disturbed or even confused enough to try hard to make sense of His words. He was not concerned that His followers immediately understood Him. He wanted them to make the new knowledge their own. This book will make you think and give you a freedom that you may never have realized. Jesus came to teach us how to love each other. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave or free, male or female, etc. Jesus taught as one who has authority because He is the Truth. Tom Weaver has found a simple key to the Gospel--understanding that Jesus words before His crucifixion were spoken to people who were still under the Old Covenant. This book explained how Jesus came to be the New Covenant and after His death and His resurrection He would be understood by those who had really &quot;listened&quot; to His teaching. Weaver spells out that He came to give us life more abundant not the law that leads to death, but grace that leads to life. Jesus healed people by forgiveness and teaching them forgiveness. Tom Weaver has put what most Christians already knew but could never quite express as well as he has. I have bought three copies of this book and have passed them on to people who have trouble with the hard sayings of Jesus, people who have had a major loss in their lives or people who think that Christians are hypocritical. It is common to man for us to see ourselves with grace and the other person with legalism. Reading this book is a humbling experience, but it gives you that satisfied feeling of finally something makes sense...."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"Ever start a book and know almost immediately that it may have something very important to tell you? &quot;The Gospel Solution&quot; struck such a familiar chord in me, and in such a very personal way, that I was quite skeptical about the author's ability to offer a real breakthrough, let alone a solution. But I think he did. When Tom Weaver, my Pastor, offered me a draft copy of this book to read, I was apprehensive. What if I didn't like it? What would I tell him? I began reading and my concerns quickly vanished as the text reached out and grabbed my attention. The difficulties I have encountered when reading the Lord's words in the Gospels, the guilt and confusion I have had, have been a source of discouragement since accepting Christ as my Savior. Missing for me was experiencing the joy and comfort of God's love and grace, always so keenly aware of the impossible things Jesus seemed to be demanding of me. If forgiveness for all sin was truly accomplished on the cross (which I believe it was), then how could the Lord say things like &quot;But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins&quot;...? This conflict was deeply troublesome. Tom Weaver offers a valuable tool, a method of interpretation, which dramatically opened things up for me. His contribution is &quot;transitionalism,&quot; principles that provide the first step towards truly experiencing God's grace -- and freedom from the shackles of paralyzing misconceptions. To loosely borrow a phrase from the book -- &quot;the significance of what he says resonates with unexpected and subtle power.&quot; He recognizes questions or concerns that readers may have (&quot;Why hasn't someone taught this before?&quot; &quot;Will some Christians use this as a license to become flippant towards evil and fall into sin?&quot;) and addresses them more than adequately. I think he was a little hard on the Pharisees, painting them a bit more evil in their misguided arrogance than I would. Perhaps, to me, they are simply lost like the rest of us, although they're professional at it. Some may be uncomfortable with his frank observations regarding his own sin nature, giving up the safety of pretense. I was encouraged by it, as it challenges me to be as honest with myself. I found many things to think about further, and plan to go through this book again. I recommend &quot;The Gospel Solution&quot; and believe that the implications of what Tom Weaver presents can greatly enhance my walk with God. Basically, I like the way he thinks and the way he put those thoughts into print"},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The writer utilizes an tool that is far too often missing in theology and exegesis. That tool is common sense. Those who disagree with the writer's methods and conclusions will no doubt seek to attribute his ideas to the bogeyman of &quot;dispensationalism&quot;. The message of this book can not be explained away in such a simplistic manner however. Where does the Old Covenant end and the New Covenant begin? Somewhere between Malachi and Matthew? The basis for Weaver's &quot;Gospel Solution&quot; is that the two covenants meet at the cross, and that the purpose of Jesus' ministry prior to the cross, was not to lay down the rules for the New Covenant, but to prepare the people of the Old Covenant for the coming of the New. Alongside this book I recommend Philip Janowsky's &quot;The Evangelical Essential&quot;."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"After 55 years of being in churches, Lutheran, Missionary, Nazarene, non-denominational, charismatic, etc. I have never heard this explained before.Pastors, you need to read this book! Sunday School teachers, you need to read this book! It's profound and very simple, at the same time. No wonder Jesus seemed to preach one thing and the rest of the New Testament seemed to preach a different thing.I urge everyone to read this book; let God speak to your heart and you will be relieved to hear the truth.Mr. Weaver, we look forward to reading your next books."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"Have you ever had problems with some of the sayings of Jesus in the New Testament? So have I. What was Jesus trying to say? The Authors of this great book explain why we have those problems with the hard sayings of Christ.I agree with what Tom Weaver and John Souter wrote in this book regarding Transitionalism. I will expain the four principles below.Principle #1 TransitionalThe ministry of Jesus is lived under the old covenant. While it prepared people for the coming new covenant, it was primarily directed towards those still living under the law.Principle #2 ConvictionThe purpose in the Lord's teaching ministry was to bring his people, the Jews, to a conviction of sin so that they could grasp their need for a savior and be ready for grace.Principle #3 Evocative (i.e. to call anew) Jesus meant to evoke (or even provoke) a response from his audience rather than just to clarify his meaning. The significance of what he said was often meant to dawn on his hearers with unexpected and subtle power.Principle #4 Interwoven ContextAny single passage with the synoptic Gospels should be viewed and understood in the light of the larger context of Scripturesurrounding it. Adjacent passages are often interwoven together to interpret one another.This book is great in that it explains passages in Jesus Christ's teaching ministry that are hard to take ... i.e., if your right hand offends you cut it off; if you eye offends you, pluck it out, etc. I think Jesus' goal was to make folks realize that to follow law was so hard that the only way they could be saved was the need for a savior. How enlightening!!! 5 Stars!!!"},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"I have been a 'Believer' my whole life. Much of my experience as a church attending, Bible reading Christian has been very heavily burdened by many teachings of Jesus that I know I was not, nor could I, live up to. Thus I have lived with much dread and concern for my own salvation, which has robbed me of so much joy, security and freedom. Mr. Weaver's elegant and Biblically based explanation of these 'hard teachings' of Christ have so wonderfully freed me from so much unnecessary bondage, disappointment and fear. As other reviewers have stated here, this book is a MUST READ for anyone who seeks a deeper understanding as to what the Lord was trying to accomplish through his hard teachings. This book beautifully explains that the Lord's difficult, if not impossible to live up to, teachings, such as the Sermon on the Mount, were actually meant to convict us of our desperate need for a Savior, not condemn us to a set of laws that no one can live up to. I truly believe in Jesus, and thus I am saved. No more needs to be said or done to secure my salvation. Praise God!!!"},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"This is the most significant book I have read in the past 5 years! The chapters on the Sermon on the Mount, church discipline, and divorce are critical for the body of Christ today. It will definitely change the way you perceive much of the synoptic Gospels.

Seeming conflict appears resolved in the perspective Weaver presents. Even if a reader does not agree with the thesis, the study and meditation this book provokes will be very productive, I believe, and should affect one's thinking on the subject to one's benefit. I hope to see some reviews of the book by some creditable theologians soon. I expect that they will bring up aspects of the relationship between the Epistles and the Gospels that eluded me."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"Having graduated from Multnomah Biblical Seminary myself, I totally understand the need to understand what Jesus is saying and to whom he is speaking in the Gospel accounts. Weaver sheds some amazing light on the areas of OT LAW and NT Epistles by very good exegesis. Somewhere in between there was all this \\"transition\\"...in that Transition Jesus was on earth and then died and rose again, but not before he spoke of the Holy Spirit to come. The Holy Spirit would help us to live and obey. Weaver consistently addresses the misunderstanding of Jesus's sayings, the law, and a period where the law was to be fulfilled in Christ, the only perfect one. As imperfect people, we were never meant to live out the law perfectly because we can not. Jesus knew this and thus the reason for his arrival to proclaim and purchase salvation and freedom for us. Weavers approach is comprehensive as well as thought provoking as the time of Jesus was a period of \\"increased revelation\\"...No more earning or thinking we can earn favor or gifts, or approval from God by works or doings, it is by believing int he One who has accomplished it all and said \\"It is Finished\\"."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"This book provides an excellent understanding of many of the things Jusus taught in the Gospels, especially in light of the differences that can be seen at times between the Synoptic Gospels and the epistles. Many have noticed distinctions between the teachings of Jesus from the Synoptic Gospels and the teachings in the epistles, which can be attributed to the movement from law to grace and from Old Covenant to New Covenant. (For example, Jesus teaches the rich young ruler to keep the commandments if he wants to inherit eternal life; this is not the teaching found in the epistles.) This author has come to a clear understanding of why there are these differences and, therefore, why Jesus spoke as He did.It may take some time to appreciate the author's insights, but, if read prayerfully and thoughtfully, I think readers will agree with his conclusions, and will then be much more comfortable in their understanding of the things Jesus taught. A very helpful book that all church leaders should read and then teach to their people."},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"I have been a 'Believer' my whole life.

Praise God!!!"},{"Title":"The Gospel Solution","review":"Riddled with faulty hypotheses, invalid proofs and scripture twisting, this book could drive the most fair-minded reader to experiment with the quickest way to burn paper. Weaver presents 4 principles (called Transitionalism), the agenda being to set aside the \\"hard\\" teachings of Christ that have been such ongoing frustration for him. His premise is that Christ's teachings should be viewed as part of the Old Covenant, arguing that the New Covenant wasn't truly established until after Christ's death. Weaver claims that therefore only the epistles and not Christ's teachings(!), contain the true gospel and ethical standards for the church today. In support, he claims that Paul almost never quoted Jesus, that Paul and John's epistles disagree with Christ's teachings(!), and further - that Christ's teachings are obviously too difficult to follow even with the Holy Spirit's help(!).Normally, reviewing heretical books is difficult because the author tends to conceal his motives. But Weaver openly displays his own unbelief and weak spiritual condition, especially so in chapter seven as he analyzes Christ's sermon on the mount:- \\"I don't really hunger and thirst after righteousness. I have only a casual desire to be righteous. I'm a carnal person.\\" (pg126)- \\"I see I have a problem, I simply don't measure up - and I don't even want to measure up - to the standard of behavior of His sermon.\\" (pg127)- \\"How can the Lord ask us to give to those who are taking advantage of us? I'll find some excuse why I simply cannot comply with this.\\" (pg128)- \\"The reality is that we cannot fulfill this teaching, even after we become true believers. And that's because this standard is just too high for us.\\" (pg131)- \\"I call Him Lord but I'm not consistently doing the things that He wants. What I do is only a limited, halfhearted version of what He wants. As I look at my life, I begin to see myself not as the wise man in this parable (who built on the rock) but as the fool (who built on the sand). I'm just not doing the kind of things Jesus clearly teaches me to do. And doing some of the things He teaches me not to.\\" (pg132)- \\"There is no grace in this sermon. From beginning to end, I find myself utterly condemned and frustrated. I can't imagine - even with the power of the Holy Spirit in my life - that I could ever achieve the standard that the Lord introduces here.\\" (pg133)- Its morality is so high that it is not a reasonable text or pattern for life. To place yourself under this sermon as a rule of life is to place yourself back under a law with all the implications of the original Ten Commandments. These tasks simply cannot be done.\\" (pg136,137)Throughout the book Weaver repeats his unwillingness to obey Christ or His teachings, or to complete the plan of salvation (ie, to take up your cross and follow Me). That prescribed road is just too hard, so Weaver has devised an easier path.I would hope that the previous quotes from chapter 7 are enough to discourage readers from considering Weaver's doctrine. If not, the following will serve to disprove his main assertions:1> Weaver supports his theory by claiming that the teachings of Paul and John contradict Christ's teachings concerning the Commandments (pg15). He cites Mt19:17 in which Jesus told a man he must keep the Commandments to inherit eternal life. Weaver states, \\"John doesn't teach that. The apostle Paul doesn't teach that.\\" But the following scriptures refute Weaver's assertions:By Paul:-1Cor7:19 Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything but what counts is keeping God's Commandments.-Rom3:31 Do we make the Law of no effect? No, we uphold the Law.By John:-Jn14:15 If you love Me, you will keep My Commandments.-1Jn5:3 The true love of God is this, that we keep His Commandmdments-1Jn2:3 We show that we know Him if we keep His Commandments.-1Jn2:4 Whoever says I know Him but doesn't keep His Commandments is a liar.-1Jn3:24 all who keep His Commandments abide in Him.-2Jn1:6 This is love: we walk according to His Commandments.-Rev12:17 they hold the testimony of Jesus and keep His Commandments.2> Weaver also tries to prove his theory by noting Christ's requirement that the same man give up his riches and follow Him. Weaver states, \\"Not only can I not find that teaching in the epistles, I find it personally frustrating.\\" (pg17)The following scriptures refute this claim:-Phil3:8 For Christ's sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish.-Heb10:34 You bore cheerfully the loss of your property in the knowledge that you had a better and lasting possession.-Acts4:32 Not one of them claimed that anything he possessed was his own, but everything they had was for the use of all.3> Another blow to this theory comes from the book of Revelation. Speaking from heaven after His ressurection, and transition to the New Covenant was already in place, Christ's messages to the 7 churches remained consistent with His teachings while on earth:-He commands loving the Lord as the principal thing (Rev2:4)-He condemns idolatry and sexual vice (Rev2:22)-He requires obedience to His commands (Rev2:26)-He requires good and perfect works (Rev3:2)-He requires repentance and obedience (Rev3:3)-He warns the unrepentant they risk being blotted from the Book of Life-He promises safekeeping to those who obey Him (Rev3:10)-He warns the rich of their spiritual poverty (Rev3:17)-He warns liars, idolators, and the unbelieving and faithless that they face the lake of fire (Rev21:8)If Weaver's theory were true, a radically different message should have been spoken by the risen Christ, instead it's the same as when He was on earth. Christ shows no evidence of moving away from those \\"hard\\" teachings that bother Weaver, proving that his theory of transitionalism is totally false.4> In chapter four, Weaver even portrays Christ's teaching to fogive others as being antithetical to the gospel of grace(!). He states, \\"An honest attempt to fulfill the Lord's words can only result in hopeless failure.\\" (pg77). This chapter best conveys his convoluted thinking and absence of faith, as he even rejects the most basic fruit that Christ commands believers to produce: simply to forgive others as God has forgiven us.If more persuasion is needed, here are a few more quotes to warn readers not to enter Weaver's spiritual wilderness:-\\"The problem stems from the promises Jesus made that He would give us what we prayed for. For many, the Lord's promises turn out to be hollow and frustrating.\\" (pg6,7)-\\"We don't really have the resolve to follow the Lord to the extent He demands, and we know it.\\" (pg11)-\\"The words of the Lord in Matthew, Mark, and Luke actually offended my theology.\\" (pg12)-\\"..Jesus often tried to confuse people.\\" (pg22)-\\"Many of the Lord's words are simply not the Christian gospel.\\"(pg27)-\\"..the Lord was not aiming His teaching toward the church, nor did He ever intend that these public messages should become a rule for Christian living.\\" (pg30)-\\"When Christians try to live by His teachings, they place themselves under bondage to a new form of Christian legalism that can only lead to frustration.\\" (pg31)-\\"Jesus was often unclear, and I submit that it is becaue He meant to be obscure. In fact, He was almost never clear. He preferred to be unclear, even confusing, because it served His purposes.\\" (pg33)-\\"He was far more interested in arousing feelings than He was in helping people fully understand the content of His message. Jesus' approach seems more inclined to create an emotional feeling, just as music does, than in teaching specific information.\\" (pg34)-\\"Jesus understood that people are not converted by coming to a clear understanding of the gospel message.\\" (pg35)Any objective look at Weaver's theory quickly reveals that it grew out of his unwillingness to accept the gospel's demands to deny self, reject the world, and to implicitly follow Christ. He has stumbled over the Stumbling Stone. Having rejected Christ's foundation, Weaver is building his own unique system of salvation based on this error-filled theory. But its only basis is Weaver's distorted imagination and desperate spiritual condition. A wiser plan is to build on this saying of Jesus: \\"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.\\" To follow Weaver's doctrines would be like trying to fly an imaginary airplane to a non-existent island. The flight is doomed and even one of Weaver's parachutes (pg73,74) won't help those who fooiishly get onboard. But a disaster should come as no surprise to anyone after the pilot has already pronounced himself as a fool.

You can take your bonsai to a place where they sell them and the gardeners will more than likely tend to your plant for a price, but in this \\"survival manual\\" you may just find out what you are looking for . . . in most cases where you may be going wrong. If you've invested a lot of time in your plants, you certainly want to be successful with them. Of course the best place to start is with someone who has experience. Colin Lewis, without a doubt, is just the person you are looking for!According to Lewis, \\"The most important horticultural information required is the knowledge needed to keep the bonsai alive.\\" Any beginner can easily become frustrated and discouraged when a cherished bonsai plant begins to shrivel and die. You will learn how to purchase a plant, what its needs are, where to put the plant, what kind of plant will work well for you, what to look for in a plant, what kind of plant to avoid, how to care for your plant, how to shape your plant, how to identify and treat problems, and you'll get to take a look at fifty commercial species.Each species is comprehensively profiled. You will receive a brief history, you'll be told what to look for, and points to watch. Each plant has a sidebar which tells the bonsai source, the needed light levels, the temperature range, pests and diseases that affect it, the type of soil needed, its water needs, how to feed, and prune the plant. Each specimen is accompanied by a photograph of a healthy, vibrant plant. The species, separated by an asterisk, are listed below.Acer Buergerianum (trident maple) * Acer Palmatum (Japanese maple) * Acer Palmatum \`Deshojo' or \`Chishio'(Japanese red maples) * Acep Palmatum \`Kiyohime' (Kiyohime maple) * Acer Palmatum \`Seigen' (Seigen maple) * Arundinaria and similar species (bamboos) * Bougainvillea * Carmona Microphylla (Fukien tea) * Carpinus Species (Hornbeama) * Celtis Sinensis (Chinese hackberry) * Chaenomeles (flowering quince) * Chamaecyparis Obtusa (Hinoki cypress) * Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster) * Crassula (Jade tree/Money tree) * Cryptomeria Japonica (Japanese cedar) * Cycas (cycad) * Fagus Crenata (Japanese \\"white\\" beech) * Ficus (Fig varieties) * Fuchsia (fuchsia) * Ginkgo Biloba (maidenhair tree) * Ilex Crenata (Japanese holly) * Jasminum Nudiflorum (Winter jasmine) * Juniperus Chinensis Sargentii (Sargent's juniper) * Juniperus Rigida (Needle juniper) * Juniperus Squamata \`Meyeri' (Meyer's juniper) * Lagerstroemia Indica (crape myrtle) * Ligustrum Sinense (Chinese privet) * Malus (crab apple) * Murraya Paniculata (jasmine orange) * Myrtus (myrtle) * Nandina Domestica (sacred bamboo) * Olea Europaea (European olive) * Picea (spruce) * Pinus Densiflora (red pine) Pinus Parviflora (white pine) Pinus Thunbergii (black pine) * Pistacia Terebinthus (pistachio) * Podocarpus Macrophyllus (plum-fruited/Chinese yew) Prunus Mume (Japanese flowering apricot) * Pseudocydonia Sinensis (Chinese quince) * Punica Granatum (pomegranate) * Pyracantha (firethorn) * Rhododendron Indicum (Satsuki azalea) * Sageretia Theezans (sageretia) * Serissa Foetida (tree of a thousand stars) * Stewartia Monadelpha (Stewartia/Stuartia) * Taxus Cuspidata (Japanese yew) * Ulmus Parviofolia (Chinese elm) * Wisteria (Wisteria) * Zelkova Serrata (Japanese gray-bark elm)This is an A to Z book on bonsai that will be a sure fire winner with anyone interested in this art form. I purchase this book along with a couple other ones as a \\"starter\\" gift for a family member. Each one generates a lot of interest in the hobby, but this one will prove to be the most useful in the long run. It sends the message that your plants will not grow themselves and must be tended to carefully. The most applicable sentence states, \\"buying a bonsai is a commitment - very much like buying a pet - as it will need daily attention.\\" This step-by-step book is detailed, thorough, and well written.

That being said, it would be perfect for someone who was deciding which type of tree to get, as it gives several pictures and good information on so many species."},{"Title":"Bonsai Survival Manual: Tree-by-Tree Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Problem Solving","review":"Nice book.

Good tips, especially for a beginner like myself; I intend to refer to them when my bonsai gets to that level (hopefully).Two main words of caution:- You won't find much help for GROWING your own bonsai - the book is not about creating a bonsai. So, if you (like me) are hoping to get some tips on how to gorw your own from seeds, look elsewhere (if someone knows books on this, would appreciate a reference!)- The described bonsai varieties are detailed for some species (a lot of maple trees covered, just not the one for which I got the seeds! lol), but some are not on the list - japanese cherries, for instance.

Unlike the common doodles, which seem whimsical, 'deliberate doodling' involves some form of structure & purpose. I am very impressed by what the author has done in the three fun books of hers.All three fun books are spiral bound, each with almost two hundred pages of inspirational doodling techniques, on top of various other discovery games & paper crafts for professional & personal entertainment. Each is sturdily constructed with two pockets for special projects, organised with ten card-board dividers & yet small enough to fit into your briefcase.From my personal perspective, they are wonderful toys for grow-ups: playful, instructive & absolutely worthwhile!The author has actually written another similar book, entitled 'Squeaky Chalk : And Other Fun Things to Draw (And Do) When There's Nothing to Do!' but for some strange reasons, I did not lay my hands on it.For the benefit of readers, let me share this personal experience of mine: I have combined the 'deliberate doodling' techniques from Joy with the 'rapid viz' techniques from Kurt Hanks, & integrated them into the 'private writing' processes as formulated by Mark Levy in his wonderful book, 'Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing .'I use what I often like to term as my 'scratch pad', the type artists use, foolscape size, spiral-bound, 100 pages per pad, 100 gms weight, in conjuction with a multi-colour/multi-utility pen from Rotring. At one point in time, (for about 3 years) I used the Bienfang spring-bound note/sketch pads until the only local supplier went out of business unexpectedly.On many occasions, I have astonished myself by being able to wrestle with the valuable business & life insights from my own seemingly disparate \\"private writing\\"/'deliberate doodling'/'rapid viz' pages. The doodles & illustrations often add a perceptive visual dimension to my seemingly random thoughts on paper. My scratch pad is always a visual smorgasbord of relatively heavy text, mystical doodles & logical illustrations (thanks & no thanks to my engineering training!). I have translated many of my valuable insights into pragmatic projects. One of the sideline projects is writing reviews on amazon website.To all readers: If you really want to use both sides of your powerful brain to generate valuable insights, I can guarantee that these three books can drive your imagination engine into hyper-speed mode."},{"Title":"How to Draw a Cup of Coffee and Other Fun Ideas for Home and Garden","review":"I simply love this little book.

With some assurance, I can say that no 20th century playwright has offered such sound advice on playwriting and its production. This is a selection of Albee's essays through the years which reflect works he is then seeing to the stage or has recently seen to the stage. Woven with extreme discretion and insight into the play-oriented texts is a sound vision of the nugatory forces alive in the US entertainment world (tv, film, theatre). He decries these, while offering up a philosophy which those interested in saving, nurturing and creating a true cultural base for this nation should listen to carefully. He believes that a democracy can only flourish in a healthy way when the electorate has as aeshetic background on which to base its choices. In a nation that has elected GWB twice, we can see the emotional and intellectual simplification of the nation's narrowing mind. Albee believes that a nation attuned to an aesthetic theatre as opposed to a pop cultural, pc theatre can not only develop a large audience base, but lead to a nation not shackled by the amygdala mindset of the digital world. Stasis can only lead to the death of art and culture, the only sure indices of a nation's spiritual, moral and ethical values. Those essays in this volume not devoted to playwriting deal with the contemporary art world. Albee is an 'accumulator' of artworks from about the globe. This is path on which I cannot follow him as I do not agree that conceptual art is art at all. But his point that a dynamic inter-relationship among sculptors, painters, composers and playwrights is a sound one. He has put his money where his mouth is with his Montauk foundation, offering new talent from these disciplines an environment in which to enjoy mingling and sharing views whilst enjoying a working holiday. If you are a fledgling writer or a theatre lover, you must have this book in your collection. Accumulate it. Read it, from first to last page."},{"Title":"The cassique of Kiawah: A Colonial romance","review":"The 1850s was the decade F.O. Matthiessen called the American Renaissance.

We are indeed fortunate to have the novel back in print once again, since its most recent publication in the 1980s."},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"The Arabian Nights / 0-486-22289-6I'm a bit of an \\"Thousand Nights\\" enthusiast -- I enjoy the stories immensely and I have four separate translations in my personal library. Several friends have asked me to discuss the differences between the editions, so I thought I'd present a four-way comparison and then talk about which version is best for which audience.For the purposes of the four-way comparison, I will draw text from the opening tale of the two kingly brothers in order to highlight how each popular version handles \\"adult\\" content and racial content.-- The Tale of King Shahryar and of his Brother, King Shahzaman --Now there were in the King's palace certain windows that looked on to the garden, and, as King Shahzaman leaned there and looked out, the door of the palace opened and twenty women slaves with twenty men slaves came from it; and the wife of the King, his brother, was among them and walked there in all her bright beauty. When they came to the pool of a fountain they all undressed and mingled one with another. Suddenly, on the King's wife crying: 'O Masud! Ya Masud!', a gigantic negro ran towards her, embraced her, and, turning her upon her back, enjoyed her. At this signal, all the other men slaves did the same with the women and they continued thus a long while, not ceasing their kisses and embraces and goings in and the like until the approach of dawn.-- Madrus & Mathers edition-- The Tale of King Shahriar and of his Brother, King Shahzenan --One day, Shahriar had started on a great hunting match, about two days' journey from his capital; but Shahzenan, pleading ill health, was left behind. He shut himself up in his apartment, and sat down at a window that looked into the garden. Suddenly a secret gate of the palace opened, and there came out of it twenty women, in the midst of whom walked the Sultaness. The persons who accompanied the Sultaness threw off their veils and long robes, and Shahzenan was greatly surprised when he saw that ten of them were black slaves, each of whom chose a female companion. The Sultaness clapped her hands, and called: \\"Masoud, Masoud!\\" and immediately a black came running to her; and they all remained conversing familiarly together.-- Muhsin al-Musawi edition-- The Tale of King Schahriar and of his Brother, King Schahzeman --Now the Sultan Schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the world, and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour, and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful jewels. It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he accidentally discovered, after several years, that she had deceived him completely, and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad, that he felt himself obliged to carry out the law of the land, and order the grand-vizir to put her to death.-- Lang edition-- The Tale of King Shahryar and of his Brother, King Shah Zaman --Thereupon Shah Zaman drew back from the window, but he kept the bevy in sight espying them from a place whence he could not be espied. They walked under the very lattice and advanced a little way into the garden till they came to a jetting fountain amiddlemost a great basin of water; then they stripped off their clothes and behold, ten of them were women, concubines of the King, and the other ten were white slaves. Then they all paired off, each with each: but the Queen, who was left alone, presently cried out in a loud voice, \\"Here to me, O my lord Saeed!\\" and then sprang with a drop leap from one of the trees a big slobbering blackamoor with rolling eyes which showed the whites, a truly hideous sight. He walked boldly up to her and threw his arms round her neck while she embraced him as warmly; then he bussed her and winding his legs round hers, as a button loop clasps a button, he threw her and enjoyed her.-- Burton edition-------For my money, the superior volume by far is the Madrus & Mathers edition. The editor and translator have deliberately worked the translation to be as readable to the English eye as possible, even making judicious choices about where to refrain from using diacritical points (single quote sound points, as in 'ain) in order to ease the reading experience. They've made a concerted effort to retain the adult content without being lewd, the racial content without descending into offensive caricature, the poetic content without overwhelming the reader, and the entire content without condensing the text and losing material. The Madrus & Mathers editions comprise four giant volumes, but the casual enthusiast will be more than satisfied with just volume one, and with over 600 pages of stories in the electronic edition, the reader will have plenty of reading material available.For children, however, the superior volume is probably the Muhsin al-Musawi edition. This edition is condensed, but the editing was done with great care to maintain story structure and content. The adult content has been toned down considerably, the racial content has been handled tactfully, the extra songs and poems have been almost entirely removed, and there are interesting and attractive pictures in the electronic edition. My biggest complain here is that the adult content has been excised to a degree that almost brings unfortunate implications: when adultery is characterized as \\"conversing\\", the angry and jilted husband seems to be seriously over-reacting. Still, if you want a sanitized version of the tales, the al-Musawi edition is almost certainly the way to go.I do not recommend the Lang edition. Lang's fairy tale collections, such as the color fairy tale books, are usually a delight, but his Arabian Nights edition is thin on content and heavily paraphrased. The stories are gutted to remove the adult content and shorten the tale length for children, but in many cases the changes are not carefully glossed over, and huge plot holes and unresolved threads are left dangling. I've never met a Lang reader who didn't ask me what was going on in one tale or other because the translation is so poorly rendered.Neither do I recommend the Burton version. If anything, the Burton version has the exact opposite problems as the Lang version: Burton's edition lengthens the stories with extensively lewd descriptions and offensive racial imagery. The edition was also rendered in the 1800s, and the language within has not aged well -- there are all lot of \\"forsooth\\"s and \\"verily\\"s that bog down the reading. If you're interested in a historical analysis of how these tales have been rendered over the years, by all means become familiar with the Burton version, but if you're just looking for light bedtime reading, give the Burton edition a pass.I hope that this comparison will be helpful. This particular listing here is for the Lang edition which I really cannot recommend.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"This is a sanitized childrens version of the classic novel made famous many decades ago. It is missing the critical &#34;adult&#34; thread of why the stories are being told; the woman telling erotic and exotic stories to the king to entertain him and entice him with wanting to hear more so she may live... Without this element, this merely becomes is a nice collection of fairy tails randomly sited."},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"I recently purchased this CD set for my daughters to listen to in the car and at bed time. I was impressed with how much they enjoyed it. Several times we have had to sit in the car for a few minutes after getting home so that they could hear the end of a chapter.Now, as for the stories themselves, be warned. These are NOT polished up, dumbed-down, sanitized disney versions. The language used is age appropriate for young listeners. However, there is a body count, and there is a scene where somebody dumps boiling oil in the jars with the murdering thieves. It is not particularly graphic, but if you have concerns about that kind of thing, you really should listen to the stories yourself before letting your kids hear them. Also, these are stories from the middle east, so there are several mentions throughout the stories to Allah. They are handled in a religiously neutral fashion, and only serve to remind the listener that the stories are from another culture. It is not some back door attempt to convert kids to Islam. All that being said, these are relatively good versions of the traditional stories. They are fun to listen to. I probably enjoyed them as much as the kids did. The narrator is engaging, and his delivery is excellent. I would recommend these CDs to anybody who is interested in introducing kids to the stories of Arabian Nights.-CR"},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"My four children and I loved reading this collection of stories from Arabia.

I was so surprized at this, that I thought at first my Kindle was broken and wouldn't go to the next page. In this version, the next page isn't there."},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"These stories are pure adventure with only superficial attempts at moralizing. They are fantastical and repeat themes of transportation to distant lands, magic infatuating lusts and power. The characters are revealed for you to be good or bad and relationships are intertwined with their worldly desires which focus on lavish gardens and palaces of competing grandeur, sweet water, and rich foods. Motives are simple and straight forward, all focused on love, money and social standing. The subject of physical beauty, infatuation, jealousy, greed is repeated throughout. Stories always resolve fully with the frequent ending being the assumption that peace, love and happiness is forever after.The stories are told succinctly and occasionally abruptly with few attempts at building anticipation or develop the imagination although this may be in part due to the editor (admittedly) screening out the \`dull' parts. Still, an attempt could have been made to soften transition points and somewhat engage the imagination. Because of their format, the tales read like a children's book; short and to the point, explaining needed details, leaving out intermediate parts of the stories so as to be able to jump to the next conclusion. Perhaps this is why I was annoyed with this book throughout. But more so was I annoyed because of the repeated themes of foolishness, lust, vanity, greed, arrogance and the abuse of power.I believe a review should be, as they say, \\"Just the facts, Mam\\". Reviews are not the best place to express your purely emotional response to a story. Still, while reading these stories, I could not rid myself the feelings of irritation for the characters foolishness and abuses. Frequently these tales told of youth, spoiled children entitled and privileged by heredity, who viciously abused their servants, were compelled by their unbridled passions (infatuations & lusts) to undertake some adventure. Instead of their adventures leading them to some moral conclusion or change of character (for which I am accustomed), they eventually had their lusts fulfilled, their lives enriched and lived happily forever after. Perhaps this is why all the Chalifs (kings), really just the grown versions of their entitled spoiled and vicious children, were so eager to cut the heads off of their innocent victims. Could they not consider any other form of justice than death? But, beheadings is a cultural insult, a reference to which I am not wholly familiar.Something distinct in these tales is the impression that the highest aspirations in life are that of power, riches and beauty. Moral imperatives, although insinuated slightly, are almost completely missing from these stories and always secondary and less than consequential to the plot. Critics were easily silenced with gifts and exhaustive explanations of why they (the privileged) were more entitled and deserving than the rest of society, almost to the point of saying that adventure and danger was a right to privilege above that of a good stewardship or humble servitude. Many of the adventures were spurned out of the pure boredom of having everything.The powerful were often cruel and vicious. The powerful always seemed concerned with conspiracies and subterfuge which might dethrone them. This may be why many of the tales deal with the powerful feinting generosity with lavished meals and gifts of money on their detractors in what is obviously a ploy to earn their condolences. But by any true accounting it is clear that they had given away an insignificant bribe to buy a conversion. The stories did not balance the cruelties issues for false conviction with any balance of penance (to which I am accustomed), having their years of base cruelties dispelled in an instance (never needing forgiveness) and without a twinge of stinging (profound) guilt. The powerful where always right (excused) in their actions, even in their severe and cruel injustices.I had to ask a friend familiar with southwest Asian studies to clarify if whether these stories were not a commentary on the cultures of that region. They advised me that they are more an aristocratic view of the poor (they control). I was relieved to learn that these stories are not a true reflection of that society for such a reflection would be a shallow one at best. But, I would extrapolate that these stories may be a means of society manipulation. For those not of these lands, the stories seem fantastical and fun, but the under pinning are that of power and privilege over all other things.I guess I have finally outgrown the silliness and cruelty of childhood fairy tales. The reality of this world compels me to search for more morality than these stories offer. I do not plan on reading these stories to my children without taking great liberties at \`improving' on the morals of these stories. Genis are a world of fun, but I prefer my fun to have meaning; ethical, moral and spiritual consequences which transcend this world, if you will. These are by no means the only fairy tales which are lacking. But these were the ones which stole my innocence away from me. These are fun adventures, but as a parent, I much prefer Aesop's Fables.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"I wanted to reread this, as I had enjoyed it so much as a child.

However, I must assure you that all of the innuendoes have been removed from this CD and what is left is a very pleasant story of a gal telling stories to her sister in order to save her own life. I wondered about it myself before purchasing this CD, but since it did indicate it is for children, well, they had to do SOMETHING to make it suitable. We have a lengthy road trip weekly and this CD gets us there and back, completely enthralled with the stories. The narrator, Toby Stephens, is sincerely adept at producing any voice he chooses, and entraps the listener not to even hardly breathe throughout the entire disk. I have to admit, driving can be hard while listening! :) It's hard to beat an English actor narration and this disk doesn't disappoint. Particularly, if you have boys listening: Casseim, Ali Baba's unjust brother, is dismembered into 4 parts, nailed to the inside of a cave, and is sewn together by a tailor before he's buried. Why that's cool, I have NO idea! Please keep in mind, however, that there are still a few graphic scenes like the one I just described and you may have to fast forward over them for younger listeners. Anyway, be SURE to get this CD - it's really awesome and adults really enjoy it too. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"I purchased this to share with my granddaughters. Always loved the stories of the Arabian Nights as a child.

But this edition of Arabian Nights is BEAUTIFUL! It's far better than many other editions I've seen, especially young reader paperbacks that visually seem to dumb-down the content.I know book structure because I build them by hand. The outside has coated bookcloth, a leather spine with gold foil stamping, and screen-printed graphics with embossed foil. Inside pages are text-weight acid-free paper (which means the pages could last for centuries without crumbling - cheaper paperback editions may use newsprint or acidic paper that causes the pages to yellow and turn brittle quickly). The quality paper produces crisp type and sharp, bright images: eighteen color plates and thirteen black plates enhance the groups of short stories.I recommend this edition as a keeper to read for years to come and to pass down to other new readers who haven't discovered these delightful tales yet. I hope you are lucky enough to also get the one page folded insert that was originally sold with this book that gives a content overview plus information on the author and illustrators."},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","review":"If you're a fan of British actor, Toby Stephens, you'll enjoy his wonderful narration of this classic tale.

Daniels in a sense updates H.P.Lovecraft's excellent essay \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\", although he addresses film, radio programs (like \\"Inner Sanctum\\"), psychedelic rock music, TV, and comic books with equal erudition (HPL, unfortunately, did not live long enough to witness the flowering of these media forms). The book was originally published in 1975, and I can't help but wonder if Mr.Daniels has any plans to update this remarkable work (it would be interesting to see his take on the \\"slasher films\\" of the 80's and the \\"death metal\\" scene in rock, among other subjects).

This book challenges you to look at life in a different way. To actually seek out challenges in life, not to avoid them. True spiritual growth comes from taking advantage of life's tribulations. I can totally agree with that. This book also encourages people to give up the \\"culture of victimhood\\" and leave it behind. An idea I adore. The book also tells people that if you have absolute faith in God, or a higher power, if you are certain that God will give you what you NEED, great things will happen. That's not a new idea, but it's certainly true.Now on to the bad stuff. The author of this book is SHAMELESS in his manner of rewriting history. According to Yehuda Berg, anybody who was anybody in history was great because of the Kabbalah. Any great idea that ever came from those people we hear about came to them because they were Kabbalists. The Dark Ages came about because Kabbalists hid The Zohar, the Kabbalah holy text, in a cave which caused \\"civilization\\" to plummet into chaos without its \\"wisdom\\". The author clearly intends us to forget that ONLY EUROPE was affected by the Dark Ages, and that the Middle East was experiencing a time of great prosperity and intellectual achievement. The author states that both Buddhism and Hinduism owe their existence to Kabbalists moving to India to spread their philosophy. I mean, come on! The ideas in this book don't need to be legitimized in such a silly manner.Do I suggest that you read this book? Possibly. It can be a positive experience. Just remember to read this book with a great amount of skepticism."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"I've noticed that many people see a need to Berg-bash in their reviews. I'm not certain what their true motives for doing so are. But, this book is well worth reading as an introduction to Kabbalah. No it is not the definative scholarly text of the belief, but it serves to introduce you to a system of belief that can improve your life. Don't fear it or the Bergs.I've also noticed many reviews that seem to be written from a very Christian point of view. This perplexes me, I myself was raised Anglican, Educated at a Jesuit university and frequently considered the call of ministry. But why do so many Christians dismiss different (i.e....hebrew/kabbalah) as being dangerous new age heresy? it just begs this statement to be made, anything that may have occured prior to crucifixion was most certainly not of the Christian movement. The movement of Christianity was AFTER the crucifixion. Therefore, Jesus and his friends were most certainly Jewish. Very progressive Jews I might add. He may very well have been a carpenter turned Rabbi. And he might even have been exposed to the Kabbalah; seems many of his ideas were awfully close to it......thus the more conservative non-progressive Jewish community might have been threatened by him..... and we all know where that led.So, pause a moment when reading these reviews. If you are drawn to this book, by all means buy and read it. It may contain the answers you seek. Question the motives of those that seem merely to dislike the Bergs of for that matter those that are locked into a strict Christian paradigm. They may not be willing to see the merits of the book.and please, to the Fundamentalist out there; do consider the history of your faith. reason dictates that this anti-semetic tone I see so much of in these reviews is most unfounded. Consider that without Judaism, Christianity would never have happened. We all share common roots. aleph kaf aleph. (go look it up)"},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"Here is a book that demystifies the secrets contained in the ancient writing of the kabbalah. As a service to the public, author Yehudah Berg presents a quick, easy-to-read outline of the basic tenets of kabbalah.I have two reactions to this book. The first is that I appreciate being able to have a feeling for what the kabbalah is because I always thought it was something that was only appropriate for a rabbi or sage to study and not for the average man. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the basic tenets of the kabbalah mirror those thoughts I have developed about spirituality as opposed to religiosity during my life.My second reaction was of disappointment. Sadness that such a miraculous work is watered down to such a degree that it feels like \\"marketing' the kabbalah in the same way that any cult goes about selling its philopsophy. Particularly objectionable to me is the book cover endorsment by Madonna. In addition, I really dislike the blatant advertising of other books by the same publisher and the offers of a free consultation at the back of the book. This makes the entire book seem more like a late-night TV ad than a book about a serious subject."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"The Power of Kabbalah speaks to readers of all religious denominations and is extremely informative, easy to read and understand. I highly recommend this and plan to purchase another copy as a gift for my Dad.Another great and highly recommended book on spirituality is \\"A Course in Miracles\\"."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"This book is well written, assuming that it is intended for beginners on spiritual paths. The content is simple enough for anyone to understand, but I got an impression that the book oversimplified matters. In other words, it lacks solid explanations of the actual specific information in terms of psychology and philosophy. Without such explanations, there is nothing unique about Kabbalah, for I find other religions, psychotherapies, and even cults using same arguments about operating our lives by taking responsibility for our actions. Also, I believe if the book eliminated repetition, it would have been a much thinner book with a less expensive price.Kabbalah does not exclusively represent the transformation of our lives by understanding how the mind works, but this book presents it as the only source of this wisdom. Anybody who has studied other major religions easily realizes that the ideas introduced in this book appear also in other faiths. After all, it does not matter where the idea came from originally. Regardless of the source of the wisdom, by either calling it Kabbalah or Buddhism or whatever, the laws of life and universe are the same. Whether or not the author has been exposed to other ancient religious knowledge is unknown to me, but except for the \\"only-Kabbalah-can-help-you\\" atmosphere, the book represents how life and the universe work in ways that are beyond our comprehensions."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"Every wondered what kabbalah is about. Find out in this great introduction book. This is the best book for anyone who is interested in kabbalah. The book is written simple. Most kabbalah books can be complex. This one is great. I have recommended this book to over 75 people everyone who read it, loved it and uses the teaching everyday in their life."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"After reading the previous reviews, all I want to say is that if you are already studding kabbalah, this book is a must, since it explains and reinforces in a very easy to read language many of the fundamental, and key concepts of kabbalah. If you are not, but you would like to understand how life works from a NON RELIGIOUS perspective, then I really encourage you to read this excellent book. Being in touch with such an amazing wisdom, could definitely change your life for good.You will start to understand the true meaning, and practical use of many of the concepts you have heard for years, such as human dignity, unconditional love, sharing, feeling others pain, living out of your comfort zone, etc .. perhaps the main concept being the understanding of ego, what is it, how it works, and how it can be responsible for the chaos in our life. Ego makes us think that we are better than our neighbor, that we hold the truth and nobody else does, that we have the right to judge other religions or ways of thinking just because they are not similar to ours, that we can treat somebody without human dignity and still believe nothing will happen to us.Kabbalah is practical, non religious, pure wisdom that really works !, so my final advice is: give it a try, if it makes sense, and if it can really help you to live a better life, keep it ... if it doesn't just throw it away."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"The principles of Kabbalah set forth in this book are more a system of ethics that help our spiritual evolution than anything.I've applied the Kabbalistic principles to my daily life and I am a much happier person. I appreciate the science behind Kabbalah. Anyone of any faith can incorporate Kabbalah into their life; you do not have to give up your faith to study Kabbalah.I think the best part of this book is that the author answers the how, when, why and where of our nature and existence.

I urge anyone interested in finding out more on this subject, to read this book. I have a feeling you won't be disappointed.I also want to add, Kabbalah is not just a fad made popular by celebrities. It is a spiritual path that anyone-regardless of their religion, or lack of-may study."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"There are enough reviews that blast this book for being from the Kabbalah Centre, which has been criticized heavily for either being a cult-like group or not doing enough to prevent cult-like situations from arising. I will, instead, address the merits of the text.Most importantly, this book addresses the teachings of the Kabbalah Centre. Their teachings are not supported or validated by any Jewish authority. Their teachings are not the traditional teachings of Kabbalah. But this does not make the book worthless--maybe you will respond to their teachings and find meaning within them anyway.While reading the book, I did my best to verify scientific claims made within it. All of the claims were true, but upon closer inspection, did not actually prove the points that Yehuda Berg was trying to make. The Superstring Theory may have a certain number of dimensions, but that does nothing to prove Kabbalistic concepts. This kind of deceptive writing pervades the entire text.There are a lot of promises about how Kabbalah will change your life for the better. Unfortunately, these claims are not supported by any details. The reader is not even directed on where to find the instructions. Reading other books by Berg will yield the same result: Promises, but no explanation.If you respond positively to Berg's teachings, this book is a fine introduction. It can even save you money, as most of their other books just re-hash what is written here (if you are looking for an in-depth read, you won't find it in any of Berg's books).Essentially, this book is an introduction to a specific school of thought that although labeled Kabbalah, is not Kabbalah. It is the Kabbalah Centre. If you are interested in the Kabbalah Centre, and not actual Kabbalah, then it's a decent introduction, but will leave you with no way of continuing the path or finding answers. But then what are you paying for? A book that promises that your life will improve, that you will have everything you ever wanted, but no way of actually knowing how to go about attaining it."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"If you're looking for spiritually based explanations on how life began and a view of the \\"bigger\\" picture, you have found the perfect read on Kabbalah.

However, for a person to really improve their life in the here and now they must apply the energies of the Tree of Life as graphically illustrated in the power of kabbalah book.Dr. Lisiewski's book, Kabbalistic Cycles and the Mastery of Life, breaks each day into 12 equal hours of light and 12 equal hours of darkness based on the sunrise and sunset of your location. He describes how to perform the mathematical calculations, but I just use the free kabbalistic calculator on his website which is 8thmatrixpress. One can find his website by typing 8thmatrixpress in Yahoo. He then uses the paths on the Tree of Life with the planets of the ancients such as the sun and the moon to predict an outcome of an event. This book is like science because I have found it to be 100% correct. The book has improved my life and more importantly to me, has allowed me to more deeply understand the practical uses of the Kabbalah. Below is the review that I placed for the book on the Amazon page.(I saw another reviewer gave a review of Dr. Lisiewski's Kabbalistic Handbook which I have not yet read, but I thought I would give a review here of this one that I did study very diligently. I liked that reviewer's method of actually posting his other review too, so I hope my doing the same will help other readers as well.)Title: The Kabbalah AppliedI was so happy to see a book like this that applied the Kabbalah to everyday life. Having studied the Kabbalah since I was a boy and being so familiar with its mystical ideas and metaphysics, I longed to find a way to apply it to the mundane matters that are the province of Malkuth. And this book satisfies my longing. I have used it for some seven months now, tested it to my complete satisfaction, and can say that I am a supporter of this system and of the author. (I wonder if the author's last name actually ends in \\"sky\\" instead of \\"ski,\\" because that would make him Yiddish as well &lt;g>.)Joking placed aside, his knowledge of Kabbalah is excellent as several other reviewers have commented on here. Everyone should be familiar with this subject, if for no other reason that to see the glory of God expressed in unfamiliar terms. This book is everything it claims to be, and in fact, contains more than the reader will get after a first read. Study it carefully, apply its doctrines, and change your life to be what you want it to be. No one could ask for more."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"This book has many useful techniques for controlling your bad habits in life and relationships, BUT, this wisdom can be found in superior books such as The Four Agreements (although I'm sure the Kabbalah Centre would claim that that book was influenced by Kabbalah, as they do with Buddhism and any other body of wisdom worth noting).The Kabbalah Centre is careful to introduce you to the rational, common sense aspects of Kabbalah so as not to scare you off with their more bizarre beliefs. Then, if you attend the Centre and progress through the classes you'll be told that your soul returns over and over via reincarnation until you achieve your 'correction'.Then you'll learn that humans have the potential to become physically immortal on earth if we \\"remove the consciousness of death from the earth\\". Hmm, overcrowding?There's also the scanning of the 72 Names of God, 72 Hebrew characters that supposedly give off energy and have healing properties that can be activated just by looking at them. Just having the 22 volume Zohar in your home offers you protection apparently. Then there's the astrology, face reading, palm reading, numerology, water, the red string, the endless books... I wouldn't have believed that rational adults could actually buy into all this rubbish unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.They encourage you to ask questions as an assurance that they are not a cult, but the upshot is that you must assume their core beliefs if you wish to progress beyond the first class.Let's hope Madonna wakes up and sends this cult back to the obscurity it deserves."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"this is the 2nd book that I have purchased of this kind figuring that I had to give it another chance unfortunatly this book did not impress me at all.

I don't even want it in my house!!I don't even like the style it was written in, it's just a lot of boasting and bravado.There are so many other true Kabbalah books out there that do the subject justice, don't waste your time and money on this one!

I won't go into the self aggrandizement of Yehuda Berg and his dark side. He is human and by our very nature, can become grandiose and self serving at times. So what? The importance of the content and teachings he has given us is to distill many of the essential teachings of the kabbalah for everyday use by all ethnic and religious persuasions. What a gift! I am sending this to a Christian friend (I am Jewish) who was moved by a Kabbalistic teaching that real transformation can only occur when we are tested with hardship and pain, and is explained with a concise, lucid passage in this book. The scanning and focusing of patterns of hebrew letters is particularly powerful."},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"After I finished \\"The Power of Kabbalah\\" I felt like someone who had sat down to dinner and left the table without being completely satisfied. This was not the first of the Berg-Kabbalah books I have read but it was the one I liked most because it contained also a scientific look at Kabbalah, examining the Big Bang, string theory and the relationship of the 6 days of Creation to Sefirot. This was my favorite part of the book and wished there was more. Most of it is a self help book, with admittedly some good advice, especially about coming up against obstacles, but I wish there was a book on the scientific aspects. I was left wishing I had something to teach me more about the secrets of the universe and the birth of the earth.

And I'm the ultimate skeptic when it comes to self help books.Michael Scott"},{"Title":"The Power of Kabbalah: Technology for the Soul","review":"...the blatant elitest tone disturbs me a little. As another reviewer has stated, the author claims that all spiritual and scientific wisdom is derived from Kabbalah; and that it is virtually impossible to conceive any useful philosophy without knowing of its secrets.To be fair, many members of the Kabbalah Center have stated that the wisdom actually predates the Israelites and the Hebrew alphabet itself. The wisdom is universal in it's 'bare-bones' state and all spiritual revelations come from this source, which comes from G-d. Not a specific god in particular, just the 'cosmic engineer' of sorts. The source of all creation that supercedes any religeon. This book IS biased however, but not so much that I found it useless.The basic fundamentals found in this book are centered around giving and acceptance. The 'Golden Rule' essentially. It details how the Universe itself works in favor for those that are selfless and dignified; and how the negative aspects of our consciousness work against our spiritual development. Also included are steps that one can take to move away from being 'reactive' humans to more 'proactive' ones.The wisdom itself is trancendental despite its debatable sources. Although, I believe it is important to realize that the Israelites were a nomadic people, and Judaism itself contains influences from many ancient cultures, including Greek, Chaldean, Babylonian, and Egyptian. Amongst all of these cultures one can find philosophies similiar to that of Kabbalah. In particular, the Greek Hermeticism comes to mind. When Alexander had conquered Jerusalem, many Jews had adopted Greek beliefs and practices.

But I didn't read it until 4 days ago on a rainy day in Southern California. Since that first reading, I've read it one more time because of the profound truths that resonated with me throughout the book.I especially like how the book is chunked in bite-sized piece for easy reading. The examples and metaphors (light and darkness, 1% vs. 99%, The Game, The Opponent, the 2 ends of a battery equating to male and female within the same vessel, etc.) make this book simple to understand as well.Pages 170 to 182 also provide great examples of how applying this ancient wisdom of resistance/free will to our everyday lives can be so easy and useful.I found the idea of time as being the space between cause and effect to be a profound understanding. And I especially appreciate the idea that good acts in one area of life may not show up first in the same context, but will appear somewhere else first. (Example: Treating business associates with deeper respect may not equate to increased business, but will show up in a better family life instead.)I was at first turned off on this whole Kabbalah stuff because of the media attention given to it by modern-day celebrities like Madonna, A-Rod, and Britney Spears. But that only exposed my own prejudice.This is a book to be read, studied, applied, and taught by example for the betterment of everyone.

The book has parts of outstanding clarity and consciousness. The book has some parts which will introduce new ways of thinking to you. But also, the book has a lot of nonsense. Sometimes the author is drawing unfounded unreasonable conclusions.Chapters are broken down into a simplifier format to the pages easy for reading. Parts I and III of the book should be mandatory reading for anybody. Parts II and IV of the book lose all sense of cohesion and rationality. Parts V and VI of the book become long winded, redundant baloney.I think that the author probably started with some ideas of another older, wiser person which were really good. Then he tried to take their wisdom a step further with his own ideas but the reasoning fell apart.The philosophy is founded predominantly on this idea of passive resistance or non reaction leading to a life of greater satifaction. It's a philosophy of just accepting whatever life throws at you. It's rididculous.

The only real flaw in this book is that by now its getting a bit dated, the last edition came out in 1992, which is why I only give it four stars. Of course, the fundamentals haven't changed, so its still an excellent way to learn about the genetic approach to studying development, but it should not be viewed as necessarily the state of the art in terms of what is known.

Disgraced French commanders such as Bazaine or Bourbaki are more pitied by Howard than criticized for their performance. He argues that primary fault for the disasters that befell the French armies were more the product of a defective French military system that put such incompetent men in command of large armies, rather than the fault of the incompetent commanders themselves.Only occasionally does Howard divert his attention to the Prussian side, and when he does it is most often to discuss the friction generated between Moltke and Bismark or to describe the usually quick and effective Prussian reaction to halting or diffident French moves. However, Howard seems to place no stock in the notion of a German genius for war. For instance, he is quick to point out the many mistakes Moltke's army made, particularly in the early days of the conflict, and notes that more often than not the French troops gave just as good as they got in open battles with the Germans.In many ways, the Franco-Prussian War marked the culmination of the dramatic military reforms begun by Scharnhorst after the disastrous defeat at the hands of Napoleon at the Battle of Jena in 1806. Prussian improvements in military recruitment, training and organization, and most notably the development of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory. Howard recognizes the revolutionary implications of the railroad, telegraph and rifled weaponry, and also notes the decisive influence Prussian military planning and organization had in the conflict. Indeed, he notes that the war was a watershed event in military history. On the one hand, the conflict included perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in history, as well as the final employment of Vauban's time-honored siegecraft techniques developed in the 17th century. Yet, the war also held some harbingers of future warfare, such as the deliberate bombardment of civilian populations at Strasburg and Paris in an attempt to undermine civilian morale and storm troop tactics developed to minimize casualties in attacking positions defended by troops with rapid firing rifled weaponry. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, Howard seems to credit the French more with defeat than the Prussians with victory.Finally, it should be noted there are a lack of adequate campaigns maps, which makes many portions of the book difficult to follow."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"The Franco Prussian War of 1870-1871 was one of the most important wars of The Nineteenth century. This war would set the stage for what European wars would be like from then on. It also optioned for Germany a respect and imitation for years to come. In this book many subjects are discussed. First the different technologies and reforms of the French and Prussians are chronicled. Then the different mobilizations of both sides, their battle plans and the concentrations of the armies before fighting started. Then the first engagements are described in great detail. Then the great battle of Sedan is laid out for all to see. Then the siege of Paris and the war in the south and west of France is told in great description. Lastly the last battles of Orleans are described and then the following peace treaty is laid out. In conclusion the Franco Prussian War by Michael Howard is a good book for anyone interested in history or politics. If the book has any problems it may be the lack of translation of French and German in the text and in the footnotes. Despite this problem the book represents the Nineteenth century very well."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"I have read only the 1961 edition, so my apologies for any discrepancies between that and the current edition. A concise overview of the contemporary political and technical scene precedes a series of detailed accounts of major clashes in the war. The engagements are detailed to the extent of considering unit actions, down to regiments, and the terrain over which they operated. Leading figures on either side are appraised, usually scathingly. Translations into English are the norm, except in footnotes. The tone of the book, to the reviewer, was somewhat condescending towards civil authorities. In reply, it could be said that the book is primarily a military history. Still, the reviewer feels that a more expansive consideration of the political causes and consequences of the war, on both sides of the Rhine, would have been useful. Considering the book as a detailed study of the clash of arms that led to an astonishing tabula rasa in Europe and the World, &quot;The Franco-Prussian War - The German Invasion of France 1870-1871&quot; will be found very enlightening."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"The Franco-Prussian War is an unusual conflict in that it is in many ways a study in contrasts. Historically, it set the stage for two twentieth century conflagrations even as it settled scores from the early nineteenth century. Politically, it marked the zenith of French national influence, and the ascendancy of a united German power. Finally, militarily, it offered the first widespread use of breech-loading rifles and modern artillery, even as it often languished in the tactics of an earlier age.It takes a broad brush to capture all of these elements, and in this book, Michael Howard has succeeded admirably. He has taken an often overlooked conflict and placed it squarely at the crossroads of modern Europe, and a new, more terrible type of war. For while the American Civil War (or even the Crimean War) is often referred to as the first modern war, it is in fact in the Franco-Prussian War that we see all the key elements of modern warfare: national mobilization, citizen soldiers under the guidance of a professional general staff, and the ascendancy of industrialization in both transport and new, more destructive, weapons. At the same time, newer, more insidious developments in the form of guerrilla warfare and the targeting of civilians centers for strategic reasons first make their appearance on a large scale.Arising out of French objections to the Prussian selection of the Spanish monarch, this war, like many before and since, arose out of a complete lack of French appreciation for the changes that had overtaken the battlefield. While the French had relied on a small, professional army, the Prussians had adopted a model of mandatory service that allowed them to raise massive, reasonably competent forces with unprecedented speed. Thus, when hostilities broke out the French, who had assumed an easy victory, were caught on their heels and never regained the initiative.Thus from the summer of 1870 through the depths of winter and into 1871, the story of the Franco-Prussian War is the story of the courage of the French soldier being failed utterly by inept leadership. It wasn't in the strength of Prussian arms, or in the courage of its soldiers that the war was won; rather, it was in the ability of the centralized Prussian command structure to adapt rapidly to events when their French counterparts were still in the dark that victory was secured.Thus, while Howard's writing on the actual combat is vivid, it is in his appreciation of the fundamentally new Prussian way of war that he is most successful. From the king, through the Bismarck and Moltke, and on down through the rest of the senior command, he paints a vivid portrait of Prussian ideals and ambition. Conversely, he is equally successful at capturing the decrepitude and ineptness of a fragmented French government that lost the war in its opening days, and then prolonged it, to the never ending suffering of its soldiers, long after all hope was lost. Likewise along these lines, Howard nicely illustrates the increasing conflict that inevitable comes between politicians and the military in an era of total war.That said, I do have a few minor complaints. The first is that Howard almost never translates quotes from the original French or German, and while I was just barely able to muddle through with what I remember from high school and college, any one who hasn't been exposed to these languages would certainly be frustrated. Secondly, as anyone familiar with European politics knows, nothing happens in a vacuum, and yet Howard spends precious little time discussing the implications of the conflict within the international system of the time. Finally, while Howard offers many maps, they offer little to know information about troop positions and lines of march, which leaves the reader flipping back rather than digesting a detailed map at a glance.However, these are minor complaints about an otherwise eminently successful work. Howard has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume. His appreciation of the politics and personalities is matched only by his understanding of the weapons of war and the nature of combat. Not only is this a successful history of the Franco-Prussian war, but also a model of what good history writing should be: balanced, well researched, and above all, readable. Finally, Howard's success elevates the Franco-Prussian War to its rightful significance as one of the root causes of the tensions that led to WWI, and hence, to WWII. Thus the student of history should appreciate this work not just for its success in considering immediate events, but for providing a bridge from the Great Power politics of the nineteenth century to the wars of the twentieth.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"The Franco-Prussian war took place in 1870-1871, and is both the last of the wars featuring the traditional Imperial powers (France, Enland, Spain) and the first of the modern 20th century wars featuring the new Imperial powers (Germany, Japan, the US). There is also a direct linear relationship from this war to WWI (and thence to WWII). Because of this linear relationship, and because it was the only war between major European powers between the years of 1815 and 1914, more books have been written about it than any other war in history, relative to its length (a scant half-year). Unfortunately, few of these books still in print. This one, however, is available, and is a good summary of the war. Michael Howard takes us through the 60 years of peace from the end of the Napoleonic wars, commenting on the reforms in equipment, tactics, and strategy of both the French and Prussian armies after their last clash at Waterloo. Then follows the meat of the narrative, the war itself. We are taken through the battles and campaign in some detail, starting with the important initial Prussian victories at Sedan and Metz that sent most of the regular French army into captivity. This is followed by the seige of Paris and the running countryside battles between the regular Prussian soldiers and the barely-trained French scratch armies and Francs-tireurs (guerillas). Along with the action, there is some insightful analysis. Howard convincingly argues that in both terms of manpower and equipment, the two armies cancelled each other out (the superiority of the Prussian artillery should have been cancelled by the superiority of the quick-firing French rifles). Thus, the Prussian victory mostly arose from superior staff work and organisation, for which he credits Moltke and Bismark and blames Napolean III and his staff. Also interesting was the debate on tactics that took place in both armies, for instance, the effectiveness of bombarding civilian populations as opposed to military targets only (and Howard gives us further analysis in light of the World Wars). The book is liberally sprinkled with footnotes and is well documented. Many of the footnotes are added as proof by direct quotes from original sources, and are thus in the language of the combatants. A knowledge of French and German is not required, as Howard gives you the gist in the main text, so the narrative runs along smoothly. Unfortunately, the narrative tends to be dry and the maps are small and occasionally difficult to read, hence the 4-star rating instead of 5."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"This is a very detailed account of the military and - to a lesser extent - political maneuverings of the Franco-Prussian War. Given the detail and the heavy footnoting, it is a surprisingly brisk read, though I do have one suggestion to assist future readers: photocopy the various pages that have maps on them so you can easily refer to them as you read on. Since I hadn't thought of this idea while reading the book, I found myself holding two or even three such pages open with the fingers of my left hand while reading battle descriptions many, many pages later.One disappointment was in the very brief epilogue. The author discusses how the speed of the Prussian victory raised the stakes for all European powers, Germany in particular, but the author does not really discuss the aftermath of the war in France or explain how France formed a post-war government given the fractious way it had fought the war. Every history needs to stop at some point, of course, but a brief explanation of France's recovery seems in order."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"This is a good book written by an exceptional soldier and historian, however, it's not for everyone. I'll try to quickly summarize the primary obstacles for the average American reader.To begin with, this is an operational history and operational histories are, by their very nature, boring reads. It is particularly difficult to become engrossed with the movements of various armies, corps, and divisions when most Americans are generally unfamiliar with the detailed geography of Alsace-Lorraine and the faceless commanders of either side.Sir Michael elected not to translate the frequent oblique French and German quotes of the participants provided to illuminate critical decisions and/or decisive actions. One must assume that the British audience of 1961 were well up on their French and German. Most Yanks will quickly tire of thumbing through their phrase books trying to figure out what was said.Sir Michael must have also assumed his audience had a basic working knowledge of the primary cast of characters of the 1870 War. For example, few Americans are likely to be familiar with the Empress Eugenie, the influence she wielded over her Emporer husband and the French decision making process as a whole. Nor are American readers likely to understand such archaic references as \\"the stone\\", a malady suffered by Napoleon III, though they will no doubt eventually figure it out.I'll readily admit that I spent a considerable amount of time online just trying to understand the background information surrounding the conflict. Several maps are included but unfortunately they are not very useful owing to inappropriate scale. At $30 per copy, this is a book best left in the public library and consulted when and if needed. If you're a die-hard military historian, then by all means, CHARLIE MIKE. If not, skip it."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"Michael Howard utilizes the Franco-Prussian War as a case study to illustrate Germany's military dilemma of the mid-19th to mid-20th Centuries. On the one hand, Prussia employed every means at its disposal--military/industrial technology, professional military training and education, and rapid mobilization and deployment-- to set the president and become Europe's greatest military power. On the other hand, the recently united Germany's victory over France would create a fervor of nationalism and militarism that would transcend two world wars in the 20th Century in what Howard refers to as \\"a disaster: for herself and for the entire world\\" (p. 456). Howard incorporates the classic old style military history approach. The author describes the political atmosphere, causes, troop movements, weapons, strategy & tactics, battles and leaders that are common fare for this genre. To a lesser degree, Howard describes the affect the war had on society especially the Paris Commune that rose after the fighting subsided and the \\"precarious\\" peace that followed (p. 455). Throughout, Howard stresses the technological aspects of the conflict, especially the role of railroads. Even Howard admits the vast array of archival material that emerged from this war is too much for any one historian to master. He carefully selects and synthesizes primary sources from both sides of the conflict yet tends to lean more towards German language sources. Among these, Howard also consults diaries and memoirs from the major actors such as Bismarck and Moltke. Howard also credits the work of Emil Daniels who published a definitive one-volume history of the Franco-Prussian War in 1929. The social aspect of Howard's thesis pales in comparison with the military historical narrative. Much of Howard's contentions are found between the lines; a technique favored by some and shunned by other historians. Also, any treatment of vast units and their commanders describing intricate troop movements and tactics should include an order of battle in an appendix. The absence of an order of battle is a major weakness of this book. Finally, what maps are provided, are just those: maps. They show no movement of troops, offensive or defensive positions or tactics utilized, another major flaw. Howard utilizes the top-down approach to military history to great affect. The strength lies in the compare and contrasting of preliminary preparations of both countries and the political/military leadership that implemented policy. Although Howard makes the French deficiencies obvious and outlines the command faults on both sides, he does it with a sympathetic approach for the realities of the nature of war. This objective style is a major strength of the book. For the Franco-Prussian War, Michael Howard's book remains the top-dog!"},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"Howard's The Franco-Prussian War details the conflict of 1870-71 wherein Prussia defeated France in the last of the three wars of German unification spanning the time from 1864-1871. The development of the modern Prussian general staff, started in the wake of Napoleon's crushing victory at Jena, here reaches its culmination both in the person of Moltke and the crowning victory over the Second French Empire. What few mistakes were made against Austria in 1866 had been corrected, and as Howard writes, \\"By 1870, the machine was perfected.\\"The swift and decisive Prussian victory, Howard concludes, actually portended disaster for the unified Germany. It brought the Germans of that era to believe that since their nation had been unified as a result of military action, that it would be through military action that the nation would be preserved. This was to bear significant consequences over the next seventy-five years."},{"Title":"Small city accounting system / [Barbara Butts and Richard Roller]","review":"Howard does a masterful job in detailing the the military preparations of both sides before the conflict, describing the war itself, and even going into some detail about the increasing importance of technology in &quot;modern&quot; warfare (especially transport). However, there are some shortcommings - the chief among them are the maps. While they are useful in giving the reader an idea of what happened where, they really needed to be more detailed, showing troop movements and positions. I also thought the lack of perspective on the war was disappointing - after all, the Franco-Prussian war was instrumental in the creation of German nationhood, the birth of the Fourth republic, and a foundation stone of the First World War. None of these important after-effects were discussed in any detail whatsoever. As a book of pure military history, though, Howard's book is beyond reproach."},{"Title":"MacKenna's Promise (Harlequin Historical No 216)","review":"From the back cover:The final meeting?Meg MacKenna had come to find her husband for only one reason: to get a divorce. She needed her freedom if she was to marry kindly old Arthur and provide for her daughter's future. But slave traders had very different plans for little Jenny.Cameron MacKenna hadn't seen his wife, Meg, in four years, and he'd never seen his daughter. Suddenly he was afraid he would never see either of them alive again. Kidnappers had taken his little girl, and Meg had set off alone across the plains of Kenya to find her. But even if Cameron could rescue his wife and child, could he bear to see them return home to another man?And my review:This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I was impressed. The book starts off with a often-used theme: the shotgun wedding. The author shows her talent right away in making this opening scene compelling, and not at all stale.The characters were both wonderful - the kind that jumped right into your heart. He was a good man (you could see this right away), and she was so plucky and feisty that it was impossible not to root for her. The problems keeping them apart were real and valid, not the stupid misunderstanding you seem to find so often in romance novels.The author has done splendid background research, and she made Kenya come alive for me. She did a wonderful job of weaving in the historical detail without distracting from the plot.The romance was well written - and the author didn't take the easy way out by using lust and sex to hold her characters together. This book had a very good balance of action, suspense and romance.This was a very enjoyable book, and while it wasn't a keeper, I would still recommend it. I will be keeping an eye out for this author's other works."},{"Title":"J.S. Bach","review":"Dr. Schweitzer himself is an excellent interpretor of Bach's music, especially his organ music. His christian belief put him closer to the heart of the great German composer. Everyone who is seriously interested in Bach should read this book which is full of information and insight. To those who not only listen music but alos feel it, the book is will be a spiritual revelation. Shortcoming: in comparsion with German version, some translation is a bit vague or inaccurate."},{"Title":"J.S. Bach","review":"I really wanted to find out which cantatas a great mind has enjoyed. My first love was music. All the social structure that assumes people need an ideology to bind them in death or a dark prison like Christ in Cantata No. 4 are missing something that even Albert Schweitzer can hardly describe. This is a book about something great. Volume 1 called J. S Bach a culmination of what could be done with music within the theories that Bach had to play on way back when it had not turned into the music we now expect. I bought a complete collection of Bach organ works when that was considered unusual by the kind of people I worked with. I don't own many recordings of the cantatas. I wish I could love something without wasting all my time. Even the Eagles sang about what is on your mind has all been a wasted time."},{"Title":"J.S. Bach","review":"The photograph on the cover is a little odd. It is a railroad receding into the distance. You aren't sure at first glance whether it only seems to peter out as a trick of perspective, but if you look closely you'll see it really does peter out in the middle distance, next to the grain elevator.What does that have to do with Bach? There's a reference to the sudden end of certain \\"American high roads\\" in a footnote in the middle of the text, but that isn't specifically about railroads so I'm not at all sure that justified the photograph.That's a minor mystery. What is more important: this book is itself a historical document, and gives us insight into two of history's great minds, the writer as well as the subject."},{"Title":"Family, Love, and Work in the Lives of Victorian Gentlewomen","review":"Recently, I was given photographs of my great-grandmother Priscilla and her mother Julia. I know some things about them, for example Priscilla was a co-founder of the garden club in Green Bay WI. I have a photocopy of a newspaper clipping taken the day she celebrated 40 years with the club circa 1910. But I want to know more about her daily life. I was pleased to discover Jeanne Peterson's little book on Victorian gentlewomen because I think it describes women like my great-grandmother --except that my grandmother was American and Peterson's Victorian women are British. In the Preface of her book on Victorian Gentlewomen, Jeanne Peterson says the image many of us have of the Victorian gentlewoman is flawed. She says you will find her everywhere- playing tennis, on horseback, caring for her husband and children, and traveling in the Mexican mountains. She says she came to the study of Victorian gentlewoman because she wishes to put to rest the &quot;persistent stereotypes of the Victorian lady that survive, despite all the recent research and writing about women.&quot; Peterson says the stereotypes of the Victorian woman persist for three reasons: 1) &quot;We see what we want to see. And it has been a comfort to think of the Victorian era as a golden age when, at least for the upper-middle class, the ideal nuclear family really existed..&quot; 2) The sources we refer to when reading about the Victorian age including John Stuart Mill's 'Essay on the Subjection of Women' and Virginia Woolfe's 'Room of One's Own' which describe the &quot;plight&quot; of the woman in the 19th Century. 3) Students of this period have a tendancy to see the Victorian middle class as a coherent whole when in fact it was comprised of an upper-middle and a lower-middle that lived very different lives. Peterson investigates the lives of several dozen women, all from the upper-middle class. She discovers these women were writers, teachers, physicians, and in the case of a few, scientists. She describes this group as the &quot;achieving class&quot; because it consisted of women like Harriet Martineau, Florence Nightengale, and George Eliot. One of the more interesting members of Peterson's group is the famous entomologist Eleanor Ormerod, who began life as the daughter of a Gloucestershire landed gentleman. Her discovery of an unusual locust led her to the life of a scientist. Ormerod wrote phamphlets and books, taught and lectured, and became one of Britain's leading agricultural entomologists. Although I believe Peterson may have intended to demonstrate something different, the message I received from her book was that some women were able to overcome almost unsurmountable odds and achieve great things in spite of the restrictions of the Victorian era. In every case Peterson examines, wealth, family position, and the assistance of a loving male relative were all critical factors in opening doors otherwise closed. And, for some women, the doors remained closed. Henry and William James' sister Alice, and Virginia Woolfe's mother, did not fare quite so well."},{"Title":"So You Want to Build a Little Log Cabin in the Woods?: A How to ... and How Not to Book","review":"This was a short, marginally enjoyable account of how a single woman served as the lead contractor and general foreman of the construction of a very small log home in the woods. Fairly well written, the author describes an uncanny series of setbacks that makes you wonder whether or not at least some of the problems were imagined. Problems with the moving trucks, architect, log producer, truck driver, every subcontractor, building inspector, insulation manufacturer, stove manufacturer and stove salesman, lawyer problems and even a problem with a delivery man who &quot;hit&quot; on her makes me think I've read a manifesto of a &quot;drama queen&quot;. Not very informative from a &quot;how to&quot; perspective, there is some value in reading this from an entertainment perspective and as a guide to potential problems with the process of building your own home."},{"Title":"The Oracle","review":"...The price was right--the title catchy--the editorial comment inticing--so I bought it, and now I have to get \\"The Priest\\" to find out how everything got started. Ms. Traylor's writing style is similar to LaHaye and Jenkins in the Left Behind series. It is easy to follow, detailed without being tedious, and very visual. The bridge between Christianity and Judiasm is wonderfully constructed and offers totally convincing scenarios for each exciting discovery. I heartily recommend this book, especially to those who have enjoyed works by Peretti and LaHaye/Jenkins."},{"Title":"The Oracle","review":"This book is a follow-up to The Priest.

It commands a lot of thought about where our country has been and where it is going."},{"Title":"The Oracle","review":"This is a novel about a search for temple articles. It is the second in the series. These are not Biblical, but fun nevertheless. The first novel in the series is * The Priest*"},{"Title":"The Oracle","review":"Small groups of dedicated Jewish traditionalists are even now working toward the possible rebuilding of the ancient temple in Jerusalem and the restoration of traditional sacrifical worship. They are busily reconstructing temple artifacts, musical instruments and priestly vestments, and they are training young men to become future priests. Of course this would become an explosive issue in Jewish-Muslim relations, politically almost unthinkable. In Traylor's novel, this core of reality is extrapolated into an amazing fantasy. Zachary Cohen has been identified as the one living person qualified to be the new High Priest. Certain ancient relics must be found, however, before he can actually be installed to the High Priesthood--such as the ephod or breastplate, the ashes of the red heifer, and the mysterious urim and thummim--the oracle of biblical times. Somehow all these relics have survived, hidden mysteriously in various far-flung points and the adventurers of the novel set out on a fast-paced search for them.This could have made a great tale, but there are some serious drawbacks. Most of the characters are one-sided and not that believable. The adventurers never encounter any real danger. Everything turns out as they would have desired and much too easily. And Mr. Cohen, the designated High Priest, turns out to be a believer in Jesus, a Messianic Jew. Which, oddly enough, turns out to be a fairly minor problem. The author has injected into the story her own religious belief/aspiration/wish that the Jewish nation is about to accept Christ as its savior, not to mention the fact that the royal house of Jordan is going to assist and that friendship is about to break out all over. Just too many unbelievable things happening too fast, and credulity is stretched to the limit and beyond.The book is poorly edited, with awkward dialogue, and with phrases such as \\"fair-complected,\\" \\"elderly gents,\\" \\"yuppie-looking\\" and \\"sneerd.\\" The author spins an interesting yarn and it's not hard to read, but it could have been so much better done."},{"Title":"Back to basic selling: Unique sales tips for sure-fire success","review":"There are few books on selling that stand the test of time, this one does.

Chock full of pictures, step by step explanations, and multiple design suggestions per project, made this book not only pleasing to the eye, but a joy to work from and with. There are sophisticated styles, 70's style favorites, antique designs, with some of the projects being downright adorable.Sherri Haab's techniques and explanations exude simplicity. I may be wrong, but I attribute it to the fact that she's written multiple crafts books for kids, and what are we, but overgrown kids, eager to create, create, create? Taking your time going through this book will not only give you an easy way to create the ideas suggested in each chapter, but each chapter shows a variety of styles and looks for each project.I've been making jewelry for myself and others for many years, so I couldn't wait to get started. I grabbed my 12 year old and we decided on two projects, the faux ivory scrimshaw pendent and the mica pearl pendent. Both projects were extremely easy to follow and with a picture for almost every step of the way, my 12 year old completed her project with very little help from me. Some of the beading projects are a little more difficult, but not unmanageable. Let's face it, reading a book to learn how to do something with your hands can be daunting, cookbooks, craft books, house repair, it can drive you nuts. Sherri manages to give you a wide variety of projects in a wide variety of styles and mediums without sacrificing the most important part, user ability.Projects include:Freshwater Pearl BraceletCrystal Flower BraceletThat 70's RingFaux Ivory Scrimshaw BraceletCeltic Knots Bracelet, Earrings & PendentShrink HeartsAsian Style Floral PendantBottle Cap Pins & PendantPressed Flower Pendant & EarringsLeather BraceletVintage Valentine BraceletIn the front of the book she includes lists of supplies and \\"Findings\\". For the creative impaired, findings are the hardware (jump rings, bails, ear wires, head pins, clasps, etc) that holds a project together and enables it to look professional. There are also lists of tools, glues and adhesives, and stringing materials. In the back you will find templates and a list of suppliers. By far, the project that intrigued me the most was the clear bauble bracelet. It reminded me so much of a bracelet I had when I was little, I would have started on it immediately if I could find the cabochons. Not to fear, I'm heading to Ebay to see what I can find. I'll try a butterfly bracelet for my daughter and a series of hearts for my sister.

Then the book presents projects that only children would wear because they look so amateurish, naive, and infantile. I did not find a single project I would want to make or wear. There is no research in the choice of colors and the materials are cheap, made of wood, glass, paper, decorated with paint and put together with glue. There is only one simple crocheted gemstone project, which is unappealing and looks cheap.

The lives of these two families, the Colemans and the Waterhouses, converge and become inextricably woven together when they inadvertently meet at a cemetery while paying their respects to deceased loved ones. Unbeknownst to them, their lives are moving inexorably towards a tragic denouement, one that is to have ramifications for both families.Two of the daughters of these respective families, Lavinia Waterhouse and Maude Coleman, find that they have formed the beginning of a friendship during the brief interlude at the cemetery. The two girls also befriend Simon Field, the son of one of the gravediggers at the cemetery. The friendship of the two girls is cemented when they later discover that they are to be neighbors, as through happenstance the Waterhouse family moves onto a property adjacent to that of the Colemans. Despite differences in social class and personal taste, as the Waterhouses are definitely sentimentally bourgeois and the Colemans have pretensions to more refinement, the families are brought together, however unwillingly, through the friendship between Lavinia and Maude.The mothers of these two girls are unable to form a true friendship, as stolid Gertrude Waterhouse and pretty Kitty Coleman are unable to find much common ground. Gertrude is bound in tradition, while Kitty, dissatisfied with her marriage and her life, is looking to escape tradition and expand the role allotted in society to women. Never the twain shall meet, as these women will never see eye-to-eye, despite the friendship between Lavinia and Maude.This is a well-plotted novel with each character adding his or her perspective to the events that unfold, many of which are of a secretive nature. Even the husbands, Albert Waterhouse and Richard Coleman, have something to say that contributes to the development of the story, as does Richard Coleman's mother, Edith, as do the Coleman's maid, Jenny Whitby, and their cook, Dorothy Baker. Lavinia's younger sister, Ivy May, who plays a small but pivotal role, also has her say, as does Kitty's admirer, John Jackson. There are also a number of twists and turns in the tale.The story is told in the clean, spare prose that fans of the author have come to expect. It is told through first person narratives, and it is almost as if the narratives were taken from the personal diary or journal of each character. Therein lies the rub, as the author is unable to make the voice of each character truly distinguishable from that of the others. The book suffers somewhat from the failure of the author to develop a truly unique voice for each one. This is, however, the only failing of this otherwise absorbing and intriguing story that is suffused with period detail. This is an otherwise excellent book that fans of the author will enjoy, as will those who love historical fiction."},{"Title":"Glencoe Pre-Algebra: An Integrated Transition to Algebra & Geometry Teacher's Wraparound Edition","review":"very few examples to learn the art of math from .....a book that the teacher must be able to teach math from the &quot;chalk board&quot; to show the theory or the student will never learn pre algebra ..... the book does have problems for review and thus a good take home book for homework assignments ,but teacher should / will be able to teach subject before assigning any homework."},{"Title":"Acadian Miracle","review":"Senator Dudley is a long revered figure in the study of Acadian/Cajun genealogy and this book is a must if you are interested in or having Acadian/Cajun roots like me.

The book takes blocks of time like the Age of Absolutism, Intellectual Revolutions of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, The French Revolution and all the major developments of Western Civilization. There is just enough information to go in depth but not feel like you are overburdened with data. The modern world is also explored and contemporary Western Civilizations. There are also many colorful maps, pictures and illustrations to supplement the writing and to enhance the learning experience.

The book is impossible to Outline or even take notes on since it follows no coherent structure. Sometimes it will talk about the consequences of things, before it discuss's there causes. It also has numerous historical mistakes. Our teacher points them out every class, but some even I cna see on my own.The book filled with typos. It says that nationalism challenged neo-platonism. I think it means nominalism. Please do not use this as a main textbook for the course. You students will not do well."},{"Title":"Western Civilizations, Volume 1, Fourteenth Edition","review":"This book arrived in fair condition. It arrived on time as promised. It was not bad for $7.00"},{"Title":"Dossier of the Ascension: A Practical Guide to Chakra and Kundalini Activation","review":"I first heard about the author by going on a well-known on-line encyclopedia and looking up the subject of \\"Kundalini\\". Mr Sharp is listed as an expert on Kundalini, so I was intrigued, and ordered the book. I had already had experience with Kundalini, and had read just about eveything on the subject that I could get my hands on. Well, there is next to nothing on Kundalini nor on Kundalini experiences here, so don't be fooled by the publicity like I was. There is the same old superficial repetition of other bad books on the subject of the chakras. Even after this disappointment however, I was willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt and read what he has to say on the metaphysical and spiritual side. Well I almost got sick when I did. Believe me, I'm not a skeptic when it comes to spiritual work - I've been on an intense eclectic spiritual path for over 35 years now. Here's just a typical quote, from p 27:\\" What is this deeper process, this deeper meaning of The Path of Awakening? Really, this path is all about how you self-interface with your physical body and mind. It is about how much of your spiritual consciousness you can get into your body at any one time. It is about bringing your \\"self\\" more fully into your body.\\"As is clear from the above quote, the hidden premiss is that the Spiritual consciousness is none other than your \\"self\\", and the \\"self\\" that the author describes in this book is in no way different from the ordinary ego. There is no discussion of the difference between the 3self\\" as ego, and the \\"Higher self\\", or even what lies beyond the Higher Self as is brilliantly discussed in Buddhism.Well that's about as deep as the book ever gets; not even ankle deep.Mr Sharp is clearly not even faintly aware of the fact that to ascend the mountain to the true summit of spiritual light, we first have to descend into the dark valley that seperates \\"our\\" mountain from the spiritual one. To go straight up into the light, is to climb our own mountain towards the false but dazzling light of the little self who is always dreaming of overcoming its inherent inferiority complex. This is the fundamental spiritual trap exposed by every great spiritual and shamanic tradition without exception. In Taoism for example, it is taught that in order to find light, you need to look into the darkness, and to go \\"up\\", you need to go \\"down\\". In the New Testament we read: \\"The last shall be first, and the first shall be last\\" etc. In The Divine Comedy, Dante first decsends into hell before ascending through the various heavens. The ancient Greeks were also very familiar with the danger of being deluded by the temptation of \\"direct ascension\\", poetically warning us through the myth of Icarus, and the myth of Promethius. We all fear going down into our own sacred darkness more than anything else because the true spiritual light that will expose our nakedness is always encountered in the sacred dark meditation space within the heart. It takes great honesty and courage to willingly and lovingly open up to the pain of having all of our illusions sacrificially shattered. And yet, that's the only place where true death and rebirth (transformation) can really happen. It doesn't happen \\"up there\\" at all, but deep within us. Direct Ascension is a false path that only leads to hubris and the search for compensatory personal power.The author offers his own bit on pop psychology by saying that we all need to face the \\"truth\\" about ourselves such as our weak points and fears, etc. But what self-help books haven't already said so thousands of times without ever explaining how to do that without the help of a psychotherapist or analyst? For those of us who are a bit naive, it is easy to be impressed by the feeling that \\"Ascension\\" includes the practice of psychological self-awareness. But the link between psychological work on oneself and spiritual unfolding has already been discussed countless times in countless books. This is nothing new, and yet it is presented as a unique and original idea in this book. The author himself has no university background in psychology, there is no sign of any knowledge on this subject deeper than skin-deep.For readers who are hoping to get some ego-strength support, the book does indeed provide a \\"feel good\\" trip. However I'm afraid that true spiritual transformation has nothing to do with stengthening our \\"self\\" by surrounding it with light."},{"Title":"Dossier of the Ascension: A Practical Guide to Chakra and Kundalini Activation","review":"Michael Sharp has come up with another winner. This one, The Dossier, goes into more depth on each chakra than his first book, \\"The Book of Life- which I also highly recommend. As humans we all face \\"fears\\"... big & little fears. His info helps you recognize what they are really all about and where they came from. What I find remarkable is how he manages to cut through all the BS of hierarchical teachings and shows us simply how we can claim and use the power that is already ours....all accomplished in a very clear & straightforward manner.Life shouldn't be a struggle and Mr. Sharp's books cut through the lies that keep reinforcing that idea.Although the Invocation was not complicated, it was incredibly powerful ... clearly we have been given a wonderful tool."},{"Title":"Dossier of the Ascension: A Practical Guide to Chakra and Kundalini Activation","review":"The best thing about Michael Sharp is that he is so practical and efficient in his approach in all of his books. Just plain straight-up language, clear and concise. When I stumbled upon his stuff, I was already going through a profound change, physically, energetically and spiritually. I went from being absolutely grounded in reality, to suddenly wondering if reality existed anymore. If it were not for finding Michael, I'd probably be prone somewhere in limbo land, or curled up in the fetal position in my closet amongst the dust bunnies. I wanted answers and I wanted them NOW. NO time to wander the earth in search of the meaning of life. I work all day for Pete's sake, I can't be holed up in an ashram or meditating on a mountain in Tibet. So I grabbed a hold of Michael's books; The Song of Creation, The Book of Life and The Book of Light, and now this one. And I screamed through them in a day or so. Could not stop reading. Up until all hours of the night. YOU HAVE TO READ THEM ALL!!!! It will be the ride of your life. Perhaps even, the ride of all the lives you've ever lived. I feel like a 10-year-old again. What ever posessed me to want to grow up and lose all the magic in the first place? So I heartily recommend you check out Michael's work and his website.

I am happy to say that this book is God-based. The book was published 2004-2006, so it is pretty current. It was preceded by \\"The Book of Life: Ascension and the Divine World Order\\". I about half-way through \\"The Book of Life\\", and it appears to be introductory in nature, so if you are new to these \\"new age\\" concepts, you may need to read \\"The Book of Life\\" first for background understanding. The author calls The Book of Life \\"the basic introductory spiritual summary and textbook for the new age of ascension\\" and \\"the first step on the Paths of Activation and Awakening.\\" So, I will refer to these books as: Book 1--Life; Book 2 - Dossier.What attracted me to \\"Dossier\\" was the portrayal of the Kundalini energy and the chakras on the cover. Many books show the colors of the chakras at the different points of entry/exit, but this book indicates what I believe to be a more accurate portrayal. In addition to the little balls of color running up the spine, rays of light extend outward and the body is encased in an elongated tubular ball of light with chakra disks spinning around the body and around the tube (like records playing). I have rarely heard anyone mention spinning disks, so that fascinated me enough to make me buy the book and validated something I had been told. Usually, most people talk about the chakras as spinning wheels, their colors, their effects on the body/health, sandskrit names etc., but not the disks.So, I began with \\"Dossier\\" because the cover drew me to it and I have been on my own spiritual path for about the last 7 years, so, I've already done a good bit of work on myself, with the help of my own personal guidance. I am also a Reiki Master, and understand the concept of metaphysical energy. If you are just beginning to learn about new age concepts, or if you begin reading \\"Dossier\\" and find you don't get it, you may need to take the author's advice and read \\"Life\\" first.I can tell you that much of what I've read in \\"Dossier\\" rings true for me and/or validates things I have already discovered on my path. I don't know about the \\"Annunaki\\" (a group of beings he speaks of), but I don't read a book expecting to totally agree with everything I read. Anyway, even if you don't believe about the Annunaki, the concepts the author speaks of are right on. For example, he speaks of how we have been held back for years in fear. If you live in fear, for example, work on it. Whether you believe the Annunaki made the fear-rules or not is immaterial. The important thing to come away with here is that fear devastates your ability to move forward. The author spends considerable time on fear, because it is an extremely important concept. With fear comes the need to control, which creates tremendous stress within you. The author attempts to explain to you why we have fear and how/why we need to face our fears and dissolve them. (And, he's soooo right!)All that said, the book is great and it covers a lot of really good material. Also, each of the 7 chakras has its own 6 - 10 page chapter. Dossier provides the most comprehensive chakra info I've found in one place to date. Each chapter provides in-depth overall info about the chakra, how/why people have experienced problems with it, what problems result from a blockage of that chakra, how the blockages result in each of the 4 main bodies (physical, etheric, emotional, astral), and how to un-block the chakra.There is a simple meditation (The Great Invocation) in the back of the book which the author recommends using daily. It is very similar to one I had been guided to begin and practice daily about a year or two ago. I have experienced considerable success with this meditation.If I could add or emphasize one thing to those on a spiritual path, it would be to try to rid yourself of ALL negativity. That means: no fear, control, jealousy, anger, etc. That's not a simple task, but, quite simply, negative energy draws negative energy to it and it's worth the effort to rid yourself of as much negativity as you can. Negativity will likely make you weak and bring you down and away from the beauty in life. If you can try to move to a place of peace, love and forgiveness as much as possible, you will likely be significantly happier."},{"Title":"Dossier of the Ascension: A Practical Guide to Chakra and Kundalini Activation","review":"After pondering the messages in Michael Sharp's books I discovered a rather profound realization. The human race is constantly looking backwards. Have you been searching for ancient wisdom, researching long standing religions, joining secret societies, traveling the planet for clues, or practicing methods and techniques pasted down from our ancestors? Why are so many of us looking into the past for the answers? Why was the Truth known by so many so long ago? There is a very common belief that the wisdom of the ages can be accessed by looking into the messages of the past.I would like to suggest there is another belief that you can leverage. The new belief is that you have the capability to establish the same connection to an all knowing consciousness that the ancient prophets and masters utilized. This point in time is unique and you no longer need to look any further than your own personal spiritual instinct. It was my experience that Michael's material is designed to stretch your awareness, expand your consciousness, shift your limiting belief system, clear your emotional blocks, balance your feminine and masculine aspects, reawaken your non-physical senses, and generally give you the very simple techniques to create a quiet and peaceful mind. I know the laundry list of items mentioned above sounds crazy from a human perspective but I have experienced all of that and more.

I am pretty much in the same manifestational chaos that I was two years ago, which is not such a good advertisement. At least now however, I know that I am the one who can change it. In my inner life, the distance I have come with Michael's help is light years from where I was. Through the revelations contained in the Dossier and The Book of Life regarding our true history and purpose, I have arrived at a place of joy and solid anticipation of breathtaking good in this world.

Absolutely enlightening."},{"Title":"Dossier of the Ascension: A Practical Guide to Chakra and Kundalini Activation","review":"This is the second in an ongoing series of books by Michael Sharp, the first being 'Thr Book of Life'. The author seeks to demystify the ascension process, predicted to occur, sometime around 2012, in consonance with the Mayan calendar coming to an end. The first book of this series dealt with the 'Why' of the process, answers to this question are further elaborated in the third book in this series, 'The Book of Light'. In this book, he confronts the 'How to' questions and provides clear-cut answers. This book is an elaboration of certain portions of the first book in the series 'The Book of Life' and contains a detailed study of the chakras in our body, how the energy flowing in them gets blocked by deep rooted thoughts and concepts embedded in our way of life, and how they can be uprooted and replaced by others, more suited to present day living. He concludes with a short discussion on Kundalini activation.One reason that gives this book its appeal, is, that the author addresses his fellow human beings as winners, who have already completed most of the preparations necessary for the ascension process and all that remains is to awake to an ongoing healing process. The author affirms that he is one of many who have been given the task of carrying forward this message of healing, that this is the reason for his writing his books and that his readers are encouraged to pick up this flag and carry it forward. The text of this book is clearly organized and very convincing indeed. I, personally, felt a greater sense of self acceptance, arising from the realization that all the suffering and pain in the past was not entirely my own doing, even though I have to take responsibility for what happened to me in order to be able to make the correct life choices. My eyes were opened to the fact that I had done better than I gave myself credit for.This book corrects many misconceptions that are endemic in our world view. In that, it could be called a book that clears the ground.

This second act of the story continues to develop the specials and drop more hints on what's really going on. Also you'll start to get a better idea of how (and why) the story ends the way it does, as was seen in the very first issue of the first book.When it comes to telling stories over a long period of time, JMS is easily one of the best. His planning and foresight is exceptional, and as the story unfolds you'll want to go back and reread the previous issues to see all the foreshadowing.As I've come to expect, the story ranges from the most intimate character development, to intense action, to very broad dramatic themes. This really is a comic to look for."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 2: Power","review":"On a whim one day, while browsing amazon.com, I decided to pick up both this and the first volume in the Rising Stars series.

It was one of the best decisions I ever made.The story is one of the most imaginative re-workings of the superhero genre I've ever read.

The storyline meandered, the powers and characters blurred together as the long-haired emo kids kept bickering over...Their Destiny! or whatever the hell they were whining about. Every woman in the series was a supermodel unless they were very old or very fat. Seriously, look at the background people in the war zone...perfect hair, full plump lips, and (if they weren't old, fat or THE NERD GIRL), their breasts were comically large even for a superhero book. The art was adequate most of the time beyond that (since that's a writer distinction as well), until the points where it became ungodly impossible, such as when one of the MIGHTY SPECIALS was putting on a comic pose and suddenly couldn't have still been alive because their kidneys would be in their throat, or their waist couldn't hold their torso up, or one arm apparently sprouts from their ear.I'd seriously pass this up, as it was so bad, it has made me reconsider how I felt about his other works.I'm not going to write up for vol. 1, since that'd make me look like I was going out of spite (which is tempting), and I don't want to waste time writing two reviews when the entire run sucked."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 2: Power","review":"With J.

Life's pathways are explored on a rich journey that brings not to endings, but to celebration and renewal.Victor di Suvero's integrated sensitivities as poet/guide hold significant power and meaning, for his experiences are in-depth and diverse. This exceptional spirit has been a political refugee, finding homes and kindred spirits in Italy, China, and the United States; the practical man is an internationally successful businessman; the personal man is the loving weaver of a caring tapestry of family and friends; and the poet is an activist from his days as youthful editor of University of California at Berkeley's literary magazine, to the published achievement of more than a half dozen books, and through to his multiple years as Director of the National Poetry Association and the establishment of powerful legacies as one of the founders of PEN New Mexico and the New Mexico Book Association.Always, Victor di Suvero is a creator and a leader. This poetry advocate established Pennywhistle Press that specializes in poetry publications and published the first bilingual collection of New Mexico's poetry. Always extraordinary, most recently, Victor di Suvero is instrumental in work toward the establishment of an International Trust for Poetry and an International Poetry Museum.As described in its Introduction, SPRING AGAIN is a quest book, reflective of witness, descent and return, hero and treasure. Just as Victor di Suvero has made meaning in life, he creates and offers archetypal fullness in this unique journey of poems. It is an offering both personal and universal, for as di Suvero declares, \\"I will not stop but will continue to acknowledge/All those others\\" (The In Betweens). With wisdom's transcendent essence, the collected poems of SPRING AGAIN \\"sing the moment between the sound of the temple bell/in the garden outside of Kyoto and its clear echo\\" (Riff #148). In the gentle flow of acceptance of shadow and light, di Suvero insightfully guides, \\"Ask no return/Of child, of lover/Or even of the busy world./It comes/When it's not asked, as wind comes,/Or rain, unexpectedly,/And then/Comes back again,/Again\\" (For Love That's Given).In the most powerful and meaningful traditions of poetry, the works in SPRING AGAIN delve, integrate, and act; they serve words' \\"immemorial functions of renewal not only in the landscape/But . . . in the hearts of those who still have the will to hope\\" (War Once More)."},{"Title":"Spring Again: New & Selected Poems","review":"These peoms drifted me into a state of blissful spring.

This is what I want poetry to sound like, and how I want it to make me feel."},{"Title":"Spring Again: New & Selected Poems","review":"The poetry in this book is sensitive, thoughtful and heartwarming .... a good read!!"},{"Title":"Spring Again: New & Selected Poems","review":"This is a thoughtful and hopeful book of poetry that called to mind two of my favorite poets, Woody Guthrie and Dylan Thomas.I thought of Woody Guthrie and his poem \\" I've Got to Know\\" while reading di Suvero's \\"Tell Us.\\" Both poems speak to the injustice and greed and fear fostered by illusions of grandeur and purported needs of socitey that serve to oppress those less fortunate. The unmistakable references to war in both poems are haunting and will give the reader, regardless of political leanings, pause especially at this point in time. It would be interesting to compare the lives and poetry of Guthrie and di Suvero. I suspect they are kindred souls that reached out and touched the stars in spite of the adversity that somehow invoked pure beauty in their writings.In a blend of sometimes subtle, sometimes humorous and always thoughtful verse the reader is taken from poems with a war theme to ones of love and life and hope. The author notes in the beginning that this collection contains \\"...some new poems, some with a bit of gray between the lines, some angry and some still filled with hope.\\" And so they are. These are not the touchy-feely type of poems that seem to be in vogue today. These are poignant, heartfelt, self-experienced poems that deal with life and love and questions that visit us all sooner or later. They truly offer faith, hope and charity in the biblical sense.Now, as to my being reminded of Dylan Thomas while reading these poems. di Suvero writes that a new book should \\"...acknowledge the past as another mistake to be undone.\\" He refuses to cease pointing out the inequities he views in life and even after close to 8 decades takes to heart Thomas's admonishment to \\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.\\" In a compelling manner di suvero continues to \\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\\"This book is worthy of the readers time. Read it slowly...twice or more and be prepared to be moved in a special way."},{"Title":"The perfect Wagnerite: A commentary on the Niblung's ring,","review":"I have read almost all of Shaw's published works which have come within my reach. I see the deterioration in the quality of his work as the aging process set in, and of his defense of such people as Djerjinski and Stalin. When he is profound, he is very profound and when he is off the mark he is way out in zoonieland. This book, fortunately, shows more of his great skill at criticism and assimilation of background data than his equally great skill at polemics. Remember, the compositionof the _Ring_ was an event of the past for him, and he was able to use historical source material. But what caught my attention was that the London newspapers of his own day ran letters trying to reconcile the &quot;Brunhilde problem&quot; in _Gotterdamerung_. All of this was a burning issue to the London intelligentsia. But, to the point: BUY this book because it is HILARIOUS, in the best sense of that word. This is Shaw, maybe not at his level best, but close to it. Learn while you laugh! The ideas propounded in this book have been burned into my memory because I have read them over and over. Read this book if you can appreciate subtle jokes."},{"Title":"The perfect Wagnerite: A commentary on the Niblung's ring,","review":"If we're going to have a voice worthy of critiquing the great master, it might as well be Shaw. For those who have not read any Shaw, he's a wickedly entertaining writer, though a bit high brow at times. This is a book for the Wagnerite and the layman alike, but expect to get a little insulted if you belong to the latter category. As to the philosophies in this little book, just about everyone who likes the Ring has their own unique opinion about its deep political/spiritual meanings, including Shaw. And although everything he writes seems obvious enough to him, I can't say I'm completely convinced by all his ideas. The book is certainly worth reading, however, just to hear the Shaw's elegant take on the musical masterpiece. (also, at least some of his ideas must be right) Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the book is its attack on Gotterdammerung, the beloved finale of the Ring. Shaw argues it is nearly devoid of underlying meaning and is a superficial conclusion to an otherwise philosophically sound work. As a final note, I appreciate the Mark Twain-like ascerbic criticism of society which seems incorrigibly imprinted in Shaw's style. This book is entertaining, and in certain places, profound. I give it four stars. (maybe 5 if he hadn't criticized Brahms!)"},{"Title":"The perfect Wagnerite: A commentary on the Niblung's ring,","review":"About twenty years ago, the BBC World Service introduced me to readings from G. B. Shaw's musical criticisms. The readings showed me that critique is as much an art as the subject of the critique. This pamphlet is a shining example of Shaw's art of criticism. Shaw presents the story, he gives some musical analysis, but most of all he presents the &quot;Ring&quot; in a philosophical and politcal slant that only Shaw could do. I suspect that the philosophy and politics are more Shaw's than Wagner's. Great for thosw who like Wagner and G.B.Shaw. Good for someone new to Der Ring des Nibelungen."},{"Title":"The perfect Wagnerite: A commentary on the Niblung's ring,","review":"Wagner, it's often said, has had more books written about him than anyone in history with the exceptions of Napoleon and Jesus Christ. This is one of the most fascinating, coming as it does from George Bernard Shaw, a penetrating music critic under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto as well as the familiar dramatist.This is GBS's take on Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung. It is a predictable mix of Shavian wit, perception and frustratingly obstinate didacticism. There is no doubt about the seriousness with which Shaw takes this massive work. He clearly sees it, still fairly fresh in people's experience as it was when his book was written, as one of the seminal works of his time. He writes to prove how much deeper its philosophy was than the simple charming fairy tale many took it for at the time. That he sees it essentially as a Shavian/Fabian fable is hardly surprising. If the book has a weakness it is, as Deryck Cooke points out in his excellent \`I Saw the World End', that the whole argument is too narrow, too one-track to accommodate the many facets and many different interpretations that can all, quite justifiably, be placed on the Ring. This of all operatic works is bigger than any of its commentators. Even Shaw was aware of that.\\"Only those of wider consciousness can follow it breathlessly, seeing in it the whole tragedy of human history and the whole horror of the dilemmas from which the world is shrinking today,\\" he wrote.When he wrote the book, Shaw intended it for the Wagner novice, helping them to a fuller understanding of the work - or, at least, how he saw it. It perhaps shouldn't be recommended for that purpose these days, but it still remains an essential read for anyone who has already started down the road to becoming a Perfect Wagnerite. Chances are you won't agree with some/most/any of it. But it is still a fascinating read for anyone with a serious interest in Wagner's works."},{"Title":"The perfect Wagnerite: A commentary on the Niblung's ring,","review":"Mister Shaw makes crystal clear everything I ever suspected about Mr. Wagner.

I was somewhat disappointed because I felt it stopped short of teaching total forgiveness. The author says it is not about reconciliation. I believe it is about reconciliation. Some ask how you can be reconciled with someone who is dead? One way is through loving and caring for the living- relatives or persons like the one who wronged you. An example was the man who started a program for drunk drivers after his wife was killed by a drunk driver.The author says total forgiveness does not mean you have to forget. You cannot forget and you ought not forget. But you can make remembering a good thing, as you show forth love to the person who wronged you. Suppose the person rejects your love? Remember you are not loving him for acceptance, but because God commands it. Do good to those who despitefully use you, the Bible says. When my husband fired his secretary, she sent him a birthday card and Christmas card for years!"},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"Beware!! This book is a combination of some truth with psycho babble of this world. Mixing truth with lies is Syncretism and this book is filled with it. I started going to a bible study and the book they picked out was \\"total forgiveness\\" with the workbook. I bought both of them and was looking forward to it. The next few days I spent at the library I read a large portion of the book. The beginning sounded good but as I came up on some of the quotes I became very concerned about the teaching. The author says we need to forgive ourselves. Nowhere in scripture does God tell us to forgive ourselves. If you are angry with yourself, hopefully it is anger towards your sins against a Holy God and causes you to repent and draws you closer to His sovereign grace. We are only forgiven in Christ and if that is done, it is done!! Romans 8, There is therefore no more condemnation for those who are in Christ. Plus, should we not take our eyes off of self and keep them on Christ. Chapter 6 is pretty bad. But if that isn't bad enough, the author has really gone off the deep end. We now need to forgive God if we are to have total forgiveness. We should forgive God for bringing hardships and trials into our lives. O My!!!! I am so thankful for the trials and tribulations for they tell me that God is chasing me and He loves me. How do you think Paul says he can rejoice in plenty and in need. Paul has learned that God is Lord of His life in every detail for his good and the Glory of God. We are being made to be like Christ and the lot you have is by the authority and will of the Almighty God so let us rejoice. I question these people who have this \\"forgiving yourself\\" thinking. It is the same as having a pity party on self. I have heard people say \\"O I've learned to forgive myself\\" What good is that going to do when you stand before a Holy God at the Great Day of judgment and you say \\"O Lord, I have learned to forgive myself\\" Do you think God will say \\"Enter into the kingdom of heaven.\\" Or even worse \\"Lord, I have forgiven You\\" This kind of thinking is a plague in our church today. Let us remember that we don't deal with flesh and blood. The powers of hate, unforgiveness of those who have wronged you and bitterness come from the father of lies. satan loves it when God's people become confused and get distracted by myths and endless geneologies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith. I Tim. 1:4 4:7 and 2 Tim. 4:4. About forgiveness: what is not possible in the flesh because the flesh wants vengence. What is not possible by the law because the law wants justice. What is possible is Christ working by His Spirit in the inner man. You can forgive others who sin against you when you have been forgiven. Those who have been forgiven much, love much. Luke 7:47 I hope this is edifying."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"This book is an invaluable aid to those who feel forgiveness is their best way to find healing, or for those whose personal beliefs demand this, but it's too simplistic to work for every trauma victim.

Angels (especially at Christmas) or darker sentinels, closing in on us all year, unkillable presences (like me), they are waiting to shrivel us even now, if we care to lift their hoods and confront them without fear.How readilly now do I forgive you -- vexed by your own endurance. So it's June again; morning will bring birdsong. Any time, especiallly at Christmas and New Year's, we recall hurtful memories about friends, lovers, parents and siblings. Many of us find it hard to forgive as it is more satisfying to strike back, or to fantasize about revenge -- showing your antagonists compassion and letting go of the desire for revenge can improve your psychological and physical health. It has been discovered that ordinary human beings who found the capacity and willingness to forgive, were better off for it.Pain and anger cause some people who were able to get on with their lives who also refused to see themselves as victims. First and foremost, we need to emphathize with the person who hurt you and consider the factors which made him commit these harmful acts. Even though these acts were not justified, the crux of forgiving is perhaps the hardest part. Forgiveness is a psychological tool to heal your own wounds so that you can get on with life and lead a happier, more positive existence.Many people fantasize that their compassion will inspire gratitude from the person who hurt them. Not likely! To forgive is a release of your most intense anger and allows you to move on and to be a better person."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"As a medical doctor, one of the most important problems that I encounter among my patients is that of bitterness, resentment,and unforgiveness.

I definitely will re-read this one over and over."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"Forgiveness today is often defined in shallow terms and trite metaphors. It is not always forgiveness as God sees it.Kendall teaches us true forgiveness-forgiveness as God forgives. The author's insight is profound, and his foundation is the Word of God. We would expect nothing less from the writer of one of the finest Joseph commentaries ever written, and that story is THE story of forgiveness. (Only &quot;With Joseph in the University of Adversity&quot; is possibly better, IF you can find it!)The key to Kendall's (and God's) forgiveness is forgiving not only the action against an offended party, but also the offender himself--sometimes, as in Joseph's case, no easy task.I recommend this book without reservation, and also Kendall's work on Joseph."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"At first I thought, what more can they say about forgiveness?

The enemy, in our spiritual battles, will make sure of it. Forgiveness is a choice and this book will lead you into an appropriate understanding as to HOW to forgive and what that means. This book could dramatically change your life, if you're honest with yourself and open minded enough to realize, it is in your hands. We must ask ourselves, if the sacrifice of Christ is sufficient enough to serve for its purpose of giving us eternal life, why is it not sufficient for its fundamental at underlying purpose of Forgiveness.

This book entiles so much and shows you how to have total forgiveness. This will also give you great understanding why it is important to forgive.I would recommend this book to who has a hard time to forgive.."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"Edit late 2012: I've renounced Christianity and religion and I've become an atheist, I've just re-read this review and I see some of the issues I had with this book are still true (maybe in spades). I totally disagree with a lot of what this author proposes and I, as I point out below, seem to see some glaring contradictions with New Testament teachings.On of the most obvious is the verse that says when someone sins it should be brought before the whole church. Of course, when this was written, churches were smaller, house churches, and the people actually loved each other. Today churches are mostly social clubs, so of course, most of the \\"life together\\" stuff is ignored.What I find funny is that my church had this guy out as a speaker and the pastors embraced him and acted as if they believed in what he had to say. When I sinned I was not only not forgiven, friends disowned me, I was banished from the church and eventually arrested for \\"annoyance\\" when I offended a Vineyard pastor. Being thrown in jail is a far cry from \\"forgiveness\\" and this was from someone that had just claimed a bit earlier he \\"loved\\" me.In any case, confrontation and working stuff out is mature and both Christians and atheists and everyone in between would be better off if such was the case, so I have to reject some of the teachings in the book about not confronting and just acting as if nothing ever happened when someone sinned (I didn't want that for myself, even being the nasty sinner).Loving people is hard work, not dealing with stuff is a cope out. Once stuff is worked out, yes, leave it in the past, but it has to be worked out, and if forgiveness is true and real, talking about what happened shouldn't be emotional and destructive anymore, it should just be the past. Ironically, some of our favorite Bible stories are ones like David seducing a young lover and having her husband killed, that wasn't buried, and he retained his position, so I don't see how it reconciles.End Edit.A friend of mine had been encouraging me to study on forgiveness and on how and why it's important for us. I had committed to do this, but it wasn't until I came across this book cleaning out some old books of my mother's that I really put my mind and heart into it. I really went through this book quickly; I kept saying \\"yeah, this applies to me\\" and \\"yes, I feel that\\" and so forth.Turns out that R.T. Kendall spoke at my old church and when I told another friend about reading the book, she handed me a c.d. of one of his sermons, which was good, he covered a section of material in the book. I found his teaching sound and helpful.More importantly I started praying and using the teaching and direction he provided right away in my life, I found that I was willing and ready to search for this freedom and peace to be had by letting go of anger, resentment, the desire to punish or get revenge and all the other things that go with being so deeply wounded, hurt and betrayed.And of course, God is there to remind me gently that I've wounded others deeply, hurt and betrayed them and so forth, the grace I desired, I had to give. This is a lifelong learning process, no doubt, but it's stepping out on the path that God really looks for and honors in our life and from there He will judge us, that is why even a cold cup of water is considered something to be rewarded for, because it is infinitely more than giving nothing.I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars for a couple reasons. First I am not sure I am able to take the accounts of Joseph and the assumptions R.T. makes about his actions at the same face value that R.T. does without more supporting evidence. It sounds good, and I'm not saying he is wrong, I'm just saying that in the text he expects the reader to take a lot for granted.Another problem area I have is the idea of non-confrontation with those that have caused injury, I certainly understand the vantage point that R.T. comes from, but I'm not sure how he squares that with such verses as this from Luke: \\"If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.\\" And from Matthew 18: \\"If your brother or sister sins go and point out their fault, just between the two of you.\\" It seems to me that R.T. has taken an extreme position, not of forgiveness, which we are called to extend, but in the matter in which we deal with hurts and such.He also suggests only talking about the wounding to one other person, a counselor, for therapeutic reasons, and I have a couple things to say, one, I believe that in a healthy marriage couples should be able to freely share their hurts (not just ones received from each other) and in true community groups (i.e. \\"Life Together\\") that people should have an assortment of close friends they can share their hurts with. Of course it can be done in unhealthy ways, but I don't read the extreme position R.T. has in the scripture or in other writers on this issue of forgiveness (again, NOT the forgiveness, but the way we go about working it out in real life).Those couple issues aside, this is a great book and I strongly recommend it. I am striving in my life now to put it into practice, to pray for those that have hurt me, to extend grace and blessing to those that have wounded me, even as I dearly covet grace and mercy from others, for as God knows, I'm a sinner and I have caused my share of pain and suffering in others that I'd like to receive grace for instead of the full penalty of my sin.A common theme I've noticed in these types of books is that I have found myself recommending more and more that they are gone over in a small group setting, really studying what the author is trying to say and trying to encourage each other to put the ideas into practice. I'm on this path currently and it seems to be the only way, working out this stuff in community."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"This is an excellent book on forgiveness. R.T.

It has changed my life and my mindset about enemies/evil doers. Forgiveness is more about us than our offenders and if I ever hope to be effective in prayer and ministry to others I must forgive because here is where my anointing lies. The principles contained in this book opposed my belief system and I wrestled with the truth I received but I resigned to let God be God. Jesus is the way the truth and the life and it is just stupid to rebell against that. I am so glad I read this book and I recommend it to everyone who has ever been deeply hurt by people you loved and trusted."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"This book has excellent insights to the scriptures about God's commands to forgive others . . . and also the scriptures about not judging others. I also especially appreciated R.T. making the distinction about what it means when God says if we don't forgive others their trespasses that He (God)will not forgive our trespasses. Many of us probably have always thought of this in terms of keeping our salvation, but as R.T. pointed out in this regard, our salvation is not by works. It is only by the shed blood of Christ on Calvary to all who believe and receive Him into their lives by faith. When we have an unforgiving attitude toward others, there is no harmony in the relationship, and so it is with Christ. We grieve the Holy Spirit and lose fellowship with God when we refuse to forgive others when Christ has already forgiven us for so much. And then on judging, who are we to think we can take the place of God and judge others. Only God is our righteous and just judge. There is so much more than what I've mentioned here. Everyone, whether a believer or non-believer, can find much help in this book."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"As a pastor and also a counselor a majority of the people I meet with are dealing with some level of forgiveness. Unfortunately, by the time they begin to try to deal with these serious issues they have already read or bought into some version of modern psychology (Christian or Secular). The Biblical and practical truths in this book demolish modern psychology and relativistic thinking which seeks to encourage will-power, positivism or a &#34;self-centered&#34; approach as the means of healing. In this book, a very quick read, you will be able to identify the root of offense, hurt, revenge and other emotional challenges that block the road to healing and forgiveness. Of course, R.T. will give you ample Biblical support for his position and real life application."},{"Title":"Total Forgiveness","review":"I haven't read all of the book yet but what I have read is very helpfull.

Oh how I've fallen short in the past!This journey to forgiveness enlightenment also showed me that I had not trusted God to handle the situations in my life that had caused me the most pain and grief. I felt that my enemies would not get their comeuppence if I turned them over to God.

I absolutley love her kind demeanor when she writes her book! I would reccomend this book to any new mom =)"},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"I was given this book by a girlfriend who highly recommended it, and I have to say that I am very pleased. As a first-time (and let's be honest, clueless) parent, I found the author's practical and straight-forward advice helpful in managing my expectations of life with a newborn. She is a big proponent of a flexible routine which is somewhere in between the regimented schedule approach and the responsive or \\"on-demand\\" approach to infant care. This philosophy seems to blend a little of both, and with our active, busy schedules, it resonated with us.While I may not agree with everything in the book, (for example, she is not a big fan of pacifiers and we gave in so as not to make a gassy baby more so by crying and gulping air), I understand and appreciate the consistent logic in her approach. Another example is her view on monitors. I understand why she says she is not a fan, and I am sure there are a few new parents out there who could probably benefit from that advice. In our case, however, with a low birth weight baby, our Angelcare monitor has given us the piece of mind so we CAN sleep. (Now if only our son would allow that on a more regular basis...ha!)I had never even thought to consider some of her recommendations before, like napping in places other than the crib or bassinet and not having black-out curtains to encourage flexibility in the child, and they make perfect sense. I also like her writing style which comes across like having a long sit-down with a grandmother or aunt in-the-know. She is supportive, and the whole point of being flexbile is that tomorrow is a new day and a chance to try again. To be frank, the last thing I need is to feel guilty or bad when something does not go according to plan.The best things about this book to me are the chapter on establishing flexible routines and that the book is less than two hundred pages. The first is great because she breaks down her philosophy into neatly outlined, daily plans based on the age of the infant. While she does encourage on-demand nursing for the first week plus to encourage milk supply, her suggested routines can start as early as day one (an every four hours plan) and continue through the first year, so any time a parent is ready to give it a go, they have a clear place to start. She also has an amended routine for babies under seven pounds, so in our case, that was especially helpful. Simply put, we started a three-hourly routine when we were ready, and the extra feeds have allowed our son to start catching up in weight. My second favorite thing about this book is the size. While the author offers some basic information and recommendations on infant care and health, even touching on the spiritual needs of the infant for those who are interested, the book is a quick read and when sleep-deprived, easy to cart around, so no one has to memorize the details. We have happily gone from every two plus hour feeds at birth to every three to four hours during the day and every five to six at night starting at around six weeks. Some days are better, some are worse, but we are confident we are heading in the right direction.If you are looking for a comprehensive desk reference on everything baby-related you can think of, this is not that book. But, if you are looking for help with the basics and a solid approach, based on years of actual, practical application this could be the book for you."},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"This book improved my life dramatically. After making a billion mistakes with our first child, who didn't sleep through the night until he was three, I found this book and changed the way I did everything. I didn't need the baby basics chapters but the rest of it is worth it. Yes, you might want to tweak some things. But her ideas for getting the baby on a schedule (maybe obvious to some but not to me!), getting him/her to settle and sleep all night, were priceless. My six month old is a champion sleeper and I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"I found this book by accident. It is by far the best baby book I have seen. It has just the right amount of information for a new mother - lots of practical advice and is presented in a friendly, flexible tone. I finally was able to pick up on how to burb and establish a routine. These things seem simple, but as a new mother I finally \\"got it\\" after reading the very practical, straight-forward information in this book. My baby is 6 weeks and is much happier. She sleeps more on this schedule, but is much less fussy when she is awake. As a result, I am much less stressed and have more time for other things. This book also established the right priority level and family roles in my mind. I don't think this was the intent of the book, but all of the info has worked for us so far and has improved my confidence and coping skills as a mother. This book and author deserves more publicity in the states. I hope she writes a toddler book."},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"I liked this book. I'm on my second child, and so thought I'd read them all, but then this one came along and I really just wanted to see what it was all about. Probably mostly out of curiosity because the author was nanny to Apple Martin (Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter). I have a 2-year old and an 8-week old and was pretty set on \\"sleep training\\" my youngest as early as possible. With my older daughter, we waited until she was about one year, and we just couldn't face that kind of exhaustion in our household. This book was a big help in that it clearly laid out 24-hour schedules from birth through the 1st birthday, something which I've actually not seen in any other book (in my recollection). I appreciated this and started on the schedule when my baby was 5 weeks old and within days (no exxageration) she was sleeping at a 5-hour stretch at night. Now, at 8 weeks, she is sleeping for 7 hours at a stretch, is strictly breastfed (which she will be until she turns one) and is a happy, calm and content little girl. I didn't think it was possible to have a breast-fed infant sleep this long at night, but this book with it's highly detailed schedules showed me otherwise. So if you are interested in sleeping well at night with a newborn, this is a wonderful book. But if you are looking for any other pearls of wisdom, there are a number of other books you can read that have more comprehensive information (I enjoyed the \\"What to Expect\\" series and \\"The Baby Book\\" from Dr. Sears.) One note: if you are a follower of Dr. Sears and attachment parenting, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF EXCELLENT ADVICE. I LOVED IT. EASY TO READ."},{"Title":"Baby Book","review":"I was completely disappointed with this book. It is truly for first time moms and concentrates on what to have on hand before the baby is even born. Being a second-time mom, I flipped through the first 2/3 of the book before I found anything on AFTER the baby comes. Then, it only really went into proposed sleeping schedules which was redundant and unhelpful. Aside from sleeping, there is no discussion on the \\"first year\\". It is all about schedules. The irony is that she is advocating a flexible schedule, but basically gives us her own schedules to follow.Furthermore, I had a hard time understanding some of the British phrases. For example, wind the baby. Does this mean burp? Is cot a bassinette?"},{"Title":"Blake or the Huts of America","review":"When Martin Delany wrote this book, he was along with his sometime collaborator Frederick Douglass, one of the two most prominent African American leaders in the country, and like Douglass his reputation extended beyond the United States to England and other parts of Europe. Unlike Douglass, Delany was even known in West Africa from which he recently returned where he had negotiated with AFrican leaders about with his economic and political plans. Indeed, in the months while Blake was published as a serial in the Anglo-African newspaper, Delany toured the US lecturing on Africa wearing African robes!Delany's book is one in a series of texts written by African American authors in response to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Despite Stowe's assistance to this project by writing small poems introducing it,one of the sub texts of Blake is to show the difference between the realities of Slavery and the picture Stowe painted in Uncle Tom. Indeed, Daleny's hero Henry Blake is placed in the exact same place time and position as Uncle Tom, but instead of heroically suffering and dying and inspiring while refusing to physically resist slavery, Henry Blake runs away from slavery to organize an international revolution against slavery.(To be fair, Stowe admits in Uncle Tom's Cabin her book made slavery seem nicer than it really was because she believed slavery was so awful that the white Northern readers she targeted would be too disgusted to read a book that accurately described it. Moreover, by the time Delany wrote Blake, Stowe's views had become more militant. She had written Dred, a book whose Black hero leads a slave revolt.)Blake reflects the deep pessimism of the period, ironically only a few years before the end of slavery. In fact, though he was born free and had no fear of the fugitive slave laws, Delany had left the United States and moved to Chatham, Ontario by the time he wrote Blake, so despairing he was of the future of Black men. Delany urged Black people to leave the United States and proposed building an independent Black nation in Central America that could be a base for liberation of the slaves in all of the Americas.This task is taken upon in fictional guise by Henry Blake the hero of this novel. He escapes and goes on a travel through the slave and free states of the US, in a round based on the travels in Uncle Tom, on an itnerary that had become standard for books about slavery in this period. Blake's conclusion is that the slaves and even well-off freed blacks lack the leadership, culture, or education to lead a revolt of their own.The solution to this problem is found by Blake when Blake reveals that he is actually Henricus Blaccus, a distinguished, cultured Afro-Cuban captured into American Slavery. He leaves the US for Cuba and rejoins a company of similarly well off, cultured, and artistic Afro-Cubans conspiring to overthrow slavery and Spanish rule and make Cuba into a base for African liberation. What is interesting is that Delany depicts these Afro-Cuba conspirators holding opulent cultural evenings rich with poetry and with artistic playing of the \\"African Banza.\\" Possession of our own culture, and a distinguished and even aristocratic elite, seem to Delany to be the prerequisites of a successful revolution.We don't have all of the copies of the Anglo African which published this as a serial. What we have ends when the conspirators appear to be about to launch their revolt in Havana, but we do have a fascinating look at Delany a Black leader of the 19th Century whose ideas and outlook was quite similar to that of Black militant leaders of the late 20th Century.Besides its message, the descriptions of life under slavery in the US, make this book a central text to truly understand slavery and the AFrican American response. Delany's journalism in anti-slavery publications about Cuba and the Poet Placido who he fictionally places at the head of the Afro-Cuban rebels, indicates he was misinformed about the opportunities for Afro-Cubans, the severity of slavery in Cuba, and the degree to which Placido's poetry identified with his African, as opposed to European, lineage. Yet, Delany's fictionalization of a revolutionary cultural nationalist upheaval launched in Cuba makes his plan for Pan Africanist revolt against slavery seem vivid exciting and unique.It is also a testament to Delany's leadership, that once the Civil War began, he dropped his belief there was no hope for freedom in the United States. He militantly campaigned for African Americans to join the Union Army. In fact, Delany became a Major in the US Army, the highest ranked African American during the Civil War other than a few doctors who severed in all Black hospitals."},{"Title":"Blake or the Huts of America","review":"One commentor argued that Delany was misinformed about Cuba and that he later dropped his concept of African American separatism. Neither of these are necessarily true. Delany used Placido as a leader of Cuban rebellion not because he actually was, but because Delany was trying to create hope in African Americans that there was a Pan African world fighting for liberation. Also, Delany's joining of the army during the Civil War is not necessarily reflective of droping his belief that there was no hope for Africans in the Americas. He simply joined the military because he was dedicated to freeing the Africans FIRST, with the hope that later they can create their own state. Delany was a Garvey before his time. Unfortunately he is written off by European Americans and those that wish to please them as a \\"militant\\" or a \\"radical\\". What's militant or radical about fighting for freedom?His idea that separatism was better was not about reverse racial prejudice, he just believed (as did many judges in Plessy Vs Ferguson) that Africans had to liberate themselves and build together before they could be equals. In fact his belief is resonate today; though there are African Americans who are successful, the vast majority remain in ghettos. Yes, Delany's message was never about reverse racial prejudice, but about creating an African society that was not the foot stool of a European one."},{"Title":"Blake or the Huts of America","review":"Great book!

That text concentrated on the actions of a single programmer or designer. Now in TSP, Humphrey expands the scope, to discuss what it means to lead and motivate a team of programmers. The acronym TSP stands for Team Software Process. But a close reading of the text suggests that you do not have to take \\"Software\\" literally. Your team might be a bunch of engineers or architects or financial analysts.Though, to be sure, the examples in the text and several of the guidelines pertain explicitly to code development. Yet if you are a flexible enough manager and team leader, you might be able to generalise those guidelines to your situation.Humphrey makes several remarks that some readers might cheer. He suggests that knowledge of specific tools and methods, while useful, is secondary to amassing an experienced and capable team. If you can do this, then they will surely be able to quickly pick up expertise in those tools or methods. If you have looked at job postings, you have undoubtedly come across those with a laundry list of detailed required skills. Some of which are mundane and low level. But try convincing that company's HR department of this!On the subject of team building, he dumps on commercial team building exercises. You know. Where some consulting firm charges your company a huge amount for taking your team to an offsite location for a day of artificial exercises. While these may indeed build some espirit de corps, typically these is no relation to the actual work environment and real issues facing your team. But because team building is such an intangible thing, and impossible to quantify, the team wastes a day and the consulting firm makes money.These two examples are actually minor parts of the text. But they really struck me (and perhaps you) as being very cogent analysis. Somewhat cynical maybe, but Humphrey has his wits about him."},{"Title":"TSP: Leading a Development Team (The SEI Series in Software Engineering)","review":"Excelente obra que nos muestra la forma en como sacar provecho de los equipos de trabajo en el desarrollo de proyectos de software.

I agree with Mr. Scott about the excellence of Mr. Krick's essay. Of course, Mr. Scott is a renowned historian and an acknowledged expert on R.E. Lee and his campaigns, so I guess I must apologize for putting him to sleep. My bad. I'll use shorter words next time."},{"Title":"Audacity Personified: The Generalship of Robert E. Lee","review":"The real audacity personified isn't Lee, it is the editor for advancing the position taken by the essays in this book. The entire effort is little more than an attempt to re-package Freeman's notion that Lee was somehow more than a mortal man. This book simply argues the same old line but for allegedly different reasons."},{"Title":"Audacity Personified: The Generalship of Robert E. Lee","review":"The essay by Robert E. L. Krick on Lee's staff is excellent. Too bad, because it is contained in a volume with very god-awful other essays.

She loves it, and has me read it several times a day. It is the perfect size for her to flip through herself. She now says socks, cup, ball, leaf, flower, kitty-cat, doggie, and duck. A month ago she only said duck out of those words. I think this book has helped her vocabulary a tremendous amount."},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"This book is well made and was a nice little gift for my daughter, who was 16 months when I gave it to her. We have a collection of several of these types and this one is just as good as the others. Good price also, but I think I saw it at a local book store for a little cheaper or the same price. I think this is essential to your child as he/she is just learning to recognize words/shapes/etc.Update written on 3/16/11--- I was revisiting my past reviews and thought it was important to note that it is 5 months later and this book is still in almost the same condition it was when I bought it!

Bright contrasting colors, simple concepts, and vivid pictures keep her attention while I read to her. I also like the sturdy construction, definitely toddler proof. We're planning on getting the other books in the series for her birthday."},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"I purchased this book for my 16 month old son for Christmas. Out of all the \\"first words\\" books out there, I found this to be the best-bright colors, one picture per page (others have too many pictures on one page). I will ask my son to find the apple, fish, etc. and he will flip through the pages to find them. He also learned how to say several of the words from this book! Perfect size for toddlers, can take in the car.I went back to Barnes & Noble to buy the set, but they don't sell them anymore-so, of course I purchased them from Amazon."},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"This book is sturdy, durable, visually interesting, well-designed and a great place to launch an infant's interest in books, photos and naming the real-life items he/she sees every day. Bright Baby First Words is part of a wonderful series of board books which includes Bright Baby Animals and Bright Baby Colors (both of which I also highly recommend). Rather than confusing an infant's eyes with an array of images all at once, the nice thing about these books is that they are laid out very simplistically with one photograph and word per page on a solid-colored background. No clutter and no distractions. For the infant who is just starting to point at everything in the world and seek \\"identification tags\\", this entire series is the perfect first set of books.Ever since he was an infant, my son has kept coming back to these books. I think it is because they can be easily adapted to teach a variety of concepts and they evolve to meet his constantly changing points of interest. I give this book five stars for a variety of reasons including the simple visual images it provides, the focused learning it encourages, and the variety of ways in which it can be used to teach not just words, but also other concepts such as colors. With its beautiful photography of real-life images set against simple, solid backgrounds, this book is definitely a solid choice with which to start your child's home library!"},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"This book is fantastic! We have several \\"first words\\" books and this is my 20 month old's favorite by far. The fact that each word is tied to a photograph of an object, rather than an artist's rendering, is much easier for him to process and understand. So not only can he say the corresponding word to each picture as we page though the book, but then when he encounters the real object, his mind makes the association much more quickly...helping him to learn words at a faster pace! Highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"Gorgeous, colorful pictures of everyday items. My toddlers go to it again and again."},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"The pictures in this book are so vibrant. And the cover is made of a nice material that doesn't come off when my daughter gnaws on it. The corners are curved, so they don't poke.My 7 month-old loves to look through this book on her own, or have it read to her. It's one of her favorites!My only complaint (very minor) is that the teddy bear in it is really ugly and it shows a polo shirt and labels it \\"t-shirt\\" and shows a light jacket and calls it a \\"coat\\". Minor minor issues. No biggie.Get this book!"},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"We were given this book in the hospital when my daughter was born as a gift from a community literacy project. Now, at 7 months, it is one of her favorites. The format is perfect for a young baby with only one word and its corresponding picture per page. The beautiful photographs are set against a colorful background and the pages hold my daughter's attention much longer than most of the books specified for her age. The other bonus is its sturdy construction. Since my daughter loves to explore her books with her mouth, her other board books quickly become worn around the edges. Not this one. The durable material of which it is made is holding up beautifully. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"My 14-month-old loves this book. It's easy to hold and loaded with great photos. I think reading these books to her has helped her learn many new words in the past two months. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"This book is great. The reason I like this book so much is because there are only two pictures to look at at a time. The pictures have bright colored backgrounds. There isn't too much information for the kids at once. This has been helpful with my twins since naming objects have been difficult. I can say, \\"point to the banana\\" and there are only two choices. I am ordering the other books too."},{"Title":"Bright Baby First Words","review":"I had one of the Bright Baby books (colors) in my daughter's \\"library.\\" I liked it so much better than most of what she had because it was one object per page with a big, real picture. Many of her other books had multiple pictures per page which made it hard to focus on one image or they had cartoonish pictures that weren't always a good representation of what they were supposed to be. Based on the ease and clarity of the Bright Baby Colors book, I ordered the First Words and the Animals books. I am not disappointed. With these books, there's one picture per page for my daughter to point to and for me to tell her what it is. I can tell that she's recognizing these pictures a lot easier and a lot quicker than images in other books. They are definitely a great tool for fun learning."},{"Title":"The legal rights of union stewards","review":"when to argue, what to say, what laws to use and how to use them!this book will make you into a super steward!!!

What's so delightful about it (besides the detailed patterns) is that the objects are illustrated in fully-realized miniature scenes, like a mom reading a magazine in a macrame hammock in the back yard, head on a knitted pillow, baby on the ground beside her in a basked with knitted baby blanket, rompers and booties, and the basket's on a red knitted blanket spread on the grass. Or a kitchen scene with two elderly ladies seated by the stove working on hand crafts; one is knitting, the other embroidering. One has a granny-square lap robe, the other a woven shawl; knitted dishtowel and tea cosy, braid rug, X-stitch sampler and more are in the picture. Not to mention a pig rolling on the rug... It has a separate chapter on each the crafts...well, let me give you the chapter titles: 1. Knitting and Crochet (cushions, blankets, housewares, toys) 2.

The photographs of the items in room settings are lovely, and the patterns given are useful. My only complaint is that because the book was written and published in England, the needle sizes and yarns to be used for knitted and crocheted items are pure guesswork. A conversion chart should have been included for American sales.

I've had it for a good while and have made things from it. The patterns and instructions are clear and easy to understand.

The border, in fact, will not even be symmetrical (as the picture is).

Claudia grew up with an alcoholic mother who embarrassed her. She never brought friends home. Her father refused to admit the problem or get the right kind of help. Apparently that's the reason Claudia is now a difficult person. She is extremely competitive, works seven days a week, is very good at her job, and never wants to marry or have kids. She is head producer of a TV show. Leandro is head producer of a rival TV show. Their paths cross. They end up having hot, heavy, addictive, passionate sex. She wants a one-night-stand. He can't forget about her and starts sending her gifts. They end up seeing each other a lot. He is patient, kind, generous, and caring. She fights him at several points along the way, and that's where my problem is. She comes off mouthy, sarcastic, selfish, bitchy, mean, and you-don't-own-me-attitude. At one point she wants to break up because she thinks there is a risk he might see scripts from her TV show and use it for his own show. Later she wants to break up because she realizes he cares for her. Later she does break up with him because she insists she never wants kids and he eventually will. He says let's not worry about the future. Let's enjoy what we have and see where it takes us. But no she won't. I did not enjoy this. She was unsympathetic. I'm not saying all main characters must be likeable. Sometimes a \\"bad girl\\" can be entertaining. S.E. Phillips did it well in \\"Ain't She Sweet.\\" I'm just saying that a heroine with problems can be done in a more engaging way. Here's a minor example of conversation that did not appeal to me. She and Leandro are on the way to meet with a criminal. Leandro asks her if she is nervous. She says no. But she is. It wasn't a big deal, but something about it bothered me. Why lie about something so minor?Regarding spoilers. I really don't think I'm doing spoilers above. From the beginning she tells him she does not want marriage and kids. And since most romance novels have a break up, my mentioning the break up should not be a surprise. My intent is to let you know the main story is all about her personal issues.The sex scenes are good. There are several.NARRATOR:The narrator Elizabeth Livingston seemed ok, but I wonder if she hurt the interpretation of Claudia. Claudia's character sounded whiny, bitchy, and arrogant. I wonder if a different narrator could have made Claudia more likeable or sympathetic.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 7 hrs and 26 mins. Swearing language: mild. Sexual language: moderate.

It is mostly comprised of alphabetical /categorized lists of plants which grow in Whatcom County.The first chapter briefly discusses the types of landscapes in which Whatcom County plants grow: sandy beaches; gravelly prairies; cliffs and ledges along the seashore; salt marshes. For each landscape there's a list of plants you might find there. A table shows plants found in various Whatcom lakes.There are only a handful of photos, in the early part of the book: black and white shots of a landscape (a field, or a slope of Mt. Baker), and a couple of trees. They're fairly small, and not detailed.If you/re a botanist, or just need a list of plants which were known to exist in Whatcom Co. in 1941, this may be useful to you.But if you're looking for an illustrated guide to local flora, I wouldn't recommend this book. It's not really a field guide; and there are some terrific field guides out there. (Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast is my favorite such field guide; it's very well illustrated, with detailed color photos and clearly organized.)"},{"Title":"Knights of Malta: 900 Years of Care","review":"This book was great.

He wrote from a perspective that was limited to the lens of &#34;modern science&#34; at that time (early 1900's). I feel this book has historic value -- to show what people were thinking a hundred years ago about the Bible. But this book has no particular value today for people who want to understand the message of the Old Testament.This is not the place for me to argue for a conservative approach to the Old Testament, but it is just a word for those who are not familiar with the author of this (Free!) book.

At first, it was difficult to get into the writing, as I am used to books that are written on a more difficult reading level, however, when I managed to move past this, I enjoyed the book. The basic premise of having two groups of people whom are stranded on a planet and fighting an ancient, and now resolved, war is fascinating. The differences in the two cultures both from the past and the &quot;present&quot; fuels this book. And the ending,though it is somewhat predictable once you get into the book and understand the feelings of the two warring groups, is definitely interesting. In fact,I loved the ending. If you're looking for a quick read, I would highly suggest reading this book. It is entertaining and the story is interesting."},{"Title":"The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)","review":"I love history and this book actually has a Starfleet historian who gets the chance to meet with a legendary Starfleet Captain, Lucien Murat.

A thinking man's Star Trek that doesn't just rely on battles and ray-guns. It deals with important issues that transcend the pulp novel genre.

And amazingly, his editor either let them pass or didn't notice them!!!!! He sets the war with the Tarn at around 204 years ago (from the current Stardate of TNG), but then says that Captain Murat (who fought in this war) was a contemporary of Christopher Pike, who was just right before Kirk. Now according to Star Trek chronology, that makes it just around 100 years or so ago! Maybe stretching it, even 150 years ago, not 204 years ago! Another one, this mistake was really stupid...he constantly CONFUSES the word &quot;ancestor&quot; for the word &quot;descendant&quot;. In one sentence he has Commander Riker as saying the Enterprise is the ancestor of the Verdun (Captain Murat's ship), but duh! obviously he means the reverse....the Enterprise being a descendant of the Verdun! This is a mistake I would expect a high school student to make, not a published author! Other than that, the story is good."},{"Title":"The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)","review":"This book has a lot to recommend it, and the reviewers enthusing below are not altogether off the mark. It is well-written,the story is interesting, the characters are lively (particularly the alien admiral), the battle scenes are vivid, and the ending is clever. However, characters change rank from chapter to chapter, the math is frequently wrong, and the Star Trek continuity errors are glaring enough for a reader with a fairly low-intensity interest in the series (e.g. me) to notice them. It is an enjoyable book, with more cerebral and philosophical awareness than most mass-market novels, but it's not quite a masterpiece. END"},{"Title":"The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)","review":"I really liked this one. It has some good action sequences and a good plot line. I'm only giving it four stars though, in light of two problems that both the author and the editor's missed out on. One, the author repeatedly refers to &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; having been going on for over two hundred years. This is no problem, right up to point in which he refers to Captain/Commodore Lucian Murat's command being during the same time as Captain Kirk and the Enterprise. Last I checked, there was only approximately a centuries time between Captain Kirk's era and Captain Picard's. My second minor problem is that the author seemed to have the idea that a Galaxy Class starship like the Enterprise has only one transporter. I understand his need for the transporter's to be down to move the story along, however, he should've come up with something else besides what he did.As I stated before though, besides the two minor problems, this is a really good Trek novel that is in keeping with the &quot;Great Bird of the Galaxy's&quot; principals and ideas of what Star Trek should be.A really good first Star Trek novel by the author. He captured the Trek regular's personalities really well and came up with some good characters on both sides of the conflict. I really liked the Tarn Admiral Jord. It was especially interesting to see basically twenty century weapons of war being used in a trek book. I hope this author put's another work into the trek library soon. Definitely a book I recommend to any and all who read Star Trek."},{"Title":"The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)","review":"A bit weak for a four-star rating, this book was just a tad too good for a three star rating. It is an interesting look at the likely results of a war between two implacable enemies, with both sides equally advanced technologically and neither side able to get enough of an edge to win conclusively. The book is well-written in terms of technical merit and well-edited in terms of avoiding the typos and other similar errors all too common in mass-market paperbacks, and it has good characterizations and good pacing.One minor quibble is that it postulates a war in the \\"past history\\" of the Federation that clearly never happened in the \\"canonoical\\" Star Trek universe, (surely, if there had been even a semi-major conflict early in the history of the Federation that involved a species of sentient lizards as the opposition, it would have been mentioned long since -- during the episode \\"Arena\\", in which Kirk and the original Enterprise run afoul of a similar alien race, the Gorn, if at no other time) so obviously, this book is an \\"alternate timeline\\" story, even if neither the author nor the editors and publisher are aware of that fact. That quibble, plus a sincere doubt that Picard's solution to the problem would have worked (can't say more without offering up a spoiler) are enough to drop the rating a point, and the sub-plot between Riker and his old flame seemed rather superfluous and irrelevant, but not quite enough to justify the loss of a second star."},{"Title":"The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)","review":"What happens when a war is over, but not all people get that message? 2nd Lt.

Over two hundred years earlier, humans had been at war with the reptilian Tarn. One of the fighters was the legendary Starfleet Captain Lucien Murat. His fate, and the fate of his ship and crew, was unknown,Centuries later, Captain Picard, the crew of the Enterprise, and a Tarn observer find the remains of Murat's ship, as well as the remains of a Tarn ship.

I read this book because it was Star Trek, and frankly, was not too impressed. It wasn't bad, but not that great either. The whole thing about the old captain in stasis was a stretch, but then, I guess why that is why they call this genre science fiction. All of the characters were in character, especially Picard. The only exception being that Riker has a past relationship with a Non Alien, which surprised me. Doesn't he usually prefer Aliens. And where was La Forge in this story? Guinan? O'Brien? Spot?

The only reason I bought this book was because it was written by Forstchen, whose Lost Regiment books are superb. However, like ALL the Star Trek books I have read, it was a great disappointment. And I am a Star Trek fan, having seen every episode of the original series several times.The only thing that I can think of that would explain this piece of tripe put out by a great writer of military SciFi is that he needed the money. Otherwise, the writing, character development, and everything else is hack writing at its worst (or best, its competently done genre fiction, just not worth buying brand new--look for it in a used-bookstore or your local library).If you want to read a really good story by the same author, look for any of his Lost Regiment series."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I'd say this is certainly not Dostoyevsky at his finest, but for the most part, the book was entertaining. Occasionally you might ask who you are reading about, Dostoyevsky or Aleksander Petrovich (if anyone knows the answer, e-mail me), or you might wonder when the book is going to end. But this is compromised for by its fascinating content explaining, at great length in detail, brutal Siberian prison life in the 19th century. It is worth reading nearly 400 pages to hear about the punishments of the convicts, the ways vodka was smuggled into the prison. In the midst of all this is a certain mood among the prisoners: depressed, but finding friendship among their fellow convicts. No other book can depict such an atmosphere, and now we have no idea what one was like, except if we read The House of the Dead. Dostoyevsky is a very good writer, in my opinion. I suggest this book."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"This book was a memoir of Dostoyevsky's experience of his time spent in a Siberian jail. Armed only with a bible and his wit he spent over 5 yrs in this prison. House of the dead is his account of this experience and it has all the crushing truth in it. This is one of the great novels in Russian literature. If you like the Russian writers there is no question you will enjoy the read, if not this is one hell of a way to be introduced."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"\\"A whaling ship was my Harvard and my Yale!\\" That's what Herman Melville declared, approximately, through his mouthpeice Ishmael in his supreme novel-of-information Moby Dick. I'm fairly sure no critic has ever linked Melville and Dostoevsky - more specifically, Moby Dick and The House of the Dead - and I'd never have made the connection if I hadn't just re-read the former. Dostoevsky, nevertheless, celebrates much the same net learning experience; his four actual years in prison labor camps in western Siberia were the Harvard and Yale of his craft as a writer and of his \\"spiritual\\" regeneration. He says it specifically at the beginning of the penultimate chapter of House (An Escape), if you want to check. By that time in the book, his literary narrative mask has completely slipped and he surely is speaking for himself.Both Moby Dick and House of the Dead are survivor's tales. Both are told by first-person narrators, although Dostoevsky's surrogate narrator, Aleksandr Goryanchikov, is not fully consistent as a literary device. Both are extremely discursive and parenthetical, spending far more words on description of other inmates/crewmates than on themselves. Just as Moby Dick is as much an account of the whaling industry as a tale of adventure, House of the Dead is a journalistic description of the Tsarist prison facilities, both of their management and of their sociology. Readers looking for a story are likely to be under-stimulated by both books. Most important, both books reveal crises in the lives of their authors -- personal epiphanies almost concealed by the plethora of externalities -- but the two authors travel in opposite directions. Moby Dick is, on one level, a confrontation with loss of belief, a parabola from complacent faith to existential skepticism. Dostoevsky's parabola curves from naive individualism, expressed as political radicalism, to a \\"resurrection\\" and redemption based on religious mysticism. How odd that the two books were written within roughly a decade of each other!I started to read The House of the Dead with a different comparison in mind. I'd just finished Alexander Solzhenitsyn's \\"Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" and I expected to find some interesting similarities and/or contrasts between these two books about Russian imprisonments. 'Ivan' and 'House' do depict equivalent misery and viciousness in the Tsarist and the Stalinist labor-camp prisons in Siberia. 'House\\" is no a literary phosphorescent flare of the blue flame intensity of 'Ivan', so it might pass unnoticed that conditions hadn't changed much from 1850 to 1940. In fact, Dostoevsky distracts his readers from the horrors of his prison by including large swathes of humor, depictions of jollier times and of the little evasions and corruptions of the system that make prison almost tolerable. Dostoevsky undoubtably offers the more realistic and rounded portrait; reading the House of the Dead exposes the deliberate unreality of A Day in the Life. Solzhenitsyn's Day cannot be extrapolated into Dostoevsky's years; 365 of Ivan's \\"days\\" in a row would be inconceivable. No one could survive them realistically. There's a summer even in Siberia.Dostoevsky explicitly places his ego-surrogate in the House of the DEAD, from which his release constitutes a resurrection. Solzhenitsyn's Ivan is metaphorically in Hell, the frozen Hell of ancient northern myths. And now, having read these two books close together, I feel very strongly that Ivan Denisovich is intended as more than a portrait of an individual. Instead, he's a metaphor also, a synecdoche of the common folk of Russia imprisoned in the absurd inefficiency and misery of their Stalinist Hell. All the more amazing, isn't it, that Nikita K authorized the publication of 'Day'! Somebody in his office wasn't a very deep reader. 'A Day in the Life' is also a survivor's tale, but definitely not a resurrection myth. There's no further destination after Ivan's Hell; survival is perpetual defiance at best.\\"The House of the Dead\\" isn't a great literary accomplishent. It can hardly be called a novel -- more a thinly disguised memoir -- but it's fascinating to read as a piece of sociology and it certainly opens the reader's comprehension of Dostoevsky's later masterpieces."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"In this book, the narrator shares a part of his imprisonment experience in Siberia in the 1850s.He describes the inmates in his barrack with remarkable perception and insight. Most importantly, he rises above the question of moral and character, resulting in a broader implication of his discoveries in the prison. There is a preoccupation with what it means to be human in conditions that constrict the full potential of man. The lack of homogeneity among the convicts, much less humankind in general, is paradoxical to the fact the man everywhere is essentially the same regardless of what social fetters are set on him. The destitute and the tender circumstances that mark a man's life only make him stronger and more desperate in violently reign in life to make it his own.Although the narrator's own moral framework is present, it is often overshadowed by his own curiosity to learn about the forces that make man who he is. His characters are without categories, without good or evil but they make you laugh bitterly, smile sardonically and hang on askance. Everyone's life has its complications but the most elusive kinds are those about human nature, the choices one takes, the unexplainable behaviors in man. While situations always resolve itself with time, human is quite an irresolvable puzzle. And all these you can find in a typical Dostoevsky's works, The House of the Dead is second only to Crime and Punishment.For these reasons, this book is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"The House of the Dead is a somewhat autobiographical account of Dostoevsky's time in a Siberian labor camp. It was written after Dostoevsky spent 4 years in a labor camp for belonging to a political group that Czar Nicolas I decided to make an example of. While the book is narrated from the point of view of a 3rd party, incarcerated for the murder of his wife, it is widely accepted that the stories and characters are based on events and people that Dostoevsky encountered while in Siberia.It is similarly noted that much of Dostoevsky's later works, including Crime and Punishment, deal with aspects of the human condition that he witnessed while in Siberia. The depths of depravity to which a man can sink, the evil he can commit, and the rationality that can exist in such an irrational place all play a part in the development of Dostoevsky's later characters and topics. An interesting thing to note is that he concerns himself not only with his fellow prisoners, but also with the guards, and the governor of the prison, and that oftentimes it is these characters that are more evil than the men they are guarding.I found the book interesting, if a bit bland at times. The biggest challenge for me was keeping track of all the characters, and trying to remember their stories as sometimes Dostoevsky would mention a character in passing, give a few details about this person, and then say something like \\"but I will speak of him more later\\" and leave you hanging for a few hundred pages before getting back to him. The characters were very well developed, and great detail is given on all of them.If you enjoyed any of Dostoevsky's later works, then you will most likely enjoy this as well, and I can recommend it easily. It reads more like a diary than a novel, but I found that this format suited the stories nicely. Readers who are new to Dostoevsky, will also find this a good place to start as it is very straightforward, and acts as an excellent backdrop for the rest of his work."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I love this book. I'm so sad that I will never be able to read this book for the first time again! I would say that there are a few technical errors in this book, but it's beauty and originality far over shadow any of that.

Plus you can't beat the price, it was only $3.50!!!!!"},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Based on Dostoyevsky experiences after spending four years in prison under the most horrific of conditions, with inadequate food and shelter, and little or no privacy. This psychologigal and sociological study of prisoners who have committed heinous crimes recognizes that people are capable of redemption and are entitled to live with dignity. Men who have slipped into misfortune and as usual contains much humor and insight into the human condition"},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"It's Dostoyevsky, which means it's great, fascinating, with throat-grabbing insight into the dark and light places of human souls. But it's not his greatest, lacking narrative framework and the richness of his big novels, which put his insights into the service of a larger metaphysical vision. It seems more of a notebook of a writer's sketches, and indeed it contains the seeds of other, more mature novels, especially Crime and Punishment and The Possessed. Of course, that's exactly what The House of the Dead is: a lightly-veiled autobiography and memoir of his own time in prison. Sucked for him, but plainly his vision of the world would not have been so deep without this trip to the bottom of the universe."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"The \\"House of the Dead\\" is an early semi autobiographical work of Fyodor Dostoevsky, telling the tale of a nobleman who is imprisoned in a labour camp in Siberia for a crime of passion. The tale is semi-autobiographical because Dostoevsky as a young man was also imprisoned in Siberia for being a member of a radical political organisation an experience which was to form and influence his amazing insights and understanding of human nature.Although not Dostoevsky greatest work \\"House of the Dead\\" is still a fascinating portrait of life in the Tsarist gulags system - a life of great hardship and deprivation yet filled with simple moments of humanity showing mankinds ability to adapt and survive in the most extreme of circumstances. Dostoevsky tells his story in a chronological order from his characters arrival as a new alienated and withdrawn noble to his gradual adjustment to prison and the return of hope as he realises that he can survive and will have a life after the completion of his term.It is also interesting to read House of the Dead in conjunction with later works such as One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn dealing with the gulag system in communist times to see the continuation of the institution despite the changing of social regimes."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"This book is very Dostoyevsky in some ways, yet is still a departure from his usual fare. It is properly dark and depressing in keeping with his usual style. It is a personel account of his time in a horrific Russian prison. He builds his characters well and evokes feelings in the reader, but this book will never stand up to his immortal Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Dostoyevsky wrote from his heart and mostly, his suffering.The House of the Dead, for me, was a difficult read.The Siberian labour camps of the 19th century reveals suffering and cruelty in its true, ugly form.Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, narrates his experience in detail and if one enters the text, understands his viewpoint and his growing learning curve to merely remain alive.Goryanchikov's (Dostoyevskys) imprisonment was for sedition: writing about the injustices of the Romanov Dynasty. Under the Czar Alexander (whose secret police arrested Dostoevski) was later assassinated by a bomb underneath the royal carriage. Nicholas, the last Czar of Russia, witnessed his father's gruesome death. The Czar's secret police continued with even more ruthlessness, to find anyone anti-royalty: they were everywhere...and even a hint of rebellion, landed one a trip to Siberia.What makes this text unique and fascinating is the style used by the author - an outsider looking in, a jounalist recording the cruelty, sadism and at times the kindness of human nature. There are so many interesting characters in the novel, like most Russian novels of this time period, one continually has to flick back as there are so many patronynmic's used, it is difficult to keep up...Similar in cruelty is the book by the renowned psychiatrist, Viktor E. Frankl and his insightful text, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\".There seems to be many similarities between Goryanchikov and Frankl, as far as their attitude to insane crulety and one's attitude of mind, simply to survive.A difficult read, particularly if one avoids stories about man's inhumanity to man, and the 19th century style of writing...Frankl survived the Nazi concentration camps under conditions that would make anyone wish for death. An important book.The House of the Dead recomended for students of lit and the curious but not the faint of heart."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"So...I am a big Dostoyevsky fan, so allow me to be just a bit critical here. I don't think \\"House of the Dead\\" is a good read for everyone. It significantly departs from the types of plot structures he uses in other novels. The reason for this makes sense--it was based on his own experience in Siberia, and was probably somewhat cathartic for him to put down in print. It is interesting if you want to learn more about prison life, but its not really a work of fiction per se with your typical plot structure. So just keep that in mind.Otherwise, Dover thrift is awesome."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I loved this book. When a person is wrongfully imprisoned the indignation keeps me interested. I can't imagine living in a place and time as this great author did."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I picked up Dostoyevsky's The House of the Dead in a charity shop in Epsom, where I had half an hour to idle away before the next bus. I was so gripped by the opening that I continued reading the next 30 pages on and off for the rest of the day. After a week I've finished it, to the exclusion of other pressing engagements and books on the pile, some recently bought.What it is about this author that has always stirred my spirit I can't exactly say. I've read The Idiot, Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov (twice) and all have haunted me. I've still got The Possessed, The Gambler and the short stories to read one cold gloomy winter when the heating fails and I'm in bed with a fatal illness.He's not exactly a barrel of laughs, is he, Dostoyevsky! But what a writer to get under your skin and make you feel this is my story, everyman's story. Solitude, self-loathing and despair at the sheer cruelty of man's fate are his common themes. In The House of the Dead, the hero or victim is sent to Siberia to live in fearful conditions amongst men who are often cruel, loathsome, self-seeking, cunning, always filthy, and always dreaming of escape. We meet a cross-section of the criminal class, some of whom are utterly despicable, but yet understandable. Floggings - sometimes up to 5000 lashes happen continuously, but even worse, it seems, is the spite, bitterness and hatred between convicts.The story is semi-autobiographical, for Dostoyevsky himself was sent to Omsk for 4 years of penal servitude. The crime or 'crimes' committed are immaterial, as is the arbitrary nature of justice: - thus, an old man is given a hundred lashes for supposed insolence before he has even settled into the hostile shed of ice where he is to serve an indeterminate sentence. That's life at the rough end. You'd better get used to it!Beneath all this torture and hatred, however, a political message emerges from time to time. This was life under a totalitarian regime of oppressive czars; there is hope in the working man, in the simple peasant class or in the artisan. Well, that sounds too sentimental of course and we know what Communism gave the average Russian - an even harsher deal, just as brutal and corrupt, and just as, or even more, intolerant of dissent.However, this is not a political pamphlet but a human document; a plea not so much for social justice as for an awareness of the strangeness and surprising nature of fate and one man's reflections on it. Thus Goryanchykov, the narrator, concludes:There is in the Russian character so much down-to-earth sobriety, so much inner sobriety, so much inner mockery directed at the self ... It may be that it was this perpetual state of secret discontent that caused these men to be so impatient in their day-to-day dealings with one another, to be so implacable and jeeringly malicious in one another's regard.Prison is the microcosm, the crucible that brings to boiling point the discontents lurking in what the author would call the soul of man."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"The book came within a few business days, well within the allotted shipping timeframe. The only condition keeping this book from being classified as \\"new\\" is the fact that it's (evidently very gently) used. Pages are also yellowing slightly, as described.Overall, speedy shipping, excellent quality, and great prices make this a good buy. Would buy from again."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Dostoevsky is a master at characterization and at tapping into the root of what it means to be human. There are traces of that here, but they are far lacking in comparison to Dostoevsky's late epics.What I liked: Although this is couched as a fictional piece, it is apparent early on that Dostoevsky is describing his own observations and experiences. Siberian prison camps make for an interesting topic, and having perhaps the greatest novelist of all time as your narrator is a nice experience.What I did not like: This is not a novel -- it is more of a collection of observations and experiences. As such, there is really not a lot of plot at all. Instead, it is more like a series of short stories and character sketches that take place at a prison. Because Dostoevsky is a master of character development, it really feels like Dostoevsky's greatest strength is not present. Instead of seeing these characters grow, we see them in a single instance and then forget about them. And because the book is novel-length, it often becomes a slow read.Dostoevsky is a magnificent author; do not let my review persuade you otherwise. If you want to see what he was truly capable of at his peak, I suggest reading The Brothers Karamazov or The Idiot."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"When initially investigating 'The House of the Dead'...I was interested to see what Dostoyevsky would do for a treatment of prison life in Russia at his time.While the stories he reveals are interesting, I found a lack of a real 'storyline thread' to call this a novel, and saw it more as a collection of 'short stories'....The day to day interactions of the prisoners, as well as the separation of what can be defined as 'noble' men and 'blue collar' men and how they segregate into cliques is interesting, but still not as good a read as other of his works.An easy foray into Dostoyevsky, this still is not a good example of his writing and storytelling skills."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I've read all of Dostoyevsky's books, and I like six of his works better than this one. That isn't to say that this is a bad work, it simply shows how talented of a writer he is.This book is a semi-autobiographical piece about the time Dostoyevesky spent in a Siberian prison. Here he relates to the dehumanizing, deadening effects of the modern prison system and invokes his philosophies of better ways of treating and rehabilitating prisoners. He sketches detailed characters, and builds largely on the dichotomy between the &quot;common crook&quot; and the &quot;gentleman lawbreaker,&quot; the latter which is represented by him, and also the minority in the prison.All in all, quite a good piece."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"The House of the Dead has so many printing errors that it is impossible to read with any involvement and pleasure. I love the story and will try to find an error-free copy from another publisher."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"House of the Dead is not a general account of imprisonment and system of law of Russia, ala Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, but is a much more personal account of the author's own experiences. There is no attempt to overplay or dramatize personal suffering, though there was probably ample reason for the author to do so. Instead, the author focuses more on his fellow inmates: their personalities, their culture, their way of life and way of thinking. The effect is immeasurable, and makes the House of the Dead one of the most potent, moving pieces of literature ever written. The convicts that Dostoyevsky describes seem to come alive -- their descriptions are so complete and realistic that its almost as if they're reading the book with you. This method of describing imprisonment defies conventiality, but Dostoyevsky pulls it off easily. By knowing the convicts, you feel for them, you understand them, and you walk away knowing and loving humanity just a bit more.A great aspect of the book is that you can pick it up at almost any spot, so long as you know the general plot. I can't tell you how many times I've picked the book up and flipped straight to the first chapter describing the hospital, and read simply that alone. When Dostoyevsky tells of the dead convict, little more than a husk or a shell of a man who couldn't even stand the weight of his clothes or his wooden crucifix, being dragged off routinely with his heavy fetters still on, one can hardly help but grimace. And when another convict yells, inexplicably, &quot;He had a mother too!&quot; you start to sympathize for these convicts: the filthiest, most degenerate human beings you can imagine.Its a story of love for humanity, of resurrection from despair, and of a man's final reconciliation with his own life."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Dostoevsky's The House of the Dead is an account of life in a Siberian prison, drawing heavily from its author's own imprisonment for sedition. The narrator is nominally serving time for murdering his wife out of jealousy, but Dostoevsky makes very little effort to maintain the artifice that the narrator is anyone other than himself, as the narrator even refers to himself as a political prisoner on a couple of occasions. The novel consists mainly of a series of anecdotes relating such things as the staging of a prison play, the memories of some convicts of the crimes that landed them in prison, and the attempted escape of two of the prisoners, all interspersed among observations of more day-to-day affairs like prison food and corporal punishment.A number of the stories are very interesting, and overall Dostoevsky paints an impressive picture of prison life as a whole. Though it's clear that his experience in prison was a brutal one, the reader never feels as though Dostoevsky is overplaying the prisoners' suffering, which makes it seem all the more authentic. However, I'd have to say this sort of narrative doesn't really play into Dostoevsky's overall strength as an author. Dostoevsky's best works generally have a strong and coherent (though in some cases somewhat melodramatic) plot that develops more or less linearly throughout the novel; The House of the Dead, on the other hand, is hardly more than a series of related roughly-15-page short stories and so inevitably lacks the suspense of much of Dostoevsky's other work. For the same reason, none of the characters get especially well developed--the reader is left with a lot of interesting character sketches, none of which get fleshed out.As such, it's sort of unfair to compare The House of the Dead with many of Dostoevsky's best known works, since the format doesn't allow Dostoevsky to show some of the strengths he shows elsewhere. Taken in isolation, though, it's a fine account of life in the Siberian prisons of the mid-19th century, and it mixes the elements of a documentary with those of a novel well enough to ultimately be a very interesting and enjoyable work."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"This book examines to what extent a man will go to keep his humanity. Among feters and prison walls, a different sort of society emerges. How is a caged man different from a caged animal? Does a prison truely change a man for the better? This is a great book."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"What an intense look at life in a Siberian prison. This is one of Dostoevsky's great works, though all of his works are great in my opinion, but this ranks right up there with Crime and Punishment and the Brothers Karamazov. Beautifully written and intriguing from the first page! A classic page-turner for sure!"},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \\"The House of the Dead\\" is one of the most powerful narratives about life in prison. A quasi-autobiographical work, the writer used the days he spent in Siberia prison to create powerful moments of sadness, fear and hope. Not many were able to be released from there, but he was one of them, and with this work he reminds everyone what it is about to be a political prisoner.\\"The House of the Dead\\" may not be one of best works from this Russian writer, who produced masterpieces such as \\"Crime an Punishment\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", but still it is a vivid account of hard times. Many scenes are unforgettable, and resonate to the condition that many people live today around the world - think of the soup that the prisoners have in the first part of the book, for instance.Dostoyevsky manages to create a living portray of many people who are forced to share the same place at the same time, however much they can't stand each other. He is able to bring to life both human beings and animals. His description of his meeting with a dog can bring tears to the eyes of the most tough reader.David McDuff's translation is superb, and so is Penguin Classics edition. The book is complemented by notes on the text and a excellent introduction. However, as happens to many books in this collection, it is advisable to read the introduction after reading the novel, because it may have spoilers."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Reading the House of the Dead is essential to understanding Dostoyevsky. While his novels are far more elaborate and well developed in a literary sense, this book is important because it is based on his actual experience. It does contain the seed of philosophy and analysis of human nature that drives much of his other works and this is written in a manifest manner. This book is relatively plot less but the characters and scenes are well developed and often it strikes awe in the reader. Being so easy to read, straight forward, and all together interesting I suggest this book highly to those who want an introduction to Dostoyevsky.We have to remember a few things when reading this book. It is probably true that upon original release that Dostoyevsky did not want to use his own name in the book and he also wanted to make the book readable to his public. What's more is we have to realize the time and place. Russia was still basically feudal during the 1850's and nobility were treated far differently than peasant classes. Understanding this brings a whole new dimension to this work. Dostoyevsky, it seems, tries to show how most of the criminals behave like some bizarre mirror of Russian society. And of course the theme of adaptation is developed throughout.This is one of the more important Dostoyevsky works. It is important to understand both the person and the thinker that Dostoyevsky was. It also is a great background on the time and place of Russia, the setting of most of his work. Beyond this it presents some interesting ideas and is certainly an interesting record of prison life in the 19th century. I can understand why many would say that this is not one of his best works and on many point I certainly agree. However, this book is still very compelling and absolutely interesting. Given that reading this is not a massive investment of time that his novels generally are this is a certain must read. I rate this book highly and if you give it a chance I surmise you will too.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"This work is somewhat of an anomaly among the works of Dostoyevsky. Though he presents it as the discovered memoirs of a member of the Russian nobility sentenced as a type two(for murdering his wife) prisoner to Siberia, it is in reality a loosely disguised autobiography of Dostoyevsky's own four year experience in the Czarist prison system.Having read accounts of the Soviet era gulags before reading House of the Dead, my first impression was the relative \\"comfort\\" of life in the Siberian prison camps of the Russian old regime. This in itself says volumes, for Dostoyevsky takes pains to try and demonstrate the utter inhumanity of the prison system he knew, never realizing the depths of cruelty to which it would sink in the generations to come. To take but one example, prisoners in Dostoyevsky's experience were allowed to earn a pittance for their labor in the camps, which they could apply to small purchases, and rich prisoners could even hire their own cooks and servants and bring in their own food. Though prisoners were certainly used for labor, this was done mainly for the self-sustainment of the prison itself and the immediate community, and not, as in Soviet times, to exploit mines and forests.Though this is an autobiography presented as a book of memoirs of another, I found it oddly impersonal. Impersonal in the sense that its narrator, Alexander Petrovich, presents his vision of prison life while little is revealed about his own sentiments or the changes the prisoner experience has on his own personality. However, the story is still rich in the detail of its main characters. It was also fascinating to read of how prison life, though it dehumanizes a human, in no way squashes our lesser instincts: our vanity for one thing. We also get a unique view on how prisoners of noble status (and Dostoevsky was a minor noble) were treated in the Russian prison system. This facet of the novel in fact is the only place where the feelings of the narrator really come into play.The House of the Dead is not a novel. Though the characters are well developed there is no real plot. It is a varied portrait of prison life, and in fact sections of the book could be read entirely separately or out of sequence without much inconveniece. What this work is is a great portrayal of prison life in imperial Russia, and useful especially to juxtapose with 20th century accounts of imprisonment, notably in the Soviet Union but not necessarily so. You be the judge if we have advanced in our humanity or only in our capacity for cruelty."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"As you can guess from the title, this book tends to the grimmer side of life. Bsed on Dostoyevsky's personal experiences as a prisoner for some political scheme or other, one can see his genius at human observation. The impersonal style, and the grey feeling you get delivers the truly mundane and painful existence of a prison in the 19th century. Lacking are the heroic escapes, the outlaw with a heart of gold, and other typically American themes (cff the Green Mile). This book is a series of subtle observations, and truly meant for those with a psychological outlook."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I'm only 19, but I know this will be my favorite book forever. It takes you inside the darker places that exist inside the psyche of every human, and makes the renewed hope brought by deep suffering shine through."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky is well-known for his novels and novellas, of which some of the best ever written flowed from his pen. This book, however, is an entirely different animal. Though ostensibly a work of fiction, The House of the Dead is actually a thinly-veiled autobiographical narrative. Dostoyevsky, who endured four years of hard labor in a Siberian prison -- after getting the &quot;silent treatment&quot; is isolation for eight months and facing a firing squad, in a death shroud, only to have his sentence commuted to the aforementioned punishment at the last minute -- created this book as a sort of memoir of his experiences. The book's Introduction sets up a fictional character to tell the story -- it was Dostoyevsky's intent to have the notes &quot;written by a stranger&quot; and to have his personality completely eliminated (one suspects for reasons not entirely related to literary conduciveness) -- but we see the emperor through his clothes. Since this is not really a work of fiction, then, it is not surprising that there is absolutely no plot to speak of, no linear development, no climax, and no resolution. It is, basically, a series of anecdotes -- the more interesting things that Dostoyevsky saw while in prison. Indeed, an alternate title that I have seen for the book is much more fitting (and revealing): Notes From a Dead House.This book certainly does not rank in the upper tier of Dostoyevsky's work: all of his long novels are acknowledged masterpieces. With that said, it should also be noted that this book is also an acknowledged classic. As a book relating the prison experience to the masses (of which there are many), it is rather fine. The book reads much like a documentary -- which, of course, is what it basically is. Unlike many other prison books, we don't see such exciting elements as dashing escapes and noble, heroic prisoners. This is the real thing. It is also remarkable how infrequently Dostoyevsky gets on his soapbox: this is not a polemic against prisons, a tome about being a &quot;victim of society&quot;, or a tract for prison reform -- it is not even an admirable psychological portrait of an enthralled criminal. Indeed, the book, as it goes, is quite remarkable for its uniqueness. Those who like to read books of this kind -- criminologists, say -- will find much to like here and will also probably find it to be quite unique. It is also a treasure for Dostoyevsky readers, who will find much material that enlivens the author himself. Readers new to the author, however, should start with one of his great novels."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"This is one of Dostoyevsky;s best books. The theme of a russian prison camp and it's \\"comfortability\\" amazed me from the first time I read it's review, formerly I thought that penal servitude in Siberia was exrutiatingly hard work, but through Dostoyevsky's descriptions it appears that life in the prison is better than that of a peasant."},{"Title":"The house of the dead","review":"I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; expecting a harrowing tale of the punishment experienced by the author during his time in prison. What I found was a tortured man limited by his eloquence. He writes of his suffering for the entirety of the work, but that's all it is, writing. The plight of this man is stale. It arouses as much sympathy from the reader as a book report on prison life might. But there was merit in the book. It revealed tortures, that although unthought of, nevertheless existed in those circumstances. It opens the eyes of the reader to the multitude of madness the human spirit can endure."},{"Title":"Developing Rich Clients with Macromedia Flex","review":"This is a great book.

As of this writing, the authors are updating the downloadable code examples to Flex 1.5.4. If your looking for extensive coverage of Charts, you won't find it here (Flex 1.0 did not ship with Charting, though that is available in Flex 1.5). You'll have to figure those out independent of this book (as of this writing, this is the only book on Flex, so you'll have to rely on the docs that ship with Flex and what you can find on the web).Bottom Line: Highly recommended if you want to learn the ins and outs of Flex."},{"Title":"Developing Rich Clients with Macromedia Flex","review":"It's a rare treat to have a collection of best practices on a new technology so early out of the gate.

Even if it leaves out the fact that Buffy is supposed to have burned down the gym, how on earth she (post-revelation)went to Europe or her parents divorce, it is not as choppy as the movie version.Reading this book is not necessary, but strongly recomended to understand the slayer's world.

It was a fun read."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"Okay, the movie was admittedly campy. But that and this book introduced us to Buffy and her destiny.I first received this book in 1994 (long after I saw the movie) and was really psyched to hear there would be a TV show (and more opportunites) for books.Anybody who wants to be introducted to the Buffy series still should start at this book.Although both it and the screen play list her as a Senior (when the TV series debuted, she was a sophomore) it is still worth the purchase. I still read the book to this day and the plot's attraction remains strong."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"I came about five years later to the story of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I did manage to see the original film on videotape before the series started, but just barely. I offer no excuses other than a mental inability to believe that the story of valley girl meets vampire might have more to it than the usual trashy horror flick. Okay, I admit I was badly mistaken. The dialog was far better than I expected, Buffy's character was complex and interesting, and the film turned out to be both funny and spooky. Nor can one fault Joss Whedon's new take on vampire mythology.I picked up this novelization of the film, the first real Buffy book, to have as a reference. It has been long enough so that I no longer remember the film. I had just read the graphic novel version that retells the tale with Sarah Michele Gellar instead of Kristy Swanson and suspected that it had taken a few liberties with the script (it did). At fewer than 200 pages, the book actually takes less time to read than it does to watch the film. Moreover, I thought it would be fun. And so it was.The plot is now so well known it hardly bears repeating. Girl cheerleads and shops, girl meets watcher, watcher trains girl, vampires try to eat high school, girl kills vampires. The girl is unusual in that, under the disguise of a young woman who makes shallowness an art, we find someone who is unexpectedly bright, has a strong personality and a surprising sense of duty. In fact, the film questions many of our images of Buffy's lifestyle, from geeks to basketball stars, and does it well.Richie Cusick does a great job of turning a script into a novel, which it the difficult matter of turning atmosphere and scene into meaningful words. As I have already indicated, this is a quick, enjoyable read, and is surprisingly hard to put down. I you are an aficionado, or simply want to find out what all the excitement has been about, this is a good book to have."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"This book was brill. I read the first chapter and the next and the next, I couldn't put it down. It had an interesting part in every page. I collect Buffy books and I have to say this is one of my faves.

But Buffy's oblivious. She's brainstorming a theme for the senior dance. One nightmare later, she meets a stranger named Merrick who tells her she bears the mark of the order: only she--the Pom-Pom Princess of California cheerleaders--can stop the vampires before they engulf L.A. They're everywhere . . . she can't even trust her best friends! Merrick has brought her knowledge, physical and mental powers beyond her wildest dreams, and a terrifying enemy: Lothos, King of the Vampires, who is determined to have Buffy for himself! All she has are a stake, a cross and a mission: destroy the evil--even if it takes her own life!\\"REVIEWThe tie-in novel to the 1992 Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (yes, there is a comma in the title) movie is interesting in two aspects. First, it's based more on Joss Whedon's original movie script than the final film version, and the differences are significant and striking. Second, the novel has several aspects that would later be revived in the first few episodes of the Buffy television series.The overall plot will be familiar to anyone who has seen the movie. Buffy is introduced to us as a vapid, valley girl cheerleader attending Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is accosted by Merrick, a Watcher, who eventually manages to convince her that she is this generation's Slayer. Along the way, Buffy befriends Pike, a fellow high school student, and battles Lothos, an evil vampire-king.More of Joss Whedon's dry wit shows through in the novel than in the movie, and there are some interesting differences. Perhaps the most dramatic difference is that Merrick ends up committing suicide rather than let Lothos turn him into a vampire. Some other scenes are changed, such as a funny one where Buffy and Merrick play video games, and the very end scene, which has Pike and Buffy standing before an ancient castle instead of taking off on a motorbike as in the movie.Many moments in the novel are seen again in the television series. For example, Buffy kills Lothos' vampire servant by pulling the same trick she did against Luke in The Harvest (tricking him into believing it's daylight and then staking him). Lothos is often referred to by other vampires as \\"The Master\\" and rises out of a pool of blood in his lair. Principle Murray in the novel has almost exactly the same \\"I want to be your friend\\" personality as Principle Flutie. Finally, drug-crazed gangs are blamed for vampire killings at the high school.We can also see some of Joss' ideas that he later discarded. In the novel and movie, vampires faces don't change and they don't disintegrate when staked, and the Slayer always has a birthmark on her shoulder and suffers cramps when vampires are nearby.Overall, the novel tie-in is probably more entertaining than the movie. Neither is spectacularly interesting but each has some value in its own way. In the end, the novel is probably worth picking up as it does contain Buffy's origin story in its original formulation."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"As usual this is an excellant book.

The search has produced a wonderful result.Written in 1992, after the movie, the author hasgiven the reader a delightful read and a character of charming presence. Heroes and heroines are hard to come by and one which can be identified with is truly a find. As a librarian, I can safely say that the original book is a must readfor any young reader (or fan) who might have missed it the first time around.After reading Buffy the vampire slayer I felt as long as Buffy, the Shadow, and Robin survive --evil shall not prevail."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"I thought this book was pretty entertaining. I liked the movie, way back when it first came out, so I bought the book, since Richie Tankersley Cusick is my favorite author. I thought the plot was good, and actually gave a little mroe depth to the characters than the movie did. I don't like the show at all, because it wasn't faithful to the movie.So, I guess I would recommend this book to people that liked the movie, and not the TV show, because it doesn't have &quot;Angel&quot; or any of the other TV characters. (And also, in the TV show, what the hell happened to Pike? He was like the main guy,and they just got rid of him!)"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"This book rapidly swerves away from everything that made Buffy an amazing television show. The witty banter...not so witty or bantery, really. I am not one to usually judge the writing style, I tend to overlook \\"bad\\" writing, but I don't think anyone can read this and say that this is \\"good\\" writing. It's absolutely cringe-worthy. There are plenty of missing moments that should have been explained (parents' divorce, burning down the gym) and were not. There's not much connection to the series at all. I haven't seen the movie version of it, but I can pretty much guess that it's a lot better than this novelization (movie novelizations are, after all, usually horrible). It's just weird and...not Buffy. The one thing I do like a lot is that the Potentials are introduced, while in the series, it took 7 seasons to introduce them out of nowhere and it was really...lousy.Rating: 1/5"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"I thought this was a very good book.&lt;I also thought that it is suited for all ages!My daughter also loved the book!"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"This novel presents a different perspective of the vampire phenomena according to our times. It is a good effort to bring traditional vampires to the final years of the 20th century, but somehow stands far away and behind other works such as Salem's Lot or The Night Flier, by Stephen King. If you are a serious vampire literature reader, avoid this book, but if you only try to enjoy and have some fun, give it a try and then read something more serious, as the mentioned ones."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"This is actually a very good book it starts with buffy as the slayer and shows her everything if u want to lke buffy get stared on this"},{"Title":"So You Think You're Good At Trivia","review":"...think I'm good at trivia.

These Jews believed in reincarnation; they developped complex historical schemes of interpretation; they had their own numerology and their own philosophy. Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav was, according to Buber, both the last and the greatest of this line of mystical philosophers. Always a controversial figure - he suffered the violent opposition of a whole opposing Jewish party in his own shtetl, which he seems to have taken with Gandhi-like non-violence - he was above all the author of a number of complex, elaborate and, dare I say, beautiful tales expressing his own view of the nature, origin and destiny of man and God. A later and rather different Jewish genius, the cartoonist Jack Kirby, has unhesitatingly ascribed the success of Jews in all the American arts and media to the influence of the Jewish tradition of storytelling, learned at home at one's mother's knee, and bearing fruit throughout life in a natural aptitude for putting complex ideas and views of life in narrative form. These tales show you where he came from; they are of a complexity that bespeaks an ancient and proud narrative culture, and they are capable of bearing the most profound intellectual meaning. As for their author, Rabbi Nachman himself, they reveal not only deep humanity and a visionary imagination, but also features very unexpected in a Chassidic Jewish teacher - a warm appreciation of human and animal beauty, and a temper to understand and forgive rather than condemn or exclude. However, this book is to be treasured not only, perhaps not even mainly, because of its own literary and intellectual excellence, but because it is the resurrection of the last testimony of a great European tradition, now vanished or changed out of all recognition, but fascinating and worthy of respect in its own right."},{"Title":"Tales of Rabbi Nachman","review":"Rabbi Nachman is one of the great leaders of Hasidism. Even today there is a whole group of Hasidism who consider him their ' rebbe' and walk in his way. The great presenter of the Hasidic message as he interpreted it to the Western world , Martin Buber in this work presents an introduction to the life and work of Rabbi Nachman, and presents six of his tales which he translated to German and which have been translated from the German by Maurice Friedman. These tales are truly 'parable-like mystical tales' and compel the reader to seek new interpretations of them. The volume concludes with an essay by Buber on Rabbi Nachman's Journey to the Holy Land. This is an excerpt from the concluding chapter. \\"Herein the land of Israel, the purification of the imagination takes place.It is not for nothing that the sounds of the word adama soil, and medame imagination , resemble one another: the fullness of the elements comes to the imagination from the earth.But the purification of the imagination by faith can take place no other way than through the consecrated earth and the consecrated earth is here in the land of Israel\\"."},{"Title":"Tales of Rabbi Nachman","review":"Martin Buber is one of my favorite authors. \\"The Legend of The Baal Shem\\" is one of the best reads I've ever encountered, and \\" Tales of Rabbi Nachman\\" is not far behind. The only reason 'Tales' is not 5 star is because of the subject matter. The Baal Shem Tov is such a compelling character, that almost nobody approaches his level of inspiration. Rabbi Nachman however comes close, and Buber's writing only enhances his story.BR"},{"Title":"Tales of Rabbi Nachman","review":"In Martin Buber's early career, he set about to translate (into German) tales from Hasidic masters. His translations were later heavily criticized as re-renderings. Buber felt that the stories the Hasidic master's told had become garbled and corrupted and needed to be cleansed and made viable. This is probably no more than a half-truth.In the process of doing this work, Buber became one of the founders of the Neo-Hasidic movement, which sought to bring the treasury of Hasidic stories and lore to modern audiences. He attenuated Hasidism, showing those parts he found decorous and meaningful, and leaving a great deal he did not like out.This is evident in his \\"The Tales of Rabbi Nachman\\" where he presents six stories from the master Rabbi Nachman of Bretzlav. The framing technique is evident. The first 43 pages are Buber's reflections on Jewish mysticism, Rabbi Nachman, and the stories themselves. The final chapter is an essay by Buber on Rabbi Nachman's voyage to Palestine and its positive implications for Zionism.All and all, Buber presents a great deal of material we no longer care about. We can now see it for what it is , Buber's attempt to create a \\"cultural\\" Judaism divorced from Jewish religious practice. But in an odd and fitting way, Buber is doing nothing more than other Jewish writers and interpreters (even Rabbi Nachman himself). He is taking sources and intentionally bending them to his own view of Judaism. He tries to create a new type of Judaism from old building blocks.Buber is in very good company here. So although his rendering of Rebbe Nachman's tales should be viewed with suspicion, we should no longer single him out for a sin shared by many others."},{"Title":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: MS-DOS (64k Disk)","review":"Really, nothing beats text adventure games. All the graphics in the world cannot begin to compare with the challenge and thoughtfulness this game provides.

This book outlines all of Shakespeare's plays, act by act, and describes each character and his/her relationship to others, where applicable. Each summary is about 3-5 pages (average of about 3.5pgs), and some include important quotations. In addition to the outlines, the book features notes on Shakespeare's life, his theatre, the structure of his plays, sources of his inspiration, by play, and suggestions on reading Shakespeare. Of course, they are not meant as a substitute to the plays, nor are they as thorough as Cliff's Notes, but the succinct format allows you to get a decent sense of the play. Best use: read it before reading the play. It makes for a faster understanding of what is going on and lets you focus on the language, art, plot devices, etc."},{"Title":"The horse who lived upstairs","review":"This is a book I remembered fondly from my childhood, so I purchased a used copy for my two little ones. It is a simple, straightforward tale about a horse, Joey, who works in the city, drawing a vegetable cart for a vegetables salesman. Yet he to longs to live in the country and \\"kick up his heels.\\" After he is sold to a country farmer he realizes that the city is where he belongs, and lucky for him, he ends up back there. A classic tale about appreciating what you have. My kids love hearing about Joey."},{"Title":"The horse who lived upstairs","review":"At 69 years the book becomes more worthwhile with the passing of time.During WWII there was rationing. A horse knew of the upside of country life but none of the possible harsh realities. Had he looked at what he currently had there would have been less discontent. More than a grass is greener parable it is more on making better informed decisions. Allowing oneself not to settle for less but possibly appreciation of that which truly matters. A wonderful children's story set in the past."},{"Title":"The horse who lived upstairs","review":"All children should read this book to learn to be contented and grateful for what they have and not to believe that the grass is always greener on the other side.

(Yaoi)","review":"first off, i'm really not into WWE-style wrestling, but i ended up w/ a copy of this so i thought i'd check it out anyway. i was leery of a yaoi book made in by a non-japanese company, but i was pleasantly surprised. the artwork is serviceable and occasionally gets steamy, but the real draw is the story. many people will be turned off by the power-play type dynamics (and the kinkier scenes) and not be able to see the underlying emotional turmoil of the two main characters. those are the same people who hated such japanese series as jazz. i for one enjoy unusual stories like this, and the author really brought the whole backstage pro wrestling setting alive. i found the emotional dynamics to be interesting, enough so that i'll be looking into what other books the author's released. hopefully the author's artwork will improve to match her writing."},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"*SPOILERS*It's great to see more original English-language yaoi in print, although this book sadly has a number of flaws.The dialogue is quite stilted and sometimes feels more like reading a translation than something that was in English to begin with. This is unfortunate considering how often the subject of rape comes up, which really needs to be better handled. I'm not entirely sure how to say this without getting my review thrown out, but basically every discussion emphasises the \\"with a FIST...!\\" aspect of said rape, which is difficult to take seriously.I was a little uncomfortable with the negative stereotypes regarding homosexuality in this book too. All the gays guys in this are evil or overbearing and controlling. Most (all?) sex is borderline rape and the seme even jokes about him fitting a gay stereotype when he says, \\"I got poofter tastes. That's one dead-giveaway about me.\\" It made me cringe.Also, the book's editor needs to play closer attention to grammar. It's 'would've' not 'would of' and I was stunned to see this mistake repeated throughout (at least four times). There was also the classic 'you're' and 'your' mix up, as well as a few other isolated typos.Overall, despite my criticisms, I didn't hate this book. The scenes that took place in the ring and backstage were extremely well-done. I also think it's good to support the production of original English-language yaoi and this book is a good choice if that's your aim. So far, I think this would be my pick of Yaoi Press' output."},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"I wasn't expecting too much from Pinned! originally, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.

Oh and again, very nice and consistent art!"},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"I hated this book. I don't consider it a yaoi title, it's more like a suspense thriller that just happens to have a few pages of man rape thrown in. It's about a psychopath wrestler who molests a younger wrestler. It's boring, makes you uneasy and the twist at the end is just plain stupid. The characters are really 2 dimensional and you are never able to sympathise with the hero. The rape/sex scenes don't last more than a page and everything is covered up. Don't waste your money on this awful book, go buy \\"Brother\\" by Yuzuha Ougi instead."},{"Title":"Pinned!

I really grew to like and care about the main characters (like I did with Dee and Ryo in Fake) -- unlike a lot of yaoi manga I've read lately. There's tension (who should our hero trust?) plus great, funny, snarky banter. All in all, good times. Hope they do a second volume."},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"I'm a huge, huge, huge yaoi fan. I read and view just about any and all forms of yaoi. I'm also a fan of wrestling and the bad boy wrestler looked an AWFUL lot like Shawn Michaels in his sexier, \\"sexy boy\\", earlier years.Was this book as bad as some say? No.Was there room for improvement? Yes.It all depends on your preferences. If you enjoy artwork and storylines rich in character development and plot such as Kizuna and not other, I suppose \\"weaker\\" novel will do, then chances are, you will not enjoy this book. If you're versitile in your yaoi preferences and willing to view all sorts of story lines...you may enjoy this novel.I happen to LOVE Kizuna, Fake, West End and many more. I'm not a critical yaoi reader...what I look for in my yaoi is SEX and lots of it! With a plot that's easy to follow and even cute is the story calls for it.Does the plot have to be so compelling, that it rivals any and all romance novels? No.I don't like a lot of angst, it's a plot device hugely overrated and overused. This novels' plot, though \\"shakey\\" didn't have that much angst. A simple plot to follow and the \\"bad guy wrestler\\" was crazy enough to keep me giggling at his psycho antics.The problems this GN had were:Sometimes the \\"talk bubbles\\" were not pointed at the person doing the talking and you have to study the picture a few seconds to actually understand who was saying what. Is that a big problem? No. the plot can be followed.The sex scenes were few. I expected more sex based on the plot. But the sex scenes that were in the book could have used more detailed drawings. These almost had a \\"fade to black\\" feel to them. You get on inset picture with a \\"69\\" position and the next page, they're cuddling.Those were my bones to pick.I would buy the second novel if Yaoi Press came out with one.

It is a bit sneaky and shocking, but it's not bad. You can bypass the explanation of the wrestling and get to the action and it makes you wonder if things like this happen often in real life. Backstabbing sucks and so does trying to remember the lies and the blackmail. Kinda wished for more though."},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book. Studio Korasu's art is simple and clean. When we think that manga art is basically caricatural, Studio Korasu's art is down right detailed. Yaoi manga is usually very flowery, bubbly and sparkly and it works at drawing you away from the poor charater design and weak story. There is non of that in this comic.Pinned! for me is close to perfection. Yamila Abraham's scenario is tight, has many layers and is researched. You can totally see it happen in real life and at the same time you want Sinn and Renagade to have a happy ending. Gay romance is not just about sex. Tha's why it's called \\"romance\\" and not \\"erotica\\". There is way too much gay erotica and REALLY not enough solid gay romance novels out there. Pinned! is one of the good ones.I few months earlier I want to the publisher's site, Yaoi Press, to see if they were going to continue the \\"series\\". The way I understand it is that Pinned! is too manly for the female readers. The book was mainly done to appeal to the gay men out there who like their boys with more meat on their bones than bishounen. I guess not enough read the book 'cause I think Yoi Press is not planning on doing a Pinned! #2. Which is a shame 'cause some of us ladies like our men with muscles and you know a background story that goes further than \\" my big junk is going into your glory h***e wether you like it or not\\" \\"NO...okay yes\\" end of story.lol ^__^Anyways if anybody is interested in an unusual and intelligent yaoi comic PINNED! is for you."},{"Title":"Pinned! (Yaoi)","review":"I bought 'Pinned' in spite of the cover, because I wanted to support yaoi publishers, but regretted the purchase. It is also important to signal publishers that content matters. Supporting bad yaoi leads publishers to believe we will buy anything with \\"yaoi\\" on the cover.In this case the combination of coerced sex and Hitchcockian plot are painful. (Do I get credit for two double entendres?) There is not enough erotic content to warrant the yaoi label. It is a textbook case of sexual harassment.

The art ranges from very good to excellent, though I really dislike the presense of ugly characters (old men). The plot is pretty much dull, to me, and jumps about, but plot is not why we buy YAOI. The sex scenes can be quite good, and the dialog/writing can be extremely good. I'd say go ahead and buy this if you like YAOI, but don't expect a feel-good novel like some of the Be Beautiful or DMP books. The ending in this book doesn't make sense and I find it quite stupid. I'd rather give this book 4 and a half stars, with it being that high because of its sensuality and hot guys...however, we must all support YAOI being brought to the U.S., even when it's not the best!"},{"Title":"Pinned!

During the \\"girls only\\" and \\"boys only\\" parts, we did separate reading times, so as not to embarrass them. When it came to the \\"hard\\" stuff for my to talk to them about, like sex, I thought I would have to \\"grit my teeth\\" and \\"go for it\\", but the sections were really well written so that it covered all the things I would want them to know about, without too much detail to cause embarrassment. Everything was written from a Biblical standpoint, but most of it came across as common sense and not threatening at all. In fact, after reading this book, both our kids have become more open to listening and accepting the boundaries we put in place for them, because they now understand, as the book points out, that we are doing this out of love to help them grow into mature, healthy adults, not to ruin their fun or their lives. It was nice, as a parent to hear someone else say the same things we'd been saying... but since it wasn't coming from us, the kids seemed more willing to listen.

This book, by concenctrating on the historical development of the thought allows those of us who think this way to &quot;ooze into&quot; the subject, gain some understanding of the problems that were solved, understanding of the experiments that solved them and thus gives us a better understanding of the problems to be solved today."},{"Title":"The History of Chemistry","review":"Hudson's The History of Chemistry promises to explain how chemistry was born and developed. It introduces the reader to a rather large number of notable chemists and explains their antics. It is all good and well, but unfortunately Hudson writes to a chemist, not to a general reader.I'm sure this book is a good overview of the history of chemistry if you're a chemistry student or a chemist, but a general reader will bump into rather thick chemistry jargon that is not explained enough. My background in chemistry is the bit I learnt in high school and I had to skip rather large portions of the book because I didn't understand them. I was constantly asking \\"why?\\", \\"why is this important?\\", \\"what does this mean?\\" - but Hudson doesn't answer those questions.So, if you're looking for popular history, you're looking in a wrong place. However, if one's interested in history of science and does have some knowledge of chemistry, this book will explain the general development of chemistry well enough.

The conversations themselves are based on a series of seminars in which McGee developed with complex web of ideas. Those who studied with McGee will quickly find themselves in familiar territory as they read these five conversations (for me it was the Todd Willey anecdote about why English Departments consider rhetoricians bastard stepchildren unworthy of entry into the ivory towers of academia):The volume begins with what amounts to an introductory first chapter entitled \\"McGee Unplugged,\\" written by John Louis Lucaites, who was the first American born student to complete his doctorate under McGee. Lucaites reminds us that stylistically, conversations were McGee's forum of choice and that the conversations included in this volume do not have to be read sequentially. You can just as easily get from Isocrates as an example of \\"phronimos\\" in Chapter 2 to the notion of collectivity in Chapter 5 as you can the importance of representation to rhetoric. From the materialist conception of rhetoric to the need to remodel liberalism, the topics McGee talks about dance in and around the pivotal relationship between rhetoric and social theory, which was on one level simply the conventional name given at Iowa to McGee's work.Chapter 2, Formal Discursive Theories reconsiders the relationship between rhetoric and dialectic and then the notion of wisdom, for which Isocrates and not Plato is the Dead Greek of choice. This leads to representations as the key way of characterizing our study of human action.Chapter 3, The Postmodern Condition follows the lead of Walter Ong and Marshall McLuhan in considering orality to be humanity's state of nature. Ironically technology has allowed us to return to a more oral view of the world and creates new problems for looking at a \\"text,\\" which can no longer be considered a single, finite entity.Chapter 4, American Liberalism is more about the Whig-Liberal tradition that harkens back to Edmund Burke than it does to contemporary left-wing politics. With the shift from the Aristotlean rhetoric of persuasion to the Burkean rhetoric of identification, McGee posits the goal of scholarly endeavor to be political effectiveness in general and remodeling liberalism in particular. Within this context McGee looks at property and capital (i.e., how to tell the difference between liberals and communists), and how morality creates the space between law and liberty that establishes a code of conduct. Multicultrualism raises the issue of heterogeneity in our society while McGee returns to a favorite topic when he talks about the dynamic between \\"male\\" sovereignty and \\"female\\" solidarity.\\"Chapter 5, The People reconsiders the key elements of McGee's first seminal QJS essay by contrasting the spectatorship created by a world dominated by television with the collectivity that television can create in crisis. This returns us to the intellectual problem of subjectivity and ontology, which is what gets McGee to his friends Jose Ortega y Gasset and Jurgen Habermas.Chapter 6, Materialism is established as a coherent philosophical position that is a variant of realism, which historical materialism (a pivotal term) as coded human practice. The idea of objectivity merely reminds us that human discourse is both referential and subjective at the same time. McGee uses the term instantiation to help us tell how materialism is different from the word as used by Communists and Wall Street types. A materialist's morality takes a more political turn that the Christian morality that serves as an idealistic exemplar.As an example of McGee's \\"performance criticism,\\" the volume concludes with a previously unpublished work \\"Fragments of Winter: Racial Discontent in America, 1992,\\" in which McGee finds an extension of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in Spike Lee's film, \\"Do the Right Thing.\\" Without getting into the particulars of this compelling essay, I would point out that McGee considers Lee's film on a cultural par with Picasso's painting \\"Guernica.\\"After reading this book the comparison between McGee and Kenneth Burke is perhaps the most relevant (flashback: McGee escorting the elderly Burke, who was about half McGee's size, at an SCA convention), for the simple reason that their public arguments display the same astounding breadth and depth of sources. For McGee reading Burke alone provided a superficial understanding; the only appropriate alternative was to read everything Burke had read (a premise fated to stay the heart of many a graduate student). For this reason you will find McGee talking about everything from Louis Althusser's understanding of the relationship between aesthetics and power to Thomas Szasz's study of the myth of mental illness (and that is just the names \\"dropped\\" over the course of these five conversations and one essay).It must be noted that both of the reviewer comments by colleagues of McGee on the back of this volume use the word \\"exasperating\\" to describe these conversation, the term being contrasted with \\"stimulating\\" and \\"intriguing\\" respectively. The explanation for such exasperation, dear friends, lies within the cognitive realm of the receiver. I would advance this brief example of exorcism by appropriating a political slogan McGee would have found unsettling in his younger days: in your heart, you know he's right.Lawrance M.

Much of the historical discussion of the first movements is quite valuable. I especially liked Smith's survey of ten criticisms of ethical emotivism. Also of considerable interest is his criticism that ordinary language philosophy, like the positivism that preceded it, fails by its own criteria of meaning.The last three chapters and a subsequent conclusion are equal parts lucid exposition of the four-decade-old (but still vital) movement of linguistic essentialism, and an impressive addition to essentialist discourse in philosophy of religion and ethics. Whether Smith has successfully refuted Plantinga's Free Will Defense and thereby revived the deductive version of the Atheistic Argument from Evil is, in my judgment, doubly questionable. Part hinges on whether Smith makes his case that since theists hold God to be both free and yet necessarily morally good, theists should also concede that it must also be logically possible for God to create moral agents who are also both free yet necessarily morally good. Smith's greatest flaw as a philosopher is a certain overassured, categorical finality he expresses in his conclusions; a self-confidence Aristotelian in its proportions.In the chapter on essentialist ethics, Smith truely shines, making a valuable case for moral realism. Although he attributes his metaethical approach to Robert M. Adams, he makes it wholly his own, expanding on every detail of essentialist ethical analysis. Although I am not aware that it has generated as much discussion as it deserves, his normative ethical theory, Naturalistic Perfectionism, is quite interesting. (I also wonder, however, whether Smith really succeeds showing that his position is as independent of intuitionism as he claims.) The final discussion of Naturalist Pantheism is also quite interesting and evocative."},{"Title":"Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language","review":"Although this is not the only topic Smith addresses in the book, I really appreciate the work he did on atheistic moral realism. Smith reviews all of the relevant literature--including that by J.L. Mackie, Robert Adams, and David O. Brink--and demonstrates the inherent plausibility of an atheistic moral realism.Smith also has occasion to defend a logical argument from evil. While I am skeptical of such arguments, Smith's book should serve as a reminder to theists who wish to proclaim the death of logical arguments from evil.If you've ever wondered how an objective morality could exist if God does not, and you've wanted a really thorough treatment of the issue, this book is for you.

On the other hand, it's just that -- an opinion. At certain points in the book, his opinion is much closer to reality than at other points.To give two opposing examples, Mr. Feazell states on page 98, \\"I will go so far as to say that Sabbatarianism prevents anyone who believes in it from coming fully to the freedom of the gospel.\\" His reasoning for this is that, based on his experience, everyone who keeps the seventh-day Sabbath believes that Sabbath-keeping is a salvation issue. Fortunately, there ARE Sabbatarians who do not believe that way. One of the largest of such groups is called \\"Messianic Judaism,\\" which believes that God has called Israelites and Gentiles to different roles. (See Acts 21:17-25, Rom. 3:1-2, 1 Cor. 7:18 and Col. 2:16-17 in particular.) It's true that most if not all of the membership of the WCG felt that way however, and in that, I agree with Mr. Feazell.On the other hand, Feazell states that Armstrong's understanding of biblical healing came from an experience he had in his early years. He then proceeded to base his entire doctrine on healing on that one experience. Just from my own reading of the bible, there were three examples of Jesus healing blindness in the bible, and He did it in three DIFFERENT ways. If each of the people who had been healed by Jesus had gone and started their own denominations based on their one experience, we might have seen something similar to what happened with Herbert Armstrong and the WCG. Yes, the understanding of biblical healing was a legitimate problem that the WCG had.Mr. Feazell was unfortunately not smart enough to understand what the WCG was all about. I do not mean to criticize him -- I'm simply stating it as a fact. Most people, whether within our outside the WCG, never understood it. I'll give one simple example to illustrate my point. There was a great amount of criticism, by both members and non-members, of the \\"opulent lifestyle\\" of Mr. Armstrong. Unfortunately, what they didn't grasp is that he believed the Kingdom of God to be an earthly kingdom that would be established at some point in the future, in which all of the riches of this world could not compare. If one could not learn to appreciate physical blessings and learn to be responsible with wealth here and now, it would be all the more difficult in the Kingdom. Whether Armstrong was correct in his understanding of the Kingdom or not (and I happen to agree with him), HARDLY ANYONE UNDERSTOOD THIS PREMISE. Although the finances of WCG weren't \\"squeaky clean\\" and the wealth WAS abused by some in the ministry, the accumulation of wealth by the WCG wasn't entirely wrong. In the exact same way, if one goes to some of the towns of western Europe where the houses are plain and simple, the town church is often highly extravagant and ornate. The townspeople contributed, over generations, to creating a beautiful place to worship which they felt glorified God.The final problem with Mr. Feazell's analysis -- and, frankly, most of Christianity -- is that they have a great deal of trouble grasping the principle that there can be more than one right way to interpret the bible. To give a simple example, the Worldwide Church of God was well-known for preaching that we are NOT \\"born again now,\\" but that this spiritual birth takes place when Jesus Christ returns and our bodies are changed from flesh to spirit. A proper reading of John 3:8 supports this interpretation. However, 1 Peter 1:3 and other, similar verses make it clear that being \\"born again\\" is something that happens during this lifetime. BOTH INTERPRETATIONS ARE CORRECT. (By the way, the doctrine that the Kingdom of God exists now and the doctrine that it is yet in the future is another example of two correct interpretations.) If Christianity -- including the WCG splits that still believe and practice a majority of the old WCG doctrines -- would realize that a lot of their doctrinal differences are the result of having different but equally correct interpretations, there would be a lot more peace and unity within the body of Christ.In the final analysis, the WCG's migration from cult to \\"mainstream\\" status could have been handled much more effectively than it was. On pages 115-117, Mr. Feazell explains the reasoning as to why the church leadership tried its best to hide the process of change from the laity, citing the cult mentality of the laity as THE barrier to effective change. To that, I say two things: first, no lie is of the Truth -- and they LIED to the laity in telling them that nothing was being changed -- and secondly, if the cult mentality is the problem, then change the cult mentality BEFORE changing any doctrines!In my opinion, the changes that took place in the WCG constitute the biggest religious disaster in years. There are still hundreds of splits from the WCG that hold nearly the same doctrines as before the changes. They have not been healed or bound up, so to speak (quoting Isaiah 61:1-2). Everyone seems to be focusing instead on the \\"miracle\\" of the mainstreaming of the \\"stump\\" of the eviscerated tree.The leadership of the WCG did not have the tools to make effective change, either. Because the entire organization was infected with an attitude of negativity and judgmentalism, THAT needed to be cured first, and the leadership just didn't know how to do that. Trust should have been won first, rather than changing doctrines. Secondly, the same goes for the WCG leadership as what I said concerning Mr. Feazell. They just weren't smart enough to discern between what WAS true and correct -- even though it was almost unique to the WCG -- what teachings had to be modified, and what had to go. Again, I'm not criticizing them, I'm just stating the facts.There are lessons to be learned from what happened with the WCG -- both in what went right and what went wrong. This is where I feel that this book has its greatest strength, although the reader must beware that the author himself makes mistakes in determining what went right or wrong. If one were to approach another \\"cult\\" organization with a similar agenda, then one had better beware of making the same mistakes and ultimately leaving the walking wounded in the wake of the \\"miracle\\" of doctrinal healing."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"The title of this book is very misleading! The Worldwide Church of God did not need to be liberated from anything. Those who were its members at the time of the death of Herbert Armstrong were content with its basic doctrines. It was a growing and thriving church, with its mission of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to the whole world as a witness. It was not a cult; it did not twist anyone's arm to join it. In fact, it was content to remain relatively small in overall numbers. Members were free to come and go as they pleased, and if they did not agree with its doctrines that differed from \\"mainstream Christianity,\\" (such as keeping the 7th day Sabbath, and observing \\"Jewish\\" Holy days such as Passover, the Day of Atomement, etc. instead of Easter, Christmas, etc.) then the WCG would recommend that they not attend its services!But with the death of Armstrong in 1986, the leadership of the WCG fell into the hands of Joseph Tkach, his son, and others like Mike Feazell. At first they deceived the membership by pretending to remain loyal to the original doctrines of the Church. Then, near the end of his life, Joseph Tkach began to make wholesale changes. These changes escalated under the pastorship of his son, Joe Tkach, Jr., who succeeded him. The Destruction, not the Liberation of the WCG was now in full gear. The membership of the WCG saw the sad mismanagement of Tkach and Feazell, and began to leave in droves. The WCG owned two beautiful and first rate college campuses, one in east Texas, and the other in Pasadena, CA. These campuses, along with many other assets the WCG owned, have now been sold off and the proceeds pocketed by the elite group (ie Tkach and Feazell, et al) who now control the remanant of the WCG. Herbert Armstrong was a man of vision who was instrumental in building a worldwide Work. The current church leadership is merely a bunch of little, greedy men who have built nothing! They did not liberate the WCG, but hijacked it and plundered its wealth for their own personal gain. I wonder Who will liberate it from them!!!"},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"Unlike his friend and co-worker, Joseph Tkach (Jr), Mike Feazell provides a relatively in-depth examination of WCG doctrinal changes during the early 1990s. The book seems poorly organized and rather disjointed, even contradictory at times - Feazell jumps from topic to topic with little of a detectable outline (perhaps he produced a majority of the book by combining previous articles he had written), and often adopts an irritatingly defensive tone, but it does provide ample \\"food for thought\\" on many points, as opposed to Tkach's rather glossy, plastic narrative. There's less here for an outside observer, though; the book seems to be more directed at current and former WCG members."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"After reading Mr. Feazell's book, I can understand why the church blew up the way it did. Having been a member since birth, I can say there were times I empathized with Mike. Not being able to play sports in high school because of the Sabbath issue, etc... Having said that, Mike seemed a bit too bitter, a bit to angry etc... I give him kudos for writing the book as it is the view of someone who lived through the break-up, however he doesn't seem to effectively refute any of Mr. Armstrongs teachings other than resorting to name calling and innuendo. Some of the teachings of Mr. Armstrong certainly are flawed, and by no stretch of any human imagination could he be called a prophet, however, my point is that Mike does not satisfactorily address any changes in a scholarly light to validate in any way how things changed. I believe this to be at best a personal memoir, and not a valid defense of any changes that occurred. My recomendation would be to read it in that light, and find scholarly advice on the Bible elsewhere. As I said, kudos to Mike for writing this, but ultimately I think it misses the very point he may have been trying to make."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"I grew up in the WCG, and like most former members, have quite a few scars and just as many questions.This book has helped so much with understand not just the error of our old ways but why we believed them, what Herbert Armstrong's vision originally was, and the complete timeline of the doctrinal changes and split of the church after he passed.It's written by someone who was right in the midst of the caos and who has a complete understanding of the hurt and confusion that was caused. Let's be honest, only those who were a part of the WCG can fully understand what kind of damage and confusion was left behind.I've already recommended this book to other previous members of the WCG in hopes it can bring as much clarity and comfort as it has brought me."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"I came in contact with Herbert W. Armstrong and what was then called the \\"Radio Church of God\\" in another time, in 1956. Then, in 1958 I came to \\"God's own college\\" - the church's Ambassador College - answering Armstrong's call to young people to share in the telling of a Christian message that he claimed had not been preached for 1900 years.I have worked most of my adult life for the Worldwide Church of God, and many of those years were lived under the shadow of this charismatic leader. Then came the turbulent years of doctrinal changes, which drastically altered my life and turned it right side up.When I heard that Mike Feazell's &quot;inside story&quot; of the Worldwide Church of God was being published, I was quite anxious to read his personal experiences. We had lived through a miraculous liberation of the Worldwide Church of God from false religious teaching. I wanted to hear the full story from someone who was &quot;in at the creation,&quot; so to speak.I found the book so compelling that I essentially read it at \\"one sitting\\" over a recent weekend. I believe most people will be astounded at the story as well. If you want to understand - both intellectually and emotionally - what it was like to be a member of and actually live and work at the pulsating hub of what Ruth Tucker has called \\"an unorthodox fringe church,\\" then you will find this book a fascinating, instructive and sobering read. Most exciting and exhilarating is Feazell's recounting of the period when the actual spiritual liberation of the church occurred during the last dozen or so years. Reading his book immersed me into those years once again -- the time when we were confronted with the real truth about belief after belief that we had once accepted as \\"gospel truth.\\"We all know what it's like to live through revolutionary times, as our age has been one of change upon change. To be immersed in the world of religious change - and to experience it even vicariously - is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Mike Feazell's book provides all of us - whether we were a part of the old Worldwide Church of God or had never heard of it - with the chance to understand what it means to face the truth and finally to be able to let go of beliefs on which we had once staked our lives, but had come to find out were simply wrong and unbiblical."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"A sound theological base is vital to the spiritual health of any church organization. In this book, J. Michael Feazell lays out the errant theological history of the old Worldwide Church of God and engages the reader in a fascinating personal and corporate journey ending in that church's embracing of Christian orthodoxy. In this accurate and painfully honest account from an insider's perspective, Feazell is unflinching in his examination of Herbert Armstrong's church under the lens of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He wisely chooses not to vilify or judge Armstrong, however, revealing him for what he was in reality, simply a fallible human. He describes how easy it is to fall into error when a charismatic leader offers believable solutions to Christian nominalism and the sense of \\"unravelling\\" that occurs when people are confronted by a world they believe to be on a downward moral and behavioral spiral. Feazell shows how appealing religious legalism and transactionalism can be to those inclined to \\"law and order\\" and how readily some with a need to be \\"right\\" can accept an \\"only true church\\" mentality. The good news he presents is that it doesn't have to be this way. Through an honest appeciation for sound biblical scholarship and a willingness to \\"listen\\" to the word, he shows where peace and healing are available and that one really can be free to rest solely in Christ.Besides being an interesting and informative read, I found this book important in two other ways. First, it can help people in the new Worldwide Church of God who struggle with a lingering false identity rooted in tradition and who continue to carry various forms of residual baggage. Feazell's clear annunciation of the New Testament message, especially in the areas of the New Covenant and our freedom in Christ, would serve to help those whose cultural identities remain partially obscured from the effects of years in legalism, to complete trust in Christ alone. Secondly, for those outside the church's fellowship, the book sends a powerful message warning against the dangers inherent in lack of education and disdain for Christian theology, history and doctrine. Any church or movement can benefit from Mr. Feazell's analysis and prevent or correct the evils that flow from exclusivist teaching and legalism. While exposing the heartache resulting from the bad fruits of an aberrant theology, this book is really one of hope and encouragement. It offers liberation through the power of the gospel to any individual or church that find themselves boxed in through fear and guilt, a negative worldview or the need to feel important. Mr. Feazell's book, like the title of the first chapter, may well prove to be a \\"crack in the dam\\" against the psychological and religious forces that seek to keep people in bondage. It deserves a wide reading."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"While fresh analysis of the theological legacy of HerbertArmstrong, founder of the controversial &quot;Worldwide Church ofGod&quot; sect, would be welcome, little is to be found here.Former members, such as myself, will remember Armstrong for hiscold hearted aloofness, cruelty, and selfish lust for wordlywealth and status - not to mention his rank dishonesty (claimingdivine inspiration for his patently eclectic theological system).With regard to pursuit of wealth, Armstrong was secretly payinghimself the equivalent of $1 million per year in the 1970's!Mr Feazell fails to point out how the new leadership - which heis a part of - is any improvement. Top salaries for the newchurch boss, Joseph Tkach, and his management team - whichincludes Michael Feazell are still top secret but rumored to bewell into the six-figure range. And so far this year, this&quot;church&quot; (business?) has spent over $4 million more than it hastaken in meaning, to me, that the leaders are maintaining theirhuge salaries and grand lifestyles despite falling revenues.They claim this money is coming from &quot;reserves&quot; but skepticssuspect that it is coming from borrowing in anticipation ofpending real estate liquidations.

In fact for over65 years, the &quot;Worldwide Church of God&quot; sect has never leveledwith its members on how much its leaders are paying themselves -even when the sect was raking in over $200 million per year !The one star rating is for the lack of freshness in analysisand the hypocrisy &amp; secrecy of the present money-hungryadministration of which Mr. Feazell is a part."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"Excellent. I grew up in the Worldwide Church of God, but had left it by the time all of the changes happened (went to college). I always felt that I could never get a straight or satisfying answer to what was going on and what the doctrinal changes were. This book made it so clear to me. I read it slowly to digest everything. It brought back tons of memories.One concern of mine though is that the church was referred to as a cult and having lived my life in that church for 13 plus years, I still to this day don't think my experience was that way. I have very fond memeories of the church and when I left there was no negative consequences,etc.for doing so. I learned so much being a part of that church that I feel has made me a better person in life."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"I had mixed feelings regarding this book due to the lack of detail regarding the recent change in the doctrines of the worldwide church of God. On the one hand, it was very moving in places (i.e., the section concerning the agonizing decision to seek medical help for his small son instead of adhearing to Herbert Armstrong's doctrine of faith healing) and yet disappointing that there was so little discussion of the major personalities involved in the upheaval that the major doctrinal reverses created. Many long time and highlevel personnel left the church taking thousands of members with them. The best history of this unique story (of a denomination deemed a cult by mainstream Christianity becoming an Evangelical denomination) has yet to be told. It would be best recited by a sociologist or historian of American religion, I think. But nevertheless, it does speak of the earnest sincerity of the new leadership in their willingness to sacrifice millions of dollars and thousands of members for what they believe to have been massive doctrinal error on the part of their founder, the late Herbert W. Armstrong. Having family members in this church myself, I can attest to the confusion, bitterness, heartbreak, and grief that these changes brought about. It's close to the crisis that Vatican II brought about in the life of older Roman Catholics in the 1960's. Sill, maybe this book will help to bring closure to what's left of the Worldwide Church of God and the myriads left to pick up the pieces."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"For decades, the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) of Herbert W. Armstrong taught a curious message blending Adventism, Mormonism and British Israelism, while claiming to be the only true Christian church. After the death of Armstrong in 1986, his anointed successor Joseph Tkach, Sr began to gradually change the long-established theology of the WCG in the direction of standard evangelicalism or even mainline Protestantism.\\"The Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God\\" is written by J. Michael Feazell, the right hand man of both Tkach Sr and the current leader, Tkach Jr. Somewhat surprisingly, the book says very little about what actually happened when the WCG was \\"liberated\\" from Armstrongism. Most of it reads like a sermon, other parts sound like an internal manual for Church administrators with titles like \\"Strategies for sound body life\\" and \\"The path of renewal\\".Feazell does make two interesting admissions. First, he reveals that there were a lot of intrigues and conspiracies going on at WCG headquarters in Pasadena during Armstrong's last years. Second, he confirms that the changes after the old man's death were rammed through by an authoritarian, central leadership - most members (interestingly enough) refused to accept the new course. Says Feazell: \\"To involve pastors and members of a cult in the planning and implementation of doctrinal changes that completely transforms the core assumptions and values of the cult is to destroy the process before it begins\\". He also writes: \\"If you take the pressure off, people will revert to their old ways. (...) If we were to stop teaching the changes right now and invite members to go back to the old doctrines, I am convinced that a certain percentage would do so\\". The book contains statistics showing a steep fall in membership and church attendance due to the doctrinal changes, especially the rejection of Sabbatarianism.In general, however, Feazell simply sidesteps all the controversies. He says nothing about the (bizarre) court case between the reformed WCG and a splinter group, the Philadelphia Church of God. Instead, the author tells a few, admittedly disturbing, personal anecdotes. Thus, Feazell almost lost one of his children to pneumonia before deciding, at the last moment, that the WCG's prohibition of modern medicine is unbiblical. This is indeed a scary aspect of cultism. The Jehovah's Witnesses' ban on blood transfusions comes to mind.On a funnier note, the author quotes C.S. Lewis' stories about Narnia to drive home a theological point about inclusive salvation, and exclaims: \\"Praise God for Fred Rogers and Santa Claus! Praise God for the Easter Bunny and chocolate eggs! Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ, the Lord.\\" Well, at least it sounds funny to an outsider - maybe Feazell is saying it with a straight face. (Armstrong opposed Christmas and Easter as \\"pagan\\". Fred Rogers is apparently a children's channel show host who once dressed as Santa Claus, which bewildered Feazell's kids.)Believe it or not, but the pro-Armstrong and anti-Tkach book \\"Raising the ruins\\" by Stephen Flurry, a member of the Philadelphia Church of God, is actually much more interesting! See my extensive review of it elsewhere.Feazell's surprisingly boring book only deserves two stars. But sure, thank God - or was it the God Family - for the Easter Bunny, LOL."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"A more pointed exploration and analysis of the flawed theology Herbert Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God was founded upon than was \\"Transformed by Truth\\", also authored by present day WCG leadership.In this sense \\"TLWCG\\" breaks new ground in that one of the WCG's present day leaders goes on record in acknowledging that Armstrong's claims he was \\"the Elijah to come\\", who as God's one and only true end time apostle had sole authority to interpret and even challenge canonized scripture, were the false teachings of a heretic.TLWCG accomplishes this without unnecessarily judging Armstrong, or delving into any of the scandals associated with his name that are now publicly available in this information age, which is the best approach given the fact that the person of Armstrong admittedly remains a sensitive one personally for the author, as well as in the WCG overall.Seems to defend holding onto the totalitarian structure Armstrong established and taught as \\"God's only true form of government\\", by reasoning that without it doctrinal correction could not have occurred which, while true, overlooks the fact that much of the heresy perpetuated was due directly to a structure that discouraged critical thought. Unorthodox doctrine (that surely both lay members and some in ministry must have questioned over the years) was corrected, but one is left to wonder how much accountability and affirmation may remain a respecter of persons within the church at large, or how officials whom have sole discretion to decide such matters might adapt to significant change from a conforming hierarchal paradigm, to a more spiritually transformational one.Mr. Feazell offers an exceptional insider's assessment of the journey of the Worldwide Church of God from its start to the present."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"The author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment; further apalled by the Church Founder's belief, in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was God's True Church through the ages, right on up to the present 'end time'. Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong, the Church's actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misrepresentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its Pastor General as a \\"heretic\\", despite the Church's humanitarian works, publishing, Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W. Armstrong. Since Armstrong's death in 1986, Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions') and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination. Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927.Recommended reading: \\"Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong\\"; \\"Mystery Of The Ages\\"; \\"The Incredible Human Potential\\"; \\"The Real Jesus\\""},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"this is the other part of the story of the world wide church of God. read it very interesting."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"Mr. Armstrong use to say &quot;never believe what I say, prove it for yourself&quot;. After many countless hours of bible study at home and research completed at the library studying Easter, Christmas, Halloween, etc., I learned that God does not want us to participate in pagan holidays. You cannot love God and the world. You have to make a decision who you will worship - God or the world. The truth is the truth. Mr. Armstrong taught what was given to him from God; if that cannot be accepted now by some, it will be learned later as end-time events occur.The scriptures said that there would be those who would creep in unaware and make changes. This is what Mr Tkach Sr, Mr. Tkach Jr. and Mr. Feazell did. They tried to make us believe the way they wanted to believe. I proved the truth for myself about the Sabbath and God's Holy Days, etc. I am so grateful that God will send His son to us again and then the world will know the truth."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"What a load of codswallop this all is....

You might have to come up with some better material than this to justify your actions Mr Feazell....Cheerio... :o)"},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"More than anyone else on the margins of Protestant religiosity, it was Herbert W. Armstrong who fashioned the \\"electronic church.\\" Starting out in advertising in Oregon, he switched in 1933 to pitching religion on the radio. He amassed a fortune, built a massive headquarters, and founded Ambassador College in Pasadena, California, where he moved his business ventures in 1947.Armstrong blended end-time speculation and the idea that the Brits were Israelites with the slogans of pre-World War II fundamentalist religiosity. Some may remember hearing his booming voice on The World Tomorrow radio show or seeing him eventually perform on television, or recall reading his Plain Truth mass-circulation magazine.Armstrong could have been the model for the comic Dave Barry's amusing quip: \\"Jesus saves, send the money.\\" He eventually augmented his Radio Church of God with congregations, launching the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). He led the WCG as its pastor general until his death in 1986.His \\"church\\" was not without controversy; his troubles surfaced when he ousted his even more gifted son, Garner Ted Armstrong, who turned out to be a high-living, spectacular moral failure. When Herbert W. Armstrong passed away in 1986, his financial empire was in decline. Joseph Tkach, who replaced Armstrong, lacked his theatrical skills. In 1995, Joseph Tkach Jr. replaced his father and was soon forced by massive financial setbacks to cut much of the headquarters staff, sell real estate holdings, and then in 1997 close Ambassador College.Feazell provides the official, but highly sanitized, account of the fall of the Armstrong empire. He grants that under Joseph Tkach Jr. the leadership of the WCG was driven to abandon various unorthodox doctrines, including much of the end-time speculation and the British-Israel connection (p. 12). This was necessary to salvage what remained after the collapse of the Armstrong empire. Feazell seems to indicate that those who remained at the WCG headquarters believed the bizarre teachings of Armstrong.But Feazell also admits that \\"despite the poor research skills of certain [unnamed] cult-watchers, Herbert Armstrong did not deny the divinity of Jesus Christ\\" (p. 216 n. 14). The Armstrong movement, whatever its strange ideology on crucial issues, was also well within the parameters of fundamentalist Christianity.Much like a failed business venture, it tried to hold some of the badly splintered followers of Armstrong together while also finding a way of salvaging something in the aftermath of a dramatic market failure. While downsizing the Armstrong empire, its managers claim to have discovered orthodox religion. With this strategic shift, the WCG was eventually admitted to the National Association of Evangelicals.Why should any of this be of interest to readers in general? When on 14 November 2004 Richard Mouw and Rabi Zacharias spoke in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Joseph Tkach Jr. was on the stand supporting the effort of Greg Johnson (Standing Together Ministries) to evangelize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Earlier Johnson had introduced Michael Feazell, special assistant to Joseph Tkach Jr., to his Latter-day Saint friends and evangelical associates. Included in this group were the ardent anti-Mormons at Living Hope Ministries who specialize in attack videos.Those folks then produced a video entitled Called to Be Free, which purports to tell the story of how and why the WCG found the real Jesus and gained evangelical respectability. This video appears to be an attempt by countercultists to suggest to the Saints, based on the model of the WCG, how they can gain full recognition as an evangelical denomination."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"The Worldwide Church of God was not liberated; it was destroyed by a group of power-hungry individuals who didn't, and never did like rules. I was a member of that church for ten years, and finally left when the changing trends and attitudes got to me. I couldn't deal with it any more! The changes were taking place in the late '70s, and you just never knew sometimes which way things were going to go. They'd say or do something, then, boom,all of a sudden it would change again back to what it had been or similar. I left with no hard feelings, no wish to cause problems, and an assurance that if I wanted to come back I would receive help and counselling, but a couple of years later I was told of attacks against me, and I had actually been kicked out, according to the source. I felt I could no longer trust anyone there and ended association with all former friends. That hurt!!"},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"This was a fascinating tale of something I have never heard happening. A cult turning back to the mainstream! I felt it was well written although I would have liked more detail of the people involved and the steps taken. Surely many people lost jobs, etc. How was that done. Were they given a severance pay? What happened to them? What is this church doing now? Most of the other \\"reviews\\" aren't book reviews at all! They belong in a chat room. They are a continuation of an ongoing conflict by members and former members of this organization. But, wow, isn't the emotion interesting!!!"},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"You will undoubtedly find many extremely negative reviews here. When you are talking about this church, which was once a cult, it is easy to understand that many of the cult members will viciously attack any book that shows their history in an unflattering light.For the most part, the entire orthodox Christian community has stated exactly what this book states, but it is unique to hear it from an insiders perspective.So, those one star reviews actually give credence to the author's tome that the Worldwide Church of God needed to be liberated from a religion that created such unloving words and actions like you see in the reviews from those associated with the church before it was Christ-centered."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"I am a former WCG pastor. My family and I are fully supportive of the remarkable changes occurring within the WCG. I deeply miss the denomination, but alas our family has been deeply wounded on the battlefield of reformation, and there was no place within the denomination for healing.Mike's book brought tears to my eyes for its amazing frankness. Herbert Armstrong was a traveling salesman who got his religion out of a public library. He ignored a &quot;multitude of counsel,&quot; was largely uneducated in regard to biblical exegisis, biblical languages and other skills of good theology. WCG ministers largely had their minds filled with a Bachelor of Arts in &quot;Armstrongism&quot; not real theology. So, even many of the &quot;educated&quot; ones have had to first unlearn gross error before learning real Christianity.The doctrines of the &quot;new&quot; WCG are incredibly balanced theologically. I pray that Armstrong's legacy of an overbearing administration is also soon reformed. I was glad to see Mike briefly address this dangling issue in his book.I was one of those who returned to seminary to get a master's degree, so as to un-learn Armstrongism and be bathed in truth. It was a personal revival, both renewing and at times a disheartening experience. I was amazed to see genuine fruits of the Holy Spirit in professors and classmates from a variety of denominations, in a way that I had never experienced before. I was also saddened at the ever-present legalism and man-made rules of other denominations. One seminary professor set me straight, declaring that all denominations are probably 80% wrong doctrinally. How great God's grace is! 80% wrong, yet 100% right if their faith is in Jesus Christ -- how wonderful is God's grace! We all differ in human understanding (which we call doctrine) yet all agree that salvation is in Jesus and that we are to love God and neighbor.Armstrongism is dying, thank God! This book, is excellent. I struggled with some of the &quot;this is how to reform a church&quot; comments, but by and large, an excellent read."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"I felt the book was candid and honest. Having been married to a long time member of the WCG I'm very familiar with HWA's theology. Many long time members, like my wife, weren't able to study the Bible without seeing everything through the eye's of Herbert Armstrong. Amazingly enough, if the Bible said one thing they would believe the opposite because that's what HWA taught them and individuals in his church just couldn't see that it was Him (HWA) they believed in not the Bible. They replace their hunger to get closer to God with a hunger to follow &quot;God's end time man&quot;. The book was honest and insightful. To reach the highest levels in the organization and then admit that you've spent four life following a lie, must of been difficult to do. Then to make the changes they did is remarkable. The new church leadership could of left everything as it was and lived a very comfortable lifestyle: cars, lavish homes, private jet. The Holy spirit was truly at work in their hearts. God is good. I also feel their was a lot more Mr. Feazell could of said about Herbert Armstrong and the goings on in the church that would of been helpful to people still attending some of the offshoot church's that still preach Armstrongism. Overall it's a must read for those that still haven't faced the fact that HWA was not an Apostle just a man who was able to convince a lot of people to believe in him."},{"Title":"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The","review":"A more pointed exploration and analysis of the flawed theology Herbert Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God was founded upon than was &quot;Transformed by Truth&quot;, also authored by present day WCG leadership.In this sense &quot;TLWCG&quot; breaks new ground in that one of the WCG's present day leaders goes on record in acknowledging that Armstrong's claims he was &quot;the Elijah to come&quot;, who as God's one and only true end time apostle had sole authority to interpret and even challenge canonized scripture, were the false teachings of a heretic.TLWCG accomplishes this without unnecessarily judging Armstrong, or delving into any of the scandals associated with his name that are now publicly available in this information age, which is the best approach given the fact that the person of Armstrong admittedly remains a sensitive one personally for the author, as well as in the WCG overall.Seems to defend holding onto the totalitarian structure Armstrong established and taught as &quot;God's only true form of government&quot;, by reasoning that without it doctrinal correction could not have occurred which, while true, overlooks the fact that without it such drastic corrections would not have been necessary.

He is also quite candid in his evaluation of its now deceased leader, Herbert W. Armstrong. Feazell's analysis of Armstrongism and how it departs from Christianity is excellent. As a former member of the WWCG, I found it refreshing that one of the current WWCG leaders is able to publicly confront these issues. This may help the many WWCG ministers and lay members who are not able to do the same.From the theology expressed in this book, it is clear that Feazell has over-reacted to the ungrace of Armstrongism and has swung in the direction of a &quot;wider hope&quot;. He espouses the weak and minority viewpoints of inclusivism and, from other sources, post-mortem evangelization. On the topic of grace, he seems to have let passionate catharsis displace careful exegesis.

I loved this book and I recommend it to people over the age of 9 because the book uses subjects that a kid under the age of 9 might not know about.

We felt so alone and devastated that we were unable to conceive. Fortunately this no longer has to happen.In \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\", the authors carefully outline the many reasons why it is so difficult for couples to be successful in getting pregnant. Readers feel like a knowledgeable friend is giving them tips and facts in a succinct, and easy to understand manner.The section explaining that a man may be part of the equation in this quest for a baby is very important. Men learn that they may be contributing to the situation and that there are solutions to alleviate most existing conditions.The authors lay out a blueprint for the IVF process in a clear and conversational manner. They remove the unknowns, reveal the pitfalls, and highlight the benefits. The personal accounts interspersed throughout the chapters help readers know that they are not alone.Another nice feature of this book is the authors actually have a sense of humor. It's not a typical \\"dry\\" read you might find when reading most fertility books.Overall, I highly recommend this book. \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" is a \\"must read\\" for any couple contemplating fertlity treatment.Regi TopolMenlo Park, California"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"My wife and I have one child with CF and even though we desperately want another we only recently decided to do it. We owe much of our newfound decision to the authors of What to Do When You Get Pregnant. The chapter on PDG (preimplantation genetic Diagnosis) answered all the questions we had about pre-genetic testing and gave us optimism to try again. We will rely on this book heavily as we begin the IVF process and will recommend it to everyone we know with fertility issues."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is EXCELLENT and packed with all the information couples need to know when diving into fertility treatment. We had an especially hard time getting pregnant and after trying for several years considered egg donors and surrogates. We soon learned that this option left us with numerous questions that other books didn't sufficiently address.The chapter on third party reproduction taught us everything we needed to know. Learning about other people's experiences including families who used a surrogate and hearing from a surrogate herself (and her husband) made us feel more at ease about the road ahead. The book not only answered all our questions but also emphasized areas that we hadn't thought about like finding the right professional team to make our path seamless.We also were undecided about telling our future children how they came into the world but were pleased to find that this book has an entire chapter dedicated to the subject.My wife and I recommend this book without reservation. It covered the IVF process the way we remembered it better than all the books we read. We have given What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant to a number of friends, and it's one of the few we would endorse."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is everything the Library Journal Review said it would be and more. My wife ran across the review and couldn't stop talking about it. Here's some highlights straight from LJR (and also why we bought it):\\"From natural family planning to high-tech methods like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and zygote and gamete intrafallopian transfers, this easy-to-read, empathic guide covers every option for infertile couples wishing to conceive-and much more...Other topics include sperm and egg donation; embryo donation and surrogacy; technologies that allow prescreening for genetic diseases, sex selection, and preselection of desirable traits; keeping a relationship healthy; deciding when to move on; and the role that legal and mental health professionals play in all these processes....This solid, up-to-date resource supplants Debra Fulghum Bruce and Samuel Thatcher's Making a Baby: Everything You Need To Know To Get Pregnant.\\"We have been going through some trying times as we sought to overcome our infertility and this book gave us the tools to not only understand the process but to navigate the ins and outs and ups and downs of treatment. Relationships have a way of drifting apart during treatment and this book gave us the life raft we needed to stay together and work it out. We highly recommend this book. If you don't have it, buy it now!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I've tried reading several infertility books in the past, and while some seemed promising they were either too technical or too autobiographical. It wasn't until I broke down in tears to a friend that she recommended a new book, What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant.I ordered this book and have been thanking her ever since. It's a huge improvement over some of the other books I've read and it really did speak to me and my husband. This was important to us because many of the books were either over our head or coming from a personal perspective that didn't resonate with us. But this wasn't the case with this book. It's comprehensive, encouraging, interesting and taught us things about our body and our condition that we would have never known.For years, we blamed ourselves and often times each other but this book showed us that our situation isn't our fault. This made a huge difference in how we view ourselves and each other and it helped us get back on the same page. No matter what fertility method you're using the section on communication is priceless.Another issue this book has helped us deal with is family and friends and how to handle the stress surrounding not being able to conceive. We've been TTC for five years and many times have gotten fed up with the constant concern over our problem.This book was the first one to let us know that we don't have to tell anyone anything and that what we disclose is entirely up to us. This was a huge relief to us because by limiting the information flow we now get along better with our loved ones.We're half way into our IVF cycle and are re-reading this book as we complete our round. It's an incredible resource and we're glad we didn't have to do it alone. Thanks a million! We highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book gave my husband the encouragement he needed to get a fertility evaluation. He hates dentists and wasn't about to go to a doctor for something like this. For awhile, I was crushed to say the least.But then suddenly my luck changed. My husband got curious about this book, picked it up off my desk, and the next thing I knew he told me he wanted to see an RE. I was amazed!My husband got excited when he learned that nearly all male infertility issues can be bypassed with IVF. We just saw an RE and found out we're good candidates for IVF and are about to take the plunge. We're glad that the authors decided to write this book, and are especially glad that one of the authors is an RE. It's exactly what we needed when we needed it."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I heard a radio interview with the female author of this book this morning on the \\"Doug Stephan's Good Day\\" show and bought it during lunch.My wife and I have struggled with secondary infertility for the past 5 years and only recently decided to take serious steps towards resolving it.The book covers all the tests, procedures, and medications that anyone needs to be successful at getting pregnant all in a knowledgeable and friendly tone of voice. This was especially important to my wife because some of the other \\"dry\\" books out there had already turned her off.I like the book because it's approachable from a man's perspective. I had a hard time finding the right fertility book because there are so many \\"girlfriend\\" guides available today. No offense to those authors, but men have a hard time getting their hands around these types of books.My wife and I recommend this book highly. We were so pleased with this buy that we orderd copies for all our friends ( 2 personal and 3 in our support group) going through the same thing. It's the best \\"couples guide\\" out there with the latest information on new and upcoming technologies."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is excellent! All I have to say is that the reviewer from Maine is either sadly misinformed or trashing it out of spite. Potter and Hanin did an excellent job writing this book and if the reviewer that dogged it actually read it she would agree too. If this book was bad or confusing, do you really think one of the top fertility patient advocates in the country (and possible the world), Pamela Madsen, the Founder & Executive Director of the American Fertility Association, would have penned the forward? I don't think so.Trust me, anyone who has something negative to say about What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant has a personal agenda that has NOTHING to do with getting pregnant. If you want to understand the fertility process in easy-to-read language but you also want a comprehensive book that gives you everything you need to know and more about reducing stress, keeping your relationships healthy and what your spouse is going through during the entire ordeal -- BUY this book. It is without a doubt a MUST READ.I can't tell you how much it's helped my husband and me. We're gearing up for our first cycle and it's been our bible."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is refreshing after reviewing some of the \\"chick guides\\" out there. It's factual, informative, conversational, and even finds a way to intersperse humor in all the right places.My wife and I have longed to have a family of our own for sometime now. We've tried every technique known to man but still haven't succeeded. I heard about this book from an RE who does business with my wife (she's in the pharmaceutical business) and can easily tell why Newsweek would recommend it.It covers all the latest and greatest and even gives a bird's-eye view into the future. None of the other books we've come across do that and the ones that do mention future technologies do so only in passing.Another reason we recommend this book is that one of the authors is a well-known RE (so he knows what he's talking about) and the other author is a journalist (so it's not a dry read). It has a journalistic bent in that it tells you what both supporters and critics say about advanced technologies. This was important to us because we wanted to know all the pros and cons of all the options available in case IVF doesn't work for us.I've yet to come across a book that does all this and gives the reader a price break -- it's published in paperback so readers aren't forced to cough up the extra cash for a hardback.We recommend this book to all our friends and colleagues and know of at least three couples who use this book as their fertility bible (like us) and several others who have just ordered it.We even ran into a couple from our support group the other day who thanked us for recommending it because it saved them from buying three books: one on natural solutions, acupuncture, and IVF. Like us, they were amazed to find that all these subjects and more are covered in one book: \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant.\\""},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I was feeling isolated and depressed until a coworker told me about this book. The authors are a doctor and patient team who wrote this so couples wouldn't have to guess what comes next when trying to get pregnant. The book covers everything from natural and advance techniques to relationships to what lies ahead in the future. I commend them. They did a remarkable job!My husband and I had been trying natural techniques for the last 4 years and had essentially thrown in the towel. We have never been opposed to getting help but like a lot of people we wanted to do it ourselves. Don't make this mistake. Once I read this book I realized how important it is to see a reproductive endocrinologist. I never knew my eggs had a limited lifespan. And I never realized getting pregnant is a throw of the dice. This is something every woman (and man) needs to know.Once I saw an RE I found out that both of my fallopian tubes were blocked and my husband had a low sperm count. Essentially, it didn't matter how long we tried - it would have never happened. This book taught me that I could either be stubborn and remain childless or seek treatment and have a child.It also opened our eyes to other possibilities like foster parenting and adoption. We hadn't given these options much thought before reading this book but now have a whole new perspective. We realized for the first time that our goal is to be parents -- no matter how it happens.Thank you Dr. Potter and Jennifer Hanin. You have helped us through a trying time and made us realize what our true desire is. This is an immeasurable gift!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon.

A must read for anyone going through this!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I got Plan to Get Pregnant first. That was a great book to read to prepare my body for pregnancy. I then was given Taking Charge of YourFertility. I would recommend that book to every woman whether she is trying to get pregnant or avoid pregnancy or just to learn about her own body. Wow it went way beyond what you learnedly in sex ed or high school bio. Wish I had read it years earlier.Then I read What to do When You Cant Get Pregnant. That really explained all the tests what they mean and what the results mean. It also explained what your options are when the results of your tests show a problem. For example if this hormone is low you will likely get thisdrug or if this test shows x you will need ivf.I found these three books to be complementary and a great resource particularly if like me you have an HMO and need to be extra aggressive about your healthcare.I also got Infertility For Dummies. Would not recommend that book. Does not contain much info although doescontain a general overview."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book was good, but not what I expected based on all the reviews I read on Amazon about it. I was expecting GREAT, not simply good. No big slam, just not worth the hype. Not much different, really, than what is already out there on the bookshelves... which is OK, but I was hoping for something more earth-shattering --not just another doctor's perspective and all the same medical techniques described, blah, blah, blah.Truth is, I should have checked this book out first at the bookstore to see if it was right for me. It wasn't a total waste of money, but didn't really address what I was looking for. I will pass it along to a friend who is getting ready to IVF...Bottom line -- I guess you shouldn't buy a book just based on reviews. Do some investigation first."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"A friend recommended this book as \\"required reading\\" if you are facing any kind of infertility, or seeking treatment. This book went far beond that, and I heartily agree. It helped me understand what I was going through, the many different options, separated fact from myth and was presented in easy to read format. Don't let the fact that a doctor has written this book think it is in clinical terms; he co-wrote it with a patient and it is all very well presented. I was so impressed, I am now seeking treatment with Dr. Daniel Potter, but this is a great book no matter where you live. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I was surprised that I did not like this book as much as other reviewers. On the plus side, it does cover a lot of information. However, sometimes the information was summarized to such an extent that it was inaccurate. As an example, when describing how to use OPK's, the authors say that if you have irregular cycles, you should use an OPK every few days. However, as OPK packages tell you and other books say, you need to do it EVERY DAY or else you could miss the one day of the surge. There are other places where statistics are summarized to the extent that they are not accurate. Finally, there are typos and spelling errors through the book. This type of lack of care makes me concerned about what other types of errors might be in the book."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I have been struggling with infertility for years.

I like the easy to understand quality of writing and the way it breaks information down in understandable terms. I like all the tips and the questions to ask a doctor or your partner.

When his golf buddy told him about this book he told me about it with such enthusiasm that I purchased it for him.He had warned me two years ago that he wasn't sure he could have kids. After his family physician diagnosed him with cancer as a child he just wasn't sure. But after reading this book he felt more certain it was a possibility than ever before.After staying up all night reading it myself I have to agree with him. The authors wrote an informative and inspirational book that has truly changed our outlook on having a family.If you're having a hard time getting pregnant, this is one book you'll want to add to your reading list. We've even shown it to friends who have been through infertility treatment and all wish they knew back then what we know now."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book did wonders for us.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This was the last infertility/IVF book I bought (after countless others), and is the most comprehensive guide that I found.

It helped my husband and I go through what the authors describe as a \\"trying time.\\" It was. By the time I found this book I was on my third cycle and needed helpful advice. We decided to read it as we went through each step instead of all at once and it gave us helpful information, insightful tips, and the encouragement we needed to succeed.I'm pregnant now and couldn't be happier! Finally I can celebrate Mother's Day weekend without worrying whether I'll ever become a mother.I thought so much of this book I bought several copies to pass on to my friends who are trying.

It also covers all the different forms of male and female infertility. It gives in depth explanations to all the treatment options and what to expect with each one of them.

Although the book can be very technical, it does offer explanation of what all the medical terms are. Highly recommend for those who are exploring their options."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"Of all of the books I've bought this is the one both myself and my husband have read and continue to refer to as we go through treatment.

I would highly recommend you start here when gathering information about this emotionally and physically difficult process."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I'm not one to review books but this one is GOLDEN. After reading it in one sitting, I loaned it to my husband and purchased copies for seven friends. Like me, they have gone career route and have put off having a family.This book gives readers helpful facts and tips that know other book does. Like did you know that most of your partner's sperm will NEVER get beyond your cervix? Or that even though tons of fertility books have instructed women to check their cervical position, this is NOT useful. The authors go on to instruct readers on what does work.My husband was thrilled to read that other couples are going through many of the peaks and valleys that we've experienced. He was especially thrilled to see that this book mirrored what he was feeling as a man. Most of the books he read early on hadn't captured how he felt so he often felt even more isolated as a result.The tips on Spicing Up Your Relationship were top-notch. I've already tried several of them and my husband was ecstatic. Thanks to communication tips provided in this book we know have the kind of relationship we've always wanted.What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant is worth every penny. It even has a comprehensive index and glossary. Our RE was surprised that he didn't have to spend extra time explaining what a salpingectomy or intracytoplasmic sperm injection was. But the great thing about this book is it explains all the treatments in lay man's terms. We easily grasped every concept of this well-written book."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I love this book! I heard about What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant in a chat room and I can't say enough great things about it. My husband and I were basically on the verge of giving up when I heard other women raving about how much this book has helped them. I'm not one to follow the crowd so I had to some independent research. I looked the authors up online and found their website: www.cantgetpregnant.comThis site made me a believer. The authors backgrounds are unparallel and praise this book has received from leading experts across the country only show they have strong confidence in this book. The website has more than one plus: not only does it offer resources and tools to help gauge your fertility but it also has an excerpt of the book.I was even more convinced when I saw that Pamela Madsen, the Founder & Executive Director of the American Fertility Association wrote the foreword. Like the authors, Ms. Madsen conceived two children through IVF. If you're not sure who Ms. Madsen is all you have to do is look her name up online. She is considered the #1 fertility patient advocate on the planet.I'm in the middle of my first round and have high hopes that I will sail through this. I have to say that I was a little concerned when I received my box of medication but this book gave me confidence to overcome any insecurity I initially had. This book has helped us understand the process and has walked me through the process step-by-step like a friend. I also liked the tips and advice in the chapter titled Living a Fertile Lifestyle. I've made a number of lifestyle changes and believe they will pay off.Whatever you decide to do -- check out this book - it's a winner all the way around."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I had no idea what I was getting into until I found this book online. The authors organized this book so that it makes going through the IVF process seamless. It gives detailed information on each step, phase, and type of medication and even gives tips on making the injections less painless. My husband and I tried many of these like using numbing cream, ice packs, and massaging the injection sites afterwards and they all REALLY work.I had my egg retrieval and we just picked \\"our team\\" on Friday. I thought so much of this book that my husband brought my wireless laptop to my bedside so I could write this review. Well, really I dictated and he happily did the rest.We both would have been lost without this book. The hardest part for us facing IVF was finding a guide that would really walk us through the process so we didn't have to guess if we were doing something right or wrong. I felt very confident about the whole thing after finding this book and it helped us get through it all without a hitch.IVF is a huge step to take and we had many concerns about going through with it. But \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" put all our fear to rest. Speaking of rest, I didn't think I could do the required \\"baby rest\\" this book calls for following the egg transfer but after reading all the things I can do like catch up on movies, journal, or play card games (Mille Bornes is my favorite) I decided this down time isn't such a bad deal after all.Our consensus is this book is very, very helpful. Go for this one!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is one of the reasons we got pregnant. It guided us through every procedure including my wife's surgery, her egg retrieval, egg transfer, and it even helped me overcome my fear of administering shots. It's not that I felt squeamish about giving them I just had a hard time doing anything to my wife that might cause her discomfort.We both read it before treatment and then used it as a guide while we were going through the motions. It kept us sane the entire time. We credit it for helping us overcome all the rough patches.It also helped us get balance back into our relationship. We had been through 2 previous IVF attempts and banked on being pregnant only to find out it didn't take. This is the stuff that rips your heart out and kills relationships. I know ours was dying until we got our hands on this book. It showed us how to pick ourselves back up again and reconnect with each other and our family and friends and even gave us tips on how to extricate ourselves from stressful situations (something we have always had a hard time with.)It worked for us so hopefully with the right RE it will work for you."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"Funny how when a book is SELLING WELL reviewers come out of the woodwork to dog it. Hmmm? Why is that? Other authors jealous?I find it hard to believe that reviewers wishing to get pregnant would spend their time belittling books that were written to help them. Most of the people I know hoping to get pregnant would happily invite in helpful information from all sources instead of running great books into the ground.I've subscribed to Newsweek for ten years and I have a hard time believing that this reputable news magazine would recommend this book if someone there hadn't reviewed it firsthand. I also find it hard to believe that Pamela Madsen, the Executive Director of the American Fertility Association, would write the foreword for this book if she didn't support it 100 percent.I believe wholeheartedly in this book. Many people in my support group swear by this book, and I know that REs recommend it to their patients. I know my cousin's RE did and she lives in New York and ours did and we live in Indiana.What's not to like about this book? It's written by a reputable RE and a journalist WHO BY THE WAY WERE BOTH FERTILITY PATIENTS. And yes, they were successful ones at that. Both have children as a result of IVF. Both set out to write the book that they would have liked to have read when they were going through treatment.From my perspective, this book is the best of both worlds -- a well-written conversational book with the medical expertise to back it up. The book covers the entire gamut of fertility treatments from pinpointing ovulation to every treatment imaginable.My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 5 years and I find it hard to believe that other people trying to get pregnant would have ANYTHING negative to say about any fertility book - especially this one."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I found this book to be well organized, easy to read and very informative. I wish it had been available when my husband and I went through treatment last year. And we did it all...IVF with ICSI, PGD, Microsort....and ultimately donor egg. The other books out there were so clinical and difficult to follow...I dreaded reading any of them.I purchased this book out of curiosity actually. You see, Dr. Potter was my RE. We are now blessed with a beautiful baby girl because of Dr. Potter and his amazing staff at Huntington Reproductive Center. I have never met a doctor with such a passion for his work. Dr. Potter's credentials are impressive to say the least. We selected him as our doctor because of that and because he is so approachable. It only makes sense that his book would be written in such a positive, easy-to-understand format.Everything you need is here. All of the angles are covered - the latest technologies, tests, procedures, what to do, what to expect and what questions to ask. The \\"what to expect\\" aspect is so important because it can be scary jumping into the world of infertility treatment. It is a highly stressful, emotional time. All the more reason to tap into helpful, positive people and resources like Dr. Potter and \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\"."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"We didn't know which infertilty book to read because there are so many to choose from but when we saw this one in Newsweek that was all we needed. My husband ordered it last week and we've both read it over the last two days.We both agree that this book is excellent! It covers all the low tech stuff we've heard about from friends as well as all the high tech stuff we've read about in newspaper articles and the latest Newsweek.We're younger than most of the people we've heard about needing treatment (only 23) but we learned from this book that infertility can strike at any age. This made us decide to see a specialist now since we have been trying since we married three years ago.We recommend this book to couples of all ages -- no matter if you're 43 or 23 like us. This book is great! It has helped us find the right path. Good luck to everyone!"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I've been TTC for awhile now, and relied mainly on the chat boards for my info. But I decided to buy a few of the new books to see what I might learn, and found this one to be terrific.It's written by a journalist and her doctor, so it's very conversational but unlike some of the other books out these days it has the medical credibility to stand on its own. The other books are ok, but the title of this one is accurate -- it really does tell you \\"What to Do When You can't Get Pregnant.\\"This one also has a lot of information the other books don't, like a chapter on relationships, on telling your children about their conception, and it even has full chapters on Microsort and PGD - most of the other books barely mention these amazing new techniques or might have a page or two on them.I'm a beleiver in \\"If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything\\", so I'm not going to review the other books.... this one is all I need."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"This book is great! It walked my husband and I through every procedure we might need and answered all of our questions (more than any one doctor could) - and if you know us you would know that is asking a lot.We would not try IVF or any other fertility procedure without first having this book. It is a truly a gem and we can't thank the authors enough.I have had four miscarriages and my husband and I never knew there are technologies available to help us figure out why this is happening. This is the first time we have both felt encouraged, and even happy.This book informed us, helped us through the grieving process, gave our relationship a needed a boost, and offered us renewed hope that one day we will have a child of our own.Some of the other IVF books were okay but we knew we had found the right book when we saw this one mentioned in this week's Newsweek (July 4). This is the one book that you can depend on every step of the away. No matter what questions you have about infertility this one gives you the answers and comforts you at the same time."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I'm doing this solo and needed a fertility guide that could take the role of my fianc&eacute; (he's working overseas and can't help with the day to day regimen). This guide did just that. It's packed with helpful information and tips and really tells you like it is without dramatizing or sugar-coating the experience. I felt like I was hearing \\"what to do when you can't get pregnant\\" from an endearing friend.I even took this book overseas and found it just as interesting as any bestselling novel. This is a high point for me because I'm a book aficionado, book club member, and an avid reader.I've recommended \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" to all my single and married friends. I start IVF next week and am excited about going through the long protocol (even though some find this scary).I owe my positive attitude to this book. If I wasn't using it, I'd probably be scared like most career-minded women like me who turn to fertility treatment as a last resort. But not anymore. Not by a long-shot.The authors of this book have done a beautiful job of taking readers step-by-step through all fertility treatments especially the IVF process.If you want a conversational, intelligent and practical guide that helps you understand why you're not getting pregnant and what you can do about it -- What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant is THE book to buy."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"It seems odd that the reviewers blasting this book and taking pot shots at its lead author (a well-known RE who has had fertility treatment himself to conceive) keep recommending A Few Good Eggs. Hmmm? Sounds to me like the authors of \\"A Few Good Eggs\\" (or they're friends) are threatened by this book. And well they should be.I joined a Resolve Support Group to deal with all the appointments, missing hours and hours away from work, and what to tell our only child who many times didn't understand why Mommy was sad sometimes.Time and time again the women in my group talked about how much \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" changed their life for the better. How it walked them through ALL types of fertility treatments. How it showed them what the options are. How it helped them overcome a steep learning curve. How it helped perk up their relationships. How it helped them understand why donors and surrogates do what they do. How it helped them decide if and when they should tell their kids about their conception. How they should talk to their non-IVF kids. How it helped them understand when pre-genetic testing is needed. How it helped them realistically decide when they should move on. And how it made them re-think their long-term goal and find the best way to achieve it. In short, they all said they used to think about having a baby but now they focus on becoming a parent. To me, this is all the reassurance I needed to know this is a stellar book.They didn't let me down either. The moment I opened it I didn't put it down until 3 am only to pick up where I left off with coffee the next morning.This book stands on its own merit (as you can see from all the 5 Star reviews it has generated). And no, despite the discredited accusation from the Boston reviewer, I don't know the authors personally -- but I wish I did.I did find out from my Resolve support group that Pamela Madsen, Co-founder and Executive Director of the American Fertility Association wrote the foreword for this book. I've seen Ms. Madsen on a number of news programs including the Today Show, Good Morning America, Dateline and many others. She is the leading fertility patient advocate in the country. There is NO way Ms. Madsen would endorse a fertility book that wasn't top notch. This I am sure of.Like the people in my support group (and the other 5 star reviewers), I support the message of this book. \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" helped me get through a difficult process and gave me a new lease on life. My egg transfer is in two weeks and I feel confident that I'll have good news.Whatever you do, don't listen to anyone who blasts this book in favor of another. Buy this book and decide for yourself. Anyone that compares this book to the other recent ones will know just what I mean. This one is conversational, informative, and a great resource. I can't say this about the fertility books that came out about the same time as this one. Neither could anyone in my support group."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I have had a number of miscarriages that none of my doctors could explain. Everytime my husband and I experienced the high of knowing we were pregnant (after rejoicing with family and friends), a tidlewave of tears washed that euphoria away.We struggled for years dealing with the emotional pain that follows losing a child. Many people suggested that I was making too much of this pain (even my doctor) since we had yet to reach full-term. This only made me angry and created rifts between my husband and I.The ongoing pain and anger forced my husband and I into counseling to deal with our repetitive grief.This book helped us understand the dynamics that occur during fertility treatments and when relationships are under immense stress. It made us realize that miscarriages often occur due to chromosomal abnormalities -- a notion that no doctor ever uttered to us. And it helped us deal with the baggage that occurs within our own relationship and others.We often found attending family functions, holiday get-togethers, and baby showers uncomfortable. We had no idea how to back out of events or limit them as these authors discuss in detail the need to sometimes \\"give yourself a hall pass\\" \\"scale back\\" and always have an \\"exit plan.\\"Thank you Dr. Potter and Jennifer Hanin for putting the high back into our pursuit to get pregnant.

It's conversational, reassuring and urges couples to \\"discover the truth\\" about why they're not getting pregnant.I conceived easily 6 years ago and we were dumbfounded when no matter what we did or how we did it nothing ever happened.The authors of \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" made us realize that anyone at any time can have trouble conceiving. The book jacket alone says it all:\\"Having a baby is the most natural thing we do in life, but that doesn't mean it's easy.\\"It also helped us understand that anything can go wrong when sperm tries to unite with an egg (it explains the process in layman's terms), and this is why getting pregnant is truly is a miracle.We both enjoyed reading this book, and learning just how important getting a fertility evaluation is.I've already used the method mentioned in this book to pinpoint ovulation, and we both value the detailed information on the IVF process. My husband felt that the chapter on male infertility really captured how he feels about not being able to conceive. And unfortunately neither of us knew that egg quality decreases with age.We were relieved to know that like us both of these authors had walked the same fertility journey that we now find ourselves in. And it's a real plus that one of the authors, Potter, is a leading reproductive endocrinologist. Who better to get the inside scoop from than an expert who knows infertility inside and out?These days I recommend two books to my friends, one after they conceive -- \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" and one before they conceive -- \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant.\\""},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"For nearly two months this book has meant everything to me. I'm 42 and am embarking on parenthood alone.Well not really - this book has accompanied me through every step so far from the initial realization that I needed to act fast to every lab test including thryroid, prolactin, FSH, and estrogen. It has held my hand as I self-administered injections, gave me courage as I approached my egg retrieval and now it will reassure me as I approach the big event (egg transfer) that could make me a parent.What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant has also done something wonderful for me -- it has gone the extra mile to help me understand that I'm not in this alone (something that not even my doctor or his nurse managed to do successfully).The resource list in this book is worth its weight in gold. I have tapped into a number of websites that have helped me find other people in my same situation. I especially like the easy-to-read charts that dummy down what medications my doctor would likely prescribe during each phase of treatment.I recommend this book to anyone - especially those who may not have a partner to help in every aspect. Fertility treatment can be an emotional rollercoaster filled with what might seem like endless appointments and nightly homework assignments (hormone injections).If you can't rely on someone special to help out this book fills in the gaps.But it also holds great value to those that do have a helpful partner. I've recommended it to both and have only received positive feedback."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I absolutely love this book! I read about it in the July 4 Newsweek and was even more convinced to purchase it after seeing one of the authors on a local morning show the other day (by the way she has the cutest twins ever)!The book is intelligent, empathetic, and easy-to-read. I'm not one to delve into self-help books with eagerness but this one is chock full of up-to-the-minute fertility information. My husband even had to bribe me with dinner to get a peek at it!I set the bar high for self help books. Whenever I pick up a consumer health guide it has to be: a) conversational; 2) well researched; 3) and most importantly written by an expert.I was pleasantly surprised to find this one met all my criteria.My husband and I consider ourselves well-read but even we didn't know just how hard it is to conceive naturally until we read this book. I always thought pregnancy would be a cinch because I have three sisters who seem to get pregnant without even trying. My luck has never been this good.But this book taught me an important lesson: luck has little to do with getting pregnant.It helped me understand that the odds are stacked against me every month, that most of my husband's sperm will NEVER get beyond my cervix, and that my egg quality continues to decline each year. I guess I was under the impression that like Madonna or Geena Davis I could conceive well into my 40's.I applaud the authors for setting the record straight. I recommend \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" to anyone trying to conceive. It helped me replace years of tears with much deserved answers."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I bought this book last night after thumbing through my RE's \\"Newsweek\\" yesterday afternoon. This is the ONLY fertility book that the Newsweek article I read, \\"Going Straight For IVF,\\" recommends. I believe it starts on page 55 of the July 4 issue.The article gives helpful information on fertility stats, treatment costs, the growing use of IVF, and discusses prominent fertility organizations like the AFA, ASRM, Resolve, and even the reproductive division of the CDC, and recommends \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" as the only book to buy.A few of my closest friends have been TTC for years way before we realized we had issues so after reading through this book I bought several extra copies online to give to them as gifts.Now I can see why \\"Newsweek\\" would only recommend this book. It's the best book available on IVF, fertility treatments, overcoming stress, has balanced views of both men and women's issues, and even gives a run down of complimentary therapies like muscle relaxation, yoga and acupuncture and so on (which surprised my husband and I because one of the authors is an RE and we thought all Western doctors didn't believe in these techniques but we're glad to find out otherwise).Don't waste another day without this book. I've followed \\"Newsweek\\" reading recommendations for the last six years and they've never let me down yet."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"Newsweek couldn't have been more right about this book. We had it expressed to us immediately after reading the July 4 Newsweek article that ONLY recommends this book when trying to get pregnant.This book has everything we expected and more. My wife and I have been trying natural ways for years and it really hurts to see her deal with the disappointment of not getting pregnant each month. This book tells you WHY this is the case for many couples. But most importantly, it tells WHAT you can do about it.We even considered an infertility book on acupuncture and Chinese medicine and one that dealt with the whole relationship thing but found that this book covers all of that and even what treatments to expect years down the line.We're relieved we can now enjoy this 4th of July weekend with a new plan to step up our journey to get pregnant. We have heard of couples like us choosing IVF and eventually egg donors, surrogates, or even adoption when nothing else works and we are happy to see that this book covers those areas too.Our advice is BUY THIS BOOK. It was easy-to-read, conversational and took the fear away that we had about stepping up our treatment plans. It also helped us figure out how to go about financing some of the costs involved."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I was in the middle of typing my review when I happened to notice a previous review knocking this book. All I have to say is that the reviewer concerned about OPK accuracy is dead wrong.I've been a nurse practioner for 22 years and OPKs (ovulation predictor kits) give users a 24 to 36 hour window to help them pinpoint ovulation. Even if the kits tell you to use it every day this is just waste of money.I've heard a lot of complaints over the years but this one's A FIRST. The reviewer failed to address that using an OPK is just one of the MANY ways that these authors discuss to help readers pinpoint ovulation. And it goes without saying that OPKs aren't foolproof.This book is well researched, well written, and is being bought by a number of teaching institutions to help train medical staff. I know this because that's how I found out about it and was so impressed that I purchased a copy for my daughter. She has tried to get pregnant over the last five years and we both turned to this book looking for answers. I'm proud to say we read What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant cover to cover.I may not be the best speller but I know what's medically correct and my daughter is an English teacher so we're confident that the confused reviewer is wrong on all accounts -- this book contains NO medical inaccuracies and NO spelling errors.I know it takes all kinds but I'm always floored when people complain about information that they know nothing about."},{"Title":"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant: The Complete Guide to All the Technologies for Couples Facing Fertility Problems","review":"I usually don't buy self-help books but made an exception when my hair stylist recommended this one. My husband and I married just after college and at 26 we have yet to conceive.I'm just a few months shy of turning 27 and am even more concerned about when we'll make the transition into parenthood.After sharing this book with my husband we became motivated to finally seek answers to the question that has been bugging us (and everyone we know) for over 4 years: Why us?My husband and I feel a tremendous amount of pressure to have a baby since we are the youngest of large families and so far all our siblings have had girls. Everyone in our family is hoping and praying (and knowing my family probably even wagering a few bets) that we'll be the ones to carry on the family name.The authors of this book have taught us productive ways to deal with the stress that comes along with infertility, how to how to handle family get-togethers, how to decide up-front who to tell what and what to keep private (which is a big concern when you have a close knit family), and what types of treatments (and options) are available to help us have a baby.It even goes further by discussing common fertility issues couples face, provides easy-to-read illustrations and charts, and discusses what medications couples take when.I would never have known that infertility can strike at any age. Certainly, we had no idea that it could strike when you're in your 20's.After reading the initial two chapters we made an appointment with an RE (reproductive endocrinologist) only to learn that I have a moderate case of endometriosis and my husband has slow swimmers.Who would have guessed? Like I said before I'm not into self-help books and don't consider myself a book critic but this is one that is essential to anyone who can't get pregnant.We plan to use it as a guide and resource throughout our treatment.

I found Kay Redfield Jamison's books insightful, inspiring, as well as incredibly knowledgeable. I found this book annoying, and it relied too heavily on the double whammy of an explanation or point made by one of the medical authors with a lay person follow-up by Nancy, a patient with bipolar disorder whose experiences and anecdotes are leaned on heavily throughout the book. In trying to warm up what they perhaps feared might be an overly objective, medical reference book, which it is far, far from being anyway, the authors used Nancy as a device to humanize the condition.I got very tired of Nancy and her loopy examples. When not preening over the authors' attention as the pet subject of the book, she was just illogical and somewhat strident or annoying. She had a very definite \\"voice,\\" which to me was loud and probably possessing a strong New York accent. I feel for Nancy and her experiences with this disorder, but her examples had no resonance for me and detracted from any actual information.Go for Jamison definitely and browse through some other newer sources.

Written from three unique perspectives, it is certain to profoundly impact the lives of patients and their families. The authors provide the latest information about bipolar disorder and depression, including the most current treatment advances with medications and psychotherapy. Above all, they present experiences of patients who have survived this illness and live productive, heroic, and inspirational lives. The bottom line: Proper diagnosis and treatment can make all the difference.

A great deal of the information is focused on depression of which there is plenty of information out there. I saw no new information in this book and not too much on mania. There are only two alternative treatments listed and one of them is contraindicated for bipolars because antidepressants of any type can trigger mania. The book does mention this, but my point is there is not any new information in it and it seems suited to depression more than bipolar."},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Bipolar Disorder: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementar y Solutions, Including: ... of Depression & Manic-Depressive ...","review":"I've read about ten books on the subject, this was cursory in some important areas and didn't have the latest information on the newer medications."},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Bipolar Disorder: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementar y Solutions, Including: ... of Depression & Manic-Depressive ...","review":"My name is Susan Musikanth, I am a psychologist in private practice and a Human Resources Consultant.

Coming from three perspectives, the book sometimes speaks *to* the bipolar sufferer and sometimes speaks *for* the afflicted individual or family. While providing advice to the manic-depressive, to people in intimate relationships with manic-depressives (parents and spouses) and to friends, acquaintances and colleagues of manic-depressives, the book also makes appeals to the medical profession and other service providers, to the insurance industry and to the general public.Speaking to the individual suffering from bipolar disorder or related afflictions, three chapters on the biological and medical aspects serve as an up-to-the-moment primer for the lay person. A solid backgrounder, this section prepares the patient for a more informed and engaged relationship with his or her doctors and other medical providers.Likewise for the sufferer himself or herself, chapters on psychotherapy, self-help and support groups compile the best advice and guidance the field has offered over the past decade.While much of the information useful to the patient himself or herself is also useful to family and friends, chapters on living with afflicted people and on suicide prevention speak more directly to individuals in these positions.Finally, chapters on stigma and on bipolar disorder in children and adolescents address the larger community. Doctors and medical providers are asked to keep current with improving treatment options and regimes. Insurance providers are implored to grasp the essentially medical nature of these illnesses and handle coverage as other medical coverage is handled. And, finally, the authors entreat the general public to engage a sense of compassion and understanding to reduce the stigma associated with these and other emotional illnesses.Written in a remarkably fluid, readable style, New Hope For People With Bipolar Disorder deserves a place on many a bookshelf."},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Bipolar Disorder: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementar y Solutions, Including: ... of Depression & Manic-Depressive ...","review":"Bipolar disorder is often underdiagnosed and/or misdiagnosed as depression, particularly for people who have Bipolar II disorder (where severe depressive episodes are sandwiched between periods of mild or hypomania), who often feel sick and seek treatment only when they're depressed -- and thus are diagnosed as depressed or dysthymic. Without proper treatment of the bipolar disorder, things won't improve. This book really opened my eyes to what bipolar disorder is all about and why it is often hard to diagnose. On average, persons suffering from bipolar disorder see four psychiatrists and suffer for over ten years before they are diagnosed properly. This book is jam-packed with useful information -- facts on symptoms, common behaviors of sufferers, the different types of bipolar disorder, information on medication, and anecdotes from people suffering from bipolar and their families. It's also very clear and readable. I certainly wouldn't recommend self-diagnosis, but this book may help you help your psychiatrist make a proper diagnosis or help you understand a loved one."},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Bipolar Disorder: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementar y Solutions, Including: ... of Depression & Manic-Depressive ...","review":"I am 24 and have been bipolar my whole life.

I appreciated the scientific information, including images of the brain of a depressed person and a &quot;normal&quot; person. It's phenomenal to see that there is actually a physical difference.The knowledge in this book is truly hope for those who suffer from depression and from bipolar disorder.

Written in language that is fluid, easy to understand and well organized, this book offers the reader a format that combines three different perspectives; each shedding light on the topic from their unique experiences. Information is comprehensive and presented in a manner that is packed with facts and yet easy to follow. This book provides a thorough discussion of symptoms, treatment and a solid basic understanding of the biology of the disorder. It offers good guidelines regarding attention to suicide. What makes this book different than other books on this topic is attention to the human side of the illness. These are clearly evidencedby Nancy's personal account, discussions of stigma, an examination of the subjective experience of optimism and pessimism, and a chapter that explores the stress in the relationships of those with bipolar disorder. Finally, New Hope for Bipolar Disorder presents a solid and focused discussion of psychotherapies that can be useful in treatment with those with this disorder and helping their loved ones. It details a discussio of cognitive-behavioral therapy with depression, and identifies the various strengths of couples therapy, individual therapy (for those with the disorder and/or those living with them), family and multiple family therapy. One of my closest friends was diagnosed with this disorder several years ago. This book has helped me tremendously to better understand her, to be more empathic with her and to better understand and be sensitive to my own reactions in our friendship.

D. and Nancy Rosenfeld, Exemplar, legitimizes our question regardless of the answer.New Hope...is not a &quot;feel good&quot; pseudo panacea directed to sufferers, families and friends of sufferers of what is popularly known as Depression and Manic-Depressive illness. The authors assure their readers that he and she are not their illness. Public awareness, now, embraces most physical illness and disease as having causes that are not the &quot;fault&quot; of the patient. Emotional and mental dysfunctions have not yet been accorded similar understanding and respect. The absolute interconnections among physical, emotional and mental discomforts are valid and necessary lessons we must learn. New Hope...is a mighty blow against overwhelming, prevailing ignorance.A sufferer with Bipolar disorder is often told to &quot;get over it.&quot; or condemned as a moral coward. The authors demonstrate through science, compassion and experience that the diseases' combination of bio-chemical, genetic and environmental factors are real, not imginary.This is a book I've waited for, although it arrives too late for loved ones who could have been saved by having it available.The book can be read as a factual presentation into the most prevalent, misunderstood and ignored physical-emotional-mental illness in current society. It can be used as an up to the moment reference and source for personal, medical and psycho-social answers and assistance. Its most important value may be to assault and dispel fear and ignorance about emotional-mental illness. The seamless collaboration by a medical practitioner, a psychologist and a patient on equal terms is an example of the best kind of interactions for all of us."},{"Title":"New Hope for People with Bipolar Disorder: Your Friendly, Authoritative Guide to the Latest in Traditional and Complementar y Solutions, Including: ... of Depression & Manic-Depressive ...","review":"Unless you are a layperson and very new to bipolar disorder, this book is just a regurgitation of very old techniques.

Dr. Fieve's book Moodswing is particularly good, as is anything by Kay Jamison.If all you want is a feel-good, fast read, not particularly enlightening book, this might be for you.

The authors have contributed their understanding and extraordinary knowledge of manic-depressive illness to help those who suffer from this malady - to give them and their loved ones hope. There is also a cautionary note which details how the all too common failure to diagnose this disorder can disable and destroy lives. This is not done through the simple recitation of statistics, but rather by detailing personal accounts of those who have met the challenge and coped. If I read this book ten years ago, my life would be dramatically different today. So many persons would have been spared the pain my untreated illness brought them.

So they asked her if she wanted to take the GED. She took the GED and passed all aspects of it. I truly believe that this book that she used outside of the GED program that she was in had a great deal to do with passing the Math portion of the test. 410 is passing, and she was able to get a 460.

For anyone who has to learn math for the first time, this book is essential. It's a great resource.If you're a person who already knows some math basics, the main book is probably plenty of work to refresh them.

Spirituelle Intelligenz.","review":"Reading the New Golden Bough was one of the most significant experiences of my youth. That book showed the remarkable similarities in the cultural stories and myths across cultures. From reading these perspectives, one arrives at a more fundamental understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature, people and community, and people with themselves. Reading SQ Connecting with our Spiritual Intelligence left me with a similar feeling. I thought that the opening quotes for the chapters were especially well designed to draw one into the points the authors wanted to make. I got a new sense of how nothingness can provide meaning (such as the hole in the middle of the wheel that allows it to be connected to the source of power). As someone with a very modest knowledge of psychology, I enjoyed the sections that integrated psychological and religious thinking about the meaning of life. There is a part of the book where you can take personality tests and help focus on the questions that will allow you to make your spiritual journey. As someone who has been a meditator for some time, I was fascinated by the reports of research on how vibrations provide wholeness in the brain. Certainly, that's what it feels like when I am meditating. I especially like books that provide a new perspective on something that I have been thinking about a lot. I found the questions for spiritual progress to be quite interesting. They certainly caused me to shift my attention in new ways that will undoubtedly lead to new learning. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in more self-awareness, particularly aimed at getting in touch with one's real nature. If you work in a business, you might also enjoy Rewiring the Corporate Brain, also by Danah Zohar."},{"Title":"Fantasy Nudes: Digital Techniques in Photography","review":"I have no experience in nude photography, and my knowledge is limited to an evening's lecture given in 1974 by Peter Gowland. Mr. Gowland was a photographer for Playboy magazine, and lectured on glamour photography, one of the six topics covered in a photo seminar. I learned quite a lot, including that women with different body types can be made to look better or worse depending on the angle from which they are photographed. I'd just learned about special effects, three years before the first Star Wars movie.Jim Zuckerman's book is also concerned with special effects, namely those created with digital photography. About half of the book is graphics. Every page either contains a graphic image or faces a graphic image. This is a book to be looked at and admired as much as read.The text covers a number of topics, including setting up a digital operation, inputting photos, and working with them. He concludes with a chapter on marketing digital photos of nudes. The discussion isn't in depth. The book devotes more discussion to the photos and how the author made them.He uses Adobe Photoshop and MetaCreations Painter, and writes within that context. His explanations can be easily transferred to most other packages such as Corel Photo-Paint. However, this book shouldn't be used to learn those packages, again because the discussion is superficial. Use the book, instead, as a cookbook as you try to create similar effects.The visual aspect of this book is very impressive. There are, admittedly, a couple of these fantasy nudes that I wouldn't want to meet in a dream on a dark and stormy night. Women, I think, are a bit like sunsets. Each is different, and yet each can be beautiful in her, or its, own way. The author captures that beauty and accents it in various ways to produce striking images.Jim Zuckerman is a professional photographer and writes for those using the same advanced technology. He doesn't seem to be addressing today's amateur with a digital camera. I don't believe he used a digital camera to produce any of the photos in this book, written in 1998. Even so, an amateur who knows a little Adobe Photoshop or a similar package should be able to produce similar effects by following his discussions.This book is about digital effects. That is, there's no discussion of photographic technique. The photos are assumed to be already taken.Why should you buy this book? First, to admire Mr. Zuckerman's work, and much of it is very good. Second, you may get ideas that can be applied to your own photos. They don't even have to be nudes. You can apply these techniques to the clothed, to children, to sunsets, and to the family pet. I rate it as a three instead of a five, because it's not written for digital photographers like me."},{"Title":"Fantasy Nudes: Digital Techniques in Photography","review":"If your looking for ideas, fine. But, one can search the web or look through magazines or go to the library to get your creative juices flowing. Save your money and start thinking for yourself!"},{"Title":"Fantasy Nudes: Digital Techniques in Photography","review":"It is a book for you who want to see how you can use software such as Painter (formerly known as Fractal Painter) to transform photos into your fantasies. It is about techniques and creativity but it is not a show-off of fantastic illustrations. The illustrations are far removed from artist like Vargas, Vallejo, or any of the old pinup masters. So, if you look for something like that don't bother. It is not a book of mastery of photoshop either, it really is more of a book using computers to twist and deform images, transform and filter them.The main theme is nuditity, without that the book would have no interest at all to many. However if you skip the pictures and read the text you can find some valuable tips and tricks, but you need to be able to bear with that you don't like or aren't interested in.If you want nice pictures look elsewhere, if you are after pinup artistry look at the various pinup books about artists such as Vargas, if you want \\"modern art\\" psychadelic pictures you may want to look in this book..."},{"Title":"How to sell yourself to others","review":"I read this book in the 1960s and have read it many times since.

Each chapter takes the form of a letter written to a young man challenging him to consider some facet of his life as it has been, is now and could be, all in the light of Catholic and Christian virtues. The author does not attempt to preach doctrine or dogma, but takes some of the established beliefs and asks the reader to consider the application of these in one's life as a catalyst for growth, a growth inspired and energized by a vision of what a man's life in Christ should be and evolve into as he leaves behind the fog of childhood and begins the pilgrimage of responsible adulthood. The advice does not always provide definite answers, but honest questions for continuous reflection and perfection during the sometimes perilous but adventurous journey."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Beagle's least-esteemed novel does not deserve much of the critical spleen that has been vented in its direction. To be certain, the novel falls down in a variety of ways, and it is not nearly as coherent or simply apprehensible a book as his The Last Unicorn or A Fine and Private Place (not that either of those books is all that facile, either).Many reviewers savaged The Folk of the Air when it was first published, failing to see what is, or should be, obvious: the novel is a more interesting failure than most conventional successes. I have read many novels, both in and out of the fantasy genre, that cleave more closely to most people's expectations for &quot;a good read,&quot; but I almost never feel compelled to reread them. Folk of the Air, on the other hand, is a tattered vade mecum that I want to loan to everyone I know (but dread losing for fear of never being able to return to its more sublime and wrenching characters and scenes).What is the book about? I'll eschew banal summarization: Folk of the Air is about the joy and the danger of wearing masks and playing roles; about the vital part fantasy itself plays in all our lives; and about the melancholy that accompanies growing older, when the masks begin to crumble, the roles to seem shopworn, and the fantasy to pall.And yet, Beagle suggests, to cast aside the irrational pleasures of role-play and magic-making is as tragic as clinging too fervently to them. We rightly fear being trapped underneath our disguises, he implies, but need them all the same.The beauties of loss, of unrecoverable time, of regret, and of the noble, desperate denial of all of the above, permeate the novel. If you ever outgrew an imaginary friend, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure, or a madcap lover, Folk of the Air will resonate with the deep, painful places where you store your most cherished, vanished memories.Please don't imagine that the novel is lachrymose or gloomy; Joe Farrell is at once hangdog and breezy, and Beagle's inimitable wit leavens the proceedings nicely. Of special note are Farrell's reactions to several of his &quot;stupid&quot; jobs, which must be read to be believed.The supporting characters, from Ben Kassoy to Julie Tanikawa to poor, deadly Aiffe, are all well-drawn and compelling. And Beagle's language is as superb as ever: an exquisite tapestry of metaphor, precise diction, and wistful irony.The ending is a dreadful mess, but that didn't stop Neuromancer from being a smash, now did it? (If you feel that you understand it perfectly, please don't mail me your insights. I agree with the sentiment expressed in Beagle's short story &quot;Julie's Unicorn&quot;: perfect expression and understanding of an artistic subject can be a terrible prison. I can live with ambiguity.)Folk of the Air is sadly out of print as of this writing; make it your personal quest to track a copy down. Save your newfound treasure for a beautiful autumn weekend; it's worth waiting until that most lovely and longing of seasons to start your journey to the Avicenna of myth and memory with Farrell and company."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"This book is unmistakably written in Peter S. Beagle's style. It starts out with Joe Farrell returning to Avicenna, California, a town he has not seen in ten years. He has picked up a hitchhiker who tries to rob him. His method for escaping without surrendering his money or his life is the first hysterical thing about this book. All the characters in this book alternate from funny to serious (or, in the case of the second major character, Sia, from odd to odder). The things that are revealed in the book lead naturally to an ending that, as in The Last Unicorn, seems to solve nothing but is nevertheless a satisfactory ending. I'm hoping to find and read A Fine and Private Place soon, and anything else he has written.There are only two things wrong with this book: once you read it, you have read one more thing that Peter S. Beagle has written; and it's too short."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Folk of the Air is a fantasy that I grew to love after two readings. Like all Beagle's novels, this one creates a world that is at once fantastic and humdrum, incredible and believable in a mixture that only a master like Peter S. Beagle can concoct.The characters in this story have Beagle's trademark stamp of realism about them; you feel you know these people like your own family. How does Beagle do it? He manages to weave the petty details of day to day living into his stories in such a manner as to make his worlds come alive. The people seem too real for fiction, even though you know that the marvelous magic of this world is, sadly, all too missing from ours.Anyone who has met the Society for Creative Anachronism will instantly recognize the behavior they encounter in this story; against the backdrop of medieval jousting tournament reenactments we meet a goddess, a man who can channel a Viking, and a talented young witch who gets dangerously involved with an evil spirit.I can highly recommend this book and may some intelligent publisher pick it up and give it the distribution it deserves, that new generations of readers can discover Beagle's magic anew."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Here's what for me has always been the greatest paradox about academic life: in order to secure a position in the world for oneself that allows for the cultivation of a rich, colorful and sophisticated inner life, one's outer life has to be thoroughly routinized, riskless, and (at least in a certain sense, let's face it) pretty damn boring. Some professors who realize this belatedly do stupid things like sleeping with their students, making catastrophic investments of their savings or driving around in flashy sports cars. Others (more sensible and imaginative folks, in my book) join the SCA.Beagle's book about the SCA is a wonderful, sympathetic but unsentimental expose of the people around universities who've adopted this eccentric way of life. He's a magnificent stylist and his characters are as complex and fully realized as those of any fantasy writer I've read, even including China Mieville. THE FOLK OF THE AIR also contains the best-portrayed dog in all of western literature, IMHO. The ending is shallowly pyrotechnical and many of the novel's central issues unresolved, but it doesn't ruin the fun."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"I just finished this book, and rated it 10/10. I can't really describe it well, it works on so many different levels, and what it is ostensibly about is not what it is really about, mostly.....but luckily, other people have managed to give you a clue in their reviews. It does start out a little slow, but then it gains steam until it is a freight train that will knock you dead. If you are a grown-up that likes fantasy, then I most strongly recommend this book. :)"},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"This is by far my favorite Peter Beagle book (which is really saying something!)Folk of the Air begins with Joe Farrell's return to Avicenna, California and an attempted robbery. Farrell has gone back to the town of his youth to stay with his old friend Ben and his unlikely companion Sia. Farrell is content with the strange dynamics in Sia and Ben's relationship, with their skittish dog, even with the house's windows, which defy counting properly.The local League for Archaic Pleasures gives Farrell's on-again off-again lover Julie a place to dance and wear her beautiful period costumes, and Farrell a place to play his lute. The League also gives Ben a place to hide his \\"Egil\\" spells, the unpredictable swapping of his consciousness with that of a ninth century Viking. What starts to disturb Farrell is the obnoxious Aiffe, daughter of the League King who seems to have a little actual magic going on around her, and her disquieting friend Nicholas Bonner. When Farrell begins to piece together the odd occurrences surrounding Aiffe and Nicholas and can't get his friends to admit that something is wrong, he decides to solve the mysteries of the world around him no matter how much they resist being solved.I love handing this book to people who refuse to read fantasy novels, because it's set in a very real world where a little magic has leaked in. The characters are richly realized but utterly believable, from their refusal to admit to what they have witnessed because it isn't logical to their quiet acceptance of impossible things that mold their lives. A newsletter I subscribe to asks authors what book they wish they could read again for the first time; I would chose The Folk Of The Air."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Folk of the Air restored the joy of reading for me. This is a book full of delicious writing, with characters presented with loving warmth, and wonder-full scenes.For me, it is a beloved book."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Almost entirely a beautifully written book; a wonderful mystification of Berkeley/the West Coast. Nice, grim account of academic life: \\"I'll never have a good time like that again. Just tenure.\\" A moving account of various relationships; refreshingly, although most are romantic none are the mommy-daddy-marriage-baby-return-to-the-patriarchal-family. The rest of these reviews seem to say a lot about the plot, so I will simply add that although this book does not have flawless racial politics (and what book does, really) it is one of the few character-driven fantasy novels by white writers where a significant number of the characters are not white, and plausibly not white. Phrases and images without number from this book have passed into my mental lexicon: \\"the fastest nostalgia in the West\\", \\"Nay, of us two, who's to be the judge of steel?\\", the fried rabbit restaurant (\\"Bunny Buckets\\", \\"Hare Pieces\\", and \\"Thumper's Forest Flavoring\\"), and the only even faintly plausible-seeming magical duel I have ever read. (I leave out the more emotionally engaging stuff, of which there is plenty) I am flabbergasted that any reviewer--however nostalgic for The Last Unicorn--could fail to appreciate this book. Of course, a lot of people are essentially embarassed by fantasy novels, so perhaps reviewers who could accept a fable about a unicorn were too embarassed about reading an actual fantasy novel to be able to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Folk of the Air","review":"Beagle seems to me to be a wise-guy author in the same way that racehorses sometimes are wise-guy horses. Those who know, or think they know, insist that every race is gonna be a winner. Or that the author is really the greatest unsung genius in the history of specfic.The horses don't always win, and I could continue the analogy, but it's probably clear.Folk of the Air is a competent urban fantasy. (Probably more like a 3 1/2 than a 3, really.) To me, its best feature was the well-characterized portrayal of an SCA-like organization. Sentence-level writing is smooth with a &quot;transparent&quot; style. There's little in the characterization, plot or concepts that I can point to and say &quot;this is flawed&quot;. (Except for the idea that a sword could *cut* armor. I don't think so, but then, I'm not in the SCA.)But the book didn't seem to have much emotional impact. I kept waiting for the big thing to happen, the moment of drama, the resolution of the &quot;SCA&quot; theme, and though battles and duels of wizardry do take place... it comes off a little flat to me, a little indecisive, as if the author doesn't really, on some level, believe in his own material."},{"Title":"Cold steel,","review":"This historical novel was first published in 1899, then in 1929 it was revised, about 100 pages being cut out. It has an extremely complicated plot in which two sisters attract the attention of Henry VIII and Francis of France, leading to a great deal of fighting and running around. Although the novel has many real personages from history, such as Henry, Francis, Katherine, Wolsey, Anne Boleyn, Charles Brandon, etc., the events of the novel certainly never took place. The whole thing is served up in Shiel's typical unique style, filled with little tricks of alliteration and assonance. The dialogue is written entirely in Tudor English."},{"Title":"Ride the Sandy River: A Trip Into the Past on What Was America's Largest Two-foot Gauge Railroad","review":"A large format hardback: cloth over boards with a sewn binding. 248 pp. 3.25 pounds.B&w; illustrations on every page.

Case dropped his book on my desk at Data Recognition Corporation and I cheerfuly paid the entry fee into the Moonie World. I have known Mr. Case personally for several years, and was curious as to what I might find in his writings. I can tell you from personal observation that the book did not dissapoint; The Thomas Case I know and the Thomas Case of the book are clearly the same character!Having said that, knowing that in my case my curiosity was piqued by the fact that I knew him, I did not then know what to expect from the book. What I found was a window into Moonie-Land, both the good and the bad. And there was good that brought Case into the fold. The spirit of comraderie, the idealism, the desire to change the world was a strong incentive of the cult. Unfortunately, the over riding desire to build the &quot;material foundation&quot; which included a rather lavish lifestyle for the leaders at the expense of bleary eyed, exhausted kids selling flowers in a Michigan winter played a stark and disturbing counterpoint to the idealism and bliss. Thomas Case saw this, and yet he also felt the strong &quot;family&quot; bond with other individuals at the grass roots level. The exploitition of the slave labor by the ruling class caused Case to wish to leave while the &quot;family&quot; and comraderie caused him to want to stay or come back. This was his dilemna for many years. He has woven the narrative very skillfully, and from the points of view of both himself as individual and as representative of his generation...as he said in his writings, &quot;I lived in the Haight before it was the Haight.&quot;Thomas Case experienced every echelon of the Moonies, from the lowest levels all the way up to their attempts to recruit or groom him for the upper echelons. He tells the story skillfully and sustains the reader's interest throughout the entire narrative. The only critique would be, while dwelling upon and giving good account of the Moonie experience, the remainder of the volume is rather slim. He wishes to round out his spiritual journey and it's ultimate destination...Catholicism...but does not provide the same level of detail as he does for his Moonie encounters. However this does not in any way distract from his compelling narrative regarding the Moonies.For a window into Moonie-Land and, in a way, into a bygone era, &quot;Moonie Buddhist Catholic.&quot;"},{"Title":"SESAME STREET WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY HIDE & SEEK IN THIS BOOK WITH LOVABLE FURRY OLD GROVER?","review":"I never write reviews, but I HAD to for this book.

Its wide, striped leaves obscure the rim of its painted pottery planter. Bees and butterflies alight on its red floral globes.)Well, that's how it was for mine. Morgan's first two Sisterhood anthologies introduced me to Feminism and shaped the way I understand economics, relationships, spirituality -- (pretty much everything!) But I read them years ago when I was in college. Although I proudly identify myself as a Feminist, I haven't felt very politically active in the past decade. SISTERHOOD IS FOREVER reminded me of the many shapes political action can take. It introduced women who are making a positive difference in women's lives -- and in the whole wide world -- in a breathtaking diversity of ways. Writers, musicians, doctors, mothers, representatives in Congress, organizers and others tell how they work, what they do, how much they have accomplished, and what they hope to achieve.SISTERHOOD IS FOREVER really does represent a wide varity of points of view.

In the new introduction he wrote for this edition of his 1944 book, Simpson states, \\"My main aim was to explore and in a way to exploit the fact that paleontology is the only four-dimensional biological science: time, 'tempo,' is inherent in it. Thus the aim of this book, which I think it accomplished, was to bring this dimension squarely, methodologically, into the study of evolutionary theory.\\" (Interestingly, he also criticizes as a \\"straw man\\" Stephen Jay Gould's interpretation of what \\"gradualism\\" in evolution means.)Simpson argues that \\"Segregation or selection of intragroup variability can give rise to new groups at a potentiallly rapid evolutionary rate.... this process is important and typical in speciation and in lower levels of differentiation.\\" He adds that \\"Theoretically saltation might result from a single large mutation ... or from the sudden segregation or recombination of pre-existing genetic characters.\\"Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge (architects of \\"punctuated equilibrium\\") were attracted to this aspect of Simpson's book: \\"Size of population is one of the dominant factors in determining tempo and mode in evolution,\\" and \\"Thus the most rapid possible evolution must occur in populations of minimum size. Such evolution will usually lead to extinction, but in a large number of trials it will not always do so.\\"Such creative ideas are needed because \\"This regular absence of transitional forms is not confined to mammals, but is an almost universal phenomenon, as has long been noted by paleontologists.\\" Simpson rejects, however, Goldschmidt's \\"hopeful monster\\" mechanism (proposed in hisThe Material Basis of Evolution: Reissued (Silliman Milestones in Science)) on the grounds that \\"he quite fails to adduce factual evidence that his postulated mechanism has ever produced or ever really could produce such an effect.\\"He proposes \\"quantum evolution\\" (defined as \\"the relatively rapid shift of a biotic population in disequilibrium to an equilibrium distinctly unlike an ancestral condition\\") as a solution, and notes that \\"The hypothesis that there were unusually high rates of mutation at certain times in the past ... is attractive to the point of seduction.\\"Interestingly, Simpson says in a footnote, \\"As a matter of personal philosophy, I do not here mean to endorse an entirely mechanistic or materialistic view of the life processes. I suspect there is a great deal in the universe that will never be explained in such terms and much that may be inexplicable on a purely physical plane.\\"This is a very significant work of interest to anyone with an interest in evolutionary theory."},{"Title":"B Is For Bluegrass: A Kentucky Alphabet (Discover America State By State.

I congratulated myself that I let a meadow emerge in my back yard when I moved in. I never gave much thought to exactly what was growing in it. I've always believed that it is just plain wrong to collect plants from the wild...but are there times when it is not only justified but perhaps actually beneficial? If so, when?In any case, the book definitely stretched my perceptions and gave me a whole lot to think about in terms of my own typical, &quot;newly developed&quot; suburban lot.

What little information I derived from this book was contradictary, such as the requirements of 'believing in one God' and 'not discussing politics', yet athiests were admitted and both right-wing and left-wing groups with strong political views controlled the lodges.

I also found a number of the author's &quot;facts&quot; to be either incorrect or misleading which makes me suspect the accuracy of the book as a whole."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"The main problem I noticed when I read this book is that it is poorly footnoted when Mr. Ridley attempts to dispel the \\"myths\\" and \\"conspiricies\\" of the critics of Freemasonry. He defends the Freemasons and dispels myth after myth without providing a shred of proof that the myth is a myth and that the Masons are abused. He provides plenty of footnotes in favor of Freemasonry and the claims they make; but nothing when he dispels \\"rumors\\" and \\"heresay\\". There are better books. In an attempt to write a balanced history, Mr. Ridley became a staunch supporter of Freemasonry...perhaps in fear of retaliation? Who knows. But the book, though a good read, is filled with pro-Masonic heresay passing as fact."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"I'm sure this is an excellent history but its strength is its weakness. It is sooo.... detailed, covers every possible epoch and is pretty confusing. Definitely only for a scholar."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"This book is a well written dissertation involving the quite extensive history of Freemasonry. Reading it, though very hard to follow at times, is like sitting down beside a fire and asking a grandfather about his past experiences. The information tends to drag its feet and many times appears to get stuck with no forward momentum; at still other times you will scratch your head and wonder what you just read. If your intent is to develop a further appreciation of the history of Freemasonry then this book receives many stars. If, however, your intent is to grab a good book on a night you cannot fall asleep you should heed this warning - DO NOT READ LYING DOWN! I did on numerous occasions and awoke the next morning having lost my place and wondering what exactly I had read the night before. The author does a very good job of highlighting, throughout the book, famous names that were involved in Freemasonry. He also highlights much of the foundation of Freemasonry and its journey through the evolution of the world as we know it today. The last three chapters make the entire book worth the reading time when the author sums up Freemasonry in England, the USA, and how Masonry is defined as a menace to society. Ridley also does a wonderful job of stifling many popular arguments waged by such authors as Knight, Ankerberg, Robertson, and many more. The author has apparently done his homework."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"I enjoyed the review written by Barnes and Noble junkie. He was bored by this book and gave it only 2 stars.I was pretty interested in the book. It held my attention more than it did his. But before I finished the book, I noticed that a public television station was doing a special on the freemasons, I turned it on, and it was more interesting than this book. It made the freemasons seem more exciting than Ridley does, more influential in world history, more on the side of the common man against the oppressor.What it comes down to is that if your emphasis is on saying that the freemasons are a silly coffee klatch wearing ridiculous robes and doing things that should embarrass them and make them feel childish, it doesn't make for that interesting a story. The freemasons in this book are often social climbers trying to flatter the royalty of England, and forbidding any political discussion.But if you focus on the historically significant things that freemasons did, and you highlight the triumphs for humanity and tolerance, you can come up with a more dramatic and meaningful book to read. Perhaps the silly useless social climbing twits who became freemasons really aren't worth mentioning. I think if I had consulted with this author during his writing of the book, I'd have advised him to leave out the boring freemasons completely and just focus on the ones who actually did something inspiring, something worth writing about."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"great survey of Masonic history - recommended for members and non-members, alike"},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society is a misleading subheading for Jasper Ridley's The Freemasons as the book presents them as not particularly powerful (although often with powerful members) and not particularly secret. The book covers the Freemason from their beginning to the present going over every accusation ever hurled at them and dispeling it. It is healthy and correct to remove much of the silliness that has surrounded freemasonry but, unfortunately, if you take away their grand conspiracies they become a lot of middle-aged men in robes meeting for secret handshakes and a couple of drinks, which seems even a little sillier. The reader is never given a clear reason why anyone would join or even what the actual purpose of the Freemasons are, other than they are not trying to take over the world. The book leaves many questions.

But even a casual perusal before I dug in at page 1 to read gave me the impression that this was not going to be a well researched or factual book. Some of the topics covered I know a good deal about, and I found myself repeatedly saying, &#34;That's not exactly right.&#34; Which makes me think that those topics about which I know next to nothing (or less) are addressed with the same lack of clarity and veracity.On top of that, there seems a mildly sarcastic tone--a subjective claim on my part, certainly--that permeates the writing.The writing, indeed. Of all my criticisms, it is foremost the writing that had me rolling my eyes page after page. The structure of much of this not-short book is fundamentally this: a gloss of an historical event or period and the part played by an individual, concluded by the sentence, &#34;He was a Freemason.&#34; Truly, page after page, this trite cycle plays out. After a couple chapters of that, I felt giddy and nauseous every time I pocketed a passage. Of course, sometimes he did mix it up a bit, with the occasional, &#34;He was not a Freemason.

Its the first and only book I've read on the subject and my expectations were high. I was somewhat dissappointed, however, when Mr. Ridley got off topic for pages and pages. It seemed, at times, that I would never learn anything new about the Masons. There is good information in the book, its just very, very hard to find it.Ridley may be better off sticking to broader topics where his digressions will be more appreciated."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"Written by an Englishman who is a veteran historian and biographer, this is a serious and sympathetic history of the much-maligned secret society (like the KKK, which had its place in history of America). The Masons are international.Brought here by the British before the American Revolution after it was formed in England in 1717, and called the Grand Lodge -- first in Philadelphia and later in Boston. By the 20th century, the Masons were firmly established in America. At one time, more than half of the members of this esteemed group in the world were in the United States of America. The first American members were of two types: the philosophical intellectuals and gentlemen who came as a social club, similar to the British men's clubs.They deny they are a religion, but strictly non-sectarian. It is a male secret society which promotes and practices equality, solidarity and brotherhood. Their God is called the 'Great Architect of the Universe.' They ban political arguments in the lodges and enforced racial segregation.Black lodges were formed and named after the first black member, Prince Hall. Some prominent members of this group included Booker T. Washington, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sugar Ray Robinson, Ty Cobb, Paul Whiteman, and Nat King Cole.The Pop Music world was represented by Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan and John Phillip Sousa. Cowboys included Kit Carson, Roy Rogers, and Buffalo Bill Cody. In the film industry, Cecil B. DeMille led the movie group, with L. B. Meyer, David Griffith (who directed the 1915 movie. 'Birth of a Nation\\" which glorified the KKK), Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Audie Murphy, John Wayne, and Clark Gable.John Paul Jones led the naval group (died in 1792 at age of 45) and Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Early members were Ben Franklin, George Washington, Nathan Hale, Benedict Arnold, Paul Revere, John Hancock, James Madison, and James MOnroe.The illustrous Edmund Burke, Winston Churchill, Frederick the Great, La Fayette, the six Ringling Brothers who brought us 'The Greatest Show on Earth', Dr. Karl A. Menninger, George M. Pullman, and David Sarnoff.Notable Americans include John Jacob Astor, J. C. Penney, Henry Ford, Melvin Jones (who formed the Lions Clubs), Charles Lindbergh, Dr. Charles H. Mayo, Norman Vincent Peale, J. Edgar Hoover, General Douglas MacArthur (my hero), John Glenn, William Jennings Bryan, and La Guardia, mayor of New York for 12 years.Some Presidents of the United States who were Masons include Theodore & Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman, McKinley, and Gerald Ford. Earl Warren and John Marshall were also Masons, as was Mozart.The cover has the Tower of Babel which was reportedly built by the Freemasons. Mr. Ridley has written (in additon to many biographies of important people) SECRET SOCIETIES, FRIENDS APART, and A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TUDOR AGE. This books is well researched and most informative. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"clearly did his research and very well written. I loved it and anyone should give it a read. 2 words."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"Whether the Freemasons are really powerful or not -- author Jasper Ridley does not really demonstrate much power -- they can glory in the finest lineup of foes of any society, secret or free, anywhere.All the most evil men of the past 300 years have condemned the Masons -- the popes, the Nazis, the Communists, the Facists, the Phalangists, assorted emperors and tyrants.Not bad for a social group devoted merely to tolerance, conviviality, a vague deism, social equality (more or less) and friendship.But if ideas have power, Jasper Ridley shows -- with a wicked tongue -- just how frightened the bad guys have been by the idea that men, some of them prominent, were gathering together privately to praise liberty, equality and fraternity, even if wrapped up in childish mumbojumbo.Ridley, a graceful writer, goes back to the origins in a labor union of carvers of stone who went to work on medieval cathedrals and bridges after the rough masons had put up the structure. For obscure reasons -- perhaps because the freemasons had to travel around to their work -- this union was susceptible to ideas of tolerance and leveling once these got a certain traction in reaction to the murderous intolerance of the 17th century religious fights. He describes the early Freemasons as \\"intellecutal gentlemen who favored religious toleration and friendship between men of different religions and thought that a simple belief in God should replace controversial theological doctrines.\\"Most lodges banned discussion of religion or politics. They went so far as to admit women, colored people and Jews, at times reluctantly.That the Freemasons were, and are, regarded as subversive of oppressive regimes will seem odd to Americans, who know them mostly as Shriners, an excuse for grown men to fool around like 9-year-olds under the coloration of raising money for sick children. It's a measure of their diabolical cleverness that they go to such lengths and effort just to mess around.Ridley, an Englishman, pays little attention to the Americans, though they make up about half the world's Freemasons. He is more concerned to debunk the notion that Masons were a self-serving circle out to subvert government.At length, he shows that in ordinary political wars and disputes, Masons were on both sides; the stories about Masons letting captives free on seeing a secret sign are fantasies.There have never been any Masonic armies, Masonic manifestoes or Masonic political parties (though there was an Anti-Masonic Party in the United States, where most of the men who led the nascent Republican Party cut their political teeth).So it is hard to imagine what power Ridley imagines Masons wield. It seems that their influence was indirect, a place for men of like thoughts to learn of each other's existence and network. In Latin countries, the Lautaro Lodge did spawn revolutionaries, but more as a midwife than as a revolutionary movement itself. There have never been any Masonic Black Shirts.In the 20th century, Ridley writes, antimasonic writings reached new levels of insanity. All -- or at least very many -- of the forces of antimodernity recognized Freemasonry for what it is: a stalking horse for modernism.Tomas Masaryk, the father of Czech modernism and independence, put it in a nutshell: \\"Freemasonry is the guilty conscience of the Catholic Church.\\" And not only of that body; all rightwingers have hated masonry, though antimasonic feeling has never figured too prominently among Muslims. (There are Muslim Masons; they hold a Koran during their ceremonies, while Jewish Masons use the Talmud.)After all this sturm and drang, \\"The Freemasons\\" ends almost on a note of comedy, where Ridley lists some of the accomplishments of men who were Freemasons. (Though Ridley is sophisicated about European and Latin American history, he is pretty shaky about American popular culture, labeling Lowell Thomas as Thomas Lowell among several other flubs).Did you know, for example, the Hubert Eaton, the man who introduced flat grave markers so lawnmowers could roll unimpeded over the corpses, was a Mason?"},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"This book is a thorough chronicle of Freemasonry's ups and downs in most countries it's been established in since the founding of England's Grand Lodge. It's rather dull reading if you're more interested in the origin and practices of Freemasonry than a blow-by-blow of which famous or infamous Masons were revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries, liberals, conservatives, warriors, philosophers, disgraces, royals, or commoners. However, one can often learn more about an organization by who wants it abolished rather than who approves of it. Ridley documents all the dictators, clerics, and monarchs who felt threatened by Freemasons. The author does point out how ridiculous, albeit profitable, some of the recent anti-Masonic zealots charges are in various mediums. Read all you can on the subject and draw your own conclusions. Join a lodge if you want to know the \\"secrets\\", but most, if not all, of them (I'm aware of) can be found on the internet with diligent research. The real mystery of Freemasonry, even for Masons, is its origin and the meaning of its ritual, and there's certainly plenty of disagreement among Masons and non-Masons about that since very little documentation of its evolution and existence survived prior to the 1700s."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"Jasper Ridley's Freemasons is probably the most objective and fairly written historical account of the history of Freemasonry.The book starts with the likely origins of the Freemasons and their original lodges and traces the organization all the way to present-day Freemasonry. It looks at the roll of the Freemasons in early modern Europe, their relationship with monarchies, their roll in revolutionary South America, their roll in the United States, and their roll today. For a book on the world's poster child secret society, Jasper Ridley's approach is very fair. He presents Freemason's assertions of historical events as well as the anti-Masons assertions (including the Protocols of the Elders of Zion) but always delivers what is historically accurate.He touches on the notable people who have really developed Freemasonry and cites many Masonic historians. He also talks of world leaders and powerful people who were Freemasons and points out that, often times, Masons were on each side of political battles. From George III, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Fredrick the Great, Ridley includes examples of noteworthy players in Western societies' history. Chapters are divided into specific stories within specific countries during a respective time period.If you are interested in conspiracy theories about Freemasons, I would not recommend this book. If you are looking for a glorified account of the roll of Freemasons throughout history, I would not recommend this book either. If you are looking for a historical account of Freemasonry and readily proclaim yourself as a history buff, then I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"I recently read this book and found it extremely interesting. It provides a look at the history of Freemasonry around the world. It is well written and doesn't get so in depth that it's hard to understand, as some histories of Freemasonry are prone to do.My only complaint with the book is that, at times, it was hard to decide if Ridley was referring to \\"Operative\\" or \\"Speculative\\" Masonry. Still though, recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"..that is where I finally put myself out of my misery...I'm not sure why I bought this book and now I wish that I hadn't.. During the course of reading this book I took two breaks: one to read Dungeon, Fire and Sword - the Knights Templar in the crusades, and one to read The Pefect Heresy. After finishing the latter book last night, I returned to the Freemasons, but alas I just can't take it anymore..The closest that I can come to describing the book is to compare it to reading a watered-down history book. Picture your old high school history book, and then imagine it with parentheses after each historical figure. After some names the word (freemason) would be inserted, after others (not a freemason) would be added, and a few would be followed by (maybe a freemason). Ridley might have been better off just writing an index of historical figures and sorting them out by these three catagories.I'm not sure if the book is boring because compared to the Knights Templar and the Cathars, the Freemason history just isn't very exciting, or if it is Ridley's style that inspires boredom, but whatever the reason, my mind just kept wandering as I read it.I gave the book 2 stars because it is not a total disaster. There are some interesting parts, for instance the part about the Boston Tea Party, but unless you really care that 9 of the 55 men who signed the Declaration of Independence and 13 of 39 who approved the Constitution were Freemasons, you would do well to browse this book in a book store before buying...Gotta run, I'm now reading The Fourth Crusade by Jonathon Phillips..

So, I will just have to say that this book is a very objective look at both the Freemasons and their critics. Where the Freemasons have made a claim that is not supported by fact or is just plain wrong, the author points out the mistake. On the other hand, he also points out the weakness of most Anti-Masonic arguments, calling some of them ridicules. When the Anti's have a fair point though, it is clearly acknowledged.Jasper Ridley traces Freemasonry from where he thinks it began, to the present day and also looks at Masonry in most countries of the world. He points out that Masonic Lodges in some countries have been the centers for radical revolutionary movements. Masons often deny this but Masonic opposition to reactionary and oppressive monarchs, dictators, and popes has helped inspire many revolutionary leaders from Simon Bolivar to Giuseppe Garibaldi to George Washington. This is for the most part the reason that the Catholic Church has historically been opposed to Freemasonry. However, Ridley correctly points out that while many revolutionary leaders were Freemasons so to were many Royals. For example, Washington fought to free the American colonies from George III whose brother was the Grand Master of English Masons. In fact, as Ridley points out, during conflicts Freemasons were often the leaders of both sides. It was indeed the Freemason Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna who ordered the slaughter of the defenders of the Alamo, Freemasons included. The head of the Texas army, Sam Houston was also a Mason. Jasper's argument here is that the Masonic oaths mean little at such times.To make a long story short, Ridley gives praise where it is due and does the same with criticism. The Masons come in for harsh treatment over the Morgan affair in New York, as do the Anti-Masons with their contention that Masons had something to do with the Jack the Ripper murders. If you are a Freemason or if you are Anti-Masonic some of your sacred cows will likely be gored by this book. If you are neither of the above you will still enjoy this well written book as it touches on most major events in modern western history.The only fault I can find is that some of Ridley's history is in error. For example, John Quincy Adams was not the Whig Presidential nominee in 1824. Nor were W.H. Crawford and Henry Clay Independent candidates. Andrew Jackson was also not the Democratic nominee. There was no Whig party in 1824 and all four candidates were Democrats since that was basically the only party in existence. Its picky I know, but if he gets some of these historical facts wrong; what else might he be wrong about?"},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"This book is a combination of the history of the Freemasons and the debunking of myths. The Freemasons organization has been accused of many things throughout the world, such as assassinations and revolutions, but Ridley scrutinizes these accusations and explains that most of this is coincidental or that the myth-writer has a different agenda.The history of the Freemasons covers the beginnings in the British Isles and the creation of lodges in Europe, Asia, and South and North America. He explains how the membership of the lodges has changed through time as well as how the lodge has changed its organization. He does not seek to expose any secrets, but points out that the organization is similar to many others, but prefers to keep it rituals and initiations to itself.This secrecy, according to Ridley, is the main reason why there are so many conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons. An example of the theories is that Jack the Ripper was a Freemason, and another is that the Freemasons started the American Revolution. He points out that although some of the American founding fathers were Freemasons, many of them were not. He also points out that less democratic governments tend to fear the lodge and will present any manner of propaganda to suppress it.This is a good book to read to learn a bit more about the organization. Also, if you are a conspiracy theorist, I would recommend reading this for balance."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"Freemasonry is an incredibly broad topic, and I'm impressed by Ridley's ability to tackle it with such skill. This book is very much a recounting of the last 400 years of European and American history, exploring the influences and inclusions of Freemasonry through the most influential persons and events of the time.Ridley does tend to jump around quite a bit, and in places it's difficult to tell if you're still reading about the same country and century as you were in the previous paragraph. And in several cases he seems to be slightly confused regarding Masonic symbolism. For example, he refers at least twice to the &quot;name of the Masonic god&quot; revealed in the Royal Arch degree. Perhaps things are different on his side of the Atlantic, but over here in the American Royal Arch, we don't specify anything or anyone as a &quot;Masonic god&quot;.Aside from these tiny quibbles, the book is great. I would recommend it as a valuable addition to any Masonic library. While it perhaps doesn't make a great introduction to Masonry, it will serve well as a reference and detailed Masonic history. Thank you, Mr. Ridley, for your great work."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"Ridley takes a critical look at Freemasonry and its place and members in history. To date this has been the best, most honest, and accurate look at Freemasonry throughout history up to the year 2000.Instead of looking at just the internal history of Freemasonry, Ridley writes about its influence (and it's members) on the world and how the world has influence it throughout history. The books places the craft in a historical context in the fact that the book explains what historical events were occurring and how it effect Freemasonry. Such as the American and French Revolutions.Meanwhile, Ridley sheds light on the Masons and sweeps away the lies and half truths of others that have come before him and takes an honest look at the craft.Ridley makes a solid case that in his work that instead of being some secret world wide conspiracy to control events or the world, Masons are often divided on the great issues of the day. However, English and American Masons forbid any political discussion within their lodges. Ridley points out that in every war, Masons supported and fought for their respective countries, which pitted Masons of different sides against each other. Ridley also documents how Freemasons were often the target of oppression and witch hunts started by dictators who have banned the craft and the formation of lodges.The Freemasons is a great book for it's historical look at the craft and the history surrounding it both inside and outside. It takes a look at who were some of history's most famous Masons. While at the same time, not all Masons were angels.. but in the end showing that Freemasonry has always stood for the ideals of morality and freedom."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"With the many books of like title, I expected us to take another bashing, Yes, I am a Freemason. Yet, I have to let you know that I have found this latest book's author quite different and supprizingly unbiased and very informitive, The author Jasper Ridley has written such works as The Roundheads, The Statesman and Fanatic, and biographies of persons of such note as John Knox, Mary Tudor, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Tito and Mussolini..Mr. Ridley not being a Freemason spent some 63 days in The Masonic Library in Freemasons Hall in London in an attempt, as he puts it of \\"writing an objective book on the subject,\\" I believe he has accomplished the task, it is a meticulous, sane and lucid.He shifts the truth from the myth and takes us from the Tower of Babelto Freemasonry in America today and answers the question for the world. \\"Are Freemasons a Menice ?\\", It is also a Who,s Who of artist, businessmen, politicians and thinkers in countries all over the world who belong to our great fraternityHe gives the contributions of the Craft to the World, refutes many of the alligations made against us and tells of our shortcomings: such as clannishness, misogyny, obsession withsecrecy and devotion to arcane ritual.This book truly provides balance from all the wild claims that come out from time to time and all the Anti-Masonic literature that is on the market.If you have bought a book on Masonry in the last 15 Years then you need this one to bring it into focus, and for our detractors, a great gift !. Thanks for writing it. Mr. Ridley"},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"At a little under 300 pages, this book is not short but it's not long either. It moves quickly and is not too verbous. I found it to be well researched and balanced and enjoyed the anecdotal stories included. Especialy the one about d'Eon, the Frenchman who created such a stir that people actually bet on his gender.If you want a book debunking Masons or one that defends them, don't by this book. If, however, you just want a good read on one of the worlds oldest secret societies, you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"This is the first book on the subject I have read and to my what this book doesn't do is go into the rituals and dealings of the Freemasons. It literally is, as it claims, a history.The book seems to concern itself more with taking focal points in history and determining how many freemasons were involved. It came across, therefore, as a general history of the world at the points at which freemasons pop up in, rather than history of freemasonry.At a purely technical level it comes across as fragmented and this is further echoed in the fact that the book is not singly thematic. It is both chronological, geographical, sociological, and political in its chapters and the reader suffers from lack of consistency. A good example is on page 54 of the hardcover version. It moves abruptly from talking about Maria Theresia to a John Coustos without pausing breath. I had to check several times there weren't missing pages for I could see no link, no chapter end, nothing. This occurs throughout the book and prevents it from having true fluidity. Indeed the history comes across as anecdotal at times (humorously so in the case of Chevalier d'Eon).Simply put, the book is far too disjointed. Half way through it becomes (on almost a paragraph by paragraph basis) a collection of historical anecdotes, each culminating with who was a freemason and who wasn't.There was no theory or conjecture as to how much the concepts, doctrines and beliefs of freemasonry dictated those peoples actions and thereby potentially altered history.What you end up with is purely a chronology of who was and wasn't a freemason at various historical points.Maybe Ridley was intimating that freemasonry today has arrived at its present perception through a combination of chance and circumstance dictated by others through history. What the book does state quite clearly is that people in power dislike secret societies for fear of fomenting sedition.So, only 3 stars because if you want to know who was a freemason and who wasn't at major points in history, then this book is for you. What this book doesn't do is show how freemasonry may have influenced the actions of those historical figures."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"I have been searching for an introduction to freemasonry for some time. Unfortunately, most of the literature I found was written by enthusiasts - how wonderful freemasonry is, how important its accomplishements, etc. A few other authors wanted to show how dangerous it is.This author provides a many sided picture of a complex group or process that has evolved over centuries. I agree with the blurb from The Economist, shown on the cover of this book: \\" a meticulous, sane, and lucid book.\\"As a general reader I rate this book four stars for the valuable service it provides, and for its readibility.

Many of them depict the Masons as bad, dangerous or just plain nutty. Ridley's study effectively stands alone, being objective and unbiased---the more so, because he admits he's not a mason himself, and demonstrates why he's not convinced by the questionable scholarship of some contemporary books that depict them as evil and corrupt.Anyone interested in a balanced overview of the masonic movement ought to read this book."},{"Title":"The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society","review":"I am not a Mason, but am interested in the organization and in possibly becoming one. This is my first history book on the Masons...I was looking for a book that didn't give secrets (I don't want to spoil anything), but an objective history. This book is very good for that purpose. However, it is really dry...I personally prefer history books that are written with more of an engaging drama style and this book is not that.The author (a non-Mason) takes no sides and just spits out the facts. Because of that it makes the history seem dull, but at the same time it is very informative. He went to great length to name the Freemasons of the times, which I am less interested in than the actual accomplishments of the organization.The overall point of the book is that while in the past and in other countries the Freemasons have had some political (and revolutionary) influence, the bulk of the Freemason organization, especially today, is not a society with particular influence or power. And that Freemasons don't play favorites to other Freemasons, as was pointed out through many, many examples throughout history. It is just a society of tolerant men who come together for sociable and charitable purposes, with a particular focus on their rituals which try to make them better men.If you are a pro-Masonry or anti-Masonry person, you will probably not like this book since it takes neither side. However, if you are just looking for an objective history of the Craft then this may be the book for you."},{"Title":"Clashes of Cavalry","review":"It is strange for this book to compare the career of Jeb Stuart, Lee's chief-of-cavalry until 1864, with George Custer. Phil Sheridan was Grant's cavalry chief and Custer's commander. Therefore, comparing Stuart to Sheridan is more correct. It then follows that, although Sheridan did favor Custer among his lieutenants, it is monstrously wrong to state 1 man (Custer), and not his commander (Sheridan), drove the Confederates out of the Shenandoah Valley and stopped Lee at Appommatox. (In fact, it is almost legend how Sheridan, by personally leading a counter-charge at the last Valley battle at Cedar Creek, was himself most responsible for ending the Valley campaign.) It is incredible that the book reviews above repeat such inaccuracies. There are much better books of both generals."},{"Title":"Clashes of Cavalry","review":"While there are better books detailing the records of both Custer and Stuart, none makes the comparisons that this book does. In isolation, each man appears to be head and shoulders above their piers, but comparing both in the same book, gives one a true comparison of their accomplishments and failures. Robert Allen: AuthorA \\"Guest\\" of the Confederacy The Civil War Letters and Diaries of Alonzo M. Keeler, Captain, Company B, Twenty-second Michigan Infantry"},{"Title":"Clashes of Cavalry","review":"How could anyone call this book anything but brilliant? Wow! What a tremendous read! The author has masterfully intertwined the lives of these two famous cavalrymen to offer the reader a swashbuckling, breathtaking ride through the Civil War. Fascinating episodes in Custer's early career - that are not found in Gregory Urwin's book - shed new light on how he came to be a general at age 23, and the portrayal of his battles are spine-chilling reading. Stuart also enjoys the benefits of the author's in-depth research, with speculation and opinion that fill in blanks found in the unsatisfying Emory Thomas biography. The final chapter compares the two cavalrymen in a most unqiue and creative manner. Although this book is two biographies in one, anyone who wants to KNOW these two men - with myths and legends debunked - will find no better volume than this, for nothing has been left out and the only drawback is that you will want the story to continue once the author has written &quot;The End.&quot;"},{"Title":"Clashes of Cavalry","review":"If you've seen the movies, \\"custer of the West\\" and \\"Custer's Last Stand,\\" it is evident that there is no fiercer fighter than the American Indian. Jeffrey Hunter was Jesus and also Custer who was almost holy, It was George Armstrong Custer who received the white flag of truce from Robert E. Lee at Aooinattix, Virginia, after making a splash as Abraham Lincoln called him the general who goes into a charge with a \\"whoop and a shout.\\" The Indians of the Great Plains showed that they could out-whoop him.The only fault one from the South could find with him was that he was a yankee; Jeb Stuart was the opposite and my son Zach had a JEB Stuart doll to go with his G.I. Joe in his performances presented to his family. Poor soul, Custer, you'd almost feel that he got what was coming to him, and yet... George was a non-drinker of alcohol (except perhaps for one lapse at the theatre) and he'd been a good general during the Civil War, serving his country well.Custer's primary purpose was to protect the men building the Pacific railroads as Notherners moved west. He was duped into going out West to clear those dreaded Indians out of the way, as the Indians had already killed all of the buffalo for their hides. After George Custer led the way, the population of Native Americans dwindled from seven and a half million in 1700 to 250,000 by 1900 after being pushed west onto marginal lands in the Great Plains. For half my life I've felt guilty about President Andrew Jackson's forcing the Cherokees to relocate to Oklahoma. It didn't seem fair to make them leave the Great Smoky Mountains. After all, they'd lived peaceably with the Europeans who came to North Carolina and Tennesseee, and there was not scalping as in the Northeast which was settled first in America. At least, that's what I though until Fall, 2006, when finally after waiting 35 yeasrs I was going to see 'The Trail of Tears,' a drama about their trek and the handships and deaths along the way. Newly revised, the photos of the new costumes showed their true colors, fierce, bitter, savage. The night I waited impatiently, they called off the performance. Not enough paying customers? Fear that the all-white audience might take theier threats and war dances the wrong way -- maybe one of the white faces had a gun? I call it cowardice of the worst kind. No refunds; I paid $20 for a nickel pen, and useless playbill.At Fort Abraham Lincoln, near Bismarck, when his wife Elizabeth arrived, the band played \\"Home Sweet Home\\" and Custer's favorite song, \\"Garryowen.\\" The soldiers always marched to such music. At the Theatre, Custer watch a Union music presentation (\\"you can't fight for Tennessee\\") compllete with the Union flag. On a Soundprint program (NPR) in which I relived earlier days in my hometown more than giving my opinions about John Wilkes Booth, I mentioned Custer out West. Interviewd by Eric Schaffer of Laurel Lata, Maryland, at the studio of WUOT, I sweated through a tough decision-making, on the spot account of my life and why I revered John Wilkes Book instead of a President, any president. Elizabeth, Custer's wife, channel her loss and grief after his untimely death into a writing career. In every way, he was her hero and she never questioned anything he did or the reasons for his actions. In 1885, she wrote and published her diary, \\"Boots and Saddles,\\" as one woman's \\"recollections,\\" just as I was led into my soul-searching as to why I think as I do.The Black Hills were a sacred place to the Plains Indians. It was a part of the Sioux Reservation and whites were forbidden to enter the magical pine forests and mountains with waterfalls and gold in the creeks (a virtual paradise in America). In 1874, Custer, with is Seventh Calvary was in violation of the treaty of 1868 and Crazy Horse retaliated. He was taunted into making the biggest mistake of his life from which he refused to run. Like a captain of a sinking ship, he chose to go down with his crew. He gave a war whoop aand his life was taken from him in a blaze of glory. President U. S. Grant provoked the inevitable showdown. It took three or four tribes to take George Armstrong Custer down, as he showed no fear.Invented by Morse, the first telegraph system was the first technology to use electricity for communications. How far we have come to computers, email, telephone lines for long distance conversations and business negotiations. Both of these men were heros on their separate sides.

It's a great guide to writing any report/paper/book in the field of computer science. It has great suggestions for describing mathematics and algorithms, how to gather data from experiments and how to present it. It contains good advice about the general act of\\u001b writing, and discusses some of the conventions followed in Comp. Sci. It is extremely well written - lucid and concise. It covers a great deal of material in only 175 pages. It is short enough that I often reread the relavent chapter before I sit down to write a section of a paper. For novices, it's a great introduction. For experts, you'll probably learn something and it is a good catalog of things to keep in mind while writing.

I was in the midst of writing a thesis and was struggling with the conventions and styles to use, but after a quick perusal of this book I had all my doubts cleared. Examples are numerous and clear and easily aid you in the writing process.

Therefore I was attracted by the title. I borrowed the book from the library and read it from cover to cover, frustrated not to be able to use my yellow highlighter on the pages of quite a few chapters.The pertinence of the examples chosen proves that Justin Zobel has reviewed his fair share of papers. If you referee papers, chapter twelve on \\"Refereeing\\" is for you. If you are in computer science or if you use computers in your research, then chapter 5 (\\"Mathematics\\"), 7 (\\"Algorithms\\"), and 11 (Experimentation\\") are written specifically for you.Scientists outside of computer science are not left out. Chapters two to four are about style and grammar. His examples will often bring a smile to your face as you recognize your own mistakes. Justin Zobel's book has the merit of systematically illustrating the principles of writing he recommends to the readers. I cannot say I always agree with his examples. For example page 32, he writes \\"Beginning a paper by stating that a topic is popular or that a problem is important is flat and uninspiring\\" (I could not agree more); he then illustrates such a flat start with the great example \\"Use of digital libraries is increasingly common\\". But then the \\"may well be preferable\\" example that follows has the same problem: \\"Digital libraries provide fast access to large numbers of documents\\". It uses two imprecise adjectives and does not enhance the knowledge of even the most junior researcher in computer science.Chapter 6 on graphs, figures, and tables gives many examples. Justin believes in making figures \\"less dependent on the paper's text\\" (page 112) by making their caption more informative. I do too.Chapter 9 gives general instructions for writing the various parts of a scientific paper, from its title to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Writing for Computer Science","review":"We used this book for my course on research skills at Cambridge and I must say it was a useful reading.

This is a book which is authored BY Celine Dion herself. Therefore, Celine stands behind all what is said in the book. If you are loking for some truthful and quite candid revelations, buy it. If you are looking for gossips on Celine, I guess you won't find them in this one.The book is a first attempt of Celine to try the \\"outfit\\" of a real star. Not \\"some\\" star, but a major STAR who she became after the Titanic. She tells all about how it happened, how it became possible, and how it feels without overloading you with the details of her childhood and other corny things.

Celine comes across as a really quite nice person. She does not leave anything out here, either. From here 24hr tryst with Dudley Moore in the 70's to her well publicised affair with Peter Lawford.

You even know more about her pregnancy!"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"That's the BEST book of Celine since she wrote it by herself, in her OWN words.

Don't think twice, buy it. 0:-)"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"When she finishes the book, she's finally become pregnant. She wishes it to be a little girl, because she feels that a little boy would be cold to her. She did end up having a little boy. I would like to see how this has worked with her career, her time at Caesar's Palace, and her fathers death. Many of the stories in her book are very touching, but she tends to be on the melodramatic side more times then not. I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that it was disturbing to read about her ideas of seducing Rene Angelil when she was 14. Rene and Celine have a beautiful love story, but at 14 that would be wrong, and it feels invading to read it. She does come across as a diva in many points, but all of these shortcomings are minor compared to the wonderful story she writes."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"The power of Celine Dion's voice is not to be denied, but to read her &quot;autobiography&quot; is a disturbing experience to those of us who are not devoted fans. &quot;My Story, My Dream&quot; is one of those &quot;everything I've done and everyone I've met is so wonderful&quot; books, and while Ms. Dion's name is on the cover, it is the hand of her husband/manager Rene Angelil that appears on every page. Far from presenting him as the near-god she (and the rest of her family) obviously believes him to be, Ms. Dion's gushing worship instead reveals Angelil for what he truly is--a master marketer and charming manipulator. He dangled the carrot of stardom in front of Ms. Dion's family, who then had no compunctions about handing their twelve-year-old daughter to a middle-aged man who essentially separated his young charge from everything she had ever known in order to &quot;make her a star.&quot; In the process, he thoroughly convinced a young, impressionable girl that HE was the only one who knew what was best for her. Is it any wonder that Ms. Dion fastened her affections on him, the only man outside her family he ever allowed to get near her? That Angelil made Ms. Dion the success she is today is undeniable, but he also has made her a emotionally fragile puppet who will probably self-destruct if something ever happens to her master--and &quot;My Story, My Dream&quot; is by no means reassuring otherwise."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"The My Story, My Dream is an excellent book.

Although I will always remain a fan of her music, I no longer respect Celine and her husband Rene. Celine portrays herself as a lovesick, immature and all around helpless woman who cannot survive one minute without her ailing, 26 year older husband. This book really is a homage to her husband more than a book about her career. I am aghast that Celine's family practically sold her out to Rene when she was barely a teenager and did nothing to stop his seduction of her. Don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"As a lover of Celine Dion's music I was pleased to receive her book as a gift this past year. Everything about this incredible lady catches my interest and I was sure this book would too.Over the years I have read a variety of different articles about Celine's life and though some are verified as being true I am amazed at just how much depth there is to this woman's life. As a fan I've always been interested in what the real Celine Dion was like. What is it like to have all that fame and fortune and is it worth the sacrifices one makes in this life?I've learned a new respect for the work it takes to become a superstar and for the private woman Celine Dion is.

You can laugh with her, cry with her,love with her, feel with her. You can personally find out more about Celine than anyone you know. After reading this book, fan or not, you will understand her emotions and know what it is like in this hard, musical life of a diva. You will then understand that fame isn't always fortune and that it doesn't happen overnight. Celine will share her thoughts on fame and how to rise above all. How to become a diva.

Because she wrote it and everything is true. It is a must have for every Celine Fan!"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I must admit I am biased because I am a really great fan of Celine Dion. Not only do I like her music, but the way she's achieved everything in her life. Here is the story of a person who was definitely ready to do anything - and everything - she had to in order to achieve what she wanted to become: one of the world's most famous singers. There are a lot of anecdotes about both her personal and professional struggles that the public didn't know about; such as why she became so thin, the times she lost her voice, etc. Celine's story is one of personal sacrifice and constant focusing into her goal.Her romance with Rene Angelil though, is kind of sordid and sometimes boring. I suppose once one becomes a superstar one loses some inhibition. As I was reading the book, at times I turned red. I would have never dared myself to reveal certain details with the openness she does here. In this Celine shows herself as inexperienced and very naive. It's incredible that a person who has gone through so much in life hasn't really gone through the catastrophes most of us have at her age. I'm sorry to say that she still has to suffer a lot to deliver an authentic autobiography that really leaves us something; for example: what will she do when she no longer has Rene in her life? Being myself Celine's age and having also been married to a man 25 years my senior, I can say for certain it is not healthy to be dependent on him as Celine is. She calls it &quot;love&quot;, but a lot of the readers will see is something more than that.Nevertheless, the book is an interesting read from the inspirational point of view. This, I found, is Celine's greatest strength; and not her love for Rene, as she intends to portray. That should always be kept personal."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"If you're going to read any of the Celine books read this one first.

That is the reason I bought this book. On thw whole, it was interesting, and hard to put it down. What I did find a littlw weird though was the way she decribes what she felt about Rene when she was 14. Fine, if she knew/thought she knew she was in love with him, but the way she describes it makes her sound selfish, if a little sordid.This book also makes her out to be greedy. Tell me, please, who needs 33 televisions? You just don't. She says that all she needs around her is her family. Why does she have so many houses then? She talks about designing new houses about a year after she has already had one. It's stupid!The book was very detailed throughout, until the end. When I got to the final 3 or 4 chapters, I notcied lack of detail in some places. It all started to seem very rushed, particually the last chapter. For a book that had been very thorough at the start, I was a little disappointed at the way it just got rather thin and boring.I better talk about some good points now. The opening of the book is good, and makes you want to read more, instead of just putting it down. And the photos were good too :DSo, IMO, this is a good book, but I think in some places a little too revealing, and as I say, the ending rushed.

The book was very easy to read and it kept my attention. The reader learns about Celine's background and family life. If you read this, you also learn about Celine's love life with Renee (alittle bit too much if you ask me!) Since Celine is so honest with the press, a lot of the information was a repeat for me; however, it was interesting to find out about what went into making certain albums and what it is like to be a singer.

There were some things which impressed me much, such as her muting state for 3 weeks, Ren&eacute;'s illness and her niece's death. But on the other hand I got some power , some will from this book. I was in fight with my lover and as soon as I read the last page I went and said &quot;I love you&quot;... I flew from Brazil just to watch Celine in Chicago-IL and I was very close to her and this book helped me to be a little bit closer to her thoughts, her ways of thinking and the way she is.

Her voice is amazing, but she has a rare quality in her personality that made me buy the book to discover more. I didn't read the book for over a year, but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was extremely well written.I was so interested to learn of the role that David Foster had in her American recordings. David Foster is a master with talent. He also has introduced the world to Josh Groban. It is my utmost hope that Celine and Josh will do many duets and shows together. It isn't just their voices - it's their personalities. They are both confident, but they are both so unpretentious as well.I was awed by the strength of Celine and her family. What a unique environment to grow up in! Additionally, Celine seems so honest about her life - both the good and the bad.I was amazed at the details regarding her husband, Rene. Amazed that Celine had such a love for this man that it triumphed over YEARS when he repeatedly \\"rejected\\" her. She was famous and could have had any number of boyfriends, but instead her heart wouldn't allow her to love anyone but Rene. I believe that Rene was MEANT to be with Celine and her family; that he truly didn't begin to live until he met them. Likewise, I think that Celine is everything that she is because of Rene. Not just her voice, but her looks, style, education, etc.Celine, a \\"homewrecker?\\" Give me a break! She was 14 and mesmerized by a cultured, attractive,genius agent who put her first in his life. I don't think that any marriage could have survived when one woman becomes such an obsession as Rene wanted the whole world to hear Celine. And in all fairness, the marriage had been over for a long time before he finally made love to her at 20. To me it is one of the greatest love stories of our time!!Rene groomed Celine to become the woman she is. And he is her whole world. What man could resist this? Personally, I think he should feel as though he is the luckiest man in the world to have the love and loyalty of this gifted, funny, and amazing woman."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"This is the best biography yet ever written on this very nice lady.

Plus of how she felt about the rest of Canada and their relatioship with the province of Quebec as well.She even was bold enough to mention the fantasies and dreams she would have about the love of her life, Rene Angelil. (Bold REALLY is the word to describe what she was imaging when it came to him.)She also is VERY frank about her naivety in politics and of show busisness.Than she goes back to her fantasies and dreams she had regarding when she would become famous or if she didn't.Every single things that Celine has experience before and after becoming famous is ALL told straight from her heart... and that's why this autobiography is worth buying for all the other Celine Dion fans out there."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"the book was in great shape , I got it in three daysCeline Dion: My Story, My Dreamthe book is an easy read and a interseting"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I loved this book.

Very well written, I must say that Celine is a very powerful individual and I look at her in a different light after reading this book.She gets very personal with the readers and goes into great depth about her relationship with Rene. I couldn't put it down and hope that she writes another book, to update us about her life after her son was born."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"Look at the subject then read on. I'm glad I finally convince me to read this book because I read I learned more on her than before. Another than that its hard to decrisbe my feelings on the this book. The pictures are so wonderful."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I must admit I'm a little bias when it comes to rating or reviewing this book because I have been a fan of Celine since 1997. Overall I think the book was great. If you're looking to learn more about this talented artist or to learn about her for the first time, I recommend it.Okay, I admit it has the fairy tale touch but not through and through. And she's very open about her personal life... things most people wouldn't freely say. My favorite parts are hearing about her tours and the passion for her work.This is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I really enjoy this book that Celine wrote. It's a great book about a great singer, who had it hard when she was a little girl, and how she became famous.. It told me alot that I didn't know about her and her love for Rene. It's so sweet!!"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I may like Ms. Dion's voice.. This book is torture.. Maybe something got lost in the French translation... but.. in the French tradition, this diatribe is oh-so-emotional and reads like a high-schooler's attempt to write a fairy tale in composition class.. I equate reading this to eating a block of sugar.. And.. another gripe.. This book is so poorly packaged.. Could some of the pictures could at least be in color?"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I received this book for Christmas and was disappointed with the personality that came forth in the book. Fame and success can truly change people and this is a prime example. The book was factual and interesting, taking the reader from Celine's birth, through childhood, her burning desire to be a singer, her early days with Rene and the secret of their relationship to marriage and the anticipated birth of their child.While I think we all admire Celine's determination and disciplined approach to becoming a &quot;super star&quot; (which she has in fact accomplished,) she appears to flaunt what she has acquired and throw her success in the faces of those who helped get her their - her fans. She talks of her wealth, her fame, her lavious wardrobe, her extravagant renewal of her marriage vows, and left the reader with the message that says, &quot;I am rich , beautiful and famous and because of that, look at me now, I am really better than anyone else.&quot;In my opinion she is the most fantastic and talented singer of all times and my music library is filled with her CD's. For me, she was a glowing example for all women and what they could achieve if they put their mind to it. However, having read her story and learned of her self-absorbed image, one forms the opinion that success truly has gone to her head, and if you loose so much of yourself in the process, perhaps one is better off without the fame and glory. Hopefully, her time away from the limelight will allow her to discover what is truly important and lasting in life and what is superficial and short-lived."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"If you love Celine or admire her or whatever, you'll enjoy her story. The idiot critic Solinas wants to trash Celine and Rene and nary gives a thought to maybe Celine is not obligated to share any of this personal info. with us... Celine bares all, lives under the scrutiny of the public and idiots like Solinas who insist they know better. I could also criticize Celine for not following her Catholic faith better, but you know I pray for her and I still enjoy her sharing so much of her intimate dreams and feelings and thank her for sharing and that's all - IT IS A GOOD READ, but if you don't like her then simply leave her alone- she doesn't ask for your approval -she is giving here, I for one appreciate that... THANKS CELINE AND THANKS RENEE - CELINE IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"From someone who is a huge fan of Celine's music - from her early work to her most recent, this book was not what I was expecting.It was a very easy read - almost like a fairytale. It was great thru the beginning of the book, but even her adult years were portrayed like they were thru the eyes of a small child. This doesn't bode well for my opinion of Celine as an adult, who spends half the book trying to assert her independence \\"because Rene wouldn't want me that way\\" if she didn't.As for the love story between her and Rene - again, I liked the early years. She admitted she didn't think much of him when she met him- hey, she was just a kid then. Talked about Anne Marie, etc. What this book is missing is things like how she dealt with breaking their relationship to his adult children, how she relates to them good and bad, and how she justifies such great lengths for a child with a man who has already raised two.Again, this story seems to brush over these kinds of topics in favor of defending Rene. We didn't read the book for Rene, we read it for her. She was real about her childhood. Not so real about her adult life."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I am ofcourse in love with Celine Dion, so I was a bit biased at first. Reading this book took me through her life from the very start, and through her stardom. Her love with Rene Angelil, her feelings for this man 26 years her senior, her view of the world, of popularity, of discipline most of all, and of her working hard and intense attitude, I fell in love with her all over again. I can't recommend the book enough, but then again, you have to love Celine the way I do to appreciate her book as much!! :)"},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"&quot;Remember this name because you will never forget this voice.&quot; That is the sologan of one of the greatest singers of all time, known all over the globe: Celine Dion. 'Celine Dion, My Story, My Dream' written by Celine Dion herself has the all the information that you've never read in the tabloids, and the truth on the stuff you did. What was Celine Dion doing in a public L.A. hosptal in her bathing suit? how her grandfather died so tragicly, and what is Celine and Renee's secret sign? Plus, Do you know how many shoes does Celine has? (Neither does she. It would take forever to count them, and she is a busy lady). This book has everything from before she went to kindergarten, to when she took her sabbatical in 1999. And what makes this one of the best books written about her? It's because she wrote it herself! This book is great for anyone who loves Celine Dion."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I wanted to read this for ages and finally I got to! I really liked it and learned a lot from it. I would recomend it to fans or people interseted in show business."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"This book was SO over-the-top...oh, wait, just like Celine.This is how Celine comes across to me: \\"Rene and I are in love...Rene is the only one for me...our love is special...there is no other love like ours...I wanted him, and I got him...what we have is true love...our love transcends the ages...\\" My question is, did wives one and two feel the same way? She doesn't seem to care that she broke up a marriage...that fact is glossed over. All she does is gloat about winning a balding, creepy predator. He's also a compulsive gambler, and she thinks it's okay...because he's HER Rene. I bet he could sell her anything.She has an amazing voice - truly very talented - but man, is she icky. Maybe she can go far away with Rene where no one has to hear her childishly gushing words for him. YUCK."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I did find this book to be enjoyable at times and boring in parts as well:I found Celine's early years of family/homelife interesting and oh my did she and her mother (her siblings as well) worked their butts off (and her manager/now husband Rene) to get Celine to where she is today.I think the reader might take the \\"I'm rich and I deserve it\\" the wrong way (maybe the French translation into English). Yes, she admits she is rich and yes she does talk about decorating homes and her fairytale wedding and renewing her vows, but I she realizes that she grew up poor and to give back, etc (she gave her siblings $$, etc).I found Celine to be heartfelt and truthful. She admits she doesn't hide \\"things\\" from the press/friends (such as fertility problems), she admits that she was kind of spoiled growing up, and she did finally come out and tell the world she was in love with her manager Rene.Around the age of 17 or so (earlier maybe) Celine describes her \\"fantasies\\" and movies she made up in her head about her manager Rene. She realized she was in \\"love\\" with him. I think she went a little in detail,(this sometimes gets boring), etc. I don't know what to think of it. Rene maybe didn't realize or didn't want to realize her attraction to him and his to her (he goes away to fix his marriage which ends up in divorce, his 2nd wife was fed up with this workaholic/gambling ways). When she was 18 I think it offical came out between the two of them that they were \\"in love.\\" Rene and her mother do question the 26 year age difference (and the twice divorce thing as well). What I took out of the \\"love\\" relationship is it is extremely power and important to her and age doesn't make a difference.Celine outlines that she indeed is strong and independent and Rene did guide her on the path of stardom but she is more than capible in making her own decisions.All in all an ok book. it seems unfinished, and rushed little, and it needs a sequel. It leaves off during her pregnancy. I think the real meaning could have gotten lost in translation from French to English as well.Anyway an ok read and I read it in a few days and I'm a die-hard Celine Fan!That's my review for celine Dion, My Story, My Dream."},{"Title":"Celine Dion : My Story, My Dream","review":"I really like Celine Dion as a singer, but reading this autobiography was a bit much. It was somewhat disturbing to read of her &quot;courtship&quot; of Rene Angelil. She seduced him--a married man over 20 years older than herself--and does not even mention the repercussions this had on his shaky marriage (it led to divorce, of course). Her fantasies of seducing and being with him when she was only 14 years old were disturbing, as is her almost total dependence on him. I really didn't need to know all of those details--it's almost like reading a tabloid magazine.I think she should stick to what she does best, and leave the book writing to someone else!"},{"Title":"Healing with water: Special applications and uses of water in home remedies for everyday ailments","review":"This is an old book with about 248 pages of information. It has useful line drawings that help us understand how to apply the water. The book is a kind of recipe book with different therapeutic uses of water. Some involve using a sprayer and spraying along the meridian lines. Some involve sponging, using compresses, and baths. Some of these I have tried from other books and am happy to see them again. Others I have not tried, but they seem promising and seem similar to other methods that I have found to work. The book describes remedies for a number of ailments and is easier to read. I would consider this book both useful and safe to use, but mainly as supportive therapy for other more serious therapies (though it might be enough for some of the less serious ailments)."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"John Gordon's book is an important book to read for those trying to gain an understanding of the Civil War and a perspective of a individual that had been involved in multiple engagements. From the start, Gordon writes about raising the Racoon Roughs and their start in Georgia which carries the reader chronologically throughout various battles. His service to the Confederate cause is covered well from his early beginnings to his involvement with General Lee in the surrender at Apomattox. This book is an important tool for understanding the fairness and qualities of Gordon and his sympathies for the people involved in the Civil War be it North or South. His character in speaking about individuals involved is fair and truly demonstrates that he wasn't just another 'racist' that fought for the South which is typical of only today's modern society. It is a must read for those looking to get into the mind of a great Southern leader. I would have rated this book 5 stars if Gordon would have only covered his involvement in the Civil War instead of writing reports on battles he wasn't involved with, though shaped the outcome of the Civil War. It would have better in my opinion if the book didn't get into explaining other battles or problems which Gordon had not took part in since it didn't appear that those other situations affected him."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"I bought this book as I recently discovered General Gordon is my ancestor. Curious to learn all I could about this heralded man, I bought his authored book regarding the civil war. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this riveting personal account of the war from the Southern side, I found parts of it to be a little self agrandizing. However, we all of us, have memories that, with time, color our role a little better perhaps than actually happened, and I'm sure General Gordon's memory was no different. This does not in any way detract from his moral and ethical carriage, or his exemplory service to this country and the reunification process post war. But this book does not cover those years. I am now reading the biography of John Brown Gordon, which covers the civil war years, but goes beyond and into his political career. Of the two, I am finding the biography much more informative as to the life of my ancestor, but I am glad to have read this book first and highly recommend it any civil war buff, or those, like me, descended from this great man."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"This is an excellent book. Gordon may not be as well known as some Confederate Generals, Nevertheless, He was a very good officier and a gentlemen that can discuss the many complex issues with the Battles he was a part of. I strongly suggest that you read this book to learn more about him and his part in the war between the States."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"Being a passionate reader of autobiographical accounts of the Civil War, I have to put this book on my top five of all-time favorites. General Gordon writes in a concise, easy-to-read style that demonstrates his intelligence as a leader and character as a great American."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"My husband thoroughly enjoys reading factual books on history. He began with the Civil War and has progressed to books on WWII. He had read this book many years ago and found it very interesting and well written. Unfortunately, he had loaned it to someone and never got it back. He wanted to read it again, so I found it available through Amazon.com. He is once again reading this book and will most likely keep it in his library of history books...and will think twice about loaning it out again (it's a difficult book to find). Through the recommendation of someone who enjoys reading about the history of our Country, in both an informative and easy-read, without any \\"Hollywood\\" storyline added, this book (the author as well) is a winner. You won't be sorry you bought it. It would also make a great gift."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"Although I haven't read the book thoroughly, it seems like a good book. And you can't beat free so come on."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"John B. Gordon was Georgia's greatest Confederate Hero.After the war, he led the KKK in Georgia and participated in one of the greatest stock market scandals of the Gilded Age.He also formed a triumvirate, along with Aleck Stephens and Joe Brown that dominated Georgia politics for more than a quarter century after \\"redemption.\\" And milked his image as the \\"plumed knight of Appomattox\\", who led the last charge of the Army of Northern Virginia.John B. Gordon, in short, was a piece of work. (Read C.Vann Woodward's description of him in TOM WATSON AGRARIAN REBEL.)Another of Gordon's postbellum achievements was as high priestof the cult of the \\"lost cause.\\" In codifying the \\"myth,\\" he was second only to Jubal Early. Like Early, he maintained that the war had not been about slavery at all, but states rights. Like Early, he would maintain that the South was not defeated but only overwhelmed but vastly superior numbers of men and material. Unlike Early, he downplayed the struggle between northern industrial capital and southern landed gentry and he gave the myth a conciliatory twist perfectly suited to the capital hungry \\"new south.\\" For decades he would dazzle memorial day audiences, with a speech arguing that *both* sides of the \\"war between the states\\" were right and *both* sides won( the North preserved the union and the South preserved \\"honor\\"). (Now *that's* conciliatory!)It is this mythmaking, that is in evidence in his wartime memoirs. His overwritten florid prosedescribes each calvary charge in romantic hyperbole with out a hint of gore attached to the proceeding. (It is just this sort of bunk that Sherman had in mind when he told cadets \\"war is not a gentlemen's game,war is hell.\\")As \\"myth\\" this book deserves five stars, as \\"history\\" two would be being generous--so I've split the difference.If one wants a real soldier's story told with out concern for the memories of marble men or a sense of decorum one would be better off with Edward Porter Alexander's FIGHTING FOR THE CONFEDERACY.If on the other hand wants to wallow in fantasies of \\"moonlight and magnolias\\" then, by all means, knock yourself out!"},{"Title":"Why the whales came","review":"This was the first serious chapter book I read to my six-year-old and it has completely sold her on books.

Thank you Michael Murpurgo, where ever you are."},{"Title":"Why the whales came","review":"This book gives you the wonder of the Isles of Scilly mixed in with a wonderful story, about children living on Bryher during the war, and shows the reader a different kind of life.

I always enjoy this author, he writes in a very easy style that makes for a relaxing reading experience."},{"Title":"Why the whales came","review":"I really enjoyed the first part of the book, as it was really interesting. I think that the author Michael Morpurgo was really clever using something that he knows about. He also wrote \`The Wreck of the Zanzibar' and both stories are very alike in some ways. They are set in the same sort of time, and are both set around the Scilly Isles. I like this story so far because it is very realistic. I think that this could actually happen although it is a bit of a fantasy. I enjoyed the first part of the book as it is a different literature than I usually read, that is interesting.At the start of the book Daniel and Gracie were sailing boats near the Isles of Scilly. When they couldn't find anywhere to sail their boats they went to the Birdman's territory. They lost one of their boats and the Birdman found it. The Birdman wrote messages in the sand to Daniel and Gracie and they gradually began to find out about him. The Birdman had had many bad stories told about him and everyone was terrified of him. Daniel and Gracie found the better side of him. This shows how many people judge other people by what they hear about them.I think that the Birdman was actually very kind inside.Daniel is very ambitious and likes to do things in a rush. Gracie is a bit shy and tries to stop Daniel in his frantic rush."},{"Title":"Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste","review":"I dont want to belabour here the greatness of Gans's study: it's an acknowledged classic and needs no further recommendation. But I would like to draw attention to a slightly less known study by Peter Swirski, called \\"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\\" (published about a year ago) which in many ways continues the line of inquiry spearheaded by Gans. As a matter of fact, Chapter 2 in \\"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\\" leans on Gans's book when it provides a thorough review (and a wonderful debunking) of a multitude of accusations raised against popular culture and popular fiction over the decades. Swirski tends to be more humorous and colloquial, and focuses mainly on literature and film, whereas Gans takes a more \\"wholistic\\" and sociological approach to popular culture. Otherwise, it is hard for me to decide which book I learned more from."},{"Title":"Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste","review":"I just want to say that i agree with the review above. I read both of these books, Gans' Popular Culture and High Culture and Swirski's From lowbrow to Nobrow and i think both are great, they explore the same subjects, the are both easy and entertaining to read, and both pay a great deal of attention to sociological issues in contemporary culture. Naturally Swirski is more up to date and his perspective is a little broader, because he deals with aesthetics as well, but these two books are quite related, almost like two chapters of a much bigger book."},{"Title":"Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste","review":"Gans makes the general argument that in a pluralistic, democratic country we all deserve the culture we want whether it be high or low. Some parts of the book are pretty dated, but overall this is an excellent analysis of American cultural stratification and the creators and users of that culture."},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","review":"Young Michael is not an ordinary child. His parents are Hungarian nobility and his days are full of magic, from the stories of his beloved \\"Nana\\" to riding lessons. But it is World War II and slowly Michael's world begins to collapse. The family estate is taken over by Nazis and his father is accused of collaboration with them. As a small soldier in the war, Michael keeps the real truth hidden--that his father is working against the enemy--but pays for his love of the beautiful horse Midnight by losing all that he has loved.This is a beautifully written page turner of a novel with lovely illustrations by Seredy. Michael, Prince Chestry, and Nana are memorable long after the story is over, and once again Seredy glorifies the life of the \\"ordinary\\" farmer, who she considers to be the true royalty."},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","review":"This has been one of my favorite books since I was young, I still love it and I am 61. It tells the beautiful story of a child who must keep a deadly secret - that his father,the King, assumed to be a collaborator with the Nazis, is actually working with the Resistance. His father plans the boy's escape on the eve of a great bombing attack called down by the Resistance that will destroy the Nazi headquarters (with Michael's father within,) but Michael's love of a beautiful black stallion ruins his escape. Michael is injured, bringing on amnesia for a time. When he recovers the war is over, his father dead, still reputed to be a collaborator, the secret of his heroism in planning the attack locked in Michael's memory only. The story of his adoption by a young GI and his gradual healing, emotional and physically, in the arms of the young man's family in America is beautifully told (and shows the author's obvious love of this country.) Of course the truth about his father is eventually told, but he is glad to be a young farmer instead of Prince Michael. Of course there is some triteness and post war pro Americanism, but the writing is beautifully done and the theme is honorable. The book has lovely soft pencil drawings, many of gorgeous horses, but this is not primarily a horse story."},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","review":"I read this book as a child several times, and have never forgotten it. It gave me a vivid sense of the beauty of Hungary, the richness of its culture, and the confusing incomprehensibility of war to a child's mind. It allows a child's eye view of World War II, without being gory or overwhelming. It's a wonderful story, full of a sense of hope, despite devastating losses, and of redeeming love. It should be a part of any intelligent child's imaginative world."},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","review":"The Chestry Oak is a excellent book.Set in Pre-war Hungary, (I think pre-WWI -- but it's been a long time.)it follows the adventures of a nobleman's son through the war.

I'm so glad I hung on to my copy from the 1960s, which I got as part of a horse book mail-order club as a kid.

This book deserves to be reprinted and made into a movie!"},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","review":"I read this book at a very early age and have read and reread it many times over the years. I am 74 and still can tell you the entire story of Michael and Midnight. When Michael sits on that horse when it comes off the ship I got goose bumps then and every time I read that part.

It tells a tale of a KGB officer whose life gets turned around, mostly for the worst. It has truth all through the core, to the other side and back again. The words are well put and it really made me think. The story plants such clear pictures of spies, guns, and Russia. It gave me a chill when the author told of his family and how the KGB ruined his life.

Yet another biography, focusing on her political as well as personal activities.I expected to be bored by this book, as I'm very familiar with the queen's life and unimpressed with what I know of the author. But he held me entranced all the way through, both with information I didn't already have, including quotes from her journals, and cogent analysis of the effect she had on the political activity of the time (and vice versa). The style is more than a bit dated, and he downplays some of the controversial aspects of her life; for example, he portrays her relationship with John Brown as simply that of mistress to devoted servant. But the sheer readability, combined with the perceptive insights into the life of a complicated woman, made this book well worth my time."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"lytton strachey is my favorite non-fiction writer. he writes non-fiction that is flawless and beautiful. some of the writing in this book is as good as any writing i've seen anywhere. but who cares? who cares? what a shameful culture has been fashioned that has no room for this."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"This is an okay book. There were moments where I had to restart a paragraph because I ended up getting lost. It was the first book I read on my Kindle, so maybe it was getting use to that. It dragged from when Prince Albert died until the end. I felt like it was cut up quite a bit, as well. The Kindle version was apparently edited by a volunteer and it was free, so maybe it was that.

This book broke away from tradition and provided a deeper look at the Queen and all those around her by abandoning the notion of promoting a person's successess and strengths and instead paints the portrait of a human with weaknesses, motivations, strengths, and stuggles. The reader sees the Queen in relationships that become history and see the impact of personality in making decisions.The book is engaging especially once Victoria moves beyond childhood and becomes Queen. The portrait of Edward and Victoria's relationship is vivid. The story provides a rich understanding of places in the lives of the royal family that continue today, namely Balmoral, and give a glimpse at the royal family culture that can be seen in current events. It is more than a book about Queen Victoria.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"Giles Lytton Strachey was an early 20th century writer and biographer who developed a reputation for writing biographies that dealt with individuals as people, rather than the events they were associated with. His 1921 biography of the British monarch, Queen Victoria, is a highly readable insight into this long-reigning queen.Many public domain books can be slow to read, with language that is sometimes archaic when compared to contemporary writing. This is not the case with Strachey's work. Not only does it thoroughly cover Victoria's life from childhood to death, but it is an engaging read that explores Victoria's relationships, both personal and professional. I particularly liked reading of the love between Victoria and her husband, Albert, much of which is detailed in Victoria's journals and letters. I also enjoyed Strachey's turn of phrase and his ability to create such effective word-pictures of this fascinating monarch and her life.If you have any interest in history or curiosity about British monarchs I think you will enjoy this book. I certainly did - far more than I expected to."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"strachey became famous for his 'eminent victorians' which has the reputation for being a hatchet job-but he was looking at the previous generation from the disillusioned, post-WWI perspective, and he treats florence nightingale et al more like prodigies than monsters. when he undertook to write about the eponymous queen herself, people expected it would be another exercise in target practice-even his mother tried to discourage him, saying that 'if she was stupid, it was not her fault.' But in the event what he produced is one of the most sympathetic, if slightly condescending, biographies ever written-and absolutely one of the most accomplished. it is a chronicle of victoria's 60+-year-long political career and emotional life, a series of portraits of all the personalities in her life-including albert, his curious replacement john brown, disraeli-him, it is true, strachey clearly did not like-a completely non-pedantic reflection on the growth and eventual shrinkage of the british empire during her reign-and the whole thing is done so subtly, so gracefully-and, at the same time, so forcefully-that you may find yourself talking about nothing else but this book and queen victoria for days afterward. one of the most successful marriages of rigorous scholarship and beautiful style in english literature."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"A readable and fairly brief account of Victoria. Frequent passages from Victoria's girlhood diary and letters make Victoria's early life particularly vivid reading. Also fascinating is Victoria's relationship with her government, and her tendency to cling to the current prime minister and despise the Opposition, whoever they might be.The enigmatic Prince Albert, and his evolving relationship with Victoria, is presented well. Strachey makes some startling suggestions about what Britain might have turned into, had Albert lived longer (answer: Prussia).This book is elegantly written, and free of the psychobabble one might expect from a more modern book.The book is not boring.

It had a lot of detail, but the writing style was a bit dry and old-fashioned (the book was written a while ago).

I am English, a romantic like the Queen so naturally I enjoyed her in this work by an English author. Being English by heritage with a great-great GM right off the \\"boat\\" as they say, the in depth details were enormously exciting and seeing the many reference volumes; I knew he was getting the real scoop from history and not from gossip or plain fancy. It made me want to own everything volume about her and also of \\"them\\" but money is an object so I have to stay with freebies. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who really wants a true depiction of her life in the Royal Court leading up to and beyond the Victorian Era. So, for the money, I recommend this e-read to anyone interested in a none sensational account without the sexual exploits of the Court and of Prince Eddy also know as Bertie. I know him to have been a scoundrel but also not knowing that much about these royals after 1901 other than the four kings that lead up to Q. Elizabeth II or Q. Bess, I hesitate to say more and so won't. There are so many other books I want to read but time won't allow. This one was enough to whet my whistle for her Highland Journals and letters to her Minister's which I bought here too with pictures of her galore and most of those closest to her. I love all the illustrated books although I would have preferred her picture on the cover to have been a young Vic not an old Dowager.

I got to like the big-hipped cat-faced women of the photographs shown as lures out in front of the burlesque show; the announcements of moving picture palaces bejeweled with paste-bright lights; the little music shops that had radios blasted into the street.\\" That of course is Wilson describing a slice of Manhattan during the Depression Era from his magnificent novel, Princess With the Golden Hair, which is two-hundred pages of brilliance. Vivid and stylized descriptions of 30s New York are sprinkled throughout what Wilson himself has remarked is his personal favorite of all his books. Memoirs of Hecate County consists of six completely separate stories, five of which are moderately good at best, it's Princess With the Golden Hair that carries the day.The dialogue between him and Imogen (the upperclass woman he's having an affair with) and him and Anna (the poor woman he's simultaneously scheduling assignations) is fantastically written. At one point he remarks to Imogen that she's a beauty yet doesn't act like it. Beauties, he explains, expect to be admired and courted. She, the suburban philistine, at one point has enough honesty to remark that if he got to know her he wouldn't like her. Meanwhile, in another passage Anna concludes that poor people can't love their mothers the way other girls do because their mothers aren't able to look after them, and physically abuse them. It's this constant juxtaposition running the length of the book which makes for fascinating reading. He jumps back and forth from Imogen to Anna -- two starkly different worlds for which he somewhat uncomfortably has a foot ensconced in each. On another occasion he reflects to himself how Imogen's peers would react to the going-ons in Anna's life, the thought of their incredulous responses is almost comical.With a deft hand Wilson incorporates into his novel such topics as class stratification and the unwritten and unseen barriers separating the well-to-do from the poor. Towards the end he finally ventures to Anna's Brooklyn 'hood and is slapped in the face with what it truly means to be poor. He later becomes convinced America's rich do indeed constitute a bourgeoisie, and that Anna's proletariat world is the base on which everything rests, including Imogen's superficial reality. He concludes on a somber note lamenting how he will never have Anna again.Included in Memoirs is an afterword by Updike who makes two extremely pertinent points: 1.) It was Wilson's conscious intent to bring Euro sexual realism into American fiction for the first time, and 2.) Memoirs, specifically Princess With the Golden Hair, was at the time an intelligent attempt by an American male to dramatize sexual behavior as a function of personality. Also included in the afterword is a quite interesting Q&A; with intellectual heavyweight, Lionel Trilling, which took place during Memoirs' obscenity hearing.Princess With the Golden Hair works on a number of levels. The cornerstone being that it contrasts two completely different worlds in the eyes of an intelligent critic. Judging by Memoirs, Wilson's foray into literature is an easy success, and an insightful look into 1930's mores."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"I had recently read and loved _To the Finland Station_, Wilson's great non-fiction work treating the history of revolutionary thought in Europe. I had wanted to read something else of his and decided to read MoHC largely because of its infamous reputation.(For those who don't know, MoHC was the subject of one of the pivotal battles over obscenity in literature. Although tame by today's standards, it was too frank about sexuality to get past the censors of the time. The Supreme Court upheld Doubleday's conviction for publishing the book.)I really really liked Memoirs. It should be viewed as more of a collection of six loosely linked short stories than truly as a novel. (\\"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\\", \\"Ellen Terhune\\", \\"Glimpses of Wilbur Flick\\", \\"The Princess with the Golden Hair\\", \\"The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul\\", and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn at Home\\"). The narrator, a kind of educated everyman, uses his participation in the stories to paint portraits of the other characters he encounters.True to the name of the book, a kind of magic realism swirls through the stories. Ellen Terhune may or may not be a ghost, and publishers may make a pact with the devil. But this is not an uplifting or gentle magic realism. The magic in this book is more of a feeling that people can step off the edge of the map more easily than they realize.The book reminds me, in a way, of Fitzgerald. Some of the concerns and situations are largely the same. What strikes me the most, however, are how acerbic Wilson makes some of these portraits. I found myself actually wincing at times at how accurately he targeted common human weaknesses and behaviours. There is something rigorous and unforgiving about the narrator's look at life. It is very well-written. I particularly liked the view on relationships exposed in \\"The Princess With Golden Hair\\".As noted, the digression into pages and pages written in French (although it only happens once) is really annoying. For me particularly it was frustrating because my French simply is not up to more than just getting the basic ideas. Still, it is worth putting up with the annoyance to read the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"The five yarns in this book, loosely linked, are very engaging and captivating - even seductive. But in the end I hated them. It's just that the first person character is a male who takes liberties in his relationships and then bristles at suggested whiffs of engagement of his partner or partners with other people - even if the implied infidelity is far from established. I find it very hard not to identify the character with Edmund Wilson himself, and then it's so hard to avoid a real repugnance for the man and the hypocrisy displayed by his character.I have met this feeling before with Paul Theroux, even in his travel stories which are openly autobiographical. I'm sure I could never expose my thinking in the way Mr Theroux does. But, on the other hand there are extenuating circumstances with Mr Theroux and he does recognise the unfairness of his attitude, even regrets it. This doesn't happen with Edmund Wilson's character who seems not to think that his self-centred behaviour should be questioned - he's a man and he can do whatever he wants - not so those who associate with him. His entreaties to the women he seduces seem so [weak] to me - and yet they are successful in the novel - 'You know you're the only woman I've ever wanted to marry!'And inexcuseable (for me anyway), towards the end of the novel there are pages and pages in French. I understand that multilingual people do sometimes switch between languages but I think this is appalling behaviour by the writer and the publisher when many, if not most, readers will not be able to read these passages. What are we expected to do - go out and hire a translator to translate the text for us?The stories are engaging, even amusing, perhaps enlightening. But in the end I just didn't like them for the arrogance of the character, the vulnerability of the women he associates with (none of them stand up against him), and the self-indulgence of the author."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"Wilson was the preeminent literary critic of his day, and advanced the careers of many of the names we associate with belles lettres the first part of the twentieth century. This foray into literature exposed a different talent. A left leaning intellectual, the protagonist explores his mythical Hecate county using modernist effects. The stories are written wryly, at times humorously, at times seriously, with an utter command of the language, in a latinate style. Leftist themes predominate--recall that at this time many intellectuals were enamoured with socialism. Stories involve him breaking class barriers in his romance, or writing about themes that were scandelous in their day. His parodies of the rich and franchised are funny, but nuanced and compassionate at the same time. His writes with gentle shades of grey, and, simply put, there are few nowadays who can write this well. He captures a world of independent intellectuals that does not exist today, moving between different social strata, and his depiction of females is based on a chivalric model, and stories possess, at the same time as displaying some of the novel ideas of the time, a nostolgic glance backward. Most interestingly, he writes of the days when an intellectual could live independently, if poorly, and explore the variegated social world around him. A book that should be part of everyone's literary education. Damon LaBarbera, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"First I encountered Vladimir Nabokov's gentle, sad and funny novel PNIN, then DEAR BUNNY, DEAR VOLODYA: THE NABOKOV-WILSON LETTERS. Because I had found Nabokov so very enjoyable to read and because he thought highly of Edmund Wilson, I was determined to read some of the latter's works. I shall still get around to some of Wilson's non-fiction works, but MEMOIRS OF HECATE COUNTY has convinced me that Wilson is not among the great fiction writers of American literature.MEMOIRS consists of six quite independent and rather different stories, linked only by the presence of the same narrator and his references to life in Hecate County. The first two, \\"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\\" and \\"Ellen Terhune,\\" are perfectly fine short stories with identifiable themes. I especially like the first one with its message of the pervasive dominance of evil over beauty in the world of human values and its linking of evil with the idea of capitalistic profit-making. The fifth story, \\"The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul,\\" while slower-moving than the first two, is also amusing for the nearly non-stop editorial comments on the book publishing and marketing trade; the reader clearly senses the conflicts between authors and publishers and feels that Wilson is speaking quite loudly through the lips of his fictional narrator.The last short story, \\"Mr. And Mrs. Blackburn at Home,\\" struck me as confused and unedifying. It contains a definite supernatural element, as do the first two stories, but the contribution of that element to any theme quite eluded me. This story is also frustrating in that Wilson has one of the characters deliver a multi-page monologue entirely in French. My own command of French is usually adequate for a few isolated sentences or phrases here and there, nor do I object to having recourse to a translating dictionary for an unusual French term now and then. However, encountering eleven straight pages of French text exceeded my patience, and most of the speech went untranslated and, therefore, unread. Is it fair to criticize an author for the reader's lack of linguistic skill? Perhaps not, but be aware that a fair proportion of this story is not written in English.The longest story, more of a novelette, is \\"The Princess with the Golden Hair.\\" It is this story that caused Wilson's book to be banned as indecent by New York courts in the mid-1940s, but it is not Wilson's detailed descriptions of female anatomy that alienated me but rather the fact that I can find no point to the story. It is, admittedly, a fine example of realistic, some will say naturalistic, writing, and the reader comes to visualize the characters quite clearly. Whether or not the reader will like any of those characters is, of course, another matter entirely. By and large, their lives seem based on self delusion as well as on their self-absorbed relationships with others. One feels the need to bathe after consorting with these characters, even vicariously.\\"The Princess\\" does contain one rather interesting revelation. Throughout all of the stories, the narrator is portrayed as, shall we say, a theoretical Marxist, ever ready to condemn the economic inequities of capitalism and to extol the benefits of socialism. However, his relationship with Anna, the quintessential example of the exploited proletariat, leads him to admit that reality and theory have parted company, and that his assumptions and beliefs may not be as accurate and inviolable as he thought. Nothing much comes of this, and the narrator experiences no epiphany or political conversion by any means, yet his conviction in the righteousness of his opinion has developed a crack. This may be the only example of character development in the entire story.As to Wilson's writing style, let me quote Kate Blackburn from the final story. Speaking to the narrator, she says, \\"...[I]f you only wouldn't try sometimes to put quite so much into one sentence-and would talk about things a little more concretely,...\\" That pretty well sums up my feelings toward the syntax of a typical Wilson sentence.In brief, then, I found some of the short stories in MEMOIRS OF HECATE COUNTY to be both entertaining and creative; others I found pointless. The longest one struck me as having gone nowhere. The last one simply reminded me that I am far from fluent in French. While I am honestly looking forward to reading Wilson's TO THE FINLAND STATION, I must confess that I have no desire to tackle another fictional work by him, and I am left wondering if Nabokov's generous remarks about MEMOIRS stemmed more from his personal friendship with Wilson than from his honest evaluation as a professional writer."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"On Christmas Day 2001 I was in San Francisco when I began reading this literary collection of six interrelated novelettes. I learned of the book while reading 'THE SCARLET PROFESSOR--Arvin Newton'. I was anxious to read it because the book was banned in 1947 because of its heatedly debated subject matter of descriptive sex, adultery, venereal disease and a mixture of the upper and lower class values of the time. My dear friend, Gloria Weiner-Freiman-Cohen, would surprise me with the gift of this book. While I was pleasantly surprised the author, Edmund Wilson, has encouraged me to write in my journal again as he did nightly in his 'Wilson's Night Thoughts'--(everyone has NIGHT THOUGHTS, right?). I'm sure that is an interesting book as well. This book is written in a very 'twenties style' of literary competence that I truly love. It just sweeps me back to the beauty of words that are often not used in this manner today. I liked the following lines from the book:-Right is right and wrong is wrong and you have to choose between them!-...it's the dead...that give life its price, its importance. You feel them under the ground just lying there and never moving.-Every work of art is a trick by which the artist manipulates appearances so as to put over the illusion that experience has some sort of harmony and order and to make us forget that it's impossible to pluck billard-balls out of the air. ...he had been spurred by no need to make money.-The only things that were fresh in the streets were the headlines--new words--on the newsstands, and most of these announced dismal events.-They didn't worry about their social position because the life that an artist leads is outside all the social positions. The artist makes his own position, which is about the nearest thing you can get to being above the classes.-He really needs somebody to hold his hand!-...it was all on the kindergarten level."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book, mostly because Frederick Exley had sung its praises in his writing, and because it is Wilson's favorite among his works. And his works are no minor achievement, including among them some truly brilliant essays and nonfiction. He was perhaps the leading American critic of his time, and a well-known personality. So given that, I have to see this mixed bag of fiction (and possibly fictionalized memoir) as something of a disappointment.This book contains 5 short stories - some of them fairly long ones, and a short novel. The stories wander thru a range of situations and are quite different from one another. There are a few threads that keep them together, although they don't really seem to be enough. There is the author's cool, refined, intelligent voice, which hints at hidden reserves of passion and humor. There is his tendency, at least from today's perspective, to go on long-windedly after the point has been made. There is also the setting - among the well-tod-do of a fictional upstate New York region. But there is so much variation here that the gambit seems unnecessary.\\"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\\" is funny and entertaining, and had me wondering if this book was going to be full of this kind of enjoyable stuff - but this was not to be. The most interesting story in the bunch followed: \\"Ellen Terhune\\", about a man who goes to visit a female friend, and each time he visits her house, the clock has moved back another decade, and that decade's family situation is then presented to him. This was a terrific literary Twilight Zonesque piece, and made me look forward to more in this vein - but this too was not forthcoming. \\"Glimpses of Wilbur Flick\\" is a cross between social criticism and absurd humor, about a rich man whose useless life becomes ever more strange until he becomes an alcoholic magician. \\"The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul\\" seems focused on gossip and criticism about the publishing world, and could be of great interest to those who are fascinated with the publishing business of the 1930s and 1940s. \\"Mr. And Mrs. at Home\\" is another surreal piece, and at times it is quite mysterious. But it does not have the benefit of a coherent plot and the divergences into French and other languages had me skipping pages to get to the end. The novella is entitled \\"The Princess with the Golden Hair\\". Despite its length, it somehow reads like a very long short story and does not really develop into a novelistic work. This concerns a well-heeled but callow 30ish intellectual who becomes involved with two women. One, the beauty of the title, is the wife of a friend, and the protagonist pursues her with great fervency and slyness for a long, and seemingly hopeless, period. He also becomes involved with a lower class, part-Ukrainian girl. The narrator marvels at the exotic horrors of her rough and tumble life, and tries to help her and love her as much as he can, but the boundaries of class and taste seem to prohibit him from really going for her.In summary, this is a grab bag of pieces that does contain some interesting writing but did not hold my interest throughout."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"I admire Wilson's essays and criticism and was curious to see what he attempted, and accomplished, in this, one of his few forays into fiction. I also was curious to see what passed for \\"obscenity\\" in the late forties, when the author and publisher were successfully prosecuted and the book withdrawn from publication in the US for about 10 years. I did wonder if, some sixty years on, I would even notice the \\"objectionable\\" content.AS to the second issue, the book is comprised of 6 loosely related stories, all told by the same narrator in the first person, and all touching upon his life between NYC and the suburban community of Hecate County. The only really \\"objectionable\\" story is the fourth, by far the longest, and the centerpiece of the collection, \\"The Princess with the Golden Hair.\\" And yes, I did notice the \\"objectionable\\" passages, but (for good or ill) they all seem rather tame by today's standards: in general, the narrator, a relatively young man working on a book on art and politics, pursues a fairly active sex life, has three or four affairs that are recounted in varying degrees of detail, contracts a STD, describes the genitalia of one his assignations in detail more poetic than graphic, and mentions his skill in arousing one woman by the manipulation of her breasts. There is a bit more, and there is some sexual content in the final story, \\"Mr and Mrs Blackburn at Home,\\" but overall, this isn't a book you would turn to for titillation. Outside of these details, the \\"obscenity\\" probably lay as much in the narrator's commitment to his sex life, which may have seemed at the time an \\"obsession\\" of unhealthy proportions. I don't think it seems so today. Rather, the narrator seems to us a relatively normal, if amorous, callow and amoral young man. Further, regardless of the overall success of the \\"Princess\\" story, his affairs explain a great deal about the narrator's character and are an integral part of the story. (I believe somewhere Wilson stated he was interested in showing \\"sex\\" as a natural function of personality.) More specifically, the \\"Princess\\" stands for a kind of chivalric ideal--she is married to another man and, for the longest time, conducts a more or less platonic relationship with our narrator, who pines after her in rather typically chivalric manner (even befriending her husband), only to find that his attraction is lessened, if not destroyed, when he actually possesses her and discovers that the back problems of which she complains may be psychosomatic rather than physical. As to his other primary interest, Anna, she is the daughter of eastern European immigrants and appeals to the narrator in large part as a representative of the proletariat, which reinforces the narrator's rather vague Marxist convictions. All in all, it is interesting to see what constituted \\"obscenity\\" in the late forties, but I couldn't recommend the book on that count alone.As to the stories, well, they are a varied lot. The first three are the most successful, but none actually aims that high. \\"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\\" is more in the line of an engaging fable about the conflict of aesthetics and capitalism in a rather peculiar member of the country bourgeoisie. It is nicely done. \\"Ellen Terhune\\" is in the line of a ghost story that also is reasonably accomplished, but it seems as if Wilson might have made a bit more of it. \\"Glimpses of Wilbur Flick\\" is an amusing portrait of a spoiled, directionless and changeable would-be American aristocrat who begins with the politics that the lower classes should, by and large, be taken out and dumped at sea, ends by championing his new wife's communism, and finds his greatest fulfillment in practicing magic tricks.The book probably stands or falls with the \\"Princess\\" story, which takes up fully half the book. This story has some of the finest writing in the book, including a particularly memorable description of the narrator crossing a bridge out of NYC into the \\"hinterland.\\" It also is a pretty decent piece of realistic fiction depicting a modern young man in that milieu. Still, we never quite engage with the narrator (as perhaps we are not supposed to), who seems in the end confused and rather shallow, and for all of its fine detail and description, it is hard not to find the story unrewarding.The final two pieces didn't engage me. \\"The Mulhollands\\" is an extended satiric piece that some have valued for its critique of the publishing world. \\"Mr and Mrs Blackburn,\\" seems something of an overview of the social world of the suburbs and includes the famous 10 pages of French dialogue, mostly about politics, art, the coming of Hitler, etc.All in all, if you are interested in Wilson, the book is worth reading. However, I was disappointed. At best, some of the stories were well done, the stories attempt to seriously address issues of art and politics, and I can see that the book opened the way for other writers like Updike and even Cheever to treat American life and sexual relations in a realistic, and sometimes fantastic, manner. All told, however, it seems a good thing that Wilson devoted himself primarily to essays and criticism, and I can't agree that this is a forgotten or lost \\"classic\\" of American literature."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Hecate County","review":"Edmund Wilson is one of the great literary and social critics of the 20th century. This collection, largely forgotten in his voluminous interpretive texts, is a group of 6 interrelated stories which explore aspects of contemporary society (published in 1946). Wilson's keen analytical mind, gives these tales a penetrating, still relevant, perspective. The venue is upscale Hecate County, New York (Hecate is the Queen of Witches), built of marriages of form, and a social life of formalities. Passion, here, swirls in a cauldron of manners. The matriarchal community is dominated by a self involved, status-seeking, unsatisfied type of woman. These are stories of intrigue, even bewitchment, bound by strictures of guilt or conformity. Pathos mingles with humour and observation to produce a sharp relief of the cultural terrain. His methods include both biting satire and tantalizing insights of intimacy. The elliptical conversations provide a platform for far ranging, not so subtle social criticism. The women are weavers of charms. They form only a spectral presence in some of the stories, but are always a catalyst in the vaguely destructive relationships. In the most ambitious story, Princess With the Golden Hair, oblique sensual imagery imbues an erotic undertone; sexuality itself is portrayed in morally ambiguous, layered contradictions. Wilson is examining conventions which bind people in structures sapped of meaning, while confessing subliminally the need for standards-- and for love. In this way the book reflects both the mid century suburban angst and the more persistent predicaments of the heart."},{"Title":"Whitewash: Pablo Escobar and the Cocaine Wars","review":"The price of this book on the secondary market has sky rocketed this year to its current level, $937.10.

Grehan, Michael J. Heads, Robin C. CrawLong after the Middle Ages a certain Equivalence of knighthood and a Doctor's degree was generally Acknowledged...For the history of Civilization the perennial dream of a Sublime life has the value of a very Important reality.Huizinga, J. - The Waning of the Middle Ages, 1924 - quoted on the front page of Space, Time, Form: The Biological Synthesis, by Leon Croizat, 1962.Like righteous knights, the authors of Panbiogeography are on a quest to save the discipline of panbiogeography: to bring it out from relative obscurity into the modern world of biogeography. Christened by Leon Croizat in the 1958, panbiogeography uses the geographic distribution of all biota, from plants to insects to vertebrates, to create hypotheses for historical biogeographic patterns. By a system of &quot;tracks&quot;, &quot;nodes&quot;, &quot;main massings&quot;, and &quot;baselines&quot;, Croizat and his followers mapped disjunct distributions and used correlations to define historical ranges. Largely due to his abject rejection of dispersal as a mechanism for vicariant patterns of biota, Croizat's theories were discounted as extreme (Cox, 1999). The main tool of panbiogeographers is the &quot;track&quot;, a line drawn on a map that links localities of a taxa. The &quot;track&quot; represents a hypothesis of previous geographic connection. Although Panbiogeography is full of many examples of tracks drawn on maps, some issues are left unclear. For instance, what taxonomic level should tracks connect? The taxa selected in this book appear arbitrary; they use both taxa with similar generic and familiar relations in order to draw tracks. Furthermore, how discrete is the geographic region described by the points at the end of a track? The scale of tracks vary from continental to discrete local scales. On the other hand, the authors illustrate that the track may function well as a heuristic device, simply drawing a line on a map may represent the possible relationship between biota between two geographic areas. Grehan and Craw, as proponents of this concept appear to believe that these tracks and especially those tracks of many taxa over-layed, called &quot;generalized tracts&quot;, represent vicariant events, rather than simply dispersal of individuals and subsequent speciation. Although this issue was contentious in the 1970's (Dipersalists vs. Vicariants), this book fails to bridge the gap between these two views. Instead, while claiming to recognize the importance of both forces, it simply reiterates the vicariant viewpoint.Grehan and Craw attempt to revitalize the discipline of panbiogeography by incorporating cladistical analysis. The book is full of case studies of suggestive corroboration of phylogenetic systematics with previous hypotheses postulated by Croizat and earlier vicariant biogeographers. Although these examples span various phyla, they generally emphasize morphological systematics. In order to support the claims of vicariant biogeographic patterns, the book would benefit from additional examples of recent molecular systematic findings.Throughout the book, many examples of faunal and floral disjunctions are correlated with geological (i.e. tectonic) patterns. It is postulated that geological events have caused vicariant distributions. Although compelling in the sense that this represents a mechanism for the patterns of disjunct biota, inferring that this is the only mechanism is nonsensical. Dispersal may function as an equally important factor in distribution. Even so, the emphasis on locality, on where an animal is found, is one of the main strengths of this book: on some level, systematics should take geography in to account in order to determine phylogeny.Panbiogeography is written purportedly to assist in the understanding of this discipline. Even so, the language is opaque and appears purposefully inaccessible. Furthermore, the authors could improve understanding by clearly defining and illustrating the concepts and methodology in the beginning of the book; it is in the 5th chapter that the authors approach the methodology of this approach.True to the very nature of panbiogeography, Panbiogeography gives examples of disjunct distributions for varied species from cotton, to starlings, to weevils. While this a data appears to be well researched, the conclusions drawn are not evident. Conclusions are made from correlations. While hypotheses are clearly stated, they are not tested, only corroborated. Comparative evidence alone is insufficient to evaluate a hypothesis. While this style often broaches upon a rant, these case studies are not uninteresting. Demonstrating that dissimilar fauna and flora have similar vicariant distributions, is inherently interesting. Unfortunately, it is difficult to disentangle any bias from selection of fauna and flora.Finally, while Grehan and Craw imply that they encourage others to use panbiogeography, they have not made this easy. The greatest disappointment in this book is that the authors do not explicitly present their methodology. The maps, adorned with crossing lines and circled regions, appear arbitrary constructions instead of the well-honed result of careful and discerning research. One is left with the impression that one needs faith in order to use this method - much like the mythic knights of the middle ages on a religious quest to obtain the holy grail.Cox,B. 1998. From generalized tracks to ocean basins - how useful is Panbiogeography? J. Biogeog., 25:813-828."},{"Title":"Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life (Oxford Biogeography Series)","review":"As in most fields in the natural sciences, prevailing approaches and the dominant paradigms in the field of biogeography have shifted radically, and back again, in the century or more of its existence. Judging by the material presented in recent biogeography textbooks, for example, Cox and Moore's (1993) Biogeography, An Ecological and Evolutionary Approach, and Brown and Lomolino's (1998) Biogeography, biogeographers generally recognize the value and strengths of using several different approaches to forming biogeographical hypotheses and evaluating them. The panbiogeography approach, although never widely accepted as a primary approach, is always addressed and given fair credence. Craw, Grehan and Heads, in their new book Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life (1999), uniquely attempt to postulate the panbiogeographical approach as the only real &quot;correct&quot; approach to biographical analysis, and in doing so, take a stand that is contrary to biogeography's pattern heretofore. Panbiogeography was originally proposed by Croizat in the 1950s as a method that emphasizes the primacy of spatial analysis of the distribution of taxa, in preference to historical or systematic hypotheses or understanding of taxonomic relationships. Due in part to the timing of Croizat's treatises which came out prior to the proposal and general acceptance of plate tectonic theory, the approach generated great controversy among biogeographers. Essentially Croizat was proposing a method that could generate hypotheses that no known mechanism could explain. The approach fell further out of favor after plate tectonics was accepted because of Croizat's singular unwillingness to accept it as a viable mechanism. Panbiogeography takes the following basic approach. Using databases containing distributions of taxa, panbiogeographers identify tracks (lines that connect related taxa), nodes (points of intersection of tracks), generalized tracks (locations where many tracks overlap spatially), and baselines (locations where tracks cross major geological or geomorphic features, usually oceans). Using these devices as heuristics, hypotheses are then generated regarding the historical, phylogenetic, ecological or other relationships among the taxa examined. Cox and Moore criticize the approach by saying that the technique stops there and does not go back and incorporate known taxonomic history, geology, or other information that is not exclusively spatial. However, it is not clear that this was the initial intent of the approach. Craw et al. do not propose an essentially different definition for panbiogeography, and their basic premise is perhaps useful and insightful. However, they have chosen to take a rather defensive position in presumed anticipation of an attack against the approach based on historic biases. For this reason, readers are forced to wade through a rather dense display of repetitively overstated points in order to glean the useful messages in the book. The authors explain the concepts initiated by Croizat, those described above, with sufficient detail to allow the uninitiated to attempt the approach. They provide a number of detailed case examples to which they apply these methods that result in a large number of images and graphical representations of the kinds of heuristic devices the methods may produce. In addition, they rightfully point out some weaknesses in the extensive dependency of some biogeographical approaches on other unproven data compilations, such as geomorphological, systematic, and historical hypotheses, in that using these hypotheses as &quot;data&quot; necessarily compound any error in data analysis. The fundamental message of their treatise is that spatial data alone are sufficient, and can be used operationally, to generate biogeographical hypotheses separate from any other kind of pattern analysis. Furthermore, the generation of biogeographical hypotheses by this method can then inform other pattern analysis approaches, such as phylogenetics, in an unbiased and uncircular fashion. These notions are valuable statements to be made about approaches to biogeography. This reviewer feels that these points could have been made in a short article, without the attempts that seem to have been made to discredit other biogeographical approaches. In including extensive statement of how this approach improves on other methods, the authors often seem to contradict themselves and generally state that the methods of panbiogeography can achieve what it is not clear that it can. For example, the authors initially name what they describe as the three main schools of biogeographical thought: faunal regions or centers of origin, vicariance and cladistics, and island biogeography. However, they never revisit these categories per se. They proceed to explicitly compare only dispersalist and vicariance approaches to biogeography. Further, the description of dispersalist hypotheses concludes with a rather heavy handed dismissal of the mechanism altogether. They propose that panbiogeography can resolve the &quot;vicariance/dispersalist dilemma&quot; with a proper understanding of what they term &quot;mobilist&quot; and &quot;immobilist&quot; phases, which seem to amount to the proposal that dispersal is never a significant mechanism in biogeography but that it all comes down to vicariance. In a later chapter, they explain the details of using a cladistic approach to understand vicariance in biogeographical distributions, which is a method that is well accepted and not novel in biogeography today. The claim that this approach is a subset of panbiogeography, and one of many unbiased advantages of the school of thought in general. However, they fail to offer other examples of approaches. Similarly, authors emphasize that the panbiogeographical approach is a hypotheses testing approach, which is unique among biogeographical approaches. This point is labored in many chapters under many headings, and yet they fail to offer an operational approach to testing a single hypothesis generated by the methods they describe. Overall, the thesis of this book is potentially useful to biographers in general. Additionally, many of the details of the panbiographical method are explained in such a way that new users may derive some utility from them. But overall, the excessive verbiage, defensive tone, and contradictory statements make the book less than &quot;required reading&quot; for biogeographers."},{"Title":"Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life (Oxford Biogeography Series)","review":"Do you know a genius when you see one? Of course: geniuses are disheveled, eccentric men who shun the world while quietly hatching ideas of global consequence, or so most of us believe. Hence the reverence for the scraggly, hoary image of Einstein, even though it was the younger, attractive man who sat in the patent office and hashed out relativity. Consider Leon Croizat, polyglot recluse biogeographer, who spent most of his life in self-imposed academic exile in Venezuela, turning piles of often erroneous distribution maps into frightful tomes with titles like Space, Time, Form: The Biological Synthesis (1). Croizat was one of a handful of scientists in the 1970's who helped to turn the tide in biogeography, away from anecdotal natural history, to quantitative and reproducible methods (2). However, for the past two decades, most biogeographers have been content to give him that much credit and have not looked much further into his work. The authors of Panbiogeography do go further, and make a case for the revival of Croizat's peculiar methods. Croizat's major innovation was to compare the distributions of a variety of species, regardless of their individual ages or dispersal abilities. He connected species occurrences on a map with lines that he called tracks, and then overlaid the tracks from multiple species. When enough overlaid tracks lined up, Croizat called the resulting pattern a generalized track, and deduced from it information about the ancient distribution of the biota that is now seen in fragments. When Croizat found fragments to be separated widely geographically, he placed a &quot;baseline&quot; in the intervening space, which identified a major event in Earth history that caused the disjunction of the groups. If, for example, large areas of diversity (called &quot;main massings&quot;) of a particular organism are found in Western Africa and South America, we can place a baseline in the South Atlantic, and conclude that it was that ocean that split the groups. Grehan et. al use Croizat's methodology to examine a number of problems in biogeography, and they choose some intriguing case studies. For example, they perform an in-depth treatment of the current and ancient biota of Africa, showing that many current communities spread across the globe are actually the remains of an ancient unified community that was altered by changing climate and geology. The effect of the shifting environment is nicely visualized with tracks drawn between the far-ranging communities. However, the authors consistently fail to let us in on the specific methods that they use to create their maps and tracks. Why are some tracks laid one way and not another? At times it seems that all points of occurrence should be connected with so-called &quot;minimum spanning trees,&quot; while, at other times, tracks seem to be drawn solely in accord with a hypothesis of vicariance. Mysterious references are made to graph theory, but the use of sophisticated mathematics is never made clear. A lack of explicit methodology gets to the heart of the book's main flaw. The authors claim that panbiogeography is a rigorous and quantifiable approach to understanding the distributions of organisms, yet we are never shown that panbiogeography, as a research program, is able to produce a testable hypotheses. One of the main features of this new science is the baseline, which identifies an important, vicariant geographical feature. That feature is identified a priori as important, so we then have a baseline and some evidence of distribution on either side of the baseline. Should we then test the validity of that baseline assumption? Should we look at individual occurrences to see if they support the baseline? If so, the authors of Panbiogeography give us no clue as to how that would be done. A lack of rigor in explaining their methodology might be more forgivable if the authors came to some conclusions that we might imagine were unique products of panbiogeography. They claim that the use of baselines should force us to reorganize our view of the world's biogeographic realms into a map of ocean basins, since those basins represent the most significant geographic events in the history of speciation on Earth. They also use tracks and baselines to make a case for the Western United States being the product of a myriad of tectonic rafts that smashed into the west coast, possibly introducing new organisms with each raft. The west coast idea is not new, and the ocean basin idea could have been conceived using a knowledge of Earth's history, with no tracks or baselines in sight. One reason that Croizats' work was revolutionary was that it was independent of natural history, and all the ambiguities that it can contain. A knowledge of peculiar species biology is not needed to draw tracks. For better or worse, natural history no longer dominates the biological sciences, so it is hard to imagine that Grehan et al. see their primary contribution to their field as being one of precision. However, it is equally hard to imagine exactly what they might suppose their greatest contribution to be. If they have something in mind, they do not make it obvious in Panbiogeography.References 1.

The language is both elevated (in the style of classic tragedy) and immediate in its emotional impact."},{"Title":"Trojan women (The Plays of Euripides)","review":"About 416 B.C. the island of Melos refused to aid Athens in the war against Sparta. The Athenians then slaughtered the men and enslaved the women and children, an atrocity never before inflicted on one Greek city-state by another. As preparations were made for the ruinous expedition against Syracuse, Euripides wrote &quot;The Trojan Women,&quot; as a plea for peace. Consequently there is a strong rhetorical dimension to the play, which prophesies that a Greek force would sail across the sea after violating victims and meet with disaster. However, there the play also has a strong literary consideration in that the four Trojan Women--Hecuba, Queen of Troy; Cassandra, daughter of Hecuba and Priestess of Apollo; Andromache, widow of Hector; and Helen--all appear in the final chapter of Homer's epic poem the &quot;Iliad,&quot; mourning over the corpse of Hector, retrieved by his father Priam from the camp of the Acheans. Whenever I have use &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; in class I have always used at least that last chapter of Homer to set up the play.As with his last play &quot;Iphigenia at Aulis,&quot; which tells of the events right before the Achean army left for Troy, &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; reflects the cynicism of Euripides. Of all the Achean leaders we hear about in Homer, only Menelaus, husband of Helen, appears. He appears, ready to slay Helen for having abandoned him to run off to Troy with Paris, but we see his anger melt before her beauty and soothing tones. In this play the Greeks do more than enslave women: they have already slain a young girl as a sacrifice to the ghost of Achilles and they take Astyanax, the son of Hector, out of the arms of his mother so that he can be thrown from the walls of Troy. Even the herald of the Greeks, Talthybius, cannot stomach the policies of his people. The play also reminds us that Helen was a most unpopular figure amongst the ancient Greeks, and there is no satisfaction in her saving her life (Note: you might want to check out Isocrates's &quot;Encomium on Helen,&quot; an exhibition speech in which he shows off his talent by defending the hated woman). The idea that all of these men died just so that she could be returned to the side of her husband is an utter mockery of the dead. This translation by Nicholas Rudall focuses on the performance of &quot;The Trojan Women,&quot; but it is certainly useful for those interested in the historical or literary aspects of the play as well. Another interesting analogy is to use this play in conjunction with &quot;Lysistrata&quot; by Aristophanes, so that students can compare and contrast an anti-war comedy and drama."},{"Title":"Trojan women (The Plays of Euripides)","review":"Edith Hamilton, in The Greek Way, says that \\"Euripides is the saddest of the poets\\" and that \\"no poet's ear has ever been so sensitively attuned as his to the still, sad music of humanity.\\" The Trojan Women, a heart-rending read, certainly supports these opinions.Written in Athens in 415 B.C. in the throes of the ruinous Peloponnesian War, the play was a condemnatory response to the recent Athenian atrocities against the neutral Greek island of Melos. After taking the island, the Athenians executed all the men and enslaved the women and children. It was an end of innocence of sorts for the city that had long considered itself the world's citadel of what we now call civilization and culture. In criticizing it, Euripides reached back to the central event of the Greek epic heritage, the legendary victory over Troy, for his setting and characters.The resulting tragedy opens in the aftermath of the slaughter of the Trojan men, with Troy in flames and the women being divvied up as slaves to the conquering Greeks. Euripides is unflinching in his depiction of the inhumanities visited upon the vanquished. King Priam's daughter, Cassandra, is raped by Agamemnon, king of the Greeks. His other daughter Polyxena is cruelly murdered. In one of the most moving scenes in all of literature, his grandson Astyanax, a young child and the only surviving heir to the Trojan throne, is taken from his mother Andromache's grieving embrace and thrown to his death from the highest wall of the city. In fact, the only pity and decency presented among the Greeks is found in the Greek messenger Talthybius, who cleans the body of Astyanax and brings it to his grandmother Hecuba after Andromache's pleading to bury him is denied as she is taken away to her fate as a Greek slave.Many have read this work as a blanket indictment of war. I read it as a misanthropic perspective on human nature, with its glimmers of what we call humanity intersticed between the harsh reality of our cruelty, hatred and violence, a reality set free within the lawless terrain of war. Those with a rosy view of our genetic inheritance should generally be given fair warning before engaging the works of Euripides, and The Trojan Women is no different. That said, whatever one's views of our species, this is one of its finer artifacts and it deserves a wide reading despite the passage of over 2,400 years."},{"Title":"Trojan women (The Plays of Euripides)","review":"Nicholas Rudall's Euripides' The Trojan Women: Plays For Performance provides a new translation of a literary classic of pathos and war, capturing the classical drama in a new form designed as a play for performing to modern audiences.

This is also a love story about Adam Rutledge and his neighbor, Mary Warden, who keeps her love secret from most people, as Adam keeps it secret for a long time even from himself, because of Adam's loyalty to his invalid wife and Mary's to the much older husband she married--apparently in name only--before meeting Adam. Adam and Mary's story, the early subplot involvign the Regulator movement that draws Adam into politics by giving him a specific group of people's problems to care about (a group that Fletcher deals with in _The Wind in the Forest_, where Adam and Mary make appearances), and the author's careful attention to details that appeal to the reader's senses, all kept me reading long stretches of this novel, sometimes when I knew that I should be reading other things for my college classes; it was only with difficulty that I made myself postpone reading the second half until catching up on class reading.

Betsy is tricked into believing she's married to Vic when the phony preacher promises to fill out the license paperwork and mail it to them later; in #7 The Reluctant Bridegroom, Rebekah finds out her husband already has a wife (and later marries Sky Winslow); and in #19 The Iron Lady, Rebekah and Sky's granddaughter Priscilla makes the exact same mistake!

I have always felt a strong affinity for this book since it was born the same year (1955) that I was. Some years back, when I was first consumed by an overwhelming interest in the Custer mystery (a passion that continues till this day), it was, fortuantely, one of the first books I turned to.Yes, numerous books and sources have come along since then and it can not incorporate the recent archaeological findings but it still gives the reader a good basic framework for studying the battle. Stewart is a judicious historian, using footnotes to bring out areas where sources conflict. His critique of Custer is, for the most part, balanced. Most importantly, Stewart's writing style is uncommonly smooth and pleasing. Just pick up a copy of this book and plunge in anywhere and you will readily discover what I mean. It is very accessible.Stewart makes one very important point in analyzing the Little Big Horn, a point that has stood and will continue to stand the test of time. He states that, more than any factor, the terrain played a decisive part in the outcome of the battle, as it hindered the 7th Cavalry batallions from readily knowing what was happening elsewhere on the field of conflict. Keep this basic observation in mind when visiting the battlefield and viewing the bluffs along the river."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"George Armstrong Custer has been referred to as the most famous American soldier. Nothing fans the light of fame like death in a spectacular manner. Custer was well known before he died, but when his death was announced just as the nation was about to celebrate its Centennial birthday, he soared into immortality. History has not always been kind to him, but whether seen as a glory-seeking fool or as a gallant trooper doing his job, Custer has never wanted for attention.This book, Custer's Luck, was first published in 1955. The author, Edgar Stewart, was well qualified to write it. Before gaining a professorship at Eastern Washington College, he had worked as an historical aide on the Crow Agency at the Custer Battlefield National Monument, where he had the opportunity to walk the ground and study all the documentation then available. With that knowledge he could provide insights that few others had the vantage point to then recognize.Much has been written about Custer and the Little Big Horn in the ensuing fifty years. Evan Connell and Robert Utley have both produced excellent biographies of Custer. Utley, Richard Fox and Robert Kammen have all produced excellent studies of the campaign told from an Indian perspective. John Gray's two books, Centennial Campaign, and Custer's Last Campaign: Mitch Boyer and the Little Bighorn Reconsidered, are now thought of as the seminal studies of Custer's role in the Sioux War. However, Stewart's older account still has value. A great part of this book is devoted to explaining the underlying situation: the Treaty of 1868, the impeachment of Secretary of War Belknap, and the battles and massacres that led up to the march to the Little Bighorn. Only about 130 pages of this 500-page book are devoted to the march of the Dakota column and Custer's last fight. So if you want to learn the background, and to read an account of the fight that is factual, concise and unbiased, if a bit dated, this book will be a fine purchase."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"If you are going to read one book about the time of the Custer battle at the LittleBig Horn river this is the book. It covers all aspects of the time leading up to the battle, with narrative from other books that have been written. I have read many books about this time and place and after reading this book I wish I had read it first as it would have removed the need of reading all the others. Covers all aspects including the indian's side of things."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"If only one book were to be read on Custer and the Little Big Horn, this one would be mandatory."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"This book is 55 years old now but is still a classic in particular providing a thorough history of the factors that lead the Lakota conflict that reached back to Red Cloud's War, the economic political reasons for the taking of the Black Hills, the Belknap Affair that consumed Custer and the later third of the book focuses n the LBH. Stewart provides a detailed narrative on the columns approaching the LBH and then launches detail on the 7th's attack that includes a decent balance including the Native American's point of view. Of special note, Stewart recognizes that all the columns were more concerned that the Indians would scatter and although the survivors generally point to the native scouts complaining of the size of the Indian camp, interpreter Fred Gerard called out \\"Here are your Indians General, running like devils!\\" as a small group fled from Lone Tepee. Stewart also recognized command issues particularly Benteen who seemed to delay his support, the questions of Reno's performance including his bug out of the valley, he addresses the theory that the 1873 springfield''s fouled, Stewart he clears up the controversy about Curley, he observes that Custer's marches were not over taxing as the Gibbon column marched 29 miles in one day, the Gatling guns couldn't keep up with the infantry, and that the Indians has some modern weaponry long before archeology of the 1980s discovered Henrys and Winchesters. Stewart also offers a broad look at what happened to Custer, including Indians who thought he was killed at the ford and provides first hand views as to what survivors thought occurred. Still a good read on this complex and mystifying subject that owes a lot of the defeat of the 7th on the strength and coordinated efforts of the Indians, command dysfunctions of the 7th, failed actions by Gibbon, Crooks leaving the field, changed circumstances that forced Custer to attack early and a genuine over optimism by all commands that the Indians would scatter."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"This is an excellent study of exactly who Custer was fighting that Day of Little Big Horn battle. The exact numbers involved are still undecided and unknown. The Indians did not keep a count of occupants fo various teepees or wickiups. Their numbers were always guesses, and so are the numbers presented by various white survivors, or even those coming in afterward to study the grounds. Altogether, this book gives many opinions which have been well researched, and well presented so that the student of the battle can decide which \\"facts\\" are indeed most believeable."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"Interesting, detailed account of one of the Native Americans last and greatest stands against thoes taking there country from their people.

This is a narrative rather than an analytical biography, and the author does not pay much attention to the military events Baker is involved in. elephant hunting in Ceylon seems to get more coverage than the Tchernaya River, for instance. At one point in the chapter on the Crimea she mentions that Baker is attached to the French cavalry on its approach to the Tchernaya; a bit later she mentions that the cavalry had been mishandled there, and later still mentions that there had been a battle at the Tchernaya! However, she does pay great attention to Baker's early career as an innovator in the British cavalry, adapting Nolan's principles and developing them further in his own book, introducing them into his own regiment's training, eventually being introduced throughout the army.This is a readable book, and there isn't much else on the subject."},{"Title":"A Question of Honour: The Life Of Lieutenant General Valentine Baker Pasha","review":"This fascinating little book tells the life of Valentine Baker, once British General but exiled into the service of the Turkish and Egyptian governments. The story of Baker's family (his brother Samual was a famous African explorer) and his own personal travails is told against a backdrop of life in the British Army from the Crimea to Khartoum. Readers of other works on the individual battles will the find the whole story told here with a unique sense of continuity. The various adventures of British forces in the Crimea, Turkey and Egypt were not unrelated events but part of a foreign policy as complex and tortured as our own today.Baker's own personal story is also fascinating, and his interaction with other famous figures of the time (the Prince of Wales, General Wolseley, Gordon, Gladstone, etc.) shows them in a very revealing light. Their relationship with Baker reveals their personal side, something lacking in most history books.The only unfortunate thing about the book is that the author does not identify her relationship with the Baker family. One assumes she is somehow related to the subject of the book, based on it's dedication to her husband &quot;Valentine Edward Baker&quot;. It would help to put the tale in perspective if we knew a bit more about her point of view."},{"Title":"A Question of Honour: The Life Of Lieutenant General Valentine Baker Pasha","review":"the authour appears to be a distant relative of the subject of this book.

Even if you use this book for a single trip, it will pay for itself by rewarding you with charming towns, and some places that are pretty bland, but accompanied by rolling hills and splendid vistas around every turn."},{"Title":"The Oxford Dictionary of Civil War Quotations","review":"I like to read the books we are selling and am so glad I picked this one up. It is organized well, has a huge range of sources and draws from every imaginable socio-economic level for the quotes.

My plan was to spice up Foote's already excellent narrative by looking up quotes in the Oxford book from the personalities in the chapter I happened to be reading in the Foote book. In this way I would get more insight into these persons.But this idea didn't work out well. Often the general I was inspired to find out more about in Foote's book had either no quotations at all in the Quotation Dictionary or the quotations that were there offered little insight into the person who said it.On the other hand, there were many interesting quotes by Lincoln, but not enough to make up for my disappointment about generals' quotations.Just my two-cents worth."},{"Title":"History of Darius the Great (Altemus' young people's library)","review":"This is a well written book of Darius. The author has taken great pains to make it easily read by the young adult history buff. I was hoping for a more in-depth type of reading. Mr. Abbott has covered all the major occurrences in Darius life, but I was hoping for a more depth, and analytical approach to this great leader of the Persian's. Darius was placed into power in very unique way, and his power play on the seating King was also a major move also.

Now she is back in her hometown living with her boyfriend, Paul van Wagoner. Suspicious fires have been breaking out. A third fire has a fatality and the prime suspect is Wish Whitefeather, Wish happens to be Nina's secretary, Sandy's son. Nina and Paul work together to clear Wish of the charges.I'm a big fan of Perri O'Shaungnessy's other Nina Reilly novels. I could barely get through this one. If I hadn't had so much time invested in it, I probably wouldn't have bothered to finish it. One problem with the book is the characters are not likable. Even Nina is whiny and rather annoying. It's a bad sign when a beloved main character becomes irritating. The secondary cast around whom the plot revolves is a pathetic bunch of people. I could not care one whit about any of them. The plot was boring which is a big offense in the thriller genre. Part of the book dealt with Nina's conflicted relationship with Paul. I don't she her able to share her life with anyone. She really doesn't know how to compromise, so I think she should just head back to Tahoe and hopefully come back in a better story."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I am so surprised to read the negative reviews of this book, because to my mind, the O'Shaugnessy sisters, having fallen into quite a slump, thoroughly redeemed themselveds with &quot;Presumption of Death.&quot;I found Nina Reilly's new venue (or old, depending on how much one has followed this character through the series) and new circumstances to be fascinating--I felt that a whole new burst of life had been injected into the series. Not only did I not find it boring, I zipped through the book in record time.Other reviewers have described the plot in detail...ominous forest fires, obviously the result of arson, are decimating the forests around the Carmel area--and young Wish Whitefeather, whom we have followed through all the books and brought to young adulthood, is arrested for setting the fires, with one count of murder to boot. It is up to Nina, who wanted nothing more than to take a hiatus from her career and explore her personal relationship with her lover and PI partner Paul, to take the case and save Wish from almost certain conviction.As Paul and Nina struggle to find a center to their relationship and to solve the increasingly thorny mystery of who really set the fires and why, a whole subcast of characters is explored. The end was sufficient enough for this reviewer to be on tenterhooks for the next book. I know this is not a popular point of view among other reviewers, and again, I don't know why. My reaction to this book was wholly positive, and I would definitely urge those who follow the series to read it.

After finishing that story, I went back to the beginning and have been reading straight through. It's sometimes been a bumpy journey, but I thought I was getting there till I read this one. Presumption of Death is set in Carmel Valley, CA, immediately after Nina has chosen to leave her growing practice in South Lake Tahoe to further her relationship with Paul van Wagoner. Before she has time even to take a breath she is embroiled in yet another mystery. This time the son of her unique secretary, Wish Whitefeather, is charged with murder. It seems that he was on a ridge marked for development, following the urging of a childhood friend, when someone started a fire. Wish disappears, only to show up later on Nina's/Paul's doorstep with obvious burns. Her desire to save her friend leads Nina to explore a neighborhood near the burned area. The obvious relationships between the residents hide a less-obvious secret that could have been a bombshell--if the writers had handled it properly. The biggest problem with the book is their penchant for introducing storylines that have potential but go nowhere. Elizabeth Gold, for example, has such potential, but she ends up becoming merely another lonely woman who finds love. I am sure the writers meant to send us chasing after snipes while they slipped in the real surprise. All they succeed in doing is making the story drag and ultimately frustrate us. When we find out the truth, our reaction is \\"so what?\\" This is decidedly NOT the reaction mystery writers are looking for. I think the first mistake the writers made was to gloss over the implications of Nina's decision to move. They want us to believe she is following her heart, but it's still a dumb decision. Bad for her. Bad for her secretary, Sandy. Bad for her son. To their credit, Nina shows signs of realizing what a controlling stud Paul is, a sexist who lives his life between his legs. Indeed, he seems to need leading by the hand to help solve this mystery. Perhaps they want us to identify with her, or at lest for the subjects of \\"Smart Women, Foolish Choices\\" to do so. I know some really dumb women, but I know a lot more smart ones. I wonder if the writers do. Oh, well, as my son says, pobody's nerfect. Maybe the next one will be better."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I enjoy watching the characters in books of this genre take new directions, it keeps readers on their toes.

I find that to be a very appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion PicturesCalifornia"},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"In Presumption of Death, the O'Shaughnessy sisters turn up the heat, both literally and figuratively, when Sandy Whitefeather's son, Wish, just barely escapes from an inferno, only to find himself charged with arson and murder. With the evidence mounting against Wish, Nina faces an uphill battle she must fight in geographically and socially unfamiliar territory.Nina's personal life is as fiery as the inexplicable conflagrations around Siesta Court, the scene of the crime. She can't decide how she feels about long-time friend and lover, Paul van Wagoner, she can't quite cope with son Bob's raging adolescene and she can't unravel the twisted threads of her own psyche. And yet, Nina manages to do what she does best: work the case.As noted by other reviewers, this novel IS different from the others in the series and I suspect that what may be so jarring for some readers is that Presumption of Death so successfully captures the true-to-life ebb and flow of a relationship (the petty annoyances, the inexplicable fears, etc.), the disorientation that arises when suddenly confronted with a &quot;foreign&quot; culture, and the pressure to meet the unreasonable demands of cherished friends.More than any other novel in this excellent mystery series, Presumption of Death is steeped in the idealogy and philosophy that is so quintessentially Californian and, at every turn in the story, its essence can be felt. In much the same way, the sisters masterfully evoke the desired reactions to the Siesta Court community by skillfully and unapologetically plunging the reader right into the midst of its swirling waters.For fans of the Nina Reilly mysteries, there is certainly enough of the familiar feel of the series to keep the reader comfortable . . . but it's the unexpected departures that give this book its distinctive, and - perhaps - more honest (if less comfortably predictable) flavor."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I agree with the reviewer who couldn't finish the book--also with the one who said there were too many characters. I found most of the characters boring, irrelevant, and I couldnt keep them straight nor did I care to. I have loved all the other Nina Reilly books and I missed the characters from Tahoe. Or perhaps I should say the characters as they were at Tahoe. Paul and Nina were indeed boring. Sandy was a different person altogether. Because I loved the other books so much, I was determined to finish this one. It became a chore. I ultimately skipped over a hundred pages and read the last ten or so. Didn't miss a thing, apparently. A real snoozer.

She moves out of her home on Lake Tahoe, rents out her law practice, and moves into Paul&#65533;s place in Carmel. Nina&#65533;s former assistant Sandi&#65533;s son Wish accompanies them because he is working during the summer for Paul in his private investigative business and is living in Nina&#65533;s rental home with two other young men.One night against his better judgment, Wish joins his friend up in the woods near the Siesta Court homes to catch and film an arsonist who has already set two fires. Things go terribly wrong and Wish&#65533;s friend dies. The arsonist injures Wish who is later arrested on an assortment of charges including homicide. It will take all of Nina&#65533;s considerable legal and investigative skills to get enough evidence to free a client she knows is innocent.PRESUMPTION OF DEATH is a very good and exciting legal thriller but also is so much more. Nina returns to the place of her childhood and realizes one can go home again. Readers see the relationship between Paul and Nina grow stronger and see through Nina&#65533;s eyes that she might have a long-term future with him, something he wants very badly. The story line has many twists and turns and it is only when the novel reaches the court phase that readers have a glimmer of what is really going on.

Salinas, the vegetable capitol of the world, is a diverse and wealthy community. Not at all as downtrodden as the sisters make it sound. And to say 'it was always a tense place' is ridiculous!It's hard to give credence to the credentials of a writer when the setting has been so badly botched. I think the sisters owe the residents of Salinas an apology. I also think the sisters owe their once legion of fans an apology for such a thin plot, filled with too many characters no one cares about, and a heroine that needs a reality check. Relationships are not perfect, and compromise goes a long way to work toward that goal...a trait Nina seems to be lacking. With so little compassion, I wouldn't hire her for an attorney!

But what really was disappointing about this book is the core characters you have come to know so well have also taken on a slightly different flavor, Nina and Paul are downright boring living together. This concept may have been more interesting under Nina's roof and on Nina's Tahoe turf, but the tension between them fizzled in Carmel to what I would call gratuitous sex scenes that came along at odd times like an afterthought. Other characters such as Sandy and Wish make cameo appearances for most of the book, and Nina's brother and sister-in-law are left out completely............Or perhaps not. I admit to having this book for three weeks now, fully intending to complete it the first day I purchased it, but found myself wandering away from it and only picking it back up in moments of complete boredom, so I'm about 3/4 of the way finished. We'll see, but so far yawn and huh?"},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I placed a preorder for this book as I have very much enjoyed all the previous ones by these authors. However this seemed completely different - turgid, boring. I found the characters too confusing, there waas little mystery and indeed little legal drama - many pages of complex subplot and descriptions of poison oak forest. Nina and Paul now both seem irritating and indeed irritated with each other.I didn't really complete it - got completely lost and baffled in the party scene and then skipped to the short courtroom sessions.I doubt if I will buy their next one - not without finding out if it is back on track."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I have been a huge fan of this series, so I bought the hardcover edition of this book with great confindence. All I can say is it is by far the worst in the series. It was so boring that it took me several weeks to finish it and it was a chore. I don't know what happened, but I am surprised because usually the plot is so great in these books. I usually adore Nina, but for some reason found myself being very irked by her. The mystery was idiotic and I found myself not caring about the outcome. The only redeeming part was the chapter about the &quot;party&quot; because it was so crazy. Keeping all the families straight in my mind was hard though because I did not care enough to put any real effort into it. I think one of the biggest drawbacks in this series is the fact that all of the interesting characters have died out. I hope the next book is better and we can get back to the real Nina."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"Many things about this book, I liked. Nina is one of the more interesting female protagonists in the legal thriller arena, with a good cast of supporting characters in teenage son Bob, P.I./love interest Paul, Legal Secretary/Native-American activist Sandy Whitefeather, etc. (too bad the the evil lawyer Jeff Reisner is gone by now . . . .)I liked the undercurrents of the complex relationships of the six neighbors in this book, who live near where a fire occurs that provides the story's setting. And Nina's feelings of restlessness and transition after leaving Lake Tahoe come across as authentic.But I had a hard time with the ultimate resolution of the crime in this one. Without giving away the ending, the &quot;perp&quot; struck me as a bit implausible, as I feel the criminal plot would have unraveled on it's own much earlier in the story, the way the author has set it up (I can't say more without giving away the ending).Overall, an entertaining &amp; well-written book; not the best in the series, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I usually enjoy reading these authors but with this book I stopped reading with about 30 pgs left. I just didn't care anymore."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"For me to throw a book into the trash, it has to be pretty bad. As others have said, all the characters were either annoying, incomprehensible, stereotyped or boring. The story jumped around so much that at one point when Nina thinks about Bob, I was totally mystified as to who he was, and went flipping back 50 pages or so, never finding a previous mention.I'd never read any of O'Shaughnessy's other books. I'm not sure I ever will. I was laid up with some post-surgery recovery, a captive audience, while reading this unremarkable story. Perhaps it was an anesthesia fog that allowed me to actually finish it before I tossed it out with the garbage."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I initially had a lot of trouble engaging with Presumption of Death. It felt slow, and the characters did not seem very interesting at first glance. (This was my first Nina Reilly book) It took me until around Part Two in the book to really warm up to this story of arson and murder.In the end, however, I liked the book. I wound up staying up far too late in order to finish it. Nina and Paul are possibly a little bit off-putting at first, but I tend to think that this may be because a nice dose of realism in their characters. Real life and real relationships are often just that prickly. I have to admire the solid skill with which these people were constructed. I'm excepting the character of Elizabeth in this praise. She alone felt unrealistic, and I was ultimately uninterested in her or her issues.I wish that I could give the book three-and-a-half stars, since that is actually what it deserves. It remains a little bit cold as a reading experience-- partly I think that this is down to the small town wife-swapping and gossip not being very interesting to me as a subject of exploration. But still I found it reliably entertaining, and would recommend it to someone in need of a diversion.In any case, I am likely to give a book from the same series a try, even if I will not rush to do so."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"First off I HAVENT EVEN FINISHED THIS BOOK YET!!! SO what I am doing is warning everyone to stay away from this book. I am now on Chapter 10 and finding this book very very hard to keep reading. The writing seems to jump from subject to subject to often and usually has nothing to do with what is going on. Right now Im deciding whether or not I want to make another attempt to read this book.... I have had this problem before, but by Chapter 10 the usually starts to pick up, but not this one. Consider this a Warning!"},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I've tried two books in the Nina O'Reilly series to give the charcaters and settings a fair shake, but after this second book they leave me cold. The heroine is an inflexible, rather unlikeable woman lawyer; her boyfriend, Paul, has no charisma and I wonder why he bothers staying with a woman who will not commit and strives to find flaws with everything about their relationship. Her 'friend' and former legal secretary, Native American Sandy Whitefeather, is basically a flat-out unpleasant person with the personality of a prickly pear cactus, and the villains and guest stars in the tales are drawn to provoke little if any sympathy and mainly annoyance. True, not every character should be warm and fluffy, but there has to be something to draw the reader's interest and empathy and buy in to the story. I wish I could have found it here, but the caliber of the protagonists does not measure up to the quality of those drawn by writers such as Fairstein, McKinzie, Jance or kellerman."},{"Title":"Presumption of Death a","review":"I have loved all the previous O,Shaughnessy books but this book is awful and I am so disappointed. I have read 2/3 of this book and still wonder what's going to happen. It is not written in the style of the two sister authors and is boring. I've decided not to waste my time reading the remainder of the book. What happened? The authors should keep Nina in Tahoe and not spend so much time describing her relationship with Paul. Keep to the mystery.

Rumpole is a good sort, who seems often the underdog, but deep down he is the barrister who would be the champion for the unjust."},{"Title":"The Best of Rumpole: Chosen By the Author","review":"Well, yes, a strong case could be made that these stories represent the Best of Rumpole, although Rumpolemaniacs must argue for a few omitted cases, but, great as these stories are - and they are engaging, clever, funny, satisfying - I don't know what the purpose of this sampler is meant to be. To introduce Rumpole to a prospective reader I would start with The First Rumpole Omnibus. It addds much to the pleasure of reading Rumpole to get to know him as he develops over the course of the original stories. On the other hand, this makes a terrific airplane or travel read, even for those who've read them all before (Rumpole is one of those characters that not only holds up well read after read but actually improves with familiarity)."},{"Title":"The Best of Rumpole: Chosen By the Author","review":"If you were introduced, as I was, to the Rumpole character through the excellent PBS series, there's a treat in store for you. John Mortimer's Rumpole stories are almost too good to be true; they're witty, humorous, and can be enjoyed as examples of good writing in addition to being well-plotted mysteries. They're one of the few mystery series which don't lose enjoyment even after you've seen the film adaptations. My favorite Rumpoles are probably Rumpole a la Carte and Rumpole on Trial; this &quot;Best of&quot; compilation features stories, chosen by Mortimer, from several different eras, including Rumpole's very first appearance. The book is a good way to get acquainted with Rumpole, and it also makes a great gift.The only possible downside is that, after reading the Rumpole stories, you may think that Mortimer's other fiction doesn't *quite* measure up. Here's hoping he decides to bring back Rumpole!"},{"Title":"The Best of Rumpole: Chosen By the Author","review":"This is a selection of stories chosen by the author himself, showcasing the talents and idiosyncrasies of Horace Rumpole, described by his own wife (known as 'She Who Must be Obeyed') as a character. We follow Rumpole through various cases, which give us an insight into Rumpole's views of life and the law (he is quite scathing of both). We meet various regular inhabitants of the Rumpole stories - the Timosn family, who with their many and varied exploits provide Rumpole with much work; 'Miz Liz' Probert, Rumpole's feminist prot&eacute;g&eacute;; uncle Tom, who hasn't seen a brief for many a year and spends his days in chambers practicing his putting; and many others. While very humourous, some of the humour is a bit dated, though this may be part of its appeal for some.The book is a collection of short stories, originally published elsewhere, and each stands alone. so you are able to dip in and out of this book. I am not really a fan of legal stories, humourous or otherwise, but in short dose these make a light break. It is also a good introduction to the Rumpole stories for those who haven't encountered Rumpole before, or have only met his television incarnation.

I have been known to purchase copies for friends after they've had no good,terrible, horrible,very bad days.The key to Alexander's survival in this story, in which he continuously stews about whether he should move to Australia to avoid such horror, is the knowledge that we all have such days sometimes...and it's OK.

Childers's descriptions of the Frisian Islands, the cities of northern Germany, and the dangerous tides are very accurate. That's what I like best about the book. The narrator, Anton Lesser, does a generally good job reading the book. In fact, he's much better than some other actors I've heard. However, his grasp of the German language is dreadful. Some sentences he reads in German are almost incomprehensible. This is inconsistent with the fact that the narrator of the story is supposed to speak German like a native.

When a British yachtsman named Davies (one who would feel at home with the grundge look) discovers that a former British naval officer is in very cozy with the Germans -- did I neglect to say that the coast is East Frisia, that part of Germany between the Dutch and Danish borders? -- the mystery becomes not to find out who the guilty party is, but what type of skullduggery is afoot.The narrator is Carruthers, a British civil servant whom Davies talks into joining him under somewhat false pretenses. After some qualms, Carruthers joins in wholeheartedly. From this point on, you are looking at the coastline charts as closely as the principals are (if you don't, you will lose track of the story, which follows geographic features more closely than any other novel in memory).While the action is spectacular, Childers is noticeably weak on character, especially with regard to the sole female character, the German spy's daughter.

What Childers clearly loves most is sailing. Although there is an espionage element thrown in to give it direction, this is really a very fine yachtsman's yarn, as detailed in its maritime technicalities as a Forsyth or a Clancy would be in their military ones.

The \`Preface' explains this book as a record of the adventures of \\"Carruthers\\". The British government was warned, but little was done. So Childers decided to publish this story to warn the public of a possible invasion of Britain. In Chapter 1 Carruthers gets an invitation to go yachting in the Baltic sea. He accepts out of boredom. The yacht is a converted life boat, thirty feet long and nine in the beam. Arthur Davies can sail this boat without help. Then Davies tells what happened before he invited Carruthers (Chapter 8). Carruthers decided to go along with the plan. Davies talks of the ambitions and rivalry of Germany (Chapter 10).The chapters describe sailing in a small boat in the North Sea. Cold, fog, and tides that imperil a small yacht. There is the story about the mysterious German, his young daughter, and his business associates. There is a mystery about a salvage operation on an old shipwreck by Memmert Sand. Carruthers has been called back to London. But in Amsterdam he disguised himself and doubled back (Chapter 25). Carruthers' suspicions are confirmed by a boat at night towing a lighter. There is a surprise in the last chapter. The \`Epilogue' discusses the plan to invade and conquer Great Britain by surprise.A similar invasion was planned in 1940 until it was prevented by The Battle of Britain. The difficulties of an invasion from sea were solved in June 1944. While a blockade of shipping can damage Britain, its internal resources will help. Only a successful invasion will conquer Britain [as in 1066]. There is no mention of the Territorial Army here. Some have claimed this was the first spy novel. \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" was published years earlier (political intrigue into a dynastic succession).The life and death of Erskine Childers is as interesting as any novel. An Englishman who married an American of Irish descent, Childers smuggled guns into Ireland from Germany (obsolete single shot Mausers). He was caught up in the Troubles and executed in reprisal for the assassination of Michael Collins. His son served a term as the President of Eire."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"The author invents a genre. Long may this book remain in print.

It was written at the turn of the century, and the author meant to convey a real situation and what he concieved of as an emergency to the British public. It worked: the premise of the book led to significant changes in British Naval policy within a few years.The book itself is well-written from the style point of view, but the plot is sort of tame, and the suspense is rather shallow by modern standards.

I mainly want to add that while it is quite good in its own way and may well deserve the label \\"classic,\\" it probably will appeal most to a rather limited and, with time, ever-shrinking audience.While it is a noted early example (perhaps even the first) of the spy/adventure genre, I doubt that it will satisfy or fully engage most fans of LeCarre, McCarry, Deighton, and others of more modern ilk. The writing often is superb, but now somewhat dated; the plot (such as it is) unfolds at a very leisurely pace; and from the reader it requires close -- even undue -- attention to the esoterica of yachtsmanship and to ever so small details of the coastal geography, topology, and tidal patterns of the East Frisian Islands. For the avid small-boat sailor or student of spy literature, \\"The Riddle of the Sands\\" may well warrant five stars, but for the average intelligent reader of the 21st Century, I suspect three stars is more on the mark."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"This is a novel written by a yachtsman which will appeal to sailors because of its authenticity. Childers sailed the German Baltic and Friesian coasts in order to write this book accurately.It will appeal to fans of spy novels, because it is the first spy novel ever written. Besides being the first, it is a great spy novel, which has stood the test of time and is as fresh today as when it was written.It is a book that was written with a purpose in mind. Back in 1903 most British people still expected that any war in Europe would be with the French, the old enemy. Childers noted the industrialisation of Germany and the desire in Germany for expansion. He also noted the dismal state of UK sea defences on the shores facing the German Coastline. This book was a wakeup call to the politicians and the Royal Navy.What I find even more interesting is the back story of Childers own life. He went on to become an Irish nationalist, and rebelled against the British Crown. He used his own Yacht, the Asguard, to run guns into Ireland. He later donated the yacht to the Irish Government, who commissioned it into the navy as the national sail training vessel.Riddle of the Sands is a marvellous story. It begins slowly and seems immersed in \\"yachtie lingo\\", but once the true purpose of Davies invitation to Carruthers is revealed the book cracks off at a running pace, and you will find you cannot put it down."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"Was interested in reading this authors material.

And boats. And rotters. And mud, lots of mud. By Christ there's a lot of mud. Riddle of the mud would be closer to the truth...\\" Later he adds a \`warning' that despite being an guys adventure - that in truth carried significant implications and political repercussions - it does contain a love interest. But it is OK guys - no \`scribblin' wimmin' this -it is described with a true stiff upper-lip by a jolly decent chap. Ironically, Erskine was exactly that, a jolly decent upstanding Brit, even if he was eventually executed for treason, by his own side.This extraordinary tale of boating in the mud of estuaries and evil German plots against the \`old country' of a Britain in decline, set in time already gone, a time of Empire and servants, guns held by Bond Street outfitters and decent chaps fulfilling their duty in the service of their country is actually based on certain aspects of the author's own real life. In his biography of Childers (Thirst for the Sea: The Sailing Adventures of Erskine Childers -[...]), Hugh Popham reveals that Childers, in his Colin Archer designed yacht the Asgard had adventures of smuggling and gun-running for the Irish Republicans that could have been a chapter in the \\"riddle of the muds\\" itself! Indeed, using Childers' own words Popham offers some pretty convincing biographical evidence that the two divergent heroes of Riddle of the Sands were one and the same ... and were, in fact, Erskine Childers himself.This almost Conradian adventure - a pure delight for those readers who love boats and muddy swatchways or who know the Frisian Island - was treated very seriously in Britain because of its predictions of the probable intentions of the rotters and villains - to the extent that the first Sea Lord (one; Sir Winston Churchill) suggested that several of the Naval Contingency Plans, a duplication of the cruise by Secret Service members and even new Naval Bases were created in the World Wars with the Germans in later years because of its validity.The book is also credited as creating the genre of the fictional spy story set in factional geographical or political environs. Whilst readers were later assured that it's adventures and warnings were all \\"just fiction\\" based on the improbable and imaginary experiences of some pretty likeable but unlikely chaps, the fact that the author was a dedicated and enormously experienced yachtsman, who met his death by execution ordered by the Provisional Irish Government, and was justly accused of spying, supporting and gun-running for the Irish Nationalist cause, adds a certain element of doubt about just how much was based on a similar truth.What does ring true is the sailing, seamanship and general \`messing about in boats' - a delight to readers who know a bowsprit from a bumpkin - but also a great adventurous Spy-Story with torturous plot-twists and strong ambience that le Carr&eacute; himself might envy.

Childers' character descriptions were also top notch - painting subtle yet rich articulation into the storyline.The descriptions of sailing weren't overly technical, they were rich and atmospheric."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"This book is often referred to as the first spy novel, and it is not wrong. However, to appreciate the novel, you have to know beforehand several things. But, don't worry, that is not much.The story is narrated by an English gentleman Currthuers, who received an unexpected invitation of duck shooting from an old friend Davies. Being tired of his neglected position in \\"society,\\" he accepts it to go to the North Sea only to find that he is involved in a mystery, or \\"the riddle of the Sands.\\" His friend claims there's something in the air, something hiding behind the misty coast of Germany. But how can they prove it?As a story, \\"The Riddle of the Sands\\" is far from perfect. It is full of authentic descriptions of local landscapes (the author actually cruised his yacht there), but at the same time frequent reference to the geographical data and nautical terms are a bit wearisome to readers, and moreover, the narrator often refers us to the maps in the appendix. Those things only slow down the action of the novel, and actually the book sometimes has to go through lull.But, wait a while. The story gets gradually faster, and as the adventure of the heroes slowly gets near to the core of the plot, the tale becomes more and more gripping. Though characters sometimes are just more than cardboard (and especially female part is poorly done), your patience will be rewarded.It is well-known that Sherlock Holmes in \\"His Last Bow\\" turns a spy for his country, and says \\"There's an east wind coming.\\" The meaning of what Holmes says is clear to the comtemporary people, and Childers, a politician, also wrote his book not as an amusement but as a warning to England about the coming threat of Germany, and actually \\"The Riddles of the Sands\\" was written about 10 years before WW1 began. In this historical context too, the book is interesting, and the tediousness of the opening chapters is justified if you keep it in mind that it is meant for Childers's sarcasm against indifference and complacency among the English people (talking of English complacency, we remember later in 1938, immediately before WW2, Alfred Hitchcock again uses it as a satire in his thriller \\"The Lady Vanishes\\" with brilliantly silly two British gentlemen who are more concerned with cricket games than surrounding danger). People don't change.So, the book itself is still enjoyable, but these historical matters will make it more precious; after all, it is one of the proof how people reacted to the coming change in the history of mankind. And if you're interested in this kind of book (I mean, books reflects German-England relationship), check out \\"The Battel of Dorking\\" by George Chesney (written in 1871) and \\"When William Came\\" (in 1913) by Saki once."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"I bought The Riddle of the Sands to use in an History essay for university where I was looking at how the spy was portrayed before World War I. As one of the more popular titles from that era of 'invasion literature,' Childer's work certainly fit the bill. It is the story of two men sailing around the Frisian Islands trying to uncover a German plot to invade the north of England. That's basically it in the way of plot. It was Childer's way of calling attention to what he believed where Britain's insufficient North Sea defenses, and the real possibility of a German naval invasion. He succeeded in that endeavour and the North Sea defenses were eventually strengthed, which you could view either as a testament to the power of this novel, or to the 'great underlying problems and increasing pessimism' felt throughout Europe (to quote Ruth Henig), in the lead up to World War I.Whichever view you take, the novel has a depth of characterisation that is quite remarkable for a first attempt at fiction. Davies and Carruthers are representative of the two poles of English class/social structure at the time, with the inarticulate, yet perceptive everyman Davies teaming up with well-mannered and intellectually capable Carruthers, figurative of the way that all aspects of British society would need to come together to face the coming invasion. However, the fact that this was Childers' first and only novel begins to show in his pacing. This is hardly the 'cliff-hanger' that Milt Bearden claims it to be in his brief 5-page introduction. However, Childers' purpose was not to write a thrilling page turner, but a warning against German invasion. To really enjoy this novel, you have to read it in that context, otherwise you'll be thinking 'what's the big deal?' There is relevance to our contemporary situation, given the whole 'invasion' theme, but to understand that connection, you need to be aware of the reasons for Childers' decision to write this book, and, by extension, the motivation of his characters.This Modern Library edition does offer some background in Bearden's introduction. Enough to give the casual reader some brief historical context, at least. It follows the Modern Library's tradition of having authors from relevant and related fields offering their thoughts, rather than the academic/scholarly approach that Penguin or Oxford take. The problem here though is that it is too brief to offer any real insights. There is also the standard Modern Library reading guide, offering questions that range between vaguely thought-provoking to superficial. I don't know why they bother with these reading guides, especially at the expense of a decent introduction. However, if you're just after the story without wading through the academia of the Oxford World's Classic release, then this is the version you're after. Plus, Modern Library's cover art is always so much nicer to look at!"},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"... not that I know enough about literary history to be able to vouch for that myself. It's hard to explain exactly what its kind is. Call it a modern spy story: and I think what makes it modern is the feeling that the protagonists are no more than a stone's throw from society, often WITHIN society, and can some of the time claim protection from society; and yet if they turn down the wrong street or move a mile or two to the left they might as well be in the wilds of Siberia, for all the mercy that anyone will show them. Everyone in this novel, in innocence or in guilt, leads a kind of double life.Two stories run side by side: the riddle of the title, concerning an unknown threat to England, and the redemption of a feckless civil servant named - naturally - Carruthers. The setting is lovely; the life aboard ship is vividly described; the author never leaves important details vague. But do pay close attention to the map in the front of the book as you read."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"This book has been described to me both as &quot;the best Yachting Book written&quot; and &quot;The book that saved Britain&quot;. Written in part as a wake-up call to the British Public at the turn of the last century -Childers (no stranger to Whitehall politics) was terrified that existing British strategy left the country wide open to an invasion from Germany- and in part as a celebration of a lifelong passion for boats and boating, the book &quot;works&quot; brilliantly. Even non-yachting enthusiasts will be drawn into the story, and those of us who have worked our way along a foggy coast by chart and compass will appreciate Childers' attention to detail and faithfulness to his subject. Overall I found the two principal characters well drawn, but the Germans are a bit cartoonish, and the hint of Romance towards the end was an un-needed distraction, other than that, this is a quite-un-put-downable novel of adventire &amp; daring that MAY just have changed the course of history."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the British government was prone to regular spasms of alarm about the possibility of invasion by a European power .Fortifications were built for the defence of London and a chain of fortresses were constructed in Kent and Surrey ,and intended to be the centres of resistance to the invader .The enemy was usually assumed to be France ,the UK's traditional enemy in war and main commercial rival in peacetime .While sharing the view of the need to arm against invasion Erskine Childers was of the view that it was Germany not France that was the likely rival and set out to dramatise this concern in The Riddle of the Sands .The book is openly propagandist in nature being written to convert military and public opinion to the dangers of German naval expansionism .It did so successfully and the book caused a hugh sensation when it appeared in 1903 .His warnings gained credibility partlt because Childers was not a professional novelist but rather a respectable civil servant ,a Committee Clerk in the House of Commons .His novel is the work of a man with a powerful romantic imagination -he devoured Fennimore Cooper and Dumas as a child -and he applied this together with a passion for sailing in a well written and propulsive narrative .The genesis was a trip he took in 1897 ,a sialing trip to the Fresian islands where he claimed he saw signs of German preparations for invasion .The book was cast in the form of a novel the better to engender interest among the general public .It also found a strong advocate in Admiral Fisher ,the only British maritime leader to warn about German naval strength at that time .These controversies are long dead and ,truth to tell ,the topical passages are the heavies-going in the book ,So ,why still read this book if all it is is a historical curiousity ?Well ,it is more than that .It is a tale of adventure ,and conveys as few books have ever done the zest and enjoyment of sailing .The two stalwart heroes are Carruthers and Davies who are on a sailing holiday in the Fresians when they stumble across a German plot to invade England .They must evade capture and return to England to warn the authorities of their discovery . The description of their fog bound journey in a dinghy through the narrow waters of the Memmert Balje is a superb piece of writing and the atmosphere of the islands is brilliantly captured .The two men are adequately characterised heroes and in \\"Clare Dollman \\" he created a spirited and personable heroine .The book is a precursor to the modern spy story and memorable for that reason amongst others .The book is no longer topical but it is still eminently readable"},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"I became aware of 'The Riddle Of The Sands' while reading Andrew Lownie's biography of my favorite author, John Buchan ('The Thirty-Nine Steps'). Buchan, a contemporary of Childers, reviewed a reissue of the book in 1926, calling it, &quot;the best story of adventure published in the last quarter of a century&quot;. Well, 78 years later not much has changed. The writing is witty, intelligent and literate and the story at once simple yet complex. This novel is a perennial favorite among small-boat sailors, and is certainly &quot;riddled&quot; with enough sailing jargon to perplex most landlubbers. All of this is, however, very neatly integrated into a spy story that, like many of Buchan's wonderful novels, starts with the slenderest of threads and challenges the characters to figure out the skullduggery using sheer wit and intelligence.It may sound trite, but they really don't make 'em like they used to."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"I was intrigued when I came across this unassuming little book at a used bookstore. The plot revolves around the dual quest of Davies, one of the book's two protaganists. An Englishman and amateur yachtist, Davies' spot of autumn sailing along the challenging Frisian coast, Germany's narrow mouth on the sea facing England, turns into something more when a man ostensibly out to aid Davies by \\"piloting\\" his small craft with his larger yacht through an intricate network of sandbanks in harsh weather, actually makes an attempt to lead Davies and his boat to their doom along the treacherous coast. This act of deceit piques the indefatigable Davies' curiosity. What was so important among these nondescript sand islets fronting the German coast that would necessitate murder? This question is one object of Davies' subsequent quest. The other is a lover's quest, namely in the form of the daughter of the putative pilot just mentioned. To aid him in his foolhardly quest, considering his small yacht and the inclement weather of the North Sea in autumn, Davies summons from England his acquaintance Carruthers, whose fluent German could prove useful. What he doesn't do, at least at first, is tell Carruthers just what is afoot, suggesting instead a spot of duck hunting and pleasure sailing. What follows soon upon Carruther's arrival is a nautical cat and mouse game involving the small yacht of Davies, an Imperial German gunboat, and an assortment of other yachts and shady characters peopling this melancholy and threatening coastline.I found Childer's work very engaging, especially as I chose to read it while doing some traveling along a similar shoal of islands, though far from Germany and not in a yacht. The novel certainly kept me riveted by its plot, and Childers does a fine job in developing the primary characters and personalities of both Davies and Carruthers who emerge in very human detail against their backdrop. I'm not sure what edition the reader will be reading, but one disapointment I encountered was that the backcover of my edition gave away too much. The nature of the mystery should be left completely to the reader to discover. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the frequent use of nautical terms and the heavy reliance upon the intricacies of coastal features (requiring, at least for the curious, a continuous back-referencing to the series of maps) does hinder the pace a bit, but not to any great degree. What I found particularly interesting about this work was its language. It is a period piece, not just historically, by revealing a growing unease among Britain of the period of a rising German power, but culturally, as seen in the very approach to their problem taken by Davies and Carruthers. It is a game, and the phrase \\"playing the game\\" comes up frequently in the course of the text. Manliness and ruggedness, being proven and found worthy by one's adversaries (be they the elements or the Germans), and most of all \\"winning the game\\" with pluck and verve are all salient characteristics of Childer's attitude (and certainly not unique to him). I found the novel revealing in the general attitude towards international rivalry and war in the pre-World War One years. It was this gamesmenship attitude to combat and its challenges (a very British notion) that helped contribute to the willingness with which men threw themselves into death in 1914. I'm not sure if \\"Riddle of the Sands\\" is indeed the first modern espionage thriller (what about Arthur Conan Doyle?), but it is a perfect insight into period attitudes and fears. It is also exciting reading."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"Widely considered the first modern spy novel, and the still the best book about sailing. Perhaps a bit tedious due to the 100 year old prose, but well worth it. It is very appearant that the author, Childers, knows his subject matter. Not only was he an avid yachtsman, and a foreign office employee, but he knew a bit about spying, too - he was executed for running guns to the IRA in the 1916 rebellion. This book is somewhere between Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Treasure Island. Truly a classic...and the movie's great too."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"Don't look for subtle characters. There aren't any.Do look for a Boy's own Best Spy Adventure. Wonderful precise detail about practical sailing as we might recognize it today.The best sequence is an awesome feat of blind, tidal naviagation.I wish Hitchcock had made the movie. He would have known what do to do with it.This novel is reputed to be one of the tensions that started WWI. Certainly the fictional strings have contributed to modern espionage. You will recognize traditions of Le Carre and Deighton."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"Erskine Childers was shot by firing squad during the Irish civil war in 1922. According to Wikipedia, his last words were a joke at the expense of his executioners: \\"Take a step or two forward, lads. It will be easier that way.\\"His son was subsequently elected fourth president of Ireland in an upset election in the 1970's, sadly to die in office a year or so later.Whatever the circumstances of his life and death, this story is a \\"cracking good read\\", one of the earliest novels in the genre of spy fiction. Don't be put off by the various maps and charts at the beginning of the book - it is entirely possible to enjoy the story without knowing anything about sailing (though presumably the fun of the story will be heightened for those who do have some knowledge of sailing and maritime affairs). The voice of the narrator is irresistibly charming, the story is an excellent one, tautly told. I feel almost ashamed to be discovering this story as late in life as I am. But better late than never.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"Childers' novel was a real disappointment. After starting to read the original Ian Fleming James Bond novels for Fleming's centennial, my interest in spy novels was piqued and I decided to make a survey of them. I was going to start with The 39 Steps until I came across The Riddle of the Sands. I wasn't expecting a Bond-style thriller, and I came with an open mind, but this was a tedious and underwhelming story with little general historical interest.Originally published in 1903, the story is a first-person account of a pre-WWI British Foreign Office employee who gets caught up in the discovery of German invasion plans while on a sailing holiday. The book was written as a serious account of events for the expressed purpose of jarring the public into recognition of the German threat.While the plot sounds like a decent one for a spy novel, and while the reader with an interest in historical fiction might expect to find period interest, most of the book is detailed accounts of sailing, complete with nautical terms and descriptions with little meaning to those not familiar with boats and navigation. I figure the book could easily have been cut down to a half of its length without losing any plot or meaningful descriptive material.There's not much else to say. The evil villain turns out to be a double agent working for the British, which all but the dimmest reader will suspect from the introduction of his character. Whenever danger seems around the corner, it turns out to be nothing. There is no descriptive material that would be of interest to the antiquarian or historical enthusiast. One reviewer who said \\"it gives remarkable insights into the culture and attitudes of the period\\" must have been reading a different book.I'm not sure who this novel would appeal to, and I suspect that it was chosen as an Oxford classic because the novelist died for the politically correct cause of supporting Irish independence. Yawn.The best thing about the novel is this edition (Oxford Classics green cover with white portrait), and the introduction by David Trotter provides a nice background on early thrillers and spy stories."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"The title (Riddle of the Sands) is exotic but beyond that - it is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw one"},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"I am not a sailor, nor am i interested in the details of sailing. Also the description of the east frisian coast (i was born there) didn't fascinate me.

The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat. The ending left me empty and unsatisfied. If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area. Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"For lovers of spy/espionage thrillers this is a great read. Childers, despite his slow(70 page) start maintains a high level of informative tension to almost the end. Who are the villains and who are the heroes and who can be trusted? The purpose of the the author,as was John Buchan's 'Thirty-Nine Steps' which was made into a fine Hitchcock film, was to warn the pre-World War I British establishment of the dangerous intentions of Imperial Germany and to awaken Britain from its complacent slumber. The evolution of the central character from snobbish dandy to a sea-toughened spy is skillfully drawn. To get the most from your reading, bring along your own maps of the North Sea/Friesan Islands,Baltic Sea region."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"This is a truly beautiful book ... Although it is said to be the first book in the genre, it is not alike to most of the spy novels I read. The plot develops slowly, and for the most part of the story nothing significant happens, but this is exactly what makes it special and valuable. Heroes are very human, they are prone to fantasies and mistakes, and for a long time it is not clear if the spy plot was a reality or the creation of their vivid imagination. There is a scene I particularly enjoyed, and if it were not written at the very beginning of the century, it might have been a satire of modern spy novels. Here I refer to the scene when one of the main characters is eavesdropping under the window of a house, but cannot hear much because the curtains are drawn! This is a jewel. I also enjoyed descriptions of sailing in the sands and of the life on the islands.Read this book if you are interested in the study of human character, do not read it if you are just after thrill and entertainment, you won't find what you are looking for then. This book requires time."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"The book arrived and was in excellent condition.

I still wonder, having enjoyed it a second time. Of course, you have to like the sea and sailing and be willing to go back in history a bit.

Yes, perhaps there is a bit too much about sailing, unless that's you're thing, but otherwise this is a marvellous late summer read. John Buchan acknowledged Childers as his master--a high complement indeed, especially in Canada!--but you'll find as much basis for Le Carre here, or indeed much of Graham Greene.

In fact I lived the first six years of my life, during the war, on the North Sea coast opposite the Frisian Islands (the Shallows lying between).So the story had particular resonance and I could see the actual land/seascape in my memory. Quit apart from that it was a great story with all the necessary elements of a good read: great and believable plot, well-developed characters, and lots and varied action and suspense.

Or was it a great way to release information gleamed through a real spy network in a way to protect the sources?There are very interesting connections to be made.1) Childers was an avid yachtsmen who sailed the North Sea exploring the coast along Germany and countries around it.2) Childers was an intelligence Officer in WWI3) Childers released the book in claims to warn the British government and citizens of the German danger and the need to defend the North Sea.4) The epilogue and postscript at the end of the book (continuing in the book style... treating the book as non-fiction) states the German danger uncovered in the book could not be put into effect for 10 years.... The book was published in 1903... That is 1913, one year before WWI!It is an amazing book and tickles the imagination to think of the possibilities. The book has no swearing I remember, no sex, no murder and no one misses it either.

His book The Riddle of the Sands and the feature film starring Michael York only enhance each other. Erskines life in itself reads like a Indiana Jones story. He began sailing along the Frisian Islands in the North Sea in 1897. His experiences and imagination of the possibilities of an invasion by Germany would change the way Great Britain looked at it's defensive policies and the lack of realistic preparations of her coastlines. Did the book and it's warning influence and delay World War I? Was there a plan to invade Britain? Was it considered? Mostly like not, but we will never really know. The Riddle of the Sands and the warning changed how an entire country defended itself. Germany was at the time expanding her empire and particularly her Navy. Germany's only rival at the time was Great Britain. So....... The Riddle of the Sands is a particular insightful look at the end of the Victorian age and the dawning of a new century.

Alas it was not so, so maybe Childers will haunt me after this review. This book, like much of the narrative has me sailing in circles. I got some nautical terms out of this reading but not much else. The plot is the German Imperial Army planning the conquest of England. They expand their tranportation system in the land nearest the UK and build train stations and barges as a means to transport their soldiers.This story is perhaps more believeable than a James Bond movie. However, the narrative at page 200, is much like that at the beginning. This is an OK read for spy buffs, and those interested in WWI."},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","review":"This story moves at a very slow pace.

It's about 280-300 pages of building not very tense tension and then finally at the end of the book you get a none thrilling conclusion. The only redeeming factor of this book, the reason why I gave it two stars and not one, is the dynamic between the two main characters. The characters are engaging but the plot is so dull I must recommend readers to stay away. DON'T READ."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"A beautiful looking cookbook, certainly.

I constantly get requests for my version of ANZAC biscuits (a cookie you can find in many other places!)."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work. I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out. I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on. Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books. And he sounds like a real prima donna."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"I'm so glad I only got this book out of the library. I would want my money back if I had paid for it! Granted I am only trying my first recipe from it now (Linzer Roll Cookies), but the directions are contradictory and full of errors. For instance, the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough. So we go from one square to some rectangles. So Nick, which one is it supposed to be? I guess I'll just have to wing it! Hello, isn't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff? I'll stick with the King Arthur Flour, their new cookie book is fabulous as is their Complete Baking book."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"I took a cooking class that he gave in my area. I was really exicted to meet him. I was looking forward to baking the cookies in his book and then reporting to you all how some of them turned out. When it came time to buy books, I readily bought one so that he could sign it. When it came time for him to sign my book, he signed it as he was looking away talking to somebody else. He never said a word to me or thanked me for buying his expensive book. Not only was that rude, but I was extremely hurt. You know how some cookbook authors you really want to meet? Well, I wish I had never wasted my time at the class or wasted my money on the book. I have never been able to bake any of the cookies he has in the book because I was so hurt. I will throw it away someday if I ever find it. I conveniently lost it. I have more than 600 cookbooks, love to cook, but never with his books ever again. If he comes to your town, don't waste your time. Go see somebody nice that will appreciate that you are spending your hard-earned money to buy their book and taking your time away from other things you could be doing to see them. Also, during the class he complained about Martha Stewart when he was on her show how mean she was to her employees. What a tattletale. That's the thanks she gets for having him on her show. Hope he never gets his own show. I wouldn't waste my time. Save your money."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"I love to make cookies, but even though there are lots of cookie books out there, there are not lots of GOOD ones. Well, this is the ONLY one you'll ever need. I have only had the book a few days, but have made 12 of the recipes and all were outstanding. Nick Malgieri is the one person I would choose to spend a day with, if I could choose only one(aside from present family &amp; friends!).Think of all the baking knowledge I could soak up.I guess I will have to be content with his books, this cookie one being my FAVORITE!"},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"\`Cookies Unlimited' by Nick Malgieri is the sixth book dedicated exclusively to cookies I have reviewed, and I can honestly say I have found not a single poor book in the lot. However, there are several reasons for selecting one of these books over the other depending on your needs at the time. Two books, \`Rose's Christmas Cookies' and \`Field Guide to Christmas Cookies' are dedicated to Christmas cookies, so you may only want these if you bake cookies only around Christmas, except that the first of the two books by Rose Levy Beranbaum has a great introduction to baking cookies in general. One of these books, \`The All American Cookie Book' by Nancy Baggett is dedicated, obviously, to American cookie recipes, including some of the very best recipes for chocolate chip cookies and the Pennsylvania Dutch specialities. The \`King Arthur Cookie Companion' and Carol Walter's \`Great Cookies' are both superb general cookie books, although the King Arthur writers give a much better introduction to cookie making in general. King Arthur and Rose Levy Beranbaum do the best job, in general, on the cookie tutorial at the beginning of the book. So where does Nick Malgieri's book fit in?For starters, while Malgieri's book does cover several famous American cookie types such as the chocolate chip and the Pennsylvania Dutch sugar cookie, he devotes much space to a lot of classic French, Austrian, and Italian cookies. If you could have but two cookie cookbooks, this book paired with Nancy Baggett's \`All American' book would do a good job of covering the subject worldwide.Malgieri also does not give us the in-depth tutorial we get from King Arthur, Beranbaum, and Carole Walter. Instead, we get a seven (7) page no nonsense survey of ingredients, equipment, and technique which I strongly urge you to read before doing any of the recipes. As a former chemist, I am a pretty good baker, as I am expert at weighing and measuring. My downfall usually comes when I mix things, as the rule of the day in chemistry is that things be mixed thoroughly. As with biscuits and pastry dough, many cookie doughs are better mixed lightly, leaving a certain coarseness in the mix so that the baking cookies are not leavened too much by the sugar's creating little air pockets in the creamed butter. As counterintuitive as this sounds, I am taking Herr Malgieri's word on this as he is the baking instructor and I am not.My general experience with Malgieri's books is that except for yeast bread baking, it is to him I always look first for a particular recipe for things like cakes, pies, and quick breads. Now that I have this book, I am sure I will come to him first for cookies as well, since I have never been disappointed with my implementing any of his recipes. The only weakness I have found in any of Malgieri's books is in the misleading title \`How to Bake', which is much more a collection of really good recipes than a tutorial on baking technique. Malgieri simply knows how to write a recipe that is easy to follow and which delivers satisfactory results.\`Cookies Unlimited' is organized in the same way as Carole Walter's book, by style of baking. That is, his chapters are on:Bar CookiesDrop CookiesRefrigerator CookiesRolled CookiesPiped CookiesMacaroonsMolded CookiesBiscottiFried CookiesFilled and Sandwich CookiesWafersCrackers and Savory CookiesFillings, Icings, and GlazesDecorating Projects, including a great plan for making a gingerbread house from scratch.Walter's book is organized around a smaller number of topics, not quite as neatly summarized. Choosing between these two books is not easy. They cost the same, they are of similar lengths, and both contain high quality recipes. Neither book gives pictures for all their recipes, but Walter's pictures are just a little better. Both books make a great virtue of giving us recipes from colleagues and friends. So much so in Malgieri's part that the book begins to look like the publication of his personal cookie recipe box. In fact, Walter's book contains a Malgieri recipe and Malgieri's book contains a Walter recipe. Malgieri gives us a very nice little page of lists of recipes by country. Oddly, this list does not include American recipes, in spite of the obviously American source for some of the recipes.Overall, I believe Carole Walter's book (and the King Arthur book) is superior if you are really serious about learning everything there is to know about cookie baking; however, I think Nick Malgieri's book is as good a source of a wide variety of recipes, especially from international sources. And, it gives a somewhat better coverage of some specialized topics such as Springerle cookies imprinted with a German or Swiss rolling pin or mold and his very nice little gingerbread house. The single most useful theme I found in Malgieri's book was his doing some classic cookie types in several different ways, as when he does the classic Linzer cookie as a sheet, a roll, or a traditional square.I also suspect that for the casual cookie baker, Malgieri's book may be slightly better as a simple collection of very good recipes from a wide variety of sources, including most of the famous cookies from around the world such as Madelaines, Arnhem cookies, Springerles, Zeppole, Linzer cookies, Pizzele, and Wiener Mandelgipferl (Almond Crescents).If you love cookie baking, get all of these books. If you simply want a good source of unusual cookies, Malgieri's book will do the job for you.Recommended."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"This is a fantastic assortment of Cookie recipes all in one place.

He has been at the pastry business so long, and he's been teaching for so long, that he knows just what to tell us, and simply, so that we make a superb cookie every time.He also has great taste. The selection of cookies ranges from down-home and familiar to slightly exotic. None of these recipes is very difficult, but there is a little bit of variation in skill level required throughout the book. This will satisfy a craving to try something new and that will stretch your pastry skills.

The class was a bit quick and geared to more experienced cooks, however the cookies I have made from Cookies Unlimited were not difficult at all. The recipes are written with enough detail and background that everything I've made so far was easy and turned out delicious."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"I've tried several of the recipes in this book, and most of them were very successful. A couple of the recipes were too sweet for my family's taste, but I made the chocolate chip cookies for my husband's office around the holidays, and two people said they were, hands down, the best chocolate chip cookies they'd ever had.The book is divided into cookie category sections (e.g., refrigerator, drop, bars, etc.) and there are many, many recipes with interesting backgrounds on all of them. There's also a great reference section in the back for ordering specialty items, cookie presses, and other things you might not find locally (although most of the recipes can be made with everyday ingredients &amp; equipment).Overall, I think this is a wonderful cookbook and it's by far the best cookie book I've ever used. I turn to it again and again not only when I'm planning on making cookies, but when I just want to read about them and drool over the pictures, too."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"This cookie book provides a great way for even the mediocre baker to get outstanding results and impress friends. It has beautiful, large, detailed photos which show how the results are supposed to look. Clear, precise instructions assist the baker along the way. Hints are included which help ensure even greater baking success. (I like the idea of lining pans with foil. It helps prevent cookie breakage and makes clean-up time so much easier).The recipes are fabulous. After just making a few of them, I've decided to bake my way through the entire book. Fortunately, I have enough receptive snackers in my family to make this an eventual possibility!I'd suggest that even if you don't want to get this book for yourself, present it as a surprise to someone who likes to bake. I guarantee that it will be appreciated for many years to come."},{"Title":"Cookies Unlimited","review":"If you are looking for some different cookie recipes, this book is for you. This book is well put together in its presentation, with plenty of photos (its nice to know how your creations are susposed to look), easy to read recipes, and well organized.

This text is current and has the same easy flow of information that has become the hallmark of this duo. It is well written for a self learning experience or can be adopted to a class setting.

The examples and quizzes are very clever and are a great reference to the subtle kind of tricks you can do to make your programs faster, cleaner, and smaller.A selection of the diverse examples in the book: Chernoff Faces, Monte Carlo Simulations, Cryptography, 3D molecular-structure renderings, an Eliza program, and a discussion and comparison of functional, rule-based, and procedural programming styles."},{"Title":"Will Teach For Food: Academic Labor in Crisis (Studies in Classical Philology)","review":"A certain elite university boasts (literally) an endowment of $5.7 billion (yes, billion with a B)--or did as of Tuesday, 16 September; you should add a million or two per day to get the approximate sum on the day you read this. On that same date the university announced that it will embark on a $1 billion (with a B) program to renovate the buildings on its campus. Yet just eighteen months ago, this same anonymous university--by far the biggest employer in one of the most economically depressed cities in the nation--engaged in a no-holds-barred campaign to break the two unions that represent its nonacademic labor force. And just before that, the university crushed the latest effort by the graduate students' union, which was seeking, before anything else, simply to get the university to admit the self-evident truth that teaching assistants are employees and that, as such, they have the right to bargain collectively.This institution fosters an extreme but not atypical example of the condition described in this book's subtitle. The academic labor force in the United States, from the celebrated professor to the undervalued custodian, faces an unprecedented crisis, a crisis deftly delineated in the seventeen essays of this book, roughly half of which focus on the labor struggles at the above-unnamed (but named in the book) elite university. That struggle brought support from labor's allies nationwide, but in the end it did little to change the workers' status from what frighteningly parallels--as Stephen Watt puts it in the book's most poignant metaphor--that of miners trapped in a &quot;company town,&quot; where the perverted law of supply and demand means that the company supplies the work, so the company can demand whatever conditions are to its liking.The book does not pretend to bipartisanship, and at times polemic detracts from persuasiveness. But the best of the essays--like Watt's, Kathy Newman's, and particularly Michael B&eacute;rub&eacute;'s--back up their rousing calls to collective action with coolly logical evidence and solidly ordered argument. This is an important book for anyone who is concerned with the state of labor and/or higher education; these days, who can afford not to be?"},{"Title":"Will Teach For Food: Academic Labor in Crisis (Studies in Classical Philology)","review":"Will Teach For Food began as Social Text 49's &quot;Yale Strike Dossier,&quot; which in turn grew out of a conference held at Yale to discuss the ramifications of the '95-'96 grade strike and the role of tenured faculty in persecuting advisees for union activity. Despite the omission of several key essays about the grade strike (Cynthia Young's &quot;On Strike at Yale&quot; from Minnesota Review 45&46, Corey Robin's &quot;Blacklisted and Blue,&quot; (which may have been written after WTFF was published) and similar work by Gordon Lafer which appeared in Dissent, this first half or so of the book is indispensable. John Wilhelm's &quot;Short History Of Unionization at Yale&quot; provides a good framework for looking at the history of workers' struggles against taylorization and union-busting since the organization of maintenance and grounds workers in the late 1930s. Corey Robin and Michelle Stephens provide a solid account of the difficulties of organizing contingent academic workers, while Michael Berube takes yale's elite faculty to task for sabotaging students' academic careers and threatening them with deportation of union activity. Kathy M. Newman provides an insightful and funny analysis of the cultural meanings of and anxieties embodied in representations of graduate students in popular culture, also looking at the ways in which GESO negotiated these images and tropes in the early days of its organizing and at the tropes and images employed and mobilized by anti-union undergraduates to express their own particular anxieties regarding the prospect of TA unionization. The seconf half of the book takes a more structural look at graduate student unionization as a national movement and is a worthwhile companion piece to both the first half of the book, as well as to other volumes following a similar route."},{"Title":"666","review":"This book is utterly awful. The narrative changes from first to third person and back again for no apparent reason. None of the characters are believable and their actions make no sense. The plot goes in all sorts of bizarre directions, both to accomodate a clumsy interpretation of Revelation and also a seemingly random collection of photographs (a crowd of people waving brooms, a holiday snapshot near a big bell in Moscow - not terribly apocalyptic). As a novel, it wobbles between tedious and unintentionally funny. As a piece of religious propaganda, it's a complete failure."},{"Title":"666","review":"Salem Kirban delivers a literal take on the events prophesied in the Biblical Book of Revelation, and creates a multitude of unintentional chuckles while he's at it. I think this was written in the '70's and its science is by now highly out of date. (\\"Ruby Laser Rings\\"?) This story about the rise of the antichrist during the Biblical end times begins with all the Christians suddenly vanishing from the face of the earth, and yet those remaining don't quite catch on that it's the Rapture. They wander around puzzled about the disappearances until a charismatic leader appears on the scene to take over the world and usher in a reign of darkness. The main characters here, a trio of dumb-as-post agnostics soon to turn true believers, begin as loyal henchmen of the politically popular antichrist (a sort of '70's smooth operator with fundamentalist-rankling leftist tendencies) but eventually repent and take it on the lam as they work underground against him and his evil administration. There are wars here, execution scenes straight out of A Tale Of Two Cities, political messages wrapped in Christian dogma, and even a resurrection from the dead achieved in a science-meets-arcane-magick stunt that puts the antichrist on a divine plateau. Finally there is the anticipated good v. evil showdown, Jesus ushers in the new world, blahblahblah, and the faithful get their reward, the rest swan dive into eternal pain and suffering, courtesy of an all-loving God.This well-meaning, sensationalistic book cracks me up."},{"Title":"666","review":"I hadn't even realized this book was still in print. Leaving any content issues aside, this is an extremely poorly written book. The characters are stilted, the perspective changes for no apparant reason and the prose is somewhat less than enthralling. In fact, to me it is one of those books that you keep reading just to see how bad it can get."},{"Title":"666","review":"Mr. Kirban has written an intersting story, but his writing style is so poor, it is distracting. As one reviewer pointed out, he switches grom first person to third person. What he didn't tell you is Mr. Kirban actually got so confused he began switching back and forth between the two, sometimes in the same paragraph. To his credit, I will say that some of his &quot;prediction&quot; about modern life were dead-on. You see, the book came out in 1970, but takes place in the year 2000. Mr. Kirban has space shuttles, laser weapons, as well as human cloning taking place."},{"Title":"666","review":"In the back of the book it states that Mr. Salem has a degree and the book sold a \\"quarter of a million copies\\". Wow. If this is all it takes to write a book and make a ton of money, count me in! I was really disapointed that Mr. Kirban's writing style is very amaturish-almost borderline \\"English as a second language\\" - no evidence of any kind of intellecutal writing talent. He chose generic names like George, Bill and Faye. I think he's trying too hard to make it a thriller that all you get is \\"cornyness\\". He has a diagram of a \\"laser ring\\" and talks about \\"protien cakes\\" made from dead humans and motor oil. And the black and white pictures are so phony - like he picked out of some photo stock agency and when he couldn't get what he wanted, they tossed in a substitute (Hey, it's much better to have a picture of Chinese waiting in line - probebly during WWII) then no picture at all! And then there is another photograph where people are supposed to be rolling in \\"mud\\" to look for any \\"morsol of food\\" - but one of the people is smiling! I didn't think starving was so much fun. This is a great book if you're like in the 4th or 5th grade, but for someone that wants a more realistic approach to the end times I believe there are far better books out there."},{"Title":"666","review":"Kirban does a wonderful job in putting the book of Revelation to comic book form. While, as most writers of Bible-based fiction do, he doesn't get all his doctrine right (Sorry, if you take the mark of the beast you can't wash it off! In fact, you'll go to Hell!), the book is still helpful.In this day when everything is visual, this book has a place in helping us \\"see\\" the Bible. Not perfect, but helpful."},{"Title":"666","review":"Salem Kirban's first attempt at a fiction novel, 666, fails miserably. The character development is virtually non-existent, the writing style is very poor, the storyline is very corny. 666 is the story of a group of people trying to survive the Tribulation Period and the Antichrist's persecution. The end-times is portrayed in an extremely corny and monotonous manner, and the characters are nothing more than cardboard stereotypes who are not in the least bit realistic. The judgments of God during the Tribulation Period the characters live through are trivialized, a war, a global famine, a worldwide earthquake, and many other global disasters and plagues are portrayed so porly and unrealistically that the judgments seem like nothing. Kirban mainly focuses on the character's struggle to survive the rampant persecution of believers, everything else is trivialized.If you are looking for an end-times thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, do not read 666 by Salem Kirban. It is a wasre of time and I regret taking the time to read it. 1 star out of five."},{"Title":"666","review":"This book is one of the best unintentionally funny novels I've ever read. It's filled with spelling and grammatical errors. There are bizarre stock photos scattered throughout that the author seems to have used to flesh out his narrative, for no reason. If you're a collector of such oddities, this is one you should not miss. It has a place of honor on my bookshelf, right next to another silly, silly classic of the rapture genre by Ernest Angley. Stupid fun!"},{"Title":"666","review":"I read this book back in the '70's and have been looking for it ever since. I love the way it shows George and his daughter and son-in-law growing closer to the Lord and realizing how important he is in our lives. I also like how it shows how we can mistake evil for good."},{"Title":"666","review":"Kirban's only attempts at fiction, &quot;666&quot; and &quot;1000&quot; are not as finely polished as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels, but still very readable.&quot;666&quot; covers the same basic period as the entire &quot;Left Behind&quot; book series - and features George and his wife Helen (who is one of the ones taken in the Rapture).The parallels between this book and the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels are very striking. The story starts on a airplane. The husband is &quot;left behind&quot; and the wife and children raptured. George is quickly catapulted into direct confrontation with the Anti-Christ and his minions.But that's not all - if you can find one of the combination books you'll even be able to read about the millennium period and what might happen during that time. Kirban's position as a born-again Arab really shine through in places. Kirban is not a novelist, though ... There are many places where an editor might have caught the fact that Kirban switches between first person and third person perspective without warning. there are other editorial mistakes, but not enough to make me want to put this book down until I had read it through.But I won't ruin the whole novel here - just recommend that if you like the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books that this is a &quot;must read&quot;!"},{"Title":"666","review":"When I first read this book in 1973, I was 16 years old. It changed my life! While I am not in the habit of reviewing books, I feel this book worthy of a high rating if it is read in HIS spirit.

Understand that when you read this, your reading the future."},{"Title":"666","review":"While this book is not as bad as Ernest Angely's RAPTURED, it is nonetheless very dogmatic.Kirban, like Angely, Hal Lindsey, et al. believes that the dispensational, premillennial view of the Second Coming is the ONLY CORRECT position to take. Kirban is also quite dogmatic on the issue of Christian rock music and Christian rock bands. He sees them as part of the great &quot;End Times&quot; apostasy. That is, anyone who is a contemporary Christian music artist is actually an apostate, according to Kirban.Another odd thing about this book, the narrative suddenly changes from first person as told by George to third person with George being spoken of along with the other characters.Finally, the end of the story as Christ returning to Earth riding astride a literal horse along with His disciples, including those &quot;caught up&quot; in the &quot;Rapture&quot; all riding on literal horses! Kirban undoubtedly interprets Revelation 19 quite literally!Intellectually weak like all the rest of this genre!"},{"Title":"666","review":"I'm not a critic or writer, but I think that every person who is a Christian and cares about someone they're not sure is saved, should have a copy of this book. I have read the Left Behind series. I read this book the first time about 15 years ago. What matters about this book is that, 1. The title gets the attention of anyone who sees it - who doesn't know the significance of the number 666; and 2. it only takes a few minutes for the person who IS left behind to figure it out - time enough to pray hard and get ready for what is to come."},{"Title":"666","review":"the its the great book i ever readed in my lifeand its weird but ok."},{"Title":"Dean's Domain: The Inside Story of Dean Smith and His College Basketball Empire","review":"I have been a tarheel fan for my whole life, I met &quot;THE MAN&quot; as a kid.

Probably no one else could read the whole thing. You will remember each game from your own perspective but Chansky gives you the details from behind the scenes. Many tid-bits and juicy morsals to satisfy your curiosity about the program and about the man. If you like Smith, this book will affirm your respect for him. If you don't like him, this book will not change your mind. Smith is presented mostly sympathetically, but his flaws are too numerous to hide, yet for the true fan, they are expected and when seen within the contaxt of his life, they are forgivable. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Also, I recently read &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; about Jordan. There is no redundancy here."},{"Title":"Dean's Domain: The Inside Story of Dean Smith and His College Basketball Empire","review":"Nice companion piece to Smith's own memoirs (&quot;A Coach's Life&quot;). A less complete portrait of Smith's inner life and interests off the court than the autobiography, but a more complete, and in many ways a more compelling, account of his public life as coach/power broker of what amounts to a multimillion dollar franchise. In this sense it is more entertaining than Smith's book -- a more open treatment of the recruiting process (including the ones that got away), the management of the Nike contract, the rivalry with Duke etc.Like the Smith book, it at times gets bogged down in season by season recapitulations of win-loss records. It also includes some material (such as a few paragraphs on the murder of Michael Jordan's father) which presumably are worth mentioning, but don't really fit into the thematic or narrative flow, and seem to be inserted in a kind of obligatory fashion. But these are quibbles.Unfortunately, the book ends with Smith's retirement and the installation of his hand-picked successor, Bill Guthridge, and, as a consequence, misses the surely interesting story of Guthridge's resignation two years later, and Smith and Guthridge's apparent inability to again stage manage the selection of the next long-run leader of the Carolina men's basketball program. Nevertheless an interesting and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Dean's Domain: The Inside Story of Dean Smith and His College Basketball Empire","review":"Art Chansky has been a close associatr of the Carolina Basketball program for yaers.

Also, I grew up Catholic just like the author. So I eagerly read this book. A big disappointment. This is not a story of adolescent anguish, or Catholic guilt, or rebelling against moral authority, or anything else one can identify with. It is an account of the progress of a psyvhiatric disorder. If the author were Jewish, or Bible Christian, or communist in his upbringing, the symbolism used would have been different. But still, this is an inner, medical disturbance, not an artistic struggle.Not a search for religious identity. Not something I can identify with."},{"Title":"Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations: Second Edition, Version 2.1 (Stochastic Modelling and Applied Probability)","review":"This book covers EXACTLY what the title promises. The approach to stochastic integration is a bit different from other books I have read, but very intuitive, general and understandable.The proofs of the theorems are generally quite easy to understand, but do not lack rigor at all - quite the opposite.The prerequisites in probability theory are quite modest, however some understanding of measure theory (at least on an intuitive level) is helpful. Some knowledge of stochastic processes (such as maertingales...) also facilitates the reading of the book.Overall, it is quite amazing how Prof. Protter manages to explain deep subjects rigorously, yet very understandably!The book contains a \\"normal\\" amount of typos, but almost all are harmless - they do not affect the understanding at all.The only draw-back to the serious researcher might be the large number of French language references."},{"Title":"Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations: Second Edition, Version 2.1 (Stochastic Modelling and Applied Probability)","review":"This review is about the material quality of the printing in the copy I received. This is not about the content.I have access to a copy of this second edition (third corrected printing, 2005) in my office. It is the usual Springer high quality hardcover: it has a matte cover with texture, beautifully bound; the paper inside is high-quality, very soft and slightly off-white; and the printing of the text is very sharp. The version I received from Amazon claimed to be exactly the same, but was very different:- The hardcover was shiny, did not have texture, and had a natural tendency to bend strongly outwards;- The paper inside is whiter, horribly white;- The text printing looks like a photocopy of the original.It looks and feels like a cheap knock-off photocopy done in a backyard. They didn't even bother changing the information about the printing including the 'Printed in Germany' and 'Printed on acid-free paper'.When I pay a lot of money for a hardcover edition I want the real thing, not a cheap knock-off.

People like me are beginning to get bored with the same type of presentation in these books over the past few years.Fortunately, this book is a bit different. The author managed to present the point of each variation in a comprehensive manner, suitable for intermediate and advanced players. You will see a lot of helpful comments in this book explaining black's problems in most of variations. He is not shy of his opinion either. He boldly stated the positional 9.Nd5 could not present a significant advantage for white compared with the 9.Bxf6 variation. A statement which I tend to agree with him. The discussion on piece sacrifice variations show that white's chance is not worse, a fact that is not often mentioned in other sveshnikov sicilian books.On the negative side, Some critical variations are not lengthy enough, the author seems to concentrate on popular variations. It may not be the book for beginners to play sveshnikov sicilian, but it is recommended for those who want to study it further with some basic knowledges."},{"Title":"The Complete Sveshnikov Sicilian","review":"I have nearly every Sveshnikov book written in English as well as some software programs that cover it. If you play the Sveshnikov you must have this book. It is better than all the rest, including Sveshnikov's original work. The author plays the Sveshnikov, he covers all the variations with his own new ideas revealed and gives verbal explanations for players new to the Sveshnikov, or to give the reader a deeper understanding. When I first saw it I immediately bought it at full price plus sales tax. I can't think of any other chess book in the last 5 years that got me so excited. If you are below 1800 USCF the opening is probably too difficult for you to play, but it leads to entertaining and instructive play. Yakovich has written the definitive work for years to come! All chess books should be so well done. Bravo Grand Master!"},{"Title":"The Complete Sveshnikov Sicilian","review":"Let me describe what this book is and isnt.This book is an examination of practicaly every possible variation that can occur in the sveshnikov. Yuri then gives very accurate assesments of moves which are based on his experience playing this opening for many years. The analysis is dead on, I havent found any mistakes and I have looked.This book is not a book where you can get ideas about where to search for an advantage against the sveshnikov. Its clear Yuri believes black is fine in every single main line. It is moderatly verbose for a chess book.Conclusion: This book is the authority on the sveshnikov hands down."},{"Title":"The Complete Sveshnikov Sicilian","review":"This is a very good book on the Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian Defence. In this defence, Black plays ...e5, weakening her d6 pawn and her d5 square, but by doing so gets more time to develop her pieces. And for those who want to turn the tables on White, this is a perfect variation for Black if she likes launching King-side attacks!While this book does describe the Sveshnikov from both sides of the table, it does have more of a focus on Black than I'd like. You see, I do not play the Sveshnikov for Black. Instead, I play it for White, sacrificing a piece on move 11, which gives me some tactical threats, as well as a strategic threat to Queen my a-pawn.Well, what advice does this book have on how to play White?1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 e5 6 Ndb5 d6 (6...h6?! 7 Nd6+) 7 Bg5 a6 (7...Be6? 8 Nd5) 8 Na3 (This looks ugly positionally, but it's best) 8...b5! (The Sveshnikov; 8...Be6 9 Nc4 Rc8 10 Nd5 Bxd5 11 Bxf6 is Bird's variation) 9 Bxf6 (Yakovich has over 75 pages on 9 Nd5, but he thinks 9 Bxf6 is best for White here, and I certainly agree) 9...gxf6 (9...Qxf6 10 Nd5 Qd8 11 c4) 10 Nd5 f5 (obviously not 10 ...Ne7 11 Nf6 mate. 10...Bg7 11 Bd3 Ne7 12 Nxe7 Qxe7 13 c4 f5 14 0-0 0-0 is the Novosibirsk variation, and Yakovich recommends 15 Qf3 or 15 Qh5 for White here).White now has a bunch of options, which the book devotes 96 pages to. 11 Bxb5, 11 exf5, and 11 Bd3 are the most popular. The author considers 11 Bd3 the most natural move, but does say that 11 Bxb5 is good too, and I now think that 11 Bxb5 is the best try for White. After 11 Bxb5 axb5 12 Nxb5 Ra7, Yakovich advises 13 Nxa7 Nxa7 14 exf5 Nb5 15 a4. But Black generally plays 12...Ra4, giving White the choice of 13 Nbc7+ (which seems okay) or 13 b4 (which may be better).After 13 b4, Yakovich explains that Black can try for an immediate draw with 13...Qh4 14 0-0 Rg8 15 c3 f4 16 Qxa4 Rxg2+ 17 Kxg2 Qg4+. That's fine if White wants a draw, but I wish Yakovich had given some advice here in case White wants more than this. He does mention 16 Nf6+ (instead of 16 Qxa4), but I feel that Black has at least a draw here. In 2002, as the author says, Shirov tried 15 f4 Kd8 16 c3 Ra6 17 a4 fxe4 against Kasparov. Kasparov won easily after that. But I think White ought to look for something better than this! In my next skittles game in this line, maybe I'll try something like 15 f4 Kd8 16 c3 Ra6 17 exf5, with the idea of answering 17...Bxf5 with 18 Ne3 Bd7 19 Nxd6 Bxd6 20 Qxd6. Wish me luck!Of course, Black may not be satisfied with a draw in the position after 13...Qh4. Yakovich tells us what Black can do instead, namely 13 ...Rxb4 14 Nbc7+ Kd7 15 0-0 Rb7 (15...Rg8 16 Qh5 is unclear) 16 Qh5 Ne7 17 Qxf7 Rxc7 18 Nb6+ Kc6 19 Rab1. Here, the author indicates that White is doing fine after 19...Ba6 20 Qb3, so he has two possible recommendations for Black, 19...Ra7 and 19...Kb7. Um, if anyone tries 19...Ra7 against me, they'll be in for a shock: 20 Qc4+ Kb7 21 Nd7+ Qb6 22 Rxb6+ Ka8 23 Rb8 mate. That leaves 19...Kb7. Once again, I wish Yakovich had given us some more advice here. White could try putting both Rooks and maybe the Queen on that b-file, or try 20 Nd5+ Ka7 21 Nxc7, or both, and my wild guess is that White ought to be able to get at least a draw that way. By the way, this whole line can lead to an endgame where White has, say, a Queen and 5 pawns against a Rook, Bishop, Knight, and 3 pawns, so if you want to get into all this, learn that endgame!As a Candidate Master, I played a Sveshnikov game with White against a Master. But I played 11 Nxb5 (which Yakovich says loses for White) instead of 11 Bxb5. One problem is that one is left with a Bishop, which doesn't cooperate as well with one's Queen as a Knight.My game went 11 Nxb5?! axb5 12 Bxb5 Bd7 (12...Bb7 is probably better) 13 exf5 Bg7. My strategic threat is to Queen my a-pawn, and I now think White's best chance is 14 0-0 0-0 15 c3. Then my threat of a4 is real (if 15...Rb8 16 a4). I'm also threatening to play Nb6 or Nc7 if Black moves his Queen away.However, not liking 14 0-0 Nd4, I played 14 a4? Nd4 15 Bxd7+ Qxd7 16 c3 Qxf5? (After 16...Ra5?! 17 Ne3 Nxf5 18 Qg4 Nxe3 19 Qxg7 Nxg2+ 20 Qxg2 Rxa4, White is okay. But 16...Qb7 17 Ne3 0-0 18 0-0 Nb3 is better for Black. Even here, I might have survived with a line such as 19 Ra3 Rfb8 20 Qg4 Kh8 21 Rd1. Black's actual move simply loses, so I said a silent prayer of thanks to Caissa and castled.) 17 0-0 e4 (I expected 17...Ne6 18 a5, but Black figured that this was hopeless and chose to try a desperate cheapo.) 18 Ne3 (I feared that 18 Nc7+ would get me mated, so I settled for something that I was sure would win.) 18...Qc5 19 cxd4 Bxd4 20 Qg4 Kf8 21 Rac1 Qa7? (makes it even easier for me) 22 Rc8+ Rxc8 23 Qxc8+ Kg7 24 Qg4+ Kf8 25 Rc1 Black ResignsI highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Sveshnikov Sicilian","review":"This is a very good book, written by a GM who has played the defence for years. Compared to Aagaard's work on the Sveshnikov, Yakovich provides more variations and obviously knows a great deal more about this variation of the Sicilian than does Aagaard. On the other hand the latter does a better job explaining basic ideas for white and black.Excellent books on openings use that opening as a medium to teach about chess in general. The Sveshnikov variation is a fascinating learning tool because of the tension between pawn-structure and dynamic piece-play. Yakovich does not discuss this much and four stars is therefore enough.If you are a medium rated player (above at least 1800) who have not played this variation before - buy Aagard first, then Yakovich."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"Magnificant book!

It's an interesting and memorable read and a nice one to add to your shelf if you're interested in judeo-christian religions."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"When I first bought this book from Amazon, there were not any reviews posted about it and I bought it on a gamble hoping that it would have what I needed. That gamble was beyond worth it!I have been working on a book and one of the subjects that I was trying to tackle was to defend Eve against the historical demonizing of her that has gone on over the millenia. I knew with certainty that various theologians from the early centuries of the Church, such as Tertullian, had perpetuated this concept, but I needed more sources to expand my study. This book provided that and more.This book is a collection of Biblical sources, extra-Biblical sources (such as Jubilees), collections of Jewish Midrash, the Talmud, other Jewish writers during the advent of Christianity, early Christian theologians (such as Tertulian, John Chrysostom, and Augustine), Medieval Jewish and Christian writings (such as Saint Thomas Aquinas), Islamic writings, Protestant Reformation/Revolt era writings (i.e. Martin Luther and John Calvin), and many more up to the present. The book collects translations of these many texts as well as commentaries on the context of the writings and their writers. As a historian, these primary sources are a pivotal resource! Moreover, collected together as they are in one volume, this saves the researcher a lot of time searching for them.But now that I have finally had the chance to write a review about this book, I have found that there are others who have already beaten me to the punch on being the first to review this book. In regards to what one reviewer said about this book being boring, if you are a historian who is enthralled with this subject, this book is far from boring! (If you are not a historian, then you might be bored because this book is collected together in a scholastic format that seems to be primarily aimed at historians.) In addition, there was another reviewer who said that he/she wished that there were more heretical writings to compliment the orthodox ones. In regards to that I find a few problems with that idea: (1) These are for the most part orthodox writings in the nature of their content and if one wants to do a thorough study from an orthodox viewpoint, it is better to limit the collection to writings that are primarily orthodox in their content; (2) This volume is so dense with material that to also include an extensive collection of heretical materials would require a second volume of material; (3) Since this book focuses on the many (and even conflicting) orthodox traditions of Adam and Eve, heretical writings are not needed for study in this context because that their nature of being heretical did not have influence on the orthodox mindset of the times; (4) If someone wants to read the heretical writings about this subject (such as from the Gnostics, the Arians, the Modalists, etc.), then one should not limit one's self to studying only one book for reference. In fact, as a resource for my own research, this is only one book of many that I have used to study; it is a VERY important book used in my research, but it is only one of many. Thus, in defense of the editors in the context of what the other reviewer mentioned about the desire for there also being an inclusion of heretical writings, I politely suggest to that reviewer and to anyone else that if they want to study on the heretical perspective of this subject that you find a work of an identical nature that focuses just on that.In summation, this is a wonderful book for reference, whether you are religious or not. If you are looking for a collection of primary sources about Adam and Eve written by (though translated from) the original writers, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"I'm not going to say it's a bad book. There are very few books that draw together so many fine and seminal pieces of literature and play them against one another so well. It's a fine book.There are, however, features of the book which are just maddening. Did ancient religious scholars stop to question the historicity of Genesis 1-3? No, out of enlightened self-interest (and a strong wish to avoid being executed as an apostate) they did not. As the modern inheritors of that legacy, we are not quite so bound up in the literal. I think the editors, all very capible, might have included more material from the mythological, metaphysical, and allegorical readings of creation and fall.It is an exceptional book as it is--but it could be a real masterwork if some slightly more heretical material were included."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"Eve & Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender by Linda S. Schearing (Editor), Valarie H. Ziegler (Editor), Kristen E. Kvam (Editor) is, indeed, a collection of proses and commentaries on Genesis and Gender. So if you are looking for a relaxing yet informative book about Adam and Eve (sorry! \\"Eve and Adam\\") to read on the beach or while visiting your in-laws, do not consider this book.This is a serious, academic (to the point of near boredom!) book that demonstrates \\"the remarkable hold the story of Eve and Adam has on the Western imagination\\".So why four stars? I gave four stars because the book did not meet my objective-a relaxing read on Adam and Eve. Why not three star then? I did not give a three star rating because the book provided some serious information about the sad nature of gender discrimination.Recommended as a good reference."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"I had to read this book for a class, and I actually enjoyed reading it! It analyzes various questions that pertain to us even today such as: how do and perhaps, how should, men and women relate to each other (and how they were related before). It gave various examples of how the same story in Genesis was interpreted by people during different eras so drastically distinct. Admittedly, I didn't read the whole book, but maybe when I have more time, I actually will finish it.So, if you want to know more about how society interpreted sacred texts to justify their beliefs(specifically about gender/race), it does an awesome job of explaining that."},{"Title":"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender","review":"Great transaction, speedy shipping, & the book is in excellent condition.

The stream of conscious narrative was an interesting perspective on the mind of a young boy. Overall, though, I wasn't engaged by the story, which didn't seem to go anywhere, nor by the inner life of the boy, which was too undeveloped to draw me in.Probably best for people deeply interested in New York or Jewish immigrant life at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Having been an English major in college, I know this is the kind of book that English profs love to teach. This is also the kind of book that I think is best enjoyed in an English class setting, because I didn't get much out of it on my own, despite my English studies background. I was constantly plagued by the annoying nature of David, a sissy mama's boy who is terrified of anything and everything in the world. The story moved slowly and some of the language was hard to wade through. Like I said, this is best read in a classroom/discussion setting."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I certainly couldn't top the review by A. Ross posted on this site. He hits all the points that make this such a ridiculously bad book. The syrupy, drippy, silly, overwrought, over-the-top, overly melodramatic, bad writing in this book is laughable at times. And it goes on and on and on, tediously pretentious for a mind numbing 440 pages or so. The young protagonist is one of the most annoying characters i have ever experienced in a novel. in fact, there is almost nothing I liked about this gigantic bore of a book. of the 2000 books i have read, i would put this in my 10 worst category."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Took me forever to get through, slow and difficult to follow"},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"This, for me, captures the pure terror that often attends childhood, and the process of dealing with things you can't understand. It's also a brilliant evocation of the alienation of the Jewish experience-- you can't really compare it, as one of my fellow reviewers did, to the experiences of other ethnic groups. The Scherls are a family profoundly alienated from everyone else-- which serves to heighten the terror. This book is written in a stream-of-consciousness style that is really brilliant in that it is completely convincing and totally natural on the part of the author-- it never seems forced-- and in that it beautifully evokes the thought process of childhood. I read this when I was very young and it has stuck with me ever since-- it helped me to understand the feelings of my own childhood."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"My hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and I was not disappointed. As with the best historical fiction, I was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting, but its effect on the main characters, especially David, the main protagonist.While the prose is often challenging and innovative, the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that I could not put down. While I was often frustrated by David's inner dialogue, the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child's mind, how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another. The author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion, namely the contrast between early 20th century New York slang, composed of so many different ethnic groups, to the authors \\"translation\\" of Eastern European Yiddish.For anyone currently reading the novel, who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot, my advice is to keep reading, as its themes of alienation, growing self-awareness, family, sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses. And for those who have yet to read the book, I strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you've finished the book, as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the Afterword. Regardless, it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Henry Roth wants to do two things well in this book: first, accurately describe the experience of being a child -- not a tough, bully-type child, but a shy kid with no friends. (I can relate.) Secondly, he wants to capture the language spoken by native New Yorkers and by immigrants to the city.It might be best to explain the book's trick as \\"inside versus outside.\\" Most of the time, we stand in a position of semi-omniscience, much like in Crime and Punishment: while the godlike narrator in Crime and Punishment could see inside Raskolnikov's head and no one else's, we are allowed into David Schearl's mind while he wanders terrified through the world. David understands perfectly well why he's so scared, and by the end so do we -- but we also understand why he can't explain his terror to anyone else. We are trapped in the child's head with him. It's been a very long time -- probably since I was David's age -- since I've remembered those feelings.The language of New York's Jewish ghettoes in Call It Sleep also has an inside and an outside, and Roth's great trick is to pull us so deeply into that world that it's a slap on the face when we're back outside. The immigrants talk to one another in their native Yiddish, in which there's great poetry and biblical allusion (as well as more than a few \\"may your remaining days be dark\\"-type curses). We're steeped in that world. Only occasionally do the immigrants step outside and talk haltingly with, say, a local policeman. They are shy, awkward, and adrift. Roth is so ingenious in the delivery that we feel their shyness and awkwardness as though it were our own.It's rare to find a book that is so committed to its characters. Roth has no ulterior motive. He just wants to introduce us to this little community and its little people. If we happen to see larger meanings or other people in those he depicts, it's accidental. That sort of devotion to character is extremely rare. I can only imagine how absorbed in the characters Roth must have been, if he drew his reader in that completely."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I read this book many years ago, in college, and remember enjoying it thoroughy. I have recently heard it read (Recorded Books, Inc.) by the incomparable George Guidall, who seems to read books requiring Yiddish phrases/accents particularly well (try Stanley Elkin's &quot;Mrs. Ted Bliss&quot; for a hilarious and compassionate thrill).I was not disappointed this second time around, having matured myself, both as a reader and a writer. One of the most striking aspects of the novel is Roth's obvious love of women; few novels by men present women in such a truly beloved light. David's aunt - something of a shrew, a harridan, and a slob - is nevertheless incredibly good-hearted - and alive! Now I want to know more about Henry Roth. Does anyone know if there is a biography of this great writer available? Also, I noticed that there is a book of essays about &quot;Call It Sleep.&quot; I plan to get it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"This sad, wonderfully written book of tormented immigrants at he turn of the last century from the eyes of an 8 year old child, is vivid and painful. A portrayal of the growth of a youngster, and the gradual revelation of the source of his pain is not easy reading. Roth's power of description of people and scenes are like verbal photographs. This is a work of art."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"According to Amazon, I bought this novel four years ago and for the life of me I actually don't remember what made me buy it.I do that a lot, I have a very long queue of things to read and so it's not uncommon for me to buy something and then file it away for several years until I finally get a chance to get around to it. So who knows what prompted me to purchase it, as I don't really fall into what one might consider a person who this book would resonate the most with. As you can tell by my last name, I'm not Jewish and I didn't grow up anywhere near the 1930s. Yet this book captures the feel of being alive in all its glory and terror (mostly terror) than anything I've read in a while. It's a vibrant work that seethes with the pulse of a city and a child, sometimes the two of them acting in concert and sometimes the two of them opposed.It tells the story of a Jewish family, the Schaerls, who have come over to make lives in New York City. David is a young child, his mother a gentle woman and his father a rather . . . intense man, let's just say. The plot isn't so much a plot as a coming of age tale, as David experiences life and starts to explore the world outside their apartment, the dirty city streets, the collision of people and language, the terror of separation and attempting to find his place in a world that he doesn't fit into very well.If nothing else, this novel manages to simultaneously capture not only the experience of Jewish immigrants but the feel of growing up. David's father Albert seems like a man who is aware that culturally he's a Star of David shaped peg trying to fit into a round hole, and the constant tension that results from that causes him to constantly rage at a world that isn't necessarily fair to begin with and seems doubly unfair to him. His effect on David is tremendous and balanced out by the sheer gentleness of his mother, who adores him.But if the story was just about growing up and being Jewish it wouldn't be that remarkable. What is remarkable is how Roth literally puts us into the perspective of this family and filters the world to us through them. The language churns and leaps and shouts, shifting unexpectedly into a stream of consciousness, as David's thoughts whisk back and forth, rarely focusing and coming at us in cascades of short sentences. Even more interesting, he chooses to render all the dialogue that would be Yiddish in plain English while rendering the English and other languages into a phonetic form, meaning that to us our own language becomes something alien, where we really get a feel for how the Schearls experience the world, where even the words have to be puzzled over for their meaning. It's amazing, not only in how vividly it conveys this world, but how easy it is to read once one gets the hang of it. It makes some sections difficult, especially when all the children are talking but it also comes closer to giving us these people's lives than anything else.Through it all, David tries to learn what it means to be Jewish, tries to learn what his family is about, tries to learn how to live in a world that shifts just out of reach as soon as he starts to adapt to it. His world seems both small and expansive, with the city streets of New York becoming the size of fields, where two avenues over can take you to another planet entirely.It all comes together in a chapter that seems to be a complete mess at first and then suddenly all the various shards fuse into something brilliant, all the voices of the city mingling, thoughts mingling, symbolism mingling, in one virtuoso effect that makes you sad that Roth only seemed to write one proper novel, as nothing else he's ever done really seems to approach the scope and intimacy of this. It leaps into voices and minds and into gutters and cellars and rooftops. It takes the world that we know and first turns it into something alien and new, and then manages over the course of the book to turn it into something familiar. I'll never know what it's really like to grow up Jewish, the traditions, the pressures, the sense of being an outsider, the twin tensions of wanting to maintain your culture and become part of this new world. I'll never know these things, as a third generation American citizen. But thanks to a book written when my grandparents were children, I have some idea on how to start understanding it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I discovered Henry Roth serendipidiously--by purchasing a used copy of &quot;Call It Sleep&quot; from a street merchant on West 4th Street in New York while I was a student at NYU. His writing completely and utterly captivated me--the beautiful (yet simple) lyricism of his prose, and his ability to capture and preserve an era gone by...&quot;Call It Sleep&quot; is truly one of the great American novels of all time--brilliant in every respect, it deserves its rightful place in the Western Canon as one of the greatest 20th century literary works. I continually re-read &quot;Call it Sleep&quot;--as well as his recent &quot;Mercy of A Rude Stream&quot; cycle of works. Roth's passing in 1995 was a truly sad time for me and for contemporary American literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Henry Roth was a truly talented writer and I feel frustrated as a reader that there are only a few books of his to read. However, \\"Call it Sleep,\\" is a wonderfully full and vibrant novel about a poor Eastern European Jewish family that settles in the Lower East Side slums of New York. David is the protagonist, a small, fearful, and imaginative boy who must contend with the fast moving intensity and danger as a foreigner in New York. He is surrounded by moving characters, such as his brutish and impatient father, who struggles to support his family or Aunt Bertha, the sanguine flirt who represents the peace and comfort of the old world. I don't ordinarily enjoy these kinds of sociological novels, but Roth is able to conjure up breathtaking images, and he paints his canvas with fascinating dialects with encompass the multi-culturism of American life. \\"Call it Sleep,\\" is truly a neglected piece of depression-era literature."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Mandatory reading for anyone who can read. Roth belongs alongside Faulkner, Dos Passos, and Joyce. Call it Sleep is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. Tight, turbulent, and heartbreakingly gorgeous. The author squeezes poetry from the tiniest, grittiest of experiences; the reader is allowed so far inside the head of David Shearl it is almost as if he or she travels the same intimate, painful path to awakening-an awakening at once political, sexual, and religious."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I read this book several years ago as an American Studies major at Penn State University. At first I began to read it only because it was a requirement of my major, but this quickly became one of my favorite books I've read in my studies. The story is of a young jewish boy, being brought up in a ethnically diverse New York City. It is about his grappling with his spirituality, and his perceptions of the world. One thing I learned about the Jewish culture is of its strong patriarchy, and this book shows conflicts that arise between father and son, and how a son can almost never live up to his father's expectations. The story is haunting, and the landscapes are vivid and picturesque. I also recommend a similar book, &quot;Bread Givers&quot;, by Anzia Yezierska."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Call It Sleep is a powerful story about a young Jewish immigrant boy who seeks to find his own identity amidst the cultural disarray of early 20th century America. In the novel, Roth reveals the sacrifice immigrants must make in order to assimilate into the American culture. Essentially, the novel is about a shift from an old way of life to a new way. Capturing the heart of this theme is Reb Yidel Pankower. As this rabbi ponders the condition of his pupils, he realizes that they do not understand who they are and what has happened to their people. In a sense, the rabbi mourns because he feels that the Jewish culture is inevitably dying in America. He refers to this as being &quot;an evil day&quot; (p. 375)."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Call It Sleep, the first novel of Henry Roth, is the book that must be be next in your life. To get pedantic about it, Call It Sleep is the logical (don't think about it -- logic has little to do with the visceral impact) outgrowth of the lessons of novel-craft as demonstrated in James Joyce's Ulysses (read Roth's later books, Mercy of a Rude Stream et al. to find out more). No literate person should neglect this striking work. It is another example (and perhaps the finest) of how the simple is the most complex; its story will find that part of you that needs to hear it most and you will never be sorry. Blah Blah -- THE AMERICAN NOVEL. READ IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Bought this book for book club.

Don't recommend because I don't like any of the characters."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"An immigrant child's inside view of his own terrifying world is at the heart of this book. The author uses a stream-of- consciousness technique and creates a unique English Yiddish poetic language through which the world is seen. The child's relation to his distant father, the cruelty the child suffers is movingly portrayed .So too his encounters with the world , search for love, meetings with women.The pains of an immigrant world, of trying to find one's way in a strange land, are also vividly portayed here.True literature burns through every line of this work."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being \\"the other\\". Trying to say the \\"New York Jewish immigrant experience\\" is representative of the \\"immigrant experience\\" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't \\"get it\\". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, \\"indulged in incest\\" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: \\"Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition.\\" Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously \\"hearing\\" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"The book came faster than I expected and in excellent shape. I read this book many years ago, and I wanted to read it again. I love it."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Call It Sleep was published in 1934, but is set between 1907-1917. The father of the family had immigrated from Germany and the novel opens with the arrival of his wife and son. The story is recounted through the boy, David's eyes. He is very impressionable and sensitive, and his father's animosity aggravates his sensitive nature. Adjusting to life in New York's slums is a challenge. Roth's writing was unique in its use of Yiddish and vernacular speech for dialogue and the scenes that are described are evocative.David's father has a very belligerent character and doubts that David is actually his own son. Because of this doubt he treats his wife and son cruelly. His cruelty, Roth implies, pushes the mother and son to be unnaturally loving and close. Frequently David's love for his mother seems to cross over into a sexualized feeling. There are frequent references to his mother's bosom, jealousy of a family friend who attempts to seduce her, etc. For example, after an upsetting incident David says: \\"'Mama! Mama! Mama!' Only the sheltering valley between her breasts muffled his scream of fear to her heart.\\"Or earlier,\\"With knees drawn up, David watched her wipe the linoleum beneath his chair. The shadow between her breasts, how deep! How far it - No! No! Luter! When he looked! That night! Mustn't! Mustn't! Look away! Quick!\\"The relationship between David and his mother (who's name, Genya, is used rarely) appears to not be healthy, and until the end of the novel the reader wonders if David will end up having a mental breakdown as he does not seem functional. He also does not seem like a realistic 4-12 year old boy.[...]"},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I struggled through this whole thing but finally finished it. I don't think it was worth the effort.As for capturing the Jewish experience in America, I don't believe Roth did anything that wasn't done much more brilliantly 19 years later with Augie March.But while that book is entertaining as well as gripping, you're going to find this a slog. Roth is very serious about capturing the dialect of his various urban characters . . . and I don't mean capturing the \\"flavor,\\" but the actual dialect.Here are a few unaltered examples:1. \\"My ticher calls id Xmas, bod de kids call id Chrizmas.

Roth chose to use a 7 year old boy to narrate his story, thus making it more visceral and intense. Roth takes advantage of a 7 year old's state of mind and innocence, to portray the mid-childhood experience in a NY City East Side tenement ghetto.Though Roth happened to choose a Jewish part of the ghetto to portray in his story, the true beauty and excellence of the book, is that the story could have taken place in any one of the ghettos of New York City. It can easily be generalized to the Irish immigrant experience, or the Chinese immigrant experience, or the Italian immigrant experience or virtually any other immigrant experience at that time. All of those immigrants experienced this cultural mixing and its attendant discriminations as immigrants in New York City in the 1920's and 1930's.Roth published his book in the midst of the depression in 1934. But it came to real prominence when printed in paperback in 1964. The books true appeal is that it is universal to all Americans, except Native American Indians. All of the rest of Americans immigrated somewhere in their past. And thus, whether one be an immigrant today, or a 1st generation American or 2nd or 3rd, even if our ancestors came over on the Mayflower, we are all immigrants somewhere in our past.Even if one's ancestors were Pilgrims, parts of Roth's book would ring true for them as well. Through the use of intricate analysis of the thoughts of Roth's main character, he portrays those innate emotions that we have all experienced, and from time to time, continue to experience.The book is highly informative, highly emotional and highly entertaining. It reads very quickly, and is written impeccably. \\"Call It Sleep\\" is truly one book that all Americans should have in their collection."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"I tried four or five times over forty years to read this book and failed - till now. Why in my 70's did it finally grip me! And grip me it did. The angry bitterness of the father, Albert, the yielding supportiveness of the mother, Genya - all the side characters, each adding something to one's sense of life, one's sense of the human condition.The immigrant English was perfect. Still better, the way the children talked opens sealed portals of our past. What I loved were passing sensory descriptions, the sound of a boat horn in the night, luminous shadows of buildings, moment to moment sensations that are heavy one moment, turn into airy nothing the next. A combination of James Joyce and Yiddish drama. For dramatic it is, and in a style those of us who remember Yiddish theater will recognize.Most of all for me was the penetration of darkness and the ways the protagonist sought Light. Even if it meant almost electrocuting himself to achieve ultimate union with God, much as Aaron's sons did.If I wrote such a novel as a young man, as Henry Roth did, I can see that I would have a hard time writing another or writing at all. I'm left more than breathless, more than forlorn. Scarred with recognition of the human plight, commingling hope and hell."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"A 1934 novel depicting life in pre-World War II New York City, Henry Roth cleverly utilizes the young and impressionable mind of David Schearl to explain the complexities interwoven with great simplicities of the 7 year old's life.The book commences with an introduction to his father who left for the promised land to earn enough money to achieve financial capabilities to deliver his wife and toddler son. The meeting is less than warm and could be explained as reproachful and with disdain.Fast forwarding a few years, the book delivers us to Manhattan kids in Jewish ghetto and how their thick accents contradict and compliment the eastern European or Germanic accents of the parents.This is really a KosherAngela's Ashes; or since it predates Ashes,Angela's Ashesis an Irish Call It Sleep. Like the ever successfulAngela's Ashes; , the poor kid in the big city offers hope in the doldrums of the gray life delivered by the \\"hood\\" or poverty.The mind of young David warps - either through constant exposure to the city's ever-emitting poisons, or through a fermenting process experienced when exposed to the city's vices. Innocent David loses innocence many times over. David's befriending Irish Leo winds up being a sexual violation upon his cousin Esther. He is bullied by adult men for some of his fathers milk cart's bottles, and then witnesses his father beat one of the crooks with a horse whip. He even sees good Jewish boys pull fast ones on Rabbi Reb Yidel at their Hebrew school. No one, no matter how young, no matter what their faith, no matter what their gender, is immune to what David experiences. This New York is the equivalent to Upton Sinclair'sThe Jungle.In the end, David speaks to himself in mumble jumble, garbled think speech, through a very awkward stream of consciousness. Hard to read, it is the author's valiant depiction of the broken psyche of David's whose book-ending act is either a product of contemplated act, or youthful ignorance. You hope for the latter, but cannot rule out the former.In any event, he must escape the world in which he lives, at least for part of the time. And, his mother cuddles him to take a nap, have some rest so that he can forget about what happened. Or what is happening about him. And, he shuts his eyes to this tranquil retreat within the borders of the city's chaotic atmosphere, and placates his mind and body in a restful feeling - one that \\". . . he might as well call it sleep.\\" And, enjoy it he should, as in only a few years, his Austrian relatives and many more are going to experience much worse than what he has had to endure in America."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"When Henry Roth's novel Call it Sleep was published in 1934 it was hailed by some critics and readers as a minor masterpiece. Indeed, this is one of the best novels about our immigrant experience. Mr. Roth's compassion for his characters, his intense narrative force, and his wonderful ear for dialectic speech and poetry is evident throughout Call it Sleep. A simple story of an immigrant Jewish family during the years 1911 to about 1913, it centers on a boy named David Schearl, who lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, his feuding parents, his street friends and some relatives. At times its scenes of domestic strife may get wearisome to the reader, but then Roth introduces the colorful Aunt Bertha, who has a different temperament than David's gentle mother, and the fireworks begin. She is a loud, course, stout and an outspoken woman who never hesitates to stand up to her sister's bitter, argumentative husband. Their hard life reaches a climax during an ugly family fight wherein David, fearing his father's rage, runs away. He soon finds himself hiding in a train yard, but comes close to being electrocuted. He survives his harrowing experience and is brought home to his worried parents.The beauty of Call it Sleep lies in Mr. Roth's power of description and his deep understanding of people. The images he conjures of his old Lower East Side neighborhood, its struggling people, busy streets and loud sounds, its smells and relentless drama all come alive. Some readers may find this somewhat lengthy novel confusing at times, with several passages difficult to understand, and its dialog undecipherable when Roth weaves speech, narration and poetry into a confusing jumble, but Call it Sleep is terrific reading. An excellent introduction by Alfred Kazin and an afterward by Hanna Wirth-Nesher, a language scholar, proclaim it a masterpiece of language and literature. Most readers will happily agree."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Call it Sleep is a good book for a reader with patience.

The book became an addiction, one that I am glad to have experienced, but would not want to try again."},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"In Call It Sleep, David Schearl, the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, straddles between his Yiddish background and the American culture. The dialogues in the novel--Yiddish written in prose and English in dialect--highlight the clash and synthesis of the two worlds. It is the essential immigrant experience, to straddle between two cultures, to struggle with identity, and ultimately to reconcile and integrate the two into a new creation.Manhattan's Lower East Side has been a microcosm of the \\"melting pot\\" where Jews, Irish, Italians, Greeks, Chinese, Puerto Ricans and Russians mingle and yet retain their unique identities. Often, second and third generations move to more affluent neighborhoods, but this place remains \\"ground zero\\" for the dynamics of cultural synthesis.

I award this particular ROTH-ROTH pair a counterparts quotient of 10 out of 10. It's as if the very first double bar routine of the very first olympics had just earned a perfect score--pretty amazing! If you want, you can just skim the following bulleted list, but these things must, for the sake of history, be enumerated:*Both books were written by men name of Roth. (that's a freebee, but still.)*Both books take place during the time period in which the authors themselves were growing up (1910s in the case of Henry, 1940s in the case of Philip).*Both books are about Jewish families living in Jewish neighborhoods.*The protagonists of both books are children.*The protagonists are pretty much the authors themselves, to wit: the main character in Philip Roth's book is named \\"Philip Roth.\\" Henry *Roth's character was born the same year as Henry Roth and, like Henry, moved to the U.S. during infancy.*The fathers of these characters both lose their respectable dayjobs and end up working nights.*The fathers are both angry men, and both books feature climaxes involving these fathers beating up family members.*The protagonists of both books share an unreasoning fear of cellars.I found Call It Sleep amazing. It's the story of a family of Austrian-Jewish immigrants who live in New York tenement housing--a \\"daily struggles\\" sort of book. The characters were beautifully drawn, and the world rendered so deeply that by the end it seemed like I could just walk around in there. As I confessed to my wife afterwards, I sometimes have a chip on my shoulder when I read something written by someone younger than myself--but that chip melted instantly here (an ice chip), despite the fact that Roth wrote Sleep between the ages of 24 and 28.The Plot Against America was harder going. When I finished, it was with a sense of having toured a nice museum. I found myself thoughtfully stroking my chin and muttering, \\"Yes indeed--the work of a master...\\" I know this sounds dismissive, and it is a little bit, but I'm telling the truth, too. P. Roth rose to the challenge of a difficult narrative task--an alternative history of WWII in which Roosevelt was defeated in his bid for a third term by the aviator, isolationist, and anti-semite Charles Lindbergh. The action alternates between the daily life of the Roth family and the larger world stage of wartime politics. I kept thinking it wasn't going to work, but it lumbered on like an oblong wheel.The style of the two books had a lot to do with their effect on me, I think. Plot is related through a distant 1st person POV, and has the marked remove of memory, whereas Call It Sleep is told in a close third person that injects the reader right into the head of the protagonist. It's interesting to note that herein is proved the notion that an intimate 3rd person can be \\"closer\\" than a distant 1st person. I'd never really thought about that before. Here are two sample sentences in which the narrators reflect upon their shared fear of cellars:Plot:The cellar was a place bereft not just of a sunny window but of every human assurance, and when I came to study Greek and Roman mythology in a freshman high school class and read in the textbook about Hades, Cerberus, and the River Styx, it was always our cellar that I was reminded of.Sleep:The rats lived there, the hordes of nightmare, the wobbly faces, the crawling and misshapen things.(Next month perhaps I'll write Literary Counterparts as a child in close third person. \\"He looked upon the book, the words, crawling and misshapen things, I am but a boy of eight!\\")"},{"Title":"Call It Sleep","review":"Very few Jewish novels can dare lay claim as the best American Jewish work of fiction.

Once I was mastered reading the long sections written in dialect form, as well as the use Yiddish, I discovered an amazing novel.A breathtaking, horrifying, gorgeous novel: poem, journalism, stream of conscious, realist, psychological, social-impossible to define. I can't say I ever found it easier to read; I can say I found it impossible to stay away from. The only way I could read it was by becoming deeply immersed in it, reading carefully line by line, word by word even.The story is of a Jewish family, immigrants from Poland and one major theme of the text is the immigrant experience. They, as are most of the people living around them, are dislocated, cut off not only from family and friends and familiar landscapes but from their culture, their very language. Their speech is reproduced in dialect only when they are attempting to speak in English, in their native Yiddish the speech is rendered in perfect English, showing us their ease and eloquence in their mother tongue.The story is also that of the streets of the Lower East Side, surrounded by tenements, overcrowded, teeming with people, life, clashing cultures, children adrift in families unmoored from their past and still unattached to their brilliant. Poverty is almost the least of their problems. Dirt, smells, noise-unbelievable noise of trolleys and trains and people screaming-\\"hollering\\", a word I haven't heard since my father died, to each other, at each other, pushing, fighting. All I remember as a child shopping on Delancey Street on a Sunday (back then, only the Jewish stores on the Lower East Side of Manhattan were allowed to be open on Sundays and I remember the terrifying crowds, loud, shoving and my terror that I would be separated from my parents).The story is also a very personal one of three years in the life a boy (aged 6-9), whose father is often violent, paranoid to a clinical degree, who shouts, rages and beats the child who turns desperately to his gentle, adoring mother who, unable to speak English and thus even more isolated than the father, turns to her son as well as her emotional lifeline. The boy, David, is sensitive, gifted (very likely to some extent a portrait of the author, Henry Roth).Published originally in 1934, the book was barely noticed. It is now considered an American classic. I wish I could quote from the book but it seems impossible to convey its power through any one sentence or paragraph. The book works in rhythmic sections that in an almost musical way resonate off, contrast with, and highlight aspects of the work in a way that resists easy description.A difficult work still but one that pays off close reading many times over. This book was well worth the effort I put into reading it. I am grateful I did not give up on it, even after so many years.
