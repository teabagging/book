Traditional explanations of Sicily's instability depict a society trapped by a feudal past. Lucy Riall finds instead that many areas of the island were experiencing a period of rapid modernization, as local government increased their organizational efforts. Beginning with the period prior to the revolution of 1860, Dr Riall shows why successive attempts at political reform failed, and analyses the effects of this failure. She describes the bitter and violent conflict between rival elites and the mounting tide of peasant unrest which together threatened the status quo within the isolated communities of the Sicilian interior. Through an examination of the problems of local government - tax collection, conscription, the organization of policing - and of attempts to suppress peasant disturbances and control crime, she shows that the modernization of the Sicilian countryside both undermined the control of the central government and made the countryside itself more unstable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wZg4ecXXmNYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The deluge: An historical novel of Poland, Sweden and Russia ; a sequel to \\"With fire and sword\\"","description":"The peoples of Poland and Lithuania rally when the Swedes invade their countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1MqnCzsUBFoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crises of the Christ","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0BoWAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Attributes of God: A Journey into the Father's Heart","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Invention and Decline of Israeliness: State, Society, and the Military","description":"This work reexamines Israel in terms of its origins as a haven for a persecuted people and its evolution into a multi-cultural society.

John William Gardner In his classic treatise Self-Renewal, John W. Gardner examines why great societies thrive and die. He argues that it is dynamism, not decay, that is dramatically altering the landscape of American society. The twentieth century has brought about change more rapidly than any previous era, and with that came advancements, challenges, and often destruction. Gardner cautions that  a society must court the kinds of change that will enrich and strengthen it, rather than the kind of change that will fragment and destroy it.  A society s ability to renew itself hinges upon its individuals. Gardner reasons that it is the waning of the heart and spirit not a lack of material might that threatens American society. Young countries, businesses, and humans have several key commonalities: they are flexible, eager, open, curious, unafraid, and willing to take risks. These conditions lead to success. However, as time passes, so too comes complacency, apathy, and rigidity, causing motivation to plummet. It is at this junction that great civilizations fall, businesses go bankrupt, and life stagnates. Gardner asserts that the individual s role in social renewal requires each person to face and look beyond imminent threats. Ultimately, we need a vision that there is something worth saving. Through this vision, Gardner argues, society will begin to renew itself, not permanently, but past its average lifespan, and it will at once become enriched and rejuvenated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=djxODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tragic Menagerie (European Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Secrets from the Center of the World (Sun Tracks)","description":"\\"My house is the red earth; it could be the center of the world.\\" This is Navajo country, a land of mysterious and delicate beauty. \\"Stephen Strom's photographs lead you to that place,\\" writes Joy Harjo. \\"The camera eye becomes a space you can move through into the powerful landscapes that he photographs.

In the case of human brain evolution, the main environmental influence was adaptation to a 'shore-based' diet, which provided the world's richest source of nutrition, as well as a sedentary lifestyle that promoted fat deposition. Such a diet included shellfish, fish, marsh plants, frogs, bird's eggs, etc. Humans and, and more importantly, hominid babies started to get fat, a crucial distinction that led to the development of larger brains and to the evolution of modern humans. A larger brain is expensive to maintain and this increasing demand for energy results in, succinctly, survival of the fattest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9b5oDQAAQBAJ&dq=Survival+of+the+Fattest:+The+Key+to+Human+Brain+Evolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natives and Newcomers: The Cultural Origins of North America","description":"In the past thirty years historians have come to realize that the shape and temper of early America was determined as much by its Indian natives as it was by its European colonizers.

Natives and Newcomers is a collection of fifteen of his best and most influential essays, available for the first time in one volume. In accessible and often witty prose, Axtell describes the major encounters between Indians and Europeans--first contacts, communications, epidemics, trade and gift-giving, social and sexual mingling, work, cultural and religious conversions, military clashes--and probes their short- and long-term consequences for both cultures. The result is a book that shows how encounters between Indians and Europeans ultimately led to the birth of a distinctly American identity. Natives and Newcomers is an essential text for undergraduate and graduate courses in Colonial American history and Native American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y0HhwAEACAAJ&dq=Natives+and+Newcomers:+The+Cultural+Origins+of+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rich men, single women","description":"Three ambitious women forego their dead-end careers to move to Los Angeles and hunt for wealthy husbands","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkEt7cd_ITsC&dq=Rich+men,+single+women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mayors and Money: Fiscal Policy in New York and Chicago (American Politics and Political Economy Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"One Man's Justice","description":"In the morally ambiguous world of post-World War II Japan, Takuya, an officer in the former Imperial Army, becomes a fugitive in his own humiliated, defeated country when he believes that the occupying authorities have discovered his involvement in the execution of American prisoners-of-war. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dktkAAAAMAAJ&dq=One+Man%27s+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Execution of Justice","description":"This docudrama on the assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected public official in the country, is based on court transcripts and public record dramatising the trial of this controversial case.

This present work covers in-depth analysis on estimating SSN and its impact for CMOS based devices and systems. At present semiconductor industries are moving towards scaled CMOS devices and reduced supply voltage. SSN together with coupled noise may limit the packing density, and thereby the frequency of operation of packaged systems. Our goal is to provide efficient and yet reliable methodologies and algorithms to estimate the overall noise containment in single chip and multi-chip package assemblies. We hope that the techniques and results described in this book will be useful as guides for design, package, and system engineers and academia working in this area. Through this monograph, we hope that we have shown the necessity of interactions that are essential between chip design, system design and package design engineers to design and manufacture optimal packaged systems.

It provides an insightful look into the benefits of sustained socio-economic effort. To convincingly argue that dreams are only achievable through mind-numbing toil, the writer draws heavily from biographical, philosophical, economic, religious, historical and scientific data. Work is the mission; the multiple rewards are the byproducts, he argues. Moreover, the pleasure resides in the effort, not the results. Against the dark backdrop of malignancies inflicted on society by unrepentant leeches, the benefit of conscientious work is sharply focused. The reader is imperceptibly nudged into a higher plane of reality: namely, purposeful effort, regardless of its nature, is supremely rewarding. The writer forces the realization that regardless of the outcome, effort is never wasted. Conversely, indolence is the bane of progress and the root cause of economic crimes. Indeed, corruption in all its diabolical forms is nothing but laziness masquerading as diligence and embraced by vacuous minds craving the most for the least. Analysis of biographical data sustains the thesis that industry prolongs life; inaction truncates it  a finding supported by the second Law of Thermodynamics. The persuasiveness of the arguments is supported by a wealth of references. Together they form the final authority; they have given resonance to the arguments contained herein.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gGVLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming a Critical Thinker: A User Friendly Manual (3rd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fifteen Century War, Islam's Violent Heritage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jonathan to Gide : The Homosexual in History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Getting Started with Arcinfo 8","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQlBtAEACAAJ&dq=Getting+Started+with+Arcinfo+8&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of Money and the Struggle for Financial Privacy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Evasion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YqmPtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Evasion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding Diaries","description":"Real moms, real stories, real hope for breastfeeding success.

Through a groundbreaking new paradigm of \\"restorative environmental design,\\" award-winning author Stephen R. Kellert proposes a new architectural model of sustainability. In Building For Life, Kellert examines the fundamental interconnectedness of people and nature, and how the loss of this connection results in a diminished quality of life. This thoughtful new work illustrates how architects and designers can use simple methods to address our innate needs for contact with nature. Through the use of natural lighting, ventilation, and materials, as well as more unexpected methodologies-the use of metaphor, perspective, enticement, and symbol-architects can greatly enhance our daily lives. These design techniques foster intellectual development, relaxation, and physical and emotional well-being. In the works of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Eero Saarinen, Cesar Pelli, Norman Foster, and Michael Hopkins, Kellert sees the success of these strategies and presents models for moving forward. Ultimately, Kellert views our fractured relationship with nature as a design problem rather than an unavoidable aspect of modern life, and he proposes many practical and creative solutions for cultivating a more rewarding experience of nature in our built environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tn6jQgAACAAJ&dq=Building+for+a+Lifetime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FREDERICK'S FABLES-A LEO LIONNI TREASURY OF FAVORITE STORIES","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Beagle: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthly Pet (Happy Healthy Pet)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Monsters and Madonnas: The Roots of Christian Anti-Semitism","description":"Contends that Christian beliefs and practices are essentially pagan in their origin.

He drives home his brand-new Corvette one day to discover a strange doll on his doorstep. It's a rag doll made entirely of white cloth, with no face or hair or clothes. Where the eyes should be, there are two crossed stitches of black thread. Five sets of crossed black stitches mark the mouth, and another pair form an X over the heart. He brings it into the house. That night, he hears an odd little popping sound and looks up to see the crossed stitches over the doll's heart breaking apart. When he picks up the doll, he feels something pulsing in its chest. Another thread unravels to reveal a reptilian green eye --and not a doll's eye, because it blinks. Tommy Phan pursues the thing as it scrambles away into his house -- and then is pursued by it as it evolves from a terrifying and vicious minikin into a hulking and formidable opponent bent on killing him.

Internet dating has spread across the globe as quickly as the Internet has spread its cyber-wings. Nearly one hundred million adults have online profiles, and from these millions, we have collected a small group of real people who are willing to relate their experiences in their own words, words that won't send you running for a dictionary and words that will leave you either laughing at their misadventures or shaking your head in commiseration. Included in this motley crew is David Osterczy, father of three, photographer and storyteller. Dipping into three years of experience standing alongside his cohorts in the firing line of online dating, he brazenly lays out all the dirty details of his exploits, asks the questions we all want to ask, and explores all the twists and turns of the road to online romance. You are invited to form your own opinions as you read the many points of views, knowing that they are told with no punches pulled.

Jim Kennedy gladly gave up the Golden Age, Senior Citizen ghettos common to older Americans for a life to a Latin beat...full of nubile & willing young women & a chance to recapture his youth--at least for a while. \\"It's a wonderful read...vastly entertaining...full of life & heart & love.\\"--Doug Mauldin.

Yet the meaning of the text is often unclear. Part of the problem arises because, although 1 John is called an Epistle, it lacks the formal marks of an Epistle. In 1, 2, and 3 John, John Painter illuminates the relationship 1, 2, and 3 John have to each other and to the Gospel. Painter explains the historical context of the Johannine Epistles using a socio-rhetorical approach. The writings are shown to reflect a situation of conflict and schism within the Johannine community; they seek to persuade the readers of the truth of the writer's message. In this truth, the readers are encouraged to abide if they would have the assurance of eternal life. Painter also examines the inseparable connection between belief and ethical life in active love for one another. Through the socio-rhetorical approach Painter brings to light the continuing relevance of these writings. 1, 2, and 3 John is divided into two parts. Chapters under 1 John are Introduction to the Exegesis of 1 John,\\" *Outline of 1 John, - *First Presentation of the Two Tests(1:6-2:27), - *Excursus: Sin and Sinlessness, - *Excursus: Love of the Brother/Sister: of One Another, - *Excursus: The Antichrist, - *Second Presentation of the Two Tests (2:28-4:6), - *Third Presentation of the Two Tests (4:7-5:12), - *Conclusion (5:13-21), and *Excursus: 'A Sin Unto Death.' - Chapters under 2 and 3 John are *2 John, - *Introduction to the Exegesis of 2 John, - *Outline of 2 John, - *Prescripti 2 John 1-3, - *Body of the Letter (4-11), - *Notice of Intention to Visit (12), - and *Final Greetings (13), - *3 John, - *Introduction to the Exegesis of 3 John, - *Outline of 3 John, - *Prescript: 3 John 1-2, - *Body of Letter (3-12), - and *Final Greetings (13-15). - John Painter is the Foundation Professor of Theology at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, Australia. \\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jUKJDAAAQBAJ&dq=1,+2,+and+3+John+(Sacra+Pagina+series,+Vol.+18)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of the Short-Story","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Statics of Deformable Solids","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Deadly Doubles (Nancy Drew Casefiles, Case 7)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"At 80: An Old Bird's Eye View of the Year Following September 11, 2001","description":"This book records my reactions to day-by-day events during the fourteen months following September 11, 2001.

Of all the martial arts, b?-jutsu, or stick fighting, is one of the least understood and most intriguing, having been largely hidden for centuries. In Advanced Stick Fighting, Masaaki Hatsumi, the most renowned bud? and ninja grandmaster in the world, and author of Stick Fighting and The Way of the Ninja, reveals some of the secrets surrounding this revered fighting art. Hatsumi offers the reader thoughtful reflections on bushid?, its venerable history, and its role in today's world. He also discusses the origins of b?-jutsu, which he sees as inexorably linked to the evolution of humankind; it is both universal and timeless. While the highly acclaimed and long-selling Stick Fighting dealt mainly with self-defense using short sticks, this book reveals to the reader a number of advanced techniques using medium and long sticks that were originally used by samurai swordsmen and military commanders. Lavish illustrations accompany the explanations and help further demonstrate the graceful, mysterious movements of stick fighting. The original Japanese text is also included in the appendix. This book will be an important addition to the libraries of readers who are seriously interested in pursuing the more advanced applications of stick fighting. It will also deepen readers' understanding of bushid? in general, and bring them closer to Hatsumi's personal philosophy -- that only through complete devotion to the martial arts as a way of life can self-enlightenment be attained, and that the wisdom gained through this can promote a true and lasting world of peace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W55NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Advanced+Stick+Fighting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal cafe (Reading rainbow library)","description":"Old Max never suspects the true source of his shop's financial success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ve96s-tutjUC&dq=Animal+cafe+(Reading+rainbow+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shetland Sheepdog: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet is the series to turn to when you want a basic reference that's reliable, up-to-date, and complete.

Some felt unwanted and unloved by past teams. Two were told by skeptics that they didn t even belong on the field. Yet it was these qualities that made them one of the most entertaining teams in franchise history. They didn t bunt to move runners along, steal bases to distract the opposing defense, or turn the double play. They just hit and hit until demoralized opponents cried uncle. They didn t win the World Series or even a division title. They couldn t be called champions, but they lived up to another title. They were the South Side Hitmen. Team owner Bill Veeck transformed a hapless 1976 ball club into contenders and big-time draws at the ticket box. New acquisitions Oscar Gamble, Richie Zisk, and Eric Soderholm led the team to a franchise record 192 home runs, while legendary broadcaster Harry Caray led Comskey Park fans through the seventh-inning stretch. The White Sox won 90 games that season (including 22 in an amazing month of July) and finished first in the hearts of baseball fans across the city s South Side.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T_tztswtZkkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of Season","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Are We Spiritual Machines?: Ray Kurzweil vs. the Critics of Strong A.I.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Standard Warehouse Management System Search Bundle, WMS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Haydn symphonies (BBC music guides [2])","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion","description":"In this new book, Alister McGrath explores the relation of religion and the natural sciences, focusing specifically on Christianity as a case study.

Both the book and Burton's 32-minute work, which is written in 12 short movements for upper-voice choir in up to 3 voice parts (with either orchestral or piano accompaniment), celebrates each lost word with a beautiful poem or 'spell', magically brought to life in Burton's music. At its heart, the work delivers a powerful message about the need to close the gap between childhood and the natural world. Burton's piece was co-commissioned by the Hall  Concerts Society for the Hall  Children's Choir and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The piano accompaniment version was premiered at the Tanglewood Festival in 2019 by the Boston Symphony Children's Choir, of which Burton is founder and director. The Hall  Children's Choir will premiere the orchestral version of the full work in Manchester, UK, post-pandemic.

The book The Lost Words, exquisitely designed, has won multiple awards and is an international best-seller.

In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president s tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln s patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator.  Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists  sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while  Herndon and Mary Lincoln  brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president s closest companions.  Getting Right with Lincoln  and  The Folklore Lincoln  draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln s presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald.

For Michael Stirling, London s most infamous rake, that moment came the first time he laid eyes on Francesca Bridgerton. After a lifetime of chasing women, of smiling slyly as they chased him, of allowing himself to be caught but never permitting his heart to become engaged, he took one look at Francesca Bridgerton and fell so fast and hard into love it was a wonder he managed to remain standing. Unfortunately for Michael, however, Francesca s surname was to remain Bridgerton for only a mere thirty-six hours longer the occasion of their meeting was, lamentably, a supper celebrating her imminent wedding to his cousin. But that was then . . . Now Michael is the earl and Francesca is free, but still she thinks of him as nothing other than her dear friend and confidant.

A superb aid to strengthening and deepening the spiritual life, each chapter begins with a prayer, lucidly discusses a divine aspect -- from God's infinity to God's love -- and relates that aspect to today's world, while pointing always to God's wonder and inscrutability.\\" A. W. Tozer asserts that the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God. He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. \\"True religion confronts earth with heaven and brings eternity to bear upon time,\\" says the author in his preface, \\"The messenger of Christ, though he speaks from God, must also, as the Quakers used to say 'speak to the condition' of his hearers; otherwise he will speak a language known only to himself. His message must be not only timeless but timely. He must speak to his own generation.\\" The message of this book is indeed both timeless and timely. Tozer is primarily concerned with the loss of the concept of 'majesty' from the popular mind and more importantly in the thinking of the church. He sees the church as having surrendered her once lofty concept of God - not deliberately, but little by little and without her knowledge. With this comes a further loss of religious awe and a sense of the divine presence, of an appropriate spirit of worship and of our ability to withdraw inwardly to meet God in adoring silence. Tozer attempts to address this problem, to go back to the causes of the decline and to understand and correct the errors that have given rise to our loss of a sense of the holy. \\"It is impossible to keep our moral practices sound and our inward attitudes right while our idea of God is erroneous or inadequate,\\" he tells us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sVNhEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"En el tiempo de Las Mariposas","description":" Un libro importante emocionalmente sobrecogedor.  lvarez nos hace un regalo cargado de rara generosidad y coraje.

With uncluttered logic and straightforward prose Wenham marshals Gospel evidence to show Jesus' own view of Scripture-that it is (1) historically accurate, (2) authoritative, (3) the standard for ethics, and (4) the verbally inspired revelation of God. He then considers why we should listen to Jesus when he makes such claims and why \\"Christ's view should be the Christian view.\\" The study substantiates Jesus' reliability influence on all New Testament writers. Finally, Wenham considers two related problems: first, which writings really belong in the Bible; second, the reliability of the text as now available. The presentation is easy to read and understand.

It's the best memoir I've ever read.   Oprah Winfrey  Will Smith isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . . An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.   USA Today Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Achievement One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smith s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale but it s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2ZNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Up+the+Agency+Signed+1ST+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced race car suspension development","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3vaEAAAACAAJ&dq=Advanced+race+car+suspension+development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage","description":"This new edition of Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage discusses and analyzes modern legal vocabulary and style more thoroughly than any other contemporary reference work.

Calne investigates the phenomenon of rationality from an astonishingly wide array of scientific, sociological, and philosophical perspectives--and shows that although reason evolved as a crucial tool for human survival, it is an aspect of mind and brain which has no inherent moral or spiritual qualities and one whose relationship to our thoughts and actions may not be as central as we want to believe. Learned, lucid, and always illuminating, Within Reason brings together the latest developments in the science of mind with some of the most enduring questions of Western thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bnZa9OLJTS0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Bible: New Jerusalem Version.

Four days later, the B-17 assigned to the search-and-rescue mission became lost in a blinding storm and also crashed.

At the same time the authors conscientiously maintain the intention and integrity of the program - its values, scope and depth. A chapter is devoted to each Step. The language is clear, engaging and personal. The Foreword to this Second Edition of the book begins with a striking quote from Chapter Three which captures the essence of both the book and the 12 Steps: \\"We can learn the universal, generic pattern of life's dance from the 12 Steps.

Both their style and their content make it difficult to locate them within the corpus of Pauline letters, and recent scholarship most often considers them pseudonymous, works that imitate Paul?s letters but apply the apostle?s teaching to the concerns of a later time, two or more decades after Paul?s death. The Pastorals differ from Paul?s own letters in being addressed to single individuals, coworkers of Paul who have been placed in charge of particular churches?Timothy apparently in Ephesus, Titus in Crete. They provide instruction for community leaders, both the individual addressees and other leaders whom they will appoint. The specification of certain offices within the local churches is one of the features that appear to locate these works in a later phase of church development. In this commentary Benjamin Fiore, S.J., places the Pastorals in their historical and literary context. The reader will find here a solid introduction to parallel literary forms in Latin and Greek literature and particular descriptions of the way in which these documents use ancient rhetorical forms to achieve their paraenetic and hortatory purpose. Drawing on his parish experience as well as his academic training, Fiore also provides reflections on the contemporary pastoral application of these books, giving readers a renewed appreciation for the ?pastoral? label these epistles bear. ?In this excellent commentary Fr. Benjamin Fiore, S.J., who was educated in Greek and Latin classics, Pauline literature, and ancient rhetoric (Ph.D., Yale, 1982), and is now president of Campion College, University of Regina, offers the best of contemporary historical and literary interpretation of the New Testament Pastoral Epistles. A devoted pastor himself, Fiore is adept at perceiving the pastoral interests in these letters. His tasty gourmet scholarship is spiced with valuable references to Jewish, classical, and patristic writers, and is noteworthy for its references to the ancient rhetoricians. Laid out in the Sacra Pagina format, with verse-by-verse exegesis, general interpretation, and up-to-date bibliography, it will be a very valuable tool for all serious students of the Bible. It is a fine achievement and very highly recommended for informed work on the Pastorals.? Dennis C.

This history-drenched city on the Adriatic has always tantalized Jan Morris with its moodiness and changeability. After visiting Trieste for more than half a century, she has come to see it as a touchstone for her interests and preoccupations: cities, seas, empires.

Philosophical skeptics claim that we know no such thing. Representationalists claim that we can gain such knowledge only by inference, by showing that the hypothesis of a real world is the best explanation for the kind of sensations and mental images we experience. Both accept the doctrine of a 'veil of perception: ' that perception can only give us direct awareness of images or representations of objects, not the external objects themselves. In contrast, Huemer develops a theory of perceptual awareness in which perception gives us direct awareness of real objects, not mental representations, and we have non-inferential knowledge of the properties of these objects. Further, Huemer confronts the four main arguments for philosophical skepticism, showing that they are powerless against this kind of theory of perceptual knowledge","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ccmNDGIiJ3IC&dq=Skepticism+and+the+Veil+of+Perception+(Studies+in+Epistemology+and+Cognitive+Theory)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glossary of Supply Chain Terminology A Dictionary On Technology, Logistics, Transportation, Warehousing, Manufacturing, Purchasing, and More!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Morgan's Justice: Murder and Madness on Ireland's Cliffs of Moher","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mr. Sneeze","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sipping Saints: A Challenge to Drinking Christians","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qMjjAAAACAAJ&dq=Sipping+Saints:+A+Challenge+to+Drinking+Christians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atonement for a 'Sinless' Society: Engaging with an Emerging Culture (Faith in An Emerging Culture)","description":"\\"Sin doesn't really exist as a serious idea in modern life,\\" wrote the journalist Bryan Appleyard.

Alan Mann charts a way through the apparent impasse between a story that supposedly relies on sin and guilt to become meaningful and one that fails to recognize the plight of humanity as portrayed in this way. He shows that the biblical narrative needs to be reread in the light of this emerging story so that it can speak meaningfully and sufficiently to an increasingly 'sinless' society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1rPiAAAACAAJ&dq=Atonement+for+a+%27Sinless%27+Society:+Engaging+with+an+Emerging+Culture+(Faith+in+An+Emerging+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Manual of Wood Veneering","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MIA's Reading Adventure","description":"Mia's grandmother, Mimi, has suddenly became very sick.

The basic medieval idea of an ordered Chain of Being is studied by Tillyard in the process of its various transformations by the dynamic spirit of the Renaissance. Among his topics are: Angels; the Stars and Fortune; the Analogy between Macrocosm and Microcosm; the Four Elements; the Four Humors; Sympathies; Correspondences; and the Cosmic Dance ideas and symbols that inspirited the imaginations not only of the Elizabethans, but also of the Renaissance as such. This idea of cosmic order was one of the genuine ruling ideas of the Elizabethan Age, and perhaps the most characteristic. Such ideas, like our everyday manners, are the least disputed and the least paraded in the creative literature of the time. The province of this book is some of the notions about the world and man that were quite frequently taken for granted by the ordinary educated Elizabethan; the commonplaces too familiar for the poets to make detailed use of, except in explicitly educational passages, but essential as basic assumptions and invaluable at moments of high passion. The objective of The Elizabethan World Picture is to extract and explain the most ordinary beliefs about the constitution of the world as pictured in the Elizabethan Age and through this exposition to help the ordinary reader to understand and to enjoy the great writers of the age. In attempting this, Tillyard has brought together a number of pieces of elementary lore. This classic text is a convenient factual aid to extant interpretations of some of Spenser, Donne, or Milton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V7VzmwEACAAJ&dq=The+Elizabethan+World+Picture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cass Timberlane (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Play Keyboards: Everything You Need to Know to Play Keyboards","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Party Handbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sixteenth Minute: Life in the Aftermath of Fame","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blurred Boundaries: Questions of Meaning in Contemporary Culture","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Barbed Quotes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The runaway dot","description":"When the rebellious dot decides to move, he suddenly discovers that a moving dot becomes a line that can be shaped into a picture of almost anything.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-OeLGAAACAAJ&dq=The+runaway+dot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agents Under Fire, Materialism and the Rationality of Science","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Exploits Of Brigadier Gerard (Large Print)","description":"\\"The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard\\" is a volume collecting 8 short stories about a courier and cavalryman in the personal service of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Understanding Israelite History is a revolutionary attempt to fill in the many gaps left in the historical record. Rosenbaum begins by demonstrating that Israel's religion was not a clean, divinely inspired break with humanity's past, but derives from the long sweep of events that began when Homo sapiens first acquired language. Strata of earlier religions are still visible beneath the surface of Israelite monotheism. Early Israel was not \\"one man's family\\", however dysfunctional. It was a collection of individuals and groups, mainly outcasts or lower social elements, who coalesced into a nation and developed -- though they did not always follow -- a religion of ethical monotheism and principles of democratic government and social justice that still today move and inspire more than half the world's population. Like all religions, Israel's was shaped by the language, in this case Hebrew, in which it is expressed. Expressing monotheism in a language that is essentially dualistic conduced to the suppression of the female elements of earlier religions which had nurtured Israel's religion, and consequently, to a lack of appreciation for the part played by women in Israel's religious life. This skewed view of Israel's religion and its history that the Bible contains is a result of its having been collected, edited and in part written by Judeans, southern survivors, and heirs of David's kingdom who were moved to record it in the wake of the destruction ofJerusalem in 586 BCE.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AxH1j2ICKZsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moon and Sixpence: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New York Times Almanac 2007: The Almanac of Record","description":"Provides information about the nations of the world, every state, individual awards and achievements, sports, entertainment, politics, science, and business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bdp__tOQaWYC&dq=The+New+York+Times+Almanac+2007:+The+Almanac+of+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Difference a Father Makes: Calling Out the Magnificent Destiny in Your Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Inconnues (Folio) (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Illinois Wilds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Genealogy of the Crane family;: Descendants of Henry Crane of Wethersfield and Guilford, Conn., with sketch of the family in England","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"For Sylvia: An Honest Account","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GztRPgAACAAJ&dq=For+Sylvia:+An+Honest+Account&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fit and Fat: The 8-Week Heart Zones Program","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mismeasure of Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Night Of Fear","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"PHP: Your Visual Blueprint for Creating Open Source, Server-Side Content","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"From the captain to the colonel: An informal history of Eastern Airlines","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Train Whistle Guitar","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Featherweight 221 - The Perfect Portable: And Its Stitches Across History, Expanded Third Edition","description":"A comprehensive history of the treasured Singer sewing machine from the author of Big Block One-Star Quilts by Magic.

The show proved to be a smashing success, and returned the next January for another round. Since then, the show has completed two more seasons, and is about to kick off Season Five. Through it all, Donna Reynolds, a freelance journalist, has been watching and writing a weekly column for Foxes on Idol, one of the top ranked reality TV websites in the world. Her weekly Idol Thoughts column has been read by fans from as far away as Singapore, and she has built a career around writing about this show. This book documents the third season of the show, one of Donna's favorites. That was the season that George Huff emerged as an unlikely Idol, returning from elimination to go on to take fifth place. That was also the year of the three divas, JPL, and a whole lot of controversy. Relive that entire exciting and dramatic season through Donna's sometimes jaded and always humorous words.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7_knAAAACAAJ&dq=Idol+Thoughts:+Season+Three&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Combat!

H. Gombrich's Little History of the World, though written in 1935, has become one of the treasures of historical writing since its first publication in English in 2005. The Yale edition alone has now sold over half a million copies, and the book is available worldwide in almost thirty languages. Gombrich was of course the best-known art historian of his time, and his text suggests illustrations on every page. This illustrated edition of the Little History brings together the pellucid humanity of his narrative with the images that may well have been in his mind's eye as he wrote the book. The two hundred illustrations most of them in full color are not simple embellishments, though they are beautiful. They emerge from the text, enrich the author's intention, and deepen the pleasure of reading this remarkable work. For this edition the text is reset in a spacious format, flowing around illustrations that range from paintings to line drawings, emblems, motifs, and symbols. The book incorporates freshly drawn maps, a revised preface, and a new index. Blending high-grade design, fine paper, and classic binding, this is both a sumptuous gift book and an enhanced edition of a timeless account of human history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N2C6BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Wine: The New Basics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Desperate Ground","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Early Days of The Sex Pistols: Only Anarchists Are Pretty","description":"A semi-fictionalized novel of the punk rock group, the Sex Pistols.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q9oaAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Early+Days+of+The+Sex+Pistols:+Only+Anarchists+Are+Pretty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Valentine Wedding","description":"Once her childhood friend, then her lover, and finally her enemy, Lord Alasdair Chase resolves to make Lady Emma Beaumont his wife by Valentine's Day, but her stubborn insistence on preserving her independence makes it a challenge.

What sorts of cultural understandings inform judicial process and litigants' strategies? How do women's claims fare? Do these courts promote social tolerance? And how do states use them to consolidate power, build nations, and shape a modern citizenry? These are among the questions addressed in this book, which not only enhances our understanding of diversity among and within the world's Muslim communities, but also provides ethnographic, historical, and transnational perspectives on contemporary Islam in the shifting landscape of a strategically important region of the world. Focusing on Malaysia, which has sustained more rapid development than probably any other Muslim nation, Michael Peletz explores the culture, political economy, and history of Islamic courts. He demonstrates that they are centrally involved in the creation and policing of new Malay-Muslim identities (such as middle-class urban dwellers) that the state sees as the basis for a national polity that will be highly competitive. He also shows how and why Islamic courts are key sites in struggles involving ethnic and religious groups, social classes, political parties, and others with a major stake in defining Islam's role with respect to the maintenance of sovereignty and the achievement of modernity and civil society in an age of globalization. Peletz deepens our knowledge of Islamic political development in a country very much concerned with forging an Islamic modernity viewed by its leaders as a viable alternative to Western-style modernization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lf1ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleepless Nights: A Novel","description":"In Sleepless Nights a woman looks back on her life the parade of people, the shifting background of place and assembles a scrapbook of memories, reflections, portraits, letters, wishes, and dreams.

Hinduism does not lend itself easily to a strictly chronological account: many of its central texts cannot be reliably dated even within a century; its central tenets karma, dharma, to name just two arise at particular moments in Indian history and differ in each era, between genders, and caste to caste; and what is shared among Hindus is overwhelmingly outnumbered by the things that are unique to one group or another. Yet the greatness of Hinduism - its vitality, its earthiness, its vividness - lies precisely in many of those idiosyncratic qualities that continue to inspire debate today. Wendy Doniger is one of the foremost scholars of Hinduism in the world. With her inimitable insight and expertise Doniger illuminates those moments within the tradition that resist forces that would standardize or establish a canon. Without reversing or misrepresenting the historical hierarchies, she reveals how Sanskrit and vernacular sources are rich in knowledge of and compassion toward women and lower castes; how they debate tensions surrounding religion, violence, and tolerance; and how animals are the key to important shifts in attitudes toward different social classes. The Hindus brings a fascinating multiplicity of actors and stories to the stage to show how brilliant and creative thinkers - many of them far removed from Brahmin authors of Sanskrit texts - have kept Hinduism alive in ways that other scholars have not fully explored. In this unique and authoritative account, debates about Hindu traditions become platforms from which to consider the ironies, and overlooked epiphanies, of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nNsXZkdHvXUC&dq=Hinduism+(Pelican+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Larousse Wine Encyclopedia Hb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"More Than Seduction","description":"Mrs. Anne Smythe's Healing Spa and Bathing Emporium is a haven for fashionable women who believe the waters have aphrodisiac properties.

Professor Lambek describes how the people of Mayotte (most often women) enter into trances, during which they believe their bodies are inhabited by spirits. He then analyses the conventions for behaviour in trance and the process by which the individuals come to terms with the spirits in their midst. The book presents thorough case studies of spirit possession over time, providing one of the most detailed accounts of possession phenomena available for a single society. The author argues that trance can best be understood as a social activity within a defined system of cultural meaning rather than as a psychological problem, a simple deception or a means of manipulating others. This book should be of particular interest to those concerned with the study of ritual, symbols and non-Western religious systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BLA5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Adventures+in+the+Human+Spirit+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Juan Pablo II/ John Paul II: La Vida De Karol Wojtyla/the Life of Karol Wojtyla (Libros Singulares) (Spanish Edition)","description":"A Singular Bond That Changed History Even as historians credit Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II with hastening the end of the Cold War, they have failed to recognize the depth or significance of the bond that developed between the two leaders. Acclaimed scholar and bestselling author Paul Kengor changes that. In this fascinating book, he reveals a singular bond which included a spiritual connection between the Catholic pope and the Protestant president that drove the two men to confront what they knew to be the great evil of the twentieth century: Soviet communism. Reagan and John Paul II almost didn t have the opportunity to forge this relationship: just six weeks apart in the spring of 1981, they took bullets from would-be assassins. But their strikingly similar near-death experiences brought them close together to Moscow s dismay. A Pope and a President is the product of years of research. Based on Kengor s tireless archival digging and his unique access to Reagan insiders, the book reveals: The inside story on the 1982 meeting where the president and the pope confided their conviction that God had spared their lives for the purpose of defeating communism Captivating new information on the attempt on John Paul II s life, including a -previously unreported secret CIA investigation was Moscow behind the plot?

When you read this book, you will understand why. As kindred spirits, Ronald Reagan and John Paul II united in pursuit of a supreme objective and in doing so they changed history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UZSxDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN Honorable Match (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"When her bethrothed elopes with an actress from Drury Lane, Lady Sarah Harrison finds herself courted by his brother who is determined to save her from scandal through a marriage of convenience.

Cryptography the science of codes and ciphers will be a significant part of the solution, but one of the hardest problems is enabling users to find out which cryptographic key belongs to whom. The main things that can go wrong with cryptography are similar to those that can go wrong with a signature stamp. A stamp can be stolen or counterfeit; or it may not belong to the person one thought it did. The first two risks can be controlled largely by technical measures. The third risk is the hard one, and the one that this book helps to solve. Many people who use cryptographic services on the Internet have had their keys certified by one or more of about a thousand important keys. The pioneers of cryptography hoped that these keys would in turn be certified by the United Nations or by each other, or listed in the phone book. For a variety of political and competitive reasons, this has not happened. The result is chaos, and the situation is bound to get worse as both companies and governments try to stake out claims in cyberspace. The primary aim of this book is to cut through the chaos by publishing the thousand or so important keys in paper form, as a kind of global phone book. The secondary aim is political: By printing these keys on paper, we can use established legal protections to limit government interference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l5sEELmGrDsC&dq=The+Global+Internet+Trust+Register:+1999+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krazy & Ignatz, The Dailies.

On a spring day more than ten years ago, sixty-nine-year-old Lloyd Lawrence was gunned down in rural Missouri. The shooter also turned his twelve-gauge shotgun on Lawrence s wife and their paraplegic grandson. The crime took place in a region known mostly for Pentecostal fervor, country music, and family-friendly tourism. But soon the murders would expose a dark underbelly in the Ozarks: Lloyd Lawrence was a notoriously violent crystal-meth kingpin, killed by an aspiring drug dealer named Darrell Mease.Capturing the raw circumstances that took Mease from his clean-cut youth to the front lines of Vietnam and an aftermath of drug use, Almost Midnight unites an unforgettable range of characters in some of America s most peculiar locales. When Mease and his girlfriend fled to the Southwest on a hair-raising road trip, this only brought Mease closer to death row. After his conviction, he claimed to receive a religious revelation guaranteeing that his life would be saved by miraculous intervention, a long-shot prediction that came true. A bizarre twist of fate brought Pope John Paul II to Saint Louis, where he pleaded with Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan to commute the sentence just months before Carnahan s fatal plane crash. In a triumph of investigative journalism, Michael Cuneo gained unprecedented access to Mease and immersed himself in the culture of the Ozarks, exploring its bucolic farms and seedy strip joints, and the lives of its preachers, cockfighters, and outlaws. By turns chilling and riveting, Almost Midnight brilliantly evokes the life of controversial renegade Mease, and the stranger-than-fiction world he still inhabits.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=njRttVd_JxsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come over to my house,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Christening Day Murder (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Not Quite American?: The Shaping of Arab and Muslim Identity in the United States (Charles Edmondson Historical Lectures)","description":"In this essay Yvonne Haddad explores the history of immigration and integration of Arab Muslims in the United States and their struggle to legitimate their presence in the face of continuing exclusion based on race, nationalist identity, and religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m1z4GcWN9CcC&dq=Not+Quite+American%3F:+The+Shaping+of+Arab+and+Muslim+Identity+in+the+United+States+(Charles+Edmondson+Historical+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melanie Martin Goes Dutch : The Private Diary of My Almost Bummer Summer with Cecily, Matt the Brat, andVincent van Go Go Go","description":"Written by the advice columnist of Girls  Life magazine, this hilarious companion to The Diary of Melanie Martin finds Melanie off to Hollandwith her best friend!

But no-one had managed to go on from there: over the jungle-clad mountains of Assam and across northern Burma to Thailand and Malaya. Over the last 3,000 miles it seemed there were just too many rivers and too few roads. But no-one really knew... In fact, their problems began much earlier than that. As mere undergraduates, they had no money, no cars, no nothing. But with a cool audacity, which was to become characteristic, they set to work-wheedling and cajoling.

As a columnist for the New York newspaper Der Tog (The Day) during the 1920s and 1930s, Coralnik moved effortlessly from discussions of Zionist politics to analyses of Marx and Plato to travelogues through the American heartland. As Europe exploded in anti-Semitism, and American Jewish life continued its spectacular transformation into the land of promise and confusion, Coralnik provided both insight and context for an immigrant community desperate to understand the changes taking place around it.Today, Coralnik's essays can be enjoyed not just for their perspective on two crucial decades of Jewish history, but for their timeless wisdom about culture, spirituality, philosophy and history.In Volume Two of Across the Great Divide, Coralnik illuminates the strange, sad life of the Yiddish language; the inner conflicts of writers from Montaigne to Thomas Mann; the way secular revolutionaries like Karl Marx channeled prophetic ideals; and the moral ideas animating American presidents like Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson.About the Translator: Beatrice Coralnik Papo, the eldest daughter of Abraham Coralnik, was born in Berlin in 1913.

In this book, Juliette Blevins explores the nature of sounds patterns and sound change in human language over the past 70008000 years, the time depth for which the comparative method is reasonably reliable. This book presents an approach to the problem of how genetically unrelated languages, from families as far apart as Native American, Australian Aboriginal, Austronesian and Indo-European, can often show similar sound patterns, and also tackles the converse problem of why there are notable exceptions to most of the patterns that are often regarded as universal tendencies or constraints. It argues that in both cases, a formal model of sound change that integrates phonetic variation and patterns of misperception can account for attested sound systems without reference to markedness or naturalness within the synchronic grammar.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-AsIRQT2VFQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eternal Fire","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MIA's Science Adventure","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Poems of the Past and the Present (Collected Works of Thomas Hardy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Performance Analysis of Transaction Processing Systems (HP Professional Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lorca, una escritura en trance: 'Libro de poemas' y 'Divan del Tamarit' (Purdue University Monographs in Romance Languages) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The life of St. Paul,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The story of the Mexican War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Professional InfoPath 2003","description":"What is this book about?

Liberation Theology and Its Critics is a comprehensive and systematic explication of these diverse criticisms, as well as a reasoned and rigorous defense of liberation theology. McGovern states his aim thus: to understand better the world of Latin America and the culture and conditions which prompt a liberation theology, while at the same time giving expression to some of the misgivings that many US Americans experience when reading about liberation theology. Liberation Theology and Its Critics begins by discussing the place of theology itself in liberation theology. The book offers an historical overview, shows us what liberation theologians see as most distinctive in their work, addresses the biblical interpretations and major areas of theology stressed by liberation theologians, and discusses other theologians' critiques. Next, McGovern explicates the use of social and political analysis in liberation theology, which has been one of the areas of particular controversy. He focuses on such issues as dependency theory, Marxism, class struggle, socialism, and the Nicaraguan revolution, addressing throughout the concerns raised by a range of critics, from the Vatican to Michael Novak. Finally, McGovern explores the role of the church and how liberation theology is lived out in practice. He examines base communities, ecclesiology, current political trends in Latin America, the varying status of liberation theology as well as its most recent developments. McGovern demonstrates that liberation theology encompasses a wide spectrum of theologians with different styles and emphases. It requires careful study, non-polemical debate, and an honest effort to present the views of both liberation theologians and their critics fairly. McGovern's book will be the benchmark against which subsequent work is measured.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vEJMAwAAQBAJ&dq=Liberation+Theology+and+Its+Critics:+Toward+an+Assessment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northern Shaolin Twelve Tantui Boxing Series","description":"The oldest and most respected martial arts title in the industry, this popular monthly magazine addresses the needs of martial artists of all levels by providing them with information about every style of self-defense in the world - including techniques and strategies.

During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was obsolete, a belief that colored his journalism career. Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant--or so Strobel thought. But today science points in a different direction. A diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason. Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost, as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe. Join Strobel as he reexamines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you'll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present compelling evidence in The Case for a Creator.

The book's stage is forbidden Tibet--with its tragic politics, its natural wonder, and its fiercely independent nomadic tubes, who are known to the chinese as \\"the last barbarians.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wGeNBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serious flyfishing","description":"In a unique fly-fishing book, Waite angles for what ultimate truths about fly-fishing he can catch. He lands some, but perhaps the most interesting is that there are no ultimate truths about the sport. For instance, tackle manufacturers all seem to go off on their own: while one says a rod is a number 7, another says its apparent number 7 is something different. Consider the facts that not all number 12 hooks are the same, that lines all differ, and that the $250 rod you just purchased in a high-end fly-fishing store costs $79.99 at the local sporting goods discounter, and you get an idea of Waite's method throughout. His unscientific survey of fly-fishers is pretty interesting, too, if only to find out how everybody else fishes. You wind up hoping Waite will some day expand his scope to survey fishers for largemouth bass, muskies, walleye, panfish, and just about any other critter that swims in fresh-or saltwater. Now that would be interesting. - Jon Kartman; 290p-","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vuQOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Serious+flyfishing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Control of Candy Jones","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heirloom Christmas Stockings in Cross-Stitch: From Cross Stitch & Country Crafts Magazine","description":"Provides a variety of cross-stitch patterns for making Christmas stockings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ucoAAAAACAAJ&dq=Heirloom+Christmas+Stockings+in+Cross-Stitch:+From+Cross+Stitch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bench Press (Training & Techniques of The World's Greatest Bench Pressers)","description":"Do you want to Bench BIG?

Now recognized as an unparalleled poet of the natural world, Mary Oliver writes with unmatched dexterity and a profound appreciation for the divergence and convergence of all living things. Mary Oliver is always searching for the soul of things. In poem after poem, her investigations go from the humble green bean that nourishes her and makes her wonder if \\"something/-I can't name it-watches as I walk the/rows, accepting the gift of their lives/to assist mine\\" to the vast, untouchable bliss of \\"things you can't reach./But you can reach out to them, and all day long./The wind, the bird flying away./The idea of God.\\" Oliver's search grows and is informed by experience, meditation, perception, and discernment. And all the while, during her quest, she is constantly surprised and fortified by joy. This graceful volume, designed to be paired with New and Selected Poems, Volume One, includes new poems on birds, toads, flowers, insects, bodies of water, and the extraordinary experience of the everyday in our lives. In the words of Alicia Ostriker,'Mary Oliver moves by instinct, faith, and determination. She is among our finest poets, and still growing.' In both the older and new poems, Mary Oliver is a poet at the height of her control of image and language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CErFfdNS8hEC&dq=New+and+Selected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kokoro: Hints and echoes of Japanese inner life","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dncqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remembering: The Autobiography of a Mystic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b9sSAAAACAAJ&dq=Remembering:+The+Autobiography+of+a+Mystic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting the Facts Straight: A Viewer's Guide to PBS's Evolution","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Walkin' on the Happy Side of Misery: A Slice of Life on the Appalachian Trail","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UtwAzwEACAAJ&dq=Walkin%27+on+the+Happy+Side+of+Misery:+A+Slice+of+Life+on+the+Appalachian+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beds & Borders: 40 Professional Designs for Do-It-Yourself","description":"This book offers instructions for building nine different beds including Shaker-style, pencil post, and bunk beds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=El_FPEe--IQC&dq=Beds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine Review For Physicians","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Master of Pimpology : Rosebudd","description":"The book Rosebudd the American Pimp is about the choices one has to make in order to go to the highest plateau in that lifestyle.

Strategic denial and deception (D&D) has emerged as a little understood challenge to security in general, and the intelligence community in particular. To gain advantages, adversaries seek to deny critical information about their own activities and capabilities, and to decieve foreign governments. In recent years, Iraq, India, Somalia, Colombian criminal groups, and terrorists, for example, have all used D&D successfully against the United States. Denial and deception is a low cost, potentially high impact to level political, military, and economic playing fields, particularly against strong opponents.Concerns about the threat of denial and deception have waxed and waned since the end of World War II. Sometimes it shaped assessments about the former Soviet Union, for example. At other times, such as the end of the Cold War, such threats appear to fade into insignificance. This volume considers whether globalization, proliferating communication technologies, and the dissemination of vast amounts of information make effective foreign denial and deception more or less likely. Contributors also examine whether more information and data sources make policymakers better informed or simply create confusion.Drawing on lessons learned from historical experiences, the authors propose ways to minimize future challenges. Chapters include \\"\\"Elements of Strategic Denial and Deception,\\"\\" by Abram Shulsky; \\"\\"Conditions Making for Success and Failure of D&D,\\"\\" by Barton Whaley; \\"\\"Conditions Making for Success and Failure of D&D,\\"\\" by M.R.D.

Our self-awareness the very thing that makes us human also makes us realize our powerlessness and the limitations of our existence. This concept is explored in this thought-provoking guide and provides a jumping off point for this treatise on existentialism and literature. Davis D. McElroy examines how modern art the unharmonious, corrupt, dismal, and shattering effect of much of humanity s painting, music, and literature can be traced to the existentialist view of existence. McElroy uses the works of such American authors as John Steinbeck, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner as well of those of Kafka and Ibsen to show that literature is the work of desperate men, whose anguish and despair have driven them to see further and more clearly than is possible for most, and their warnings must be heeded. To be able to live in the chaos of the modern world, many authors have turned to existentialism as a guide, according to McElroy. Using T. S. Eliot s The Wasteland and his plays The Confidential Clerk and The Cocktail Party as examples, McElroy posits that these authors are ultimately teaching us that we must learn to live authentically, or we will not live at all; we must choose the good that is in us, or be engulfed in the evils that surround us. This is the simple message which modern writers as well as the philosophers of existentialism are trying so desperately to bring to our attention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GJt8EAAAQBAJ&dq=Existentialism+and+modern+literature%3B:+An+essay+in+existential+criticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek Manuscripts - Galatians","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Krystal Kracker","description":"Korii Castellanos was thrust into a magical world within a geode.

Are you doing all you can to be the best parent possible? Dr. Garrett Soldano has spent his entire adult life applying the Universal Laws to athletics and entrepreneurship. He now applies these same laws to successful parenting. Turning his efforts to creating a simple yet easy to understand guide for parents, he has outlined a clear path for setting a solid foundation of values for children. How many times do we see children follow their parents down the same road toward self-destruction falling prey to behaviors like alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, self-esteem issues, relationship social difficulties or financial problems? Our children are a product of their environment. Therefore, as parents we must be a positive influence--not only in how we react to situations and events but also by monitoring ourselves constantly in everything that we do and don't do. With the wealth of knowledge available today there is no excuse to sit back and not take action against the debacle we are witnessing with our youth. In God's True Law, Dr. Garrett Soldano describes the definite science to being a successful parent. It is built upon a foundation of his life experiences growing up in poverty. The story begins with his two very young parents, completely raw in their skills, living in a trailer park and struggling to make ends meet, who still succeeded in pulling themselves up while providing their sons with all the prerequisites to move forward in life. Based on his experiences and observations, Dr. Soldano began to study, formalize, and apply the lessons of Universal Laws to parenting. The teachings in this revolutionary book, if applied correctly, will make sure parents' aspirations take root, legacies grow and family trees flourish for generations to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oxoUyAEACAAJ&dq=Every+Parent%27s+Guide+to+the+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth Door Sky Door: Paintings of Mustang","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"DIGITAL CONTROL OF DYNAMIC STSTEMS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Intermediate Algebra: A Programmed Approach","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blood Will Tell: A Shocking True Story of Marriage, Murder, and Fatal Family Secrets (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","description":"Describes the brutal murder of Kristine Fitzhugh, a wealthy investor, popular scoutmaster, and father of two, a crime that shocked the peaceful middle-class town of Palo Alto, California, and that reveals the dark, long-hidden secrets of the Fitzhugh family.

Ralph Munroe first went to Biscayne Bay in 1887. Soon after that time he and his friends built his home, The Barnacle, in Coconut Grove, where he has lived ever since. From this center his influence has been felt for almost fifty years during the vivid and exciting period of early exploration and settlement, during the slow development which led up to Flagler and the railroad, through the boom, the disastrous hurricanes against which the Commodore s warnings went unheeded, down to the present time.

The fall of the Berlin Wall symbolically signaled the subsequent demise of the Warsaw Pact and the eventual disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Following nearly fifty years of Cold War hostility and mistrust between the United States and its archetypal enemy, the Soviet Union which began to emerge revealed a newfound sense of openness, conscience, and candor. Not only had the 'new Soviets' developed a taste for democratic principles and free market economics, they also demonstrated uncharacteristic willingness to solicit technical and financial assistance from the West. The ultimate evidence of this remarkable metamorphosis was reflected in the Soviet Union's unprecedented support of U.S. policy in the recent Gulf War with Iraq. Given the dramatic lessening of tension between the two former superpower adversaries, the door has opened to a new phenomena: U.S.-Soviet military cooperation. Six such initiatives are discussed herein: Moving to a Professional Army, Building a National Guard, United Nations Peacekeeping, Exchanging Comradeship, Nation Building, and Supporting Arms Destruction. It is proposed that such collaborative efforts will foster a more stable globe, decrease the potential for future U.S.-Soviet conflict, and provide humanitarian relief and assistance to the Third World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SJyzSgAACAAJ&dq=U.S.-Soviet+military+cooperation:+An+exercise+in+equipoise+(USAWC+Military+Studies+Program+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Criss Cross","description":"Winner of the Newbery Medal ?

For the first time a developing country has become a major player in the international sports arena. This fully updated and revised edition of Mihir Bose's classic history is a unique account of the Indian cricket phenomenon.

This illuminating study reveals Indian cricket's central place in modern India s identity, culture and society. Insightful, honest and challenging, Bose tackles the myths and controversies of Indian cricket.

Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with \\"heavyweight\\" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.In Better, Faster, Lighter Java, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code. As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two \\"lightweight\\" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. Better, Faster, Lighter Java shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, Better, Faster, Lighter Java, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications. You'll learn to spend more time on what's important. When you're finished with this book, you'll find that your Java is better, faster, and lighter than ever before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-g7VdTzHJkUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The inadequacy of evolution as a world view","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-PY0AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+inadequacy+of+evolution+as+a+world+view&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Smart Step-Family: Seven Steps to a Healthy Family","description":"Discover the Keys to a Healthy Stepfamily Leading stepfamily expert Ron L.

Raised on the notion that driving is the essence of freedom, many of us still cling to the belief that the American Dream is defined by a house in the suburbs and a car in the garage. But in Why I Walk, Kevin Klinkenberg shares a very different dream life and a very different kind of freedom. A few years ago, Kevin moved to Savannah, Georgia, from Kansas City, Missouri. In large part, he chose his new home because he was seeking a truly walkable place to live. Going beyond the typical arguments against suburbia, he shows how walking on a daily basis has improved his health, finances, social life, and sense of personal freedom. By focusing directly on the real, measurable advantages of choosing to be a pedestrian, Why I Walk makes a convincing case for ending our love affair with the automobile and rekindling the romance of walking.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOD0AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathermatica Computer Programs for Physical Chemistry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Psychic Academy, Vol. 11","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Making Life More Livable: Simple Adaptations for Living at Home After Vision Loss","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Elements of Christian Philosophy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V0MNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Elements+of+Christian+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loving God with All Your Mind Growth and Study Guide (Growth and Study Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Howell Equine Handbook of Tendon and Ligament Injuries (Howell Equestrian Library)","description":"A Plain-language Medical Guide for Horse Owners and Trainers Painful and potentially debilitating tendon and ligament injuries are among the most common and serious physiological problems facing performance horses.

A dramatic picture of discrimination  (Kirkus Reviews). With opportunities for black men limited in postWorld War II London, Rick Braithwaite, a former Royal Air Force pilot and Cambridge-educated engineer, accepts a teaching position that puts him in charge of a class of angry, unmotivated, bigoted white teenagers whom the system has mostly abandoned. When his efforts to reach these troubled students are met with threats, suspicion, and derision, Braithwaite takes a radical new approach. He will treat his students as people poised to enter the adult world. He will teach them to respect themselves and to call him  Sir.  He will open up vistas before them that they never knew existed. And over the course of a remarkable year, he will touch the lives of his students in extraordinary ways, even as they in turn, unexpectedly and profoundly, touch his. Based on actual events in the author s life, To Sir, With Love is a powerfully moving story that celebrates courage, commitment, and vision, and is the inspiration for the classic film starring Sidney Poitier.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DAVlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lollipop Lounge","description":"Always the pioneer, Genya formed Goldie and the Gingerbreads in the early sixties, touring behind a string of European hits with the Stones, Kinks, Yardbirds and Hollies as the first all female rock and roll band. Later she resurfaced back in the US as the powerful voice of Ten Wheel Drive, one of the original horn jazz-fusion bands. In the Seventies she expanded her repertoire becoming the world's first independent female producer, with critically acclaimed records by Ronnie Spector and the Dead Boys, 'Young Loud and Snotty', labelled the ultimate punk album by many reviewers. During the same period Hilly Krystal summoned Genya to head up CBGB Records.In 2003 she received accolades for her memoir, Lollipop Lounge, one of the great tales of Rock and Roll survival. In it she speaks candidly about her childhood as a holocaust survivor, a teenage immigrant growing up in the tenements of New York's lower East Side, her career and survival of both addiction and lung cancer. In 2011 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum included Goldie and the Gingerbreads in their Women in Music exhibit. In 2012 her latest CD, the autobiographical, Cheesecake Girl, was released to rave reviews. She also appears on the posthumous Joey Ramona release, 'New York City', and a portion of her story is about to hit the big screen as Castle star, Stana Katic portrays her character in the new feature film, 'CBGBs' scheduled for a 2013 release.

Robert McAfee Brown draws extensively on Gutierrez's own writings (some never published in English) and on personal conversations with him. Brown clearly and compellingly presents the basics of liberation theology and the differences between North American and Latin American theologies. The form of Gustavo Gutierrez is that of a drama. Brown's initial \\"program notes\\" introduce and situate the \\"author,\\" the \\"actors,\\" the \\"critics.\\" He sets the stage with a history of church and state in Latin America and introduces its definitive figures, themes, and milestones. A collective biography of Gutierrez's spiritual predecessors is followed by a biography of Gutierrez himself, which takes critical account of his works. Then we are ready, dramatically and theologically, to move to the first act: that of commitment to the poor. The second act, in two scenes, explores first liberation theology's method of critical reflection on praxis and also its content: nothing less than the Word of God. Brown delves next into the controversies and criticisms Gutierrez faces, especially the challenges from authorities in Rome. Finally, in act three, readers discover that in this particular drama, they too are \\"on stage\\" and must take part by reflecting on what this drama really means for them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ALNNAwAAQBAJ&dq=Gustavo+Gutierrez:+An+Introduction+to+Liberation+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Root and the Flower (20th Century Classics)","description":"Describes the reign of two sixteenth-century Indian rajahs and the betrayals, religious strife, and political struggles that plagued their kingdoms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sp4FAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Root+and+the+Flower+(20th+Century+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barron's Science Study Dictionary","description":"Fast reference is the key to this science dictionary, written and designed especially for junior and senior high school students.

Wendy Leigh- after three years' research - has gained unprecedented access to over one hundred sources who have never talked about Grace before, including nine of her until now undisclosed romances - among them an English aristocrat, an American tennis player, and a Hollywood legend - and also including her priest friend, Father Peter Jacobs, and Bernard Combemal, the former head of the S.B.M, the consortium that runs Monaco. Wendy Leigh provides revealing new details about Grace's life, including her premarital romantic swan song which took place during her voyage to Monaco, the hitherto untold story of her troubling relationship with bridesmaid, Carolyn Reybold and the moving story of Grace's lifelong relationship with actor, David Niven. Wendy Leigh paints a compelling portrait of Grace, the ambitious young actress, Grace, the dutiful princess who transformed the principality of Monaco into a jet-set haven, Grace, the kind-hearted philanthropist, Grace, the loving mother, and Grace, the patriotic American.

The first is a unique consideration--from the point of view of Eastern Christianity--of the Holy Grail, the chalice used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch the blood and water as it flowed from Jesus' side when it was pierced on the Cross by the spear of Longinus. This moment is described in John 19:34. Bulgakov's essay is a \\"dogmatic exegesis\\" of this passage in which, with astounding passion and precision, he reveals that the Earth itself and hence the human universe is the Grail wherein Christ lives forever. The second essay is also unique--the most important contribution to eucharistic theology by an Orthodox theologian. In the West, the meaning of the Communion bread and wine as the Christ's Body and Blood has been interpreted largely in philosophical terms deriving from Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Bulgakov insists on a christological and Gospel-based interpretation, one with tremendous significance for our understanding of the supernatural and sophianic nature of a world interpenetrated by the divine. This little book is a priceless gift, enriching our understanding of the Christian mystery and two of its deepest aspects, the Grail and the Eucharist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qhPlZugbr78C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead Walk","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Case for Space: Who Benefits from Explorations of the Last Frontier (Frontiers in Astronomy and Earth Science)","description":"Shows how technology developed for the space program makes personal contributions to people's quality of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H9APAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Case+for+Space:+Who+Benefits+from+Explorations+of+the+Last+Frontier+(Frontiers+in+Astronomy+and+Earth+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The elusive Mrs. Pollifax","description":" Mrs. Pollifax gives Agatha Christie's Miss Marple a rival to reckon with.

Actually, the book goes much further than just reading palms, because you you'll also learn how to interpret the shape of the hand, the texture of the skin, and much more. Have you ever wondered how it is possible to tell the future from tea leaves? This book explains it all: the type of tea to use, how to prepare it, how much fluid to leave in the cup, how to manipulate the cup, and more. Eventually, you'll see the leaves forming patterns on the cup. Ray includes a dictionary with interpretations for almost 300 symbols so you can start practicing this ancient divinatory system right away. What else can you learn? How to read Tarot cards and regular playing cards. How to use dice and dominos to determine fate and the future. Divination with crystals and gemstones. Fortunetelling with fire. Telling fortunes with sticks, knives, and even using a needle as a pendulum to answer questions. You'll also learn how Gypsies were able to interpret omens such as those dealing with weather. Even the position of moles on the body has meaning, and those meanings are revealed here. If you are interested in any form of fortunetelling, this is the book you need to get. It is an entire bookstore of information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3iS6OQAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+of+Gypsy+Fortunetelling+(Llewellyn%27s+New+Age+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O The Red Rose Tree","description":"In 1893 four girls befriend an old lady and try to find seven shades of red for the special quilt she wants to make.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nCSUIHVrdz0C&dq=O+The+Red+Rose+Tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for Your Ancestors: The How and Why of Genealogy (Bantam book)","description":"Genealogy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2pdpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Searching+for+Your+Ancestors:+The+How+and+Why+of+Genealogy+(Bantam+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Molecule: One Company's Quest for the Perfect Drug","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Optimize Your Warehouse Operations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Paul Samuelson and the Foundations of Modern Economics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Celebrant","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Telling Lies and Getting Paid: More Gambling Stories (Gambling Theories Methods)","description":"He quit his job, abandoned his wife, and checked in at the Nirvana Casino.

One reason she has become a timeless icon of mystery for many readers is that her developmental phases have not been clarified. In this exhaustively researched biography, Alfred Habegger presents the first thorough account of Dickinson s growtha richly contextualized story of genius in the process of formation and then in the act of overwhelming production. Building on the work of former and contemporary scholars, My Wars Are Laid Away in Books brings to light a wide range of new material from legal archives, congregational records, contemporary women's writing, and previously unpublished fragments of Dickinson s own letters. Habegger discovers the best available answers to the pressing questions about the poet: Was she lesbian? Who was the person she evidently loved? Why did she refuse to publish and why was this refusal so integral an aspect of her work? Habegger also illuminates many of the essential connection sin Dickinson s story: between the decay of doctrinal Protestantism and the emergence of her riddling lyric vision; between her father s political isolation after the Whig Party s collapse and her private poetic vocation; between her frustrated quest for human intimacy and the tuning of her uniquely seductive voice. The definitive treatment of Dickinson s life and times, and of her poetic development, My Wars Are Laid Away in Books shows how she could be both a woman of her era and a timeless creator. Although many aspects of her life and work will always elude scrutiny, her living, changing profile at least comes into focus in this meticulous and magisterial biography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3xQiUvQIIBUC&dq=My+Wars+Are+Laid+Away+in+Books:+The+Life+of+Emily+Dickinson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brading collection (Her A Miss Silver mystery)","description":"Miss Silver investigates the murder of jewelry collector Lewis Brading, a man who had consulted her on security measures for his collection and then rejected her advice","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RtxPAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Brading+collection+(Her+A+Miss+Silver+mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cinderella Wore Tennis Shoes","description":"Songs written for Disney productions over the decades have become a potent part of American popular culture. Since most Americans first discovered these songs in their youth, they hold a special place in one's consciousness.

Over 900 songs are given individual entries and presented in alphabetical order. The songwriters and original singers are identified, as well as the source of the song and other venues in which it might have been used over the years. Notable recordings of the song are also listed. But most important, the song is described and what makes it memorable is discussed. This is not a reference list but a true encyclopedia of Disney songs. The book also contains a preface describing the criteria for selecting the songs, a glossary of song terms, a list of all the Disney songs and their sources, a songwriter's directory in which every song by each composer/lyricist is listed, a bibliography, a guide to recordings and DVDs of Disney productions, and an index of people and titles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dimhg9t2TrUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The armies of India","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seti Pioneers: Scientists Talk about Their Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence","description":"\\"Are there beings in some sense like you, elsewhere in the universe, or are we the only ones around? It's one of the most basic questions there is.\\" --Carl SaganCarl Sagan, when asked his assessment of the importance of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), replied, \\"You find out who you are. It's a basic question. Are there beings in some sense like you, elsewhere in the universe, or are we the only ones around? It touches deeply into myth, folklore, religion, mythology; and every human culture in some way or another has wondered about that kind of question. It's one of the most basic questions there is.\\" Why did some scientists decide to conduct a search for extraterrestrial intelligence? What factors in their personal development predisposed them to such a quest? What obstacles did they encounter along the way? To learn about their search, to preserve historical information not otherwise available, and to discover more about how scientific fields originate and develop, sociologist David Swift interviewed the first scientists to be involved in this fascinating quest. These SETI Pioneers reveal not only their involvement in the search, but also the facets of their personal backgrounds that led them to participate--family, education, intellectual growth--and their speculations about the nature of extraterrestrial life. Each interviewee is asked the same set of questions to facilitate comparison of how their careers developed. Introductory text by Swift reviews the emergence of SETI and early attempts to detect extraterrestrial life; a concluding interview with Paul Horowitz, a leader in the new generation of SETI scientists, reflects on the contributions of the pioneers. While a host of books have considered the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, none has considered the motivations of the individuals who initiated it; nor have any books documented from the participant's perspective the emergence of a new field of science while it was actually evolving. This collection of interviews thus sheds important light not only on the search for other life forms in our universe, but also on the nature of scientific discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=twOUPW2S7D4C&dq=Seti+Pioneers:+Scientists+Talk+about+Their+Search+for+Extraterrestrial+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Collection of Plays by Mark Frank: Bend, Hotel 5, I, Figaro!

A compelling story of romance, family, and friendship, with humor and heart, perfect for fans of If I Stay, The Spectacular Now, and Looking for Alaska. Francesca is stuck at St. Sebastian s, a boys' school that pretends it's coed by giving the girls their own bathroom. Her only female companions are an ultra-feminist, a rumored slut, and an impossibly dorky accordion player. The boys are no better, from Thomas, who specializes in musical burping, to Will, the perpetually frowning, smug moron that Francesca can't seem to stop thinking about. Then there's Francesca's mother, who always thinks she knows what's best for Francesca until she is suddenly stricken with acute depression, leaving Francesca lost, alone, and without an inkling of who she really is. Simultaneously humorous, poignant, and impossible to put down, this is the story of a girl who must summon the strength to save her family, her social life, and hardest of all herself. Melina Marchetta is the Printz-winning author of Jellicoe Road, as well as Looking for Alibrandi and Finnikin of the Rock.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KNi4S2leWqcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fingersmith","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"GIS in Public Policy: Using Geographic Information for More Effective Government","description":"How government officials, educators, and social welfare experts can put GIS to use.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MqAS2VeNYukC&dq=GIS+in+Public+Policy:+Using+Geographic+Information+for+More+Effective+Government&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackfoot Lodge Tales","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oIw3AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daniel Boone;: Taming the wilds (A Discovery book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Love and Logic : Verses of Romance and Reason","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Be Like Jackie Robinson: Life Lessons from Baseball's Greatest Hero","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Don't Go to Uncle's Wedding: Voices from the Warsaw Ghetto","description":"When the Nazis invaded Poland, the Jewish population in Warsaw was the second largest in the world.

A champion of Africa, legendary for his good looks, his charm, and his prowess as a soldier, lover, and hunter, Finch Hatton inspired Karen Blixen to write the unforgettable stories in Out of Africa. Now esteemed British biographer Sara Wheeler tells the truth about this extraordinarily charismatic adventurer. Born to an old aristocratic family that had gambled away most of its fortune, Finch Hatton grew up in a world of effortless elegance and boundless power. Tall and graceful, with the soul of a poet and an athlete s relaxed masculinity, he became a hero without trying at Eton and Oxford. In 1910, searching for novelty and danger, Finch Hatton arrived in British East Africa and fell in lovewith a continent, with a landscape, with a way of life that was about to change forever. Wheeler brilliantly conjures the mystical beauty of Kenya at a time when teeming herds of wild animals roamed unmolested across pristine savannah. No one was more deeply attuned to this beauty than Finch Hattonand no one more bitterly mourned its passing when the outbreak of World War I engulfed the region in a protracted, bloody guerrilla conflict. Finch Hatton was serving as a captain in the Allied forces when he met Karen Blixen in Nairobi and embarked on one of the great love affairs of the twentieth century. With delicacy and grace, Wheeler teases out truth from fiction in the liaison that Blixen herself immortalized in Out of Africa. Intellectual equals, bound by their love for the continent and their inimitable sense of style, Finch Hatton and Blixen were genuine pioneers in a land that was quickly being transformed by violence, greed, and bigotry. Ever restless, Finch Hatton wandered into a career as a big-game hunter and became an expert bush pilot; his passion that led to his affair with the notoriously unconventional aviatrix Beryl Markham. But Markham was no more able to hold him than Blixen had been. Mesmerized all his life by the allure of freedom and danger, Finch Hatton was, writes Wheeler,  the open road made flesh.  In painting a portrait of an irresistible man, Sara Wheeler has beautifully captured the heady glamour of the vanished paradise of colonial East Africa. In Too Close to the Sun she has crafted a book that is as ravishing as its subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BCRMba2LyHcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teacher.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Elephants and Ivory","description":"The authors examine the example of elephants in this exposition of the arguments favouring 'sustainable utilisation'.

Xena, Buffy, Sabrina, and a host of other characters have become household words, as well as icons of pop culture 'feminism.' Their popularity makes for successful programming, however, how much does this trend truly represent a contemporary feminist breakthrough? And what does it mean for feminism in the next few decades? Fantasy Girls: Navigating the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television seeks to explore as well as challenge the power and the promises of this recent media phenomenon. Such TV programming offers the exciting opportunity to rethink established gender norms, but how far is it really pushing the limits of the status quo? Amidst the exuberant optimism of fanzines and doting fan websites, the contributors to this volume endeavor to provide us with a much needed critical analysis of this contemporary trend. These essays explore the contradictions and limitations inherent in the genre, forcing readers to take a fresh and critical look through a variety of lenses including girl power, postfeminism, cyborg feminism, disability politics, queer studies, and much more. Programs covered are Babylon 5, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Disney's Cinderella, Lois and Clark, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Star Trek: Voyager, The X-Files, Third Rock from the Sun, and Xena: Warrior Princess.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sDR5m2op-PQC&dq=Fantasy+Girls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curious Moments","description":"Photojournalists are constantly hunting for \\"the right moment\\".

Rollo May challenges the idea that \\"mental health is living without anxiety,\\" believing it is essential to being human.

May sees a link extending from anxiety to intelligence, creativity, and originality, and guides the reader away from destructive ways to positive ways of dealing with anxiety. He convincingly proposes that anxiety can impel personal change, as it is only by confronting and coping with it that self-realization can occur.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bOtyCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Tree, The: Book Two of The 2nd Chronicles of Thomas Covenant","description":" The hottest fantasy writer since J.R.R.

Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story. Fire in the Valley is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at InfoWorld in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution. A rich story of colorful individuals, Fire in the Valley profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years. This completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-g5QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bonds ;: An American family","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Winged Magic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Spirit-filled Life Bible Discovery Series B14-twelve Voices For Truth","description":"Christopher West makes John Paul II's theology of the body available for the first time to people at all levels within the Christian community.

And the Project's Los Alamos, New Mexico site where the bomb was perfected was supposed to have the tightest security of the project's other 37 installations across the United States. Even the vice president, Harry S. Truman, was kept in the dark initially until fate propelled him into the fray. But this was an illusion. Evidence from Soviet and American sources have proven that at least three-and as many as six-Communist spies penetrated the security system at Los Alamos and shared the secret of the atomic bomb with the Stalin regime in the Soviet Union before the end of World War II. Historian Richard Melzer now sheds new light on how security at Los Alamos broke down-not by examining this isolated site in New Mexico from the outside as many other authors have-but from within Los Alamos itself. Using interviews, memoirs, and formerly confidential files Melzer shows that spies quite easily obtained security clearances, gained access to top secret information, and carried this information to their Soviet contacts without a hitch. What Melzer tells us about the flaws of security in the past might well help those in charge of security today as the United States grapples with these problems in the aftermath of the Chinese espionage scandal that rocked Los Alamos and the American intelligence.

Smith also details Carroll s enthusiastic work as a collector, in which role he arranged portrait sittings for photographers whose work he admired.

When tragedy strikes Bill Carter's life he finds himself drawn to an unlikely place -- Bosnia, in the midst of its civil war. Searching for meaning in the heart of darkness, he manages to find lodging in an abandoned tower block and sets out getting supplies to the starved, besieged citizens of Sarajevo. It is there that Carter emerges from his stupor. Inspired by a community of people working to bring relief to the city, he daringly enlists the help of music group U2 and its lead singer, Bono, who set up satellite links on the band's Zooropa tour that allowed ordinary citizens of Sarajevo to speak unedited and live on 90-foot television screens to thousands of concertgoers worldwide. Just as Michael Herr's Vietnam memoir Dispatches captured the horror of war for the '60s generation, Bill Carter's Fools Rush In will be the seminal book for this generation on the visceral and transformative impact of war in our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mfDnAAAACAAJ&dq=Fools+Rush+In:+A+True+Story+of+War+and+Redemption&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and the Political Process in Twentieth-Century Iran (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Kabala of numbers: A handbook of interpretation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of Psychology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pattern Library: Crochet","description":"Create your own sweater, shawl, dress, afghan, etc., with these easy-to-follow instructions for beautiful, imaginative crochet patterns: * Double Stitch, Cable Stitch and Basket Stitch * Raised Puff Balls, Honeycomb Stitch and Scallop Stitch * Petal Stitch, Stripes and Zigzags * Flower Square, Spray of Leaves and Shamrock Relief Motifs * Ladder, Diamond and Irish Net Stitches * And many, many more!

Maximus left his stamp on Christianity as it is now recognized by all three broad streams of Christian faith: Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. Yet for centuries the detailed study of Maximus's writings was neglected. The first edition of Thunberg's Microcosm and Mediator (1965) helped to transform this situation of indifference into one of intense interest in Maximus and the subtleties of his thinking. This new edition has been revised and expanded, with updated references and bibliographies. The focus of Microcosm and Mediator is Maximus's anthropology, his highly developed general reflections on human nature. Maximus understands man as, not only a being - a microcosm - who reflects the constitution of the created universe, but also as a being - a mediator - created in the image of God, whose task it is, in Christ, to reconcile the spiritual and the sensible into one homogeneous unity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SnbYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Microcosm+and+Mediator:+The+Theological+Anthropology+of+Maximus+the+Confessor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is the Reformation Over?: An Evangelical Assessment of Contemporary Roman Catholicism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Las Vegas Advisor Guide to Slot Clubs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sYPddTHqW-QC&dq=The+Las+Vegas+Advisor+Guide+to+Slot+Clubs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cathouse","description":"Carroll Locklear finds himself stranded on a planet of the prehistoric Kzinti, otherworldly bearcats with homicidal tendencies, and must win over the female cats in order to survive","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VzSIWnNGyZQC&dq=Cathouse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Fine Place To Daydream: Racehorses, Romance, and the Irish","description":"Twenty-five years after his racetrack classic Laughing in the Hills, Bill Barich tells the story of how he fell in love and found a new life in Dublin, where he was soon caught up in the Irish obsession with horses and luck. Barich travels throughout his adopted country and meets the leading trainers and jockeys, the beleaguered bookies who work rain or shine, and a host of passionate, like-minded fans from Father Sean Breen, the  Racing Priest,  to T. P. Reilly, whose peculiar betting system turns on a horse s looks. Witty, philosophical, and vividly written, A Fine Place to Daydream is a paean to the real Ireland, a moving tale of a surprise romance, and a thrilling account of a hugely exciting season at the track.  Captivating. . . . Mr. Barich recaptures much of the feel and compass of his first narrative of the equine life, once again weaving a broad tartan from scores of interviews with inhabitants of every corner of the horseracing industry.

He was busy hearing how Dylan channeled Billie Holiday in Blonde On Blonde and how Robert Plant was doing his best to sound like Janis Joplin on early Led Zeppelin recordings.

It explains how China's defeat by Japan in 1895 prompted an explosion of radical reform proposals and the beginning of elite Chinese disillusionment with the Qing government. The book explores how this event also prompted five decades of efforts to strengthen the state and the nation, democratize the political system, and build a fairer and more unified society. Peter Zarrow weaves narrative together with thematic chapters that pause to address in-depth themes central to China's transformation. While the book proceeds chronologically, the chapters in each part examine particular aspects of these decades in a more focused way, borrowing from methodologies of the social sciences, cultural studies, and empirical historicism. Essential reading for both students and instructors alike, it draws a picture of the personalities, ideas and processes by which a modern state was created out of the violence and trauma of these decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ijaAAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model-Reduction Algorithms: Principles, AWE, CFH & Macromodeling","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Colossians and Ephesians (Sacra Pagina Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Religions of Late Antiquity in Practice","description":"This is an unprecedented collection of nearly seventy Late Antique primary religious texts. These texts--all in new English translation and many appearing in English for the first time--represent every major religious current from the late first century until the rise of Islam. Produced through the efforts of thirty-six leading scholars in the field, they constitute a comprehensive view of religious practice in Late Antiquity. Religious life and performance during this period comprised diverse, often unusual practices. Philosophical ascent, magic, legal pronouncement, hymnography, dietary and sexual restriction, and rhetoric were all part of this deeply fascinating world. Religious and political identity often intertwined, as reflected in the Roman persecution of Christians. And a fluid boundary between religion and superstition was contested in daily life. Many practices, including ascetic training, crossed religious boundaries. Others, such as \\"incubation\\" at specific temples and certain divination rites, were distinctive practices of individual groups and orders. Intrinsically interesting, the practice of religion in the Late Antique also edifies modern-day religious life. As this volume shows, the origins of the contemporary Western religious terrain can be gleaned in this period. Rabbinic Judaism flourished and spread. Christianity developed still-important theological categories and structures. And even movements that did not survive intact--such as Neoplatonism and the once-powerful Manichaean churches--continue to influence religion today. This rich sourcebook includes discussions of asceticism, religious organization, ritual, martyrdom, religion's social implications, law, and theology. Its unique emphasis on practice and its inclusion of texts translated from lesser-known languages advance the study of religious history in several directions. A strong interdisciplinary orientation will reward scholars and students of religion, theology, gender studies, classical literatures, and history. Each text is accompanied by an introduction and a bibliography for further reading and research, making the book appropriate for use in any university or seminary classroom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TQBaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaizen","description":"Healthcare Kaizen focuses on the principles and methods of daily continuous improvement, or Kaizen, for healthcare professionals and organizations.

All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.

Remind us that Jesus loves us and bids us to shine. Testify to God's amazing grace. Prompt us to fall on our knees, to lift up every voice. Some of them tie a song's origin to its message. Many weave in moments of epiphany: How and when did a particular hymn touch someone's spirit? All of them lead you to consider God's Word as you face daily victories and challenges.

The entire book has been revised to take into account new developments in quantum mechanics curricula. The textbook retains its typical style also in the new edition: it explains the fundamental concepts in chapters which are elaborated in accompanying complements that provide more detailed discussions, examples and applications. * The quantum mechanics classic in a new edition: written by 1997 Nobel laureate Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and his colleagues Bernard Diu and Franck Lalo? * As easily comprehensible as possible: all steps of the physical background and its mathematical representation are spelled out explicitly * Comprehensive: in addition to the fundamentals themselves, the book contains more than 350 worked examples plus exercises Claude Cohen-Tannoudji was a researcher at the Kastler-Brossel laboratory of the Ecole Normale Sup rieure in Paris where he also studied and received his PhD in 1962. In 1973 he became Professor of atomic and molecular physics at the Coll ge des France. His main research interests were optical pumping, quantum optics and atom-photon interactions. In 1997, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, together with Steven Chu and William D. Phillips, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms. Bernard Diu was Professor at the Denis Diderot University (Paris VII). He was engaged in research at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and High Energy where his focus was on strong interactions physics and statistical mechanics. Franck Lalo? was a researcher at the Kastler-Brossel laboratory of the Ecole Normale Sup rieure in Paris.

Images of happy people stare out at us from magazine pages and television screens; they are successful and busy, hurrying from the office to the opera, eating healthfully and acting responsibly. We are a nation of achievers but, as Dr. Edward Hallowell makes clear in Connect, what sustains us emotionally, psychologically, physically is connectedness, the feeling that we are part of something that matters, something larger than ourselves that gives life its meaning, direction, and purpose. Hallowell examines the real life most of us lead overwhelmed, harried, pressured and outlines the steps we can take to connect ourselves to the people and things that matter to us. He elevates the simplest forms of communication, understanding, and self-knowledge as examples of the human moment: the basis for the bridges we build to one another. He tells stories of personal growth one woman's plan to bring a neighborhood together, another woman's assembling of a makeshift family, a real estate developer's institution of company-wide weekly pizza dinners and identifies in them twelve vital ties to a more connected life. Hallowell concludes that within each of us exists the capacity to connect with the people around us our parents, spouses, children, friends, and colleagues to become who we want to be and to be happy with who we are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3YRF9MmwnBkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philip Hall Likes Me.

Fred, prowling the antique and jumble shops of Boston's Charles Street, enters one of his own haunts--Oona's--which is run by an unflappable, seen-it-all proprietress as honest about her wares as she is ruthless in her pricing and secretive about acquisitions. Oona offers Fred a painting, the image of a common gray squirrel on a chain, which he discovers has been cut from a larger canvas. Believing it to be the work of an important eighteenth-century American master, he snaps up the fragment for his employer, the eccentric Beacon Hill art collector Clayton Reed. Then he sets out to find the remainder of the painting and its origins. Fred's quest, with assistance from his lover, Molly Riley, crosses and ultimately blocks the path of Dr. Eunice Cover-Hoover, whose specialty is deprogramming former members of satanic cults. Molly, pursuing her own agenda, becomes entangled with this adept psychologist--and, shortly, murder, mayhem, and other forms of vandalism join the violence already done to the painting. Kilmer's story in Man with a Squirrel bursts with a sophisticated and sardonic wit and a thorough knowledge of the art world: its glories, romances, accidents, and dangers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9mb2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rose of the World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Impact of Empire: A World Study of The British Empire - 1585 to The Present (This Is History!)","description":"This is History is the Schools History Project's Key Stage 3 scheme of work for National Curriculum history.

Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin have chosen the American Robin as their state bird, while a pair of robins grace the Canadian two dollar bill.

From his youthful exploits aboard a whaling ship to his often stormy friendships with such figures as Harry Houdini and George Bernard Shaw, Conan Doyle lived a life as gripping as one of his adventures. Exhaustively researched and elegantly written, Daniel Stashower's Teller of Tales sets aside many myths and misconceptions to present a vivid portrait of the man behind the legend of Baker Street, with a particular emphasis on the Psychic Crusade that dominated his final years--the work that Conan Doyle himself felt to be \\"the most important thing in the world.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0qufAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Passenger Ships of the World: 1924-1935 Volume 3","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RSJUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+Passenger+Ships+of+the+World:+1924-1935+Volume+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interior Style : How to Use Color Throughout Your Home","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Captain Caution","description":"This is the classic series from Pulitzer Prize-winning historical novelist Kenneth Roberts, all featuring characters from the town of Arundel, Maine.

From the beginning, he had conceived this sequence as the opening movement in a larger structure--now, with Star Dust, finally complete. Throughout his work, Bidart has been uniquely alert to the dramatic possibilities of violence; in this, and in his sense of theater, he resembles the great Jacobean dramatists. It is no accident that Webster's plays echo in \\"The Third Hour of the Night,\\" the brilliant long poem that dominates the second half of Star Dust. Bidart locates in Benvenuto Cellini the speaker truest to his own vision. Who better to speak of the drive to create, not as reverie or pleasure or afterthought, but as task and burden, thwarted by the world? In its scale, sonorities, extraordinary leaps, and juxtapositions, \\"The Third Hour of the Night\\" makes an astonishing counterbalance to the intense, spare lyrics that precede it. In this profound and unforgettable new book, the dream beyond desire (which now seems to represent human destiny) is rooted in the drive to create, a drive tormented at every stage by failure, as the temporal being fights for its survival by making an eternal life. Bidart is a poet of passionate originality, and Star Dust shows that the forms of this originality continue to deepen and change as he constantly renews his contract with the idea of truth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6or6hwKikbIC&dq=Star+Dust:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Search for Sunken Treasure: Exploring the Worlds Great Shipwrecks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"King of Ages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"TROPICAL DERMATOLOGY","description":"In an increasingly global community, the rapid adaptation of microorganisms has facilitated the return of old communicable diseases and the emergence of new ones.

Using a mix of experiential reportage, personal storytelling, and fresh scientific discovery, Steven Johnson describes how the brain works -- its chemicals, structures, and subroutines -- and how these systems connect to the day-to-day realities of individual lives. For a hundred years, he says, many of us have assumed that the most powerful route to self-knowledge took the form of lying on a couch, talking about our childhoods. The possibility entertained in this book is that you can follow another path, in which learning about the brain's mechanics can widen one's self-awareness as powerfully as any therapy or meditation or drug. In Mind Wide Open, Johnson embarks on this path as his own test subject, participating in a battery of attention tests, learning to control video games by altering his brain waves, scanning his own brain with a $2 million fMRI machine, all in search of a modern answer to the oldest of questions: who am I? Along the way, Johnson explores how we \\"read\\" other people, how the brain processes frightening events (and how we might rid ourselves of the scars those memories leave), what the neurochemistry is behind love and sex, what it means that our brains are teeming with powerful chemicals closely related to recreational drugs, why music moves us to tears, and where our breakthrough ideas come from. Johnson's clear, engaging explanation of the physical functions of the brain reveals not only the broad strokes of our aptitudes and fears, our skills and weaknesses and desires, but also the momentary brain phenomena that a whole human life comprises. Why, when hearing a tale of woe, do we sometimes smile inappropriately, even if we don't want to? Why are some of us so bad at remembering phone numbers but brilliant at recognizing faces? Why does depression make us feel stupid? To read Mind Wide Open is to rethink family histories, individual fates, and the very nature of the self, and to see that brain science is now personally transformative -- a valuable tool for better relationships and better living.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ojttc1nru7sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Jesus: Critically examined","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pb4rv6OMQd4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Guinea Pig (The Essential Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flavor of the Month: Why Smart People Fall for Fads","description":"Joel Best explores the range of institutional fads, analyses the features of our culture that foster them, and identifies the major stages of the fad cycle: emerging, surging, and purging.

How do they make the landscape work for them? In what ways does Austen herself use landscape to convey meaning? These are among the questions Barbara Britton Wenner asks as she explores how Austen uses landscape to extend the range of reflection and activity for her female protagonists. Women, Wenner argues, create private spaces within the landscape that offer them the power of knowledge gained through silent and invisible observation. She traces the construction of these hidden refuges in Austen's six major novels, as well as in her juvenilia and her final, unfinished novel, Sanditon. Her book will be an important resource for Austen specialists and for those interested generally in the importance of landscape in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century women's fiction writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qSSoDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horror, The Film Reader (In Focus: Routledge Film Readers)","description":"Horror, The Film Reader brings together key articles to provide a comprehensive resource for students of horror cinema.

In the sagas that grew from this discovery, the lands were given names that resonated with hope and promise. Almost 1000 years later, a husband and wife team united their talents. Intrigued by allusions in the ancient sagas to fabled Vinland, they considered the scholarship on Viking culture and technology; they studied maps and they researched intensively the prominent theories on Vinland's location.
