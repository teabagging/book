That image may not, however, be completely correct. Since his appearance as a novelist in 1991, Grisham has annually produced a best-selling work. In those efforts, he wanders in and out of the courtroom and spends a great deal of time away from the law. While his major characters are often attorneys, they frequently find themselves in predicaments that bear only an incidental connection to the legal profession. Previous Grisham efforts such as THE FIRM, THE BRETHREN and, to a degree, THE PELICAN BRIEF and THE SUMMONS, represent plot lines in which the main characters could easily be non-lawyers without significant impact on the narrative.Whether one considers Grisham a courtroom or mystery writer, it is clear in his writing that, as a former practicing attorney, he has much to offer about the strengths and failings of the American legal system. In his books, Grisham has taken to task politically motivated prosecutors, the flawed juvenile justice system, the health insurance and tobacco industries and insurance defense attorneys. Last year, in THE SUMMONS, Grisham had some unkind words for those members of the legal profession often pejoratively referred to as \\"trial lawyers\\". Now, in THE KING OF TORTS, Grisham returns to this subject and sets his sights on that particular aspect of trial law very much in discussion today --- the field of mass tort litigation.THE KING OF TORTS follows the winning Grisham formula. Early in the novel, an insignificant crime of violence introduces us to Jarrett Clay Carter II. Young Carter is an overworked, underpaid and under-appreciated public defender in the District of Columbia. He is appointed to represent Tequila Watson, a career drug offender charged with the murder of Ramon \\"Pumpkin\\" Pumphrey. Like many of Grisham's young lawyer heroes, Clay Carter is at the juncture of his life when he has begun to question his status in the legal system.THE KING OF TORTS is the Faustian tale of Carter's meteoric rise to the top of the field of mass tort litigation. Shortly after his appointment to represent Watson, Max Pace, a man of mystery and intrigue, visits Carter. He offers the young attorney the opportunity to initiate litigation against a drug manufacturer who has negligently produced a product that causes people to kill. Although Clay Carter has countless questions and concerns, Pace's simple answer is always to remind him of the millions of dollars in legal fees that will soon be deposited in the accounts of the new law firm that Carter will control. That answer is sufficient.In the span of several months, Carter becomes the beneficiary of nearly $100 million in fees. Such an achievement is most ironic when one considers that never during the course of his spectacular achievement does Carter even enter a courtroom. Indeed, his only venture inside a courthouse during the course of this novel occurs when Carter watches one of his fellow attorneys attempt to win a case that will produce millions of dollars in fees for Carter and his firm.In his meteoric rise, Clay Carter becomes a member of an exclusive club of trial attorneys who engage in mass tort litigation, often referred to as class actions. In these types of cases, thousands of injured parties are grouped together to bring their claims. Oftentimes, small claims in the range of $25,000 to $50,000 are bundled together. The main beneficiaries of such activity are the attorneys who generate large legal fees from settlements in thousands of cases without being forced to handle each case on an individual basis. Attorneys in this field often obtain clients by advertisements in newspapers, radio and television. Because successful mass tort lawyers obtain their cash awards from huge corporations, the entire subject has become a high stakes political contest between the business and legal communities.The major character in THE KING OF TORTS is not Clay Carter. Rather, the attorneys who engage in mass tort litigation are the prime targets for Grisham's wrath. As they fly around the country ferreting out clients like bloodhounds hunting down criminals, Grisham enjoys poking fun at their numerous foibles. They are far more interested in fancy private jets, beautiful women, vintage wine and high-class living than in securing justice. John Grisham, a man who practiced law for several years before commencing his writing career, does not find such characters to be an asset to the legal profession.THE KING OF TORTS is a prime example of the adage that, in novels, \\"Plot trumps the truth.\\" In order to make the novel work, Grisham must compress a great deal of action into a short amount of time. Anyone with a minimal knowledge of the workings of the American legal system knows that what John Grisham has written is hyperbolic. But Grisham has written with a message. The debate in America today over \\"tort reform\\" and the \\"malpractice crisis\\" is continuing and clamorous. Although it is a work of fiction, THE KING OF TORTS can help enhance the quality of that debate. Anyone interested in the issue, or just interested in another appealing novel, will enjoy John Grisham's latest effort.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Are you sure John Grisham wrote this book? It was so unlike his other books. It was so boring I started skipping pages to get to the &quot;good part&quot;. Trust me - there isn't a &quot;good part&quot;."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I started King of Torts expecting to have a good read. His stories do follow a formula, but it's usually interesting: good lawyer, bad lawyers, someone running for their life, and lots of money. As usual, his engaging style kept me turning pages, but I kept wondering when the plot was going to go somewhere. I could not believe it when I finished and realized that was all there was. So many story points headed in possibly exciting directions and not one of them panned out. I would say this book was a good first half of a novel. Unfortunately, it never comes to a climax or resolution. It's like telling a joke and forgeting the punchline. I was very disappointed. Was the whole thing about the evils of rapid wealth? If so, even that point was poorly made. I can't believe this got published. I hope Grisham puts a little more into his future works."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It's been a while since I read a Grisham through, but I wasn't disappointed. How much is a soul worth, Grisham asks in this tale, with an even harder question whispering underneath,Who has to pay for it? Clay Carter decries his beatup Honda Accord, condescending would-be in-laws and deadend job. When saddled with a murder case, the public defender thinks things have really hit rock bottom.And he's right. But not for long. Enter a slick guy dressed in black and rippled with muscles, a corporate fireman who needs to silence Clay before he runs onto a secret that can destroy his client--and everything changes. Ten million everythings. Dragging his co-workers and roommate along for the ride, Clay gets sucked into the vaccuum of wealth over the next year, only to be spit out at the end, grasping the one thing that's eluded him despite his millions, a relationship with the girlfriend he loves.Though some describe this as fluff or boring, I urge them to read between the lines. The background cast of THE KING OF TORTS is just as important as the main cast. Tequila Watson, Ramon Pumphrey, the Hannas and definitely the Worleys all give a picture of the reality of tort litigation, drug companies and the criminal justice system. It's not just about the writing, but the thinking the writing makes you do. :)"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I've read 5-6 Grisham novels and they usually keep my attention and interest. This one is the worst by far. Some have said this one was preachy in that it showed his disdain for these types of lawsuits and lawyers. I didn't get that -- it seemed to me that he was almost excusing them. After all, the main character never redeems himself. Furthermore, this novel seemed to just trudge along. Half the book is about the wealth and possessions Clay acquires. I mean literally -- he buys this, that and then some more of this and a building to put them in.... Zzzz...Also, the characters in this novel were very one dimensional and bland. The most interesting is Ridley, Clay's supermodel, trophy girlfriend!While I don't think the end is predictable (I was hoping the character would right some wrongs or go to jail) it is anticlimactic and disappointing. It is as if it is saying, &quot;Clay did all this stuff wrong, hurt all these people, allowed an innocent man to go to jail for life, but Clay is okay in the end and that's what matters.&quot; I hope Grisham's next is better...of course in my opinion it won't be too hard."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This has to be the worst story line Grisham has put into the public domain yet. I have read all his previous books and keenly anticipated another legal thriller but I could not actually bring myself to finish it.What multinational firm in their right mind would go out of their way to find, inform, compensate and then demand confidentiality of seven poor underprivileged familes that had no idea they were wronged and even if they ever did would never ever be able to prove it.An artificial set of circumstances and assumptions that have no basis what so ever in reality.There is a certain contempt of the reader in the stupidty of this story line.Sorry, just no good enough!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have read everything Grishom has written and was about to give up because of disappointment in last books.

It doesn't have any action or suspense like the early Grisham's books had. He just keeps getting worse with every novel. If you are interested in reading John Grisham don't read this one, read his early stuff like The Firm, The Client, or A time to Kill. Skip this one though. Clay Carter is a very believable character but he is not exciting enough, he is just a very boring character who starts out small lawyer with no real hopes or dreams. Then through a lawsuit he makes millions, gets greedy, and the he ends up bankrupt. That's what the whole novel is about."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"So Grisham is back to writing about what he is best at....Lawyers.The King Of Torts is no different from any of the earlier &quot;Lawyer&quot; books that he has written.The formula is the same-Young Bright Lawyer-Strike Something Big-Makes Big Money.Now &quot;The King Of Torts&quot; does not end the story here.In fact the story sort of begins here.Grishm's writing style is amazing,the main protagonist Clay Carter is the &quot;King of Torts&quot; actually another term for a greedy Lawyer,and yet you sympathise with him.The book is &quot;unputdownable&quot; because somwthing is always happening or going to happen and you are always wondering what could happen.Its not a thriller by any means but its got that addictive quality about it.Grisham fans go get your copy now,and If you are not one go get it and you will become a Grisham fan."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I was quite excited to pick up the new Grisham book, but must admit I was disappointed in what I read.

I really enjoyed this novel as I do every John Grisham novel. With the detail, and a smoothness I just can't explain. A must read, for anyone dreaming of a little more then normal life."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book seemed to go too fast."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts is a modern fairy tale seemingly based on Jack and the Beanstalk. I use that reference because I could see no other reason for employing this story's absurd structure. The book came across to me like it was a writing exercise based on that fairy tale that was not intended to be read by anyone. Mr. Grisham is a fine writer, and has shown he can do much better than this in developing his character, his plots and his resolutions.Hapless public defender Clay Carter is handed the equivalent of some magic beans when he uncovers a pharmaceutical company conspiracy while defending an indigent client and decides to settle the case for a big fee. Using the same source of the magic beans (an illegal fixer), he's soon off pursuing another class action suit. That brings him into the land of the giants where he meets the other class action tort attorneys. He learns their ways (but not too well) and soon has his clients and defendants chasing him down the beanstalk. He chops down the beanstalk (his mass tort practice), and manages to survive the experience. Like Jack, he's better off for the experience even though he did a lot of misdeeds along the way.Why would anyone want to read this book? Basically, it will appeal to those who want to know about how mass tort law practices operate. These are the modern version of the classic lawyer who chases ambulances to get clients . . . except these lawyers chase as many ambulances as possible and pile the results of those chases into one law suit representing the interests of millions. It's now the biggest way of making money by practicing law. Most of what is revealed here comes pretty close to the truth, with some exaggeration for humor. Is the public interest served by these practices? You'll be in a better position to decide after reading this book. The King of Torts is not Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, however, so it won't become the basis for widespread revulsion against these class action practices.If tales about greed and excess don't turn you on, avoid this book. You won't like it.After you finish reading the book (if you decide to do so), ask yourself when providing financial incentives is a good thing . . . and when too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing for us all. Certainly, the many recent cases of corporate misdeeds related to fraudulent accounting fit."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book came recommended by a friend. I can't say I've ever been impressed by Grisham's writing. I've seen his writing used in too many examples of what a writer should not do. Nevertheless, I went to the bookstore, picked it up, read the first sentence, then quickly placed it back on the shelf. Here's the fatal sentence:&quot;The shots that fired the bullets were heard by no less than eight people....&quot;Huh? Shots don't fire bullets! Pistols do. Rifles do. Grisham is obviously too much of a lawyer to know that 'report' can also mean the sound of an explosion or a loud noise, as in &quot;The report of a gun.&quot; Grisham has had a constant problem with this sort of thing, beginning with his breakout novel, THE FIRM. Oh, he can construct an engaging storyline, but the writing is absolutely attrocious. I can't believe this got past his editors. Had a lesser known writer submitted a manuscript with that first line, it would've been rejected out of hand! What happened with this one? Were they asleep at their desks? Or were they hypnotized by the millions their employers would make off of Grisham's fan base? Neither is good. It takes a better writer and a better first sentence to get my attention and my money.Amazon's scale should be 0-5 stars, not 1-5. I'd rather give this book 0 stars."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I won't even get into the boring, predictable and ultimately pointless story. Suffice it to say that a lead character with shaky morals and no redeemable qualities makes for a pretty uninvolving read. A new low for a once great author."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Dont let anyone tell you this book is boring, infact it is anything but that. The pace is real fast and I enjoyed the yarn thoroughly. This is more on the grisham main stream track than &quot;the last juror&quot;. Although this book is not the firm,pelican brief type. In places it reads like the &quot;life and times :documentary of crooked lawyers&quot; who make money out of mass tort cases. I dont know if it's as bad in real life, but anyways its labelled fiction I guess for any story you have to stretch things a bit. Its a power rise story. Those who like to read books on the lifestyles on the rich and famous theme will love it coz this book is abt power, money and high ambitions. This book is abt getting filthy rich in very little time.Dont look for the ending, as in most of the recent Grisham novels the overall book experience is cherishable. Enjoy the moments in the book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I have been a long time fan of John Grisham but the last few books that I've read of his, King of Torts included, have just seemed like he got tired of writing and ended it. One of the things I always liked about Grisham was his ability to come up with twists and unexpected endings that were totally unpredictable. King of Torts was very entertaining up to the last few chapters of the book but the ending was a huge letdown."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"In his latest legal thriller, John Grisham tackles the world of mass tort litigation, where lawyers sign up thousands of clients in class action lawsuits. They tap into goldmines by forcing companies guilty of selling bad products to settle out of court, typically raking in millions of bucks in fees themselves because of the sheer numbers. The protagonist is Clay Carter, a nobody at the Office of the Public Defender, who stumbles into a huge settlement that begins a meteoric rise for him to become the king of torts, earning millions. Who is the mysterious contact who is feeding Clay inside information to accomplish all this? Clay's increased richness is combined with an increased nastiness, and it takes some surprises to bring him to repentance \\"He was ashamed of his greed and embarrassed by his stupidity. It was sickening what the money had done to him.\\"The story-line is quite gripping, probably because we identify with the hero, and his rise to success appeals to our own inate desire for instant wealth. The protagonist has both virtues and vices, and we must both love and hate him at the same time (although the supporting cast of characters is rather cardboard and lame). There is a moral lesson in Clay's changing characterization, as he falls to the very depths of character and greed that he himself first despised. Clay's rise and his fall is didactic, because ultimately Grisham wants us to be somewhat sickened by all the greed of money hungry mass tort lawyers. But while the filthy rich lawyers with their glitzy personal jets and bought women soon lose their appeal because of their nastiness, has the money itself lost its appeal for readers? It could be argued that by the last page, our love of money which made the plot so gripping is still rather intact. And some of the other smut we've encountered in the process isn't quite wiped clean either. At times Grisham is surprisingly and plainly smutty - the unmarried hero is sexually active, and although Grisham doesn't give us all the details of what happens in bed, he doesn't suggest it is wrong either. There are even a couple of sly references to homosexuality and bisexuality that were unnecessary. While the morality tale about greed is crystal clear, it's a shame that Grisham appears to let some other morals slip in the process, or at least fails to make clear the lines between good and evil behaviour in other respects.At the end of the day, like the main character, this morality tale is itself flawed and incomplete. The plot isn't entirely credible either, especially the way in which Clay became chosen as the lawyer elect in the first settlement. But if you can look past these weaknesses, this is another Grisham novel that can be enjoyed for what it is - a suspenseful legal pageturner. This is not Grisham at his best (The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Rainmaker), but it isn't Grisham at his worst (The Summons) either. Let's hope that Grisham has finished his own personal fall, and is on the rise again."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Thin premise, weak plot line, poor character development, and a lousy ending. Young and gullible lawyer trades his ethics for big bucks but eventually sees the light. Boy leaves girl and goes through trials, then boy gets the same girl he didn't want in the first place. Ho-hum. Don't waste your time. It's clear to me, considering \\"King of Torts\\" and the boredom of his \\"Skipping Christmas,\\" that Grisham has written himself out. (Why didn't I give it a '1', you might ask. Because I did read it all the way through, and because I did learn something about the modern practice of class action law. Were the learnings worth my time? In my opinion, no.)"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am an avid reader of Grisham and a collector of his legal thrillers. This book is overall a good read, compared to my experience with The Bretheren (still trying to get through it).Although The King of Torts is good, it in now way lives up to Grisham's earlier works.

Check it out at the library."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham usually delivers quick, easy, and enjoyable reads, but this book fails to hold the reader's attention past chapter eleven. At that point, the book becomes incredibly boring and difficult to finish.

The read was torture, as was the slow uninteresting plot of the work. I only wish he had taken more time with it. I told my mother that by the second chapter I lost all real interest. The main character does not have to work in this novel, unlike the rest of Grisham's books. Everything just seems to fall into his lap. Bankruptcy, which is where the book ultimatley ends, is not an exciting exit strategy for a novel."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I am a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books except the 2 that he wrote recently which were not lawyer based. After his first 4 books Grisham was by far my favorite author but he seems to be no longer giving a good effort.King of Torts starts out OK with some promise but the last two thirds of the book is very mediocre, predictable and did not seem to have much real thought put into it.Grisham seems to be writing just to make money and has lost his ingenious imagination. He still is a very good writer but it seems like he is going through the motions.Let's hope he rolls up his sleeves and uses his excellent mind to create some more great books in the future but King of Torts is not one of them. For me it is very mediocre to poor."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I had promised not to buy any more Grisham books, then a friend brought me a gift.

I suspect he was referring to the &quot;King of Torts.&quot; I think he already knew this book was way below the expectations that people have when they pick up one of his books.A young, struggling lawyer is offered a way to make a lot of money. He makes a lot of money, becomes entangled in the method of which he made it, loses a lot of money and nothing happens.Characters are shallow, save your money and time.

However, it is a very enjoyable, quick read. Perfect for a vacation read. It isn't close to his best."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"THE KING OF TORTS by John GrishamBig MoneyPlenty of work for a Public Defender, more than enough without murder thrown in, he attempted to avoid it but he didn&#65533;t dodge fast enough. Clay Carter had taken the murder case reluctantly. The defendant had shot anther man in the head without a known reason. Which was possible in Washington D. C.Not much of a case, he was guilty and admitted it, but this murder turned into something bigger when Clay was carefully investigating it. He was approached by a so-called &#65533;fireman&#65533; who was employed by a large pharmaceutical firm to put out the fire of a large upcoming case. To control, what it knew to be a loser for them the pharmaceutical company literally gave the &#65533;fireman&#65533; the authority to offer Clay more than he ever had dreamed of to take a case against them, the large pharmaceutical company for the benefit of the company. They figured that $40 million was a bargain settlement. The drug would have cost them a lot more for one defendant if a good lawyer got the correct jury and they would have to worry about the other five potent defendants. Clay was talked into quitting his job and setting up an office. He was offered enough money to qualm any conscious objections.To try and summarize the case: the pharmaceutical company had illegally tried a drug on humans in Washington D. C. It would allow a drug addict to be cured of his addiction in a few months. It worked well except in a few cases where it turned the addict into a killer. The defendants were the nearest relatives of the people killed by the drug addicts who had taken the drug. Imagine them having someone offer to get them a few million dollars for doing nothing.The pharmaceutical company wanted to settle the case with all defends and get it off the books. They never worried about the drug addicts who had taken the drug. They would spend their time in prison.Sound strange, but not so strange when you start talking about the amount of money involved. It will be Clay&#65533;s first case of mass torts which can make a lawyer rich overnight. He would have about 10 clients and he would legate each for $4 million. They would win their case, the pharmaceutical settled out of court and his share, as the lawyer fees was 30 percent, which would be $10 million. Actually, Clay had only six defendants, but they worked it out to get him the $10 million.That started Clay career as the King of Torts. There were plenty of companies who were making mistakes that had an adverse effect on their clients. (I&#65533;ll throw one in here that&#65533;s not in the book, illegal insider trading in a stock on the market.) On one case Clay had over 2500 people. He could settle for less for each defendant and still make a fortune with his one third of the total. He never had to spend a day in court. The cases were all settled out of court.Clay quickly learned to spend money in large sums on mail, advertising, TV etc&#65533; to find involved people who were clients and convince them to become defendants. On some cases the defendants did not get enough to make it worthwhile, but the lawyer(s) still made one third of the total for all the defendants, which was a good sum. The only problem was Clay had a conscious.This is a good book Mr. Gresham knows his subject. Its well worth buying for the education in money making, and spending."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"While this is an interesting book, it is not a page-turner like A Time to Kill or The Firm (or any of his first four or five books). I never really cared about Clay Carter. I never understood why he stayed at the OPD office if he hated it so much - he had to have other options. He certainly wasn't there for any altruistic reasons. And granted, $10 million is a lot of money, but he didn't seem to have to struggle too hard with his conscience. No, in the end he finally seems to feel some remorse, BUT, if he had continued on a successful trajectory, would he have have felt remorse for his actions? I believe it is the case of the thief not being sorry he stole, but being terribly sorry he was caught. No, this was a disappointing book. So much could have been done with this premise. I'd like to read a book about Helen Warshaw, and how she came to the point of taking down the mass tort lawyers. That sounds like the sort of tale Grisham tells best, about one little guy taking on the Goliaths.Ever since Runaway Jury, Grisham's books seem to have gone downhill, with the exception of Painted House. His books start with good ideas, but just seem to take the path of least resistance as far as storylines.I'm sure I will read his new books as they come out (I've read all except The Summons), hoping against hope for the Grisham I knew and loved."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Truly horrible! No storyline whatsoever. Disgusting. The beginning 20 pages were ok, but the rest was not. Reading the book turned into a much-dreaded chore, instead of enjoyment. Grisham can do better."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I really liked this book. I have read all the books by John Grisham, and I liked most of them. This was one of his better ones."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Painfully predictable! Sorry, but although I've been a huge fan of Grisham's books in the past this one was unbearable. Only read through to the end in the hope that I might be wrong. Characters one dimensional - set in stone sterotypes - the leggy dumb money hungry blonde, the poor little rich girl, lawyers with no morals etc. As a result you feel nothing for any of the characters. Slightly more readable than a Mills and Boon book, but only just."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts starts with such intrigue and mystery and continues to be intriguing and mysterious to the very last page when we finally discover that there is no payoff. I like Grisham, but we are never told anything about the most interesting character, Max Pace, and ultimately the protagonist, Clay Carter is neither moral nor interesting. I didn't even like him and despite his week attempt at feeling remorse for his wrongdoings, I got the sneaky suspicion that given the same opportunity in the future, he'd do the same thing. Working with flawed characters has worked for Grisham in the past but those characters were lovable and ultimately had charisma, but Clay did nothing heroic nor even professional to earn our sympathy and care. Like Oskar Schindler in Schindler's list, Clay is tormented by an interesting and moral accountant, but does not heed his advice and I ultimately lost patience with him and his Gulfstream and his Russian bisexual friend. The King of Torts could have been so much more but wasted its energy following a ridiculous protaganist."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I'm really a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books. I really can't believe that he has written &quot;King of Torts&quot; by himself.

Grishamseemed to pull together the whole story a bit too abruptly . . . yet that said, I'd still recommend it.There were several memorable passages; among them:* Clay laid the receiver down for a moment and summarized hisdefense. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client shot Mr.Pumphrey (who was unarmed) five or six times at point-blankrange in a dirty alley with a stolen gun for two reasons; first, he recognized him, and second, they had a playground shoving match about eight years ago. May not sound like much, ladies and gentlemen, but all of us know that in Washington, DC, those two reasons are as good as any.* The gaze from the frosty hostess told him, I know you are not a member, but I'll take you to your table anyway. \\"Follow me,\\" she said the slight makings of a fake smile. Clay said nothing. He swallowed hard, looked straight ahead, and tried to ignore the heavy knot in his stomach. How was he supposed to enjoy a meal in such surroundings? He and Rebecca had eaten there twice--once with Mr. and Mrs. Van Horn, once without. The food was expensive and quite good, but then Clay lived on processed turkey so his standards were low and he knew it.* \\"Where will you be in ten years?\\"\\"I don't think like that. I don't believe in calendars and schedules and lists of things to do. Setting goals is such a stupid American habit. Not for me. I try to get through today, maybe give a thought or two to tomorrow, and that's it. Plotting the future is damned ridiculous.\\"\\"Sorry I asked.\\"\\"Live for the moment, Clay. Tomorrow will take care of itself. You've got your hands full right now, seems to me.\\"\\"The money should keep me occupied.\\"\\"Don't blow it, son. I know that looks impossible, but you'll be surprised. New friends are about to pop up all over the place. Women will drop from the sky.\\"\\"When?\\"\\"Just wait. I read a book once--FOOL'S GOLD, or something likethat. One story after another about great fortunes that had been lost by the idiots who had them. Fascinating reading. Get a copy.\\"\\"I think I'll pass.\\""},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I like reading Grisham books- they are extremely entertaining, engaging, etc. but the endings are always a bit of a let down... everything gets \\"solved\\" to easily- like the FBI dropping the charges. Oh please!It's a good read, if you don't expect a creative ending....------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts is a typical Grisham novel. It follows the same pattern as his other lawyer stories. However, I can say that I was suprised that it took the main character as long as it did to spend the money and then lose it. The pattern was predictable from the beginning. I'm sorry to say that this was not one of Grisham's best."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I just finished &quot;The King of Torts&quot; and enjoyed it alot. In true Girsham form it has an exciting plot and an unsuspecting ending. Having read all of his books, the thing that has me hooked on Girsham is that his writing flows well and the plots have just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing up until the end. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This book was gripping. I began reading it at 5 p.m. and didn't stop until I finished it the next day! Possibly Grisham's best legal thriller since The Rainmaker. I admit that I prefer stories told in first person, but this one made me feel like I was a part of the story line despite its third person perspective. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"After reading the King of the torts, I was struck by two outstanding feelings. One, that Grisham made a return to his comfortable writing topic and style, and two, that the excess of the dot-com era heavily influenced this unusual book.The central character seems to be the antithesis of the typical Grishim model. While the basic formula is still present in our Mr. Clay, his fatal flaw - call it arrogence, or greed - is new territory for Grisham.On numerous occassions he mention's the wash out of dot-commer's who've built and lost fortunes - a fitting analogy for our protagonist who ulitmately sow's the seeds of his own destruction.The book effectively will move you with feelings of excitment, undeserved means, and humbling defeat.All in all, this was the best Grisham novel since the runaway jury."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I don't consider myself a huge Grisham fan, but I was looking forward to this book. From page 1, it kept me going and I ended up reading the entire book in one night (though it was a late night).A lot of the characters in the book were similar to those of others in previous Grisham novels; as were the themes of greed and ethics and where it gets you.Not my favorite Grisham tale, but a good read none the less."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Another standard Grisham novel, but more satisfying than his recent books. This one reminds me of \\"The Firm\\"--a poor lawyer tempted by corrupt money; lengthy descriptions of the good life he finds once he gets to the top; the feds attempt to rain on his parade; he disappears with the girl at the end. The first case which makes our hero the \\"King of Torts\\" can be seen coming from a mile away, but the twist which \\"dethrones\\" him is a nice surpise."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham definitely delivers a strong message of the grave consequences of greed and power and the affect on even the most unsuspecting individual in the story \\"King of Torts.\\" Clay Carter was a humble attorney working for the Office of the Public Defender, not making the big bucks and daydreaming of a legal practice that pulls in a healthier salary to impress his soon to be in-laws. While all of this would be icing on the cake for Clay, he abhors his future in-laws because of their snobby, materialistic behavior. By way of a random call by one Max Pace, Clay is introduced to the ins and outs of suing big corporations for their mistakes (primarily drug companies) and the fascinating world of mass tort litigation. Seems this is a fast and easy way to become a millionaire. As Clay begins working for Max, he uncovers very dangerous drugs on the market with quite serious and some even fatal, side effects. What begins as financial aid for the victims suffering from the after-effects of a bad drug, explodes into a money-making, out-to-get-all-you-can, big business for the attorney handling the cases. Clay quite quickly falls into what he despised; a vulture, looking out for number one with no concern for the good of his clients. He abandons his former life for a ride on the fast tract of class lawsuits in mass tort litigation, settling out of court with not much effort (with the exception of widespread advertising to bring the clients to him), raking in millions of dollars as well as his trophy toys, a luxury airliner and trophy bimbo (Ridley) to mention just two. What happens to him as a result? You'll have to read the book - it is the work of a master writer with a strong as well as entertaining message."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"King of Torts is a middling Grisham novel. It is not nearly as compelling as some of his early novels (The Firm and Runaway Jury), nor is it as tedious as some of his recent efforts (The Broker and The Summons).The story is a simple one: Boy sells soul. Boy gets rich. Boy goes broke.Clay Carter, a struggling young lawyer is led to the dark side of the law by a mysterious stranger who introduces him to the morally bankrupt world of mass tort litigation. With the help of his new found friend, Clay becomes obscenely rich in a ridiculously short period of time. His half-hearted attempts to resist the trappings of wealth are short-lived and before long he is sucked into the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Inevitably, Clay's financial empire crumbles.Grisham uses King of Torts as a diatribe against mass tort litigation and the need for reform. King of Torts isn't a suspense novel, it's a morality tale.That said it was interesting to learn how these class action lawsuits work (and how the lawyers get rich without ever entering a courtroom). Grisham's novels are always well written, accurate, and plausible - and King of Torts is no exception.The biggest problem with this novel though is the character of Clay Carter. While he isn't inherently evil, (he certainly doesn't start out that way) it's hard to feel good about his meteoric rise or to feel his pain when it all comes crashing down. The novel may have worked better if Clay had been a little more of an a--hole. At least then the reader would feel something. As it was, I felt indifference to Clay's rise and fall. I didn't hate him enough to relish his ruin, but I didn't like him enough to feel badly for him either.In the end Clay lands with at least one foot on the ground. He may lose his beloved plane and his vacation homes, but he won't be destitute and homeless. He even gets the girl (although, she didn't seem like much of a catch to me)Readers looking for a mystery thriller will be disappointed by King of Torts. There isn't much mystery and virtually no thrills in this novel. I found it interesting enough but I never felt like I had much invested in Clay. I didn't care whether he kept his fortune or not, whether he managed to stay out of jail or not, or whether he got the girl or not."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment. Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits. This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees. Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline. It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall. Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone. I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs. Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"The King of Torts stands as testiment as to why John Grisham is the King of the Thriller novel. His ability to change pace, yet retain all the necessities of boldness, involvement, and redemption, I think, prove my point. This novel is a learning experience for all of us. It shows vividly how the Tort system, through this abomination of the \\"Class Action Law Suit,\\" is a needless dredge on society--little more than a device for legalized extortion. Just one example: When a team of lawyers can organize a group of airline passengers to sue an airline, and win for them, maybe, a free plane ticket each, the lawyers, individually, walk off with millions of big ones with which to line their own pockets. This sort of thing is happening, all around us, just about every day. This book is a great lesson, an in-depth examination of the \\"System.\\" He has done us all a great favor by stripping bare the innards, guts and entrails of what makes this the leach-like, blood-sucking process what it is. While the Master paints his usual artistic suspense-portrait, his revelations, alone, make this book a must read."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Yeah, Adam, I noticed the Flagstaff temperature reference as well. Guess folks figure its in Arizona, it must be hot. Note To Grisham: Its in the mountains. Its cool. I realize its a small point but its representative of the sloppy way the book was put together. Plot is tired. Characters are not developed. Lawyers and corporations are caracatures. And for the folks that are thankful about the education about the tort system, you might want to look elsewhere for the truth. Here is just one thing. These cases that Clay has are not class actions. They may be mass tort cases, but they are not class actions. In class action litigation, the plaintiff's lawyer does not go out and recruit individual clients and race to sign them up. You sue on behalf of one person and others, not named in the lawsuit, who are similarly situated. The class is as big as the number of people who respond to public notices. One other thing. Grisham breezily dismisses the rights of the murderer client. Maybe someone who is drugged to undo addiction with a drug that causes the user involuntarily to kill people might have a good defense, as Clay's lawyer realizes in the waning moments of the book. If Clay had realized this at the beginning then we wouldn't have had much of a story I guess."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Of all novels that have galloped out of John Grisham's closet,\\"The King of Torts\\" must rank as one of his best. This is a novel that invokes a chiselled language and portrays life to its near perfected harshness;a book where there's a very narrow scope of sentimentality and emotions to be more than just fringe players and one where meanderings from the mainstream idea is but a prohibited parameter. \\"The King of Torts\\" is a novel which looks at life as it is and reflects it as it is;it is the common story of how hunger for fame,fortune and success can erode moral aflictions;it is a tale of a stroke od good luck pulling down a person to the depths of conscientous and financial ruins.\\"The King of Torts\\" is a book firmly focused on the moral decay and rampant corruption that the legal inatitution has consciously leapt into. John Grisham traces several months in the life of Clay Carter,a young public defender whose moral conviction and honest structure of job plan is dealt a blow by the undeniably powerful hand of money. As the author takes us on a roller-coaster ride with Clay,we can feel ourselves actively involved in the plethora of transactions that the protagonist of the novel engages himself in and as the journey becomes more and more bumpy,we can feel the heat of life itself.Five years into this profession and Clay has relinquished all hopes and expectations of ever leaving behind the lowly-paid,relative obscure onus of a public defender. The city of Washington is getting even more exasperating for him to breathe as his girlfriend's parents are looking for a new man for their daughter to marry. Rebecca Bennett too is getting fidgety and wants Clay either to accept the extended hand of help of her parents or be damned. Clay refuses to oblige and loses a major fraction of his better self. And when every feature of his life seems to conspire to dash Clay's back against the wall,a silver lining arcs itself across a dark sky.Clay takes up a pretty humdrum and unglamorous task of defending Tequila Watson,a 20-year-old black male accused of killing a man on a street in Washington DC. To Clay this appears just one of the myriad senseless killings that are carried out across Washington every day. But a very much routine investigation into Tequila Watson's past and background seems to contain several lost pages and an equal number of loopholes. and then arrives Max Pace onto the scene offering untold riches and a place amongst the revered community in the twinklng of an eye should Clay resort to tort litigations,cease to look into Tequila Watson's issue and solve the case outside court. Clay has simply to keep mute on a secret and he could realise his age-old dream of possessing an independent law firm.As Clay accepts this offer and from being just a peripheral figure in the battle of torts in the beginning,the central character in this superbly crafted John Grisham novel becomes the \\"king of torts\\". He becomes a renowned figure in the public eye,a hero really. But luck rotates in wheels and so inevitably Clay falls down from CLoud 9 to a bed of thorns. Clay never recovers and is entangled further and further into a web of legal mess and loses his way completely out of it. Money is want Clay once craved for and money is what he gets and money is what distorts the design of his life.From a young lawyer exhausted of his unpromising position to an overnight millionaire.....this is the fairytale that Clay Carter lives for the space of more than a year. But wealth and power are not eternal but morals and sound princiles are and Clay realises this basic truth in the crudest fashion under the sun. His rise is meteoric and his downfall equally spectacular but John Grisham's portrayal of the character Clay Carter is really a microcosm. Himself a former lawyer,Grisham doesn't find putting himself into the shoes of the lead actor in this drama that tough and neither is one of the most prolific writer in contemporary time inept at showcasing the dire corruption that has seeped into law and which dissolves youthful idealism in no time. Characters such as Mulrooney,Patton French and Saulsberry---whom the author paints so marvellously with the shade of reality---are overlapping in the aspect that all these lawyers resort to tort litigation to make fast money without paying no regard to teir original profession. Indeed it is Grisham's sardonic view of the legal institution and the various elements there that is so overwhelingly captivating in this book. The kinds of lawyers who feature in this book are the true and fair images of their real-life counterparts and the added dimension of a very subtle language sharpened on the edge of a die-hard authrative ambition marks a massive onslaught on the undertakings that occur in the legal proffesion,and by extension in all the apparent noble callings. John Grisham's \\"The King of Torts\\" is a greatly satirical novel that etches reality into its own ereal-life colours and the final product is a picture that shattes the whole essence of law and jurisdiction."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"This is my first Grisham novel and being in a captive (airport) environment I succumbed to the curiosity of examining current \\"fiction\\" from a big name best seller. A previous review hit the nail on the head. Utter formulaic crap. It is the book version of network TV programming. A hastily created outline fleshed out with gloss and flash and at no time a shred of human character development of any depth. I was intrigued by the promise of the cover jackets' description about \\"a conspiracy too horrible to believe\\". I kept waiting and waiting for the \\"conspiracy\\", which turns out to be the concept that big corp pharmaceuticals actually rush unproven drugs to market for profit. Wow, gosh, really? Superficial, boring, trite crap thrown together by a jaded rich type under pressure to come up with \\"product\\". A total waste of time."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Formulaic tripe.

However, this book was pretty bland. I kept expecting something significant to happen-or at least a drastic twist in events, and that never came. The book exhausts the word &quot;million&quot;, and revolves around getting insider information, and spending way too much money. Unfortunately, that is pretty much all that happens in this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"As I rounded page 300, I was starting to get concerned that NOTHING WAS HAPPENING. This book is horribly boring with inane sub plots that go nowhere and mean nothing. The first hundred pages were excellent and intriguing, and then . . . issue resolved. No big deal, like nothing had happened. There are countless pages of Clay dreaming about private jets, and countless other pages of Clay driving, eating, vacationing, dating, complaining. Good grief, edit out about 100 pages of fluff, DEVELOP A STORY, and this would be a great read. What bothers me more than anything is that Grisham is an excellent writer. His characters are vivid and entertaining. My opinion is not a matter of excessive expectations. This book was just boring. Oh, and I read the whole thing just to make sure.Off topic, and realizing that this is fiction, Grisham has a scene set in Flagstaff, AZ, a place near and dear to my heart. Grisham writes on page 406 that in September the temperature was pushing 105. A quick look at the record books reveals that the RECORD high in Flagstaff, AZ in September was 90 and that was in 1950. The average is around 75. I don't care in the context of the King of Torts, but I don't want people thinking that all of Arizona is an arid wasteland. Flagstaff is a wonderful mountain town and home to my undergrad university, Northern Arizona University."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Having read &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; as well as a couple of his other books, I was getting excited that Grisham had put together another classic that would have twists and unexpected events unfolding that made you laugh or cheer for the underdog. In this book the main character, Clay Carter, was characterized very well as a noboday working for the OPD about to get the break that only people dream of. Instead of developing as a character, along with all the other losers that came on the scene, he stayed a loser who did everything predictable when over $110,000,000 bucks fell in his lap. His romantic relationships were shallow as well and at times shameful. I kept waiting for the turning point in the book where Clay Carter would find his way and become someone I could like but it never happened. After I gave up on him I was hoping that something fun and exciting would happen, at least, but nothing. He simply ends up filing for chapter 11 (which is where I should have stopped reading...), gets assurance from distant friends that they will help him get through it, and of course he gets his girl back - someone named Rebecca who is absent 3/4 of the book married to someone nobody knows???I'm a person who feels guilty ready anything other than technical books, so I am not a literary critic. I just found the book boring and uneventful. The only surprise to me in this book was that there wasn't any."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"If you don't care about manipulative, greedy, lawyers, you'll be hard pressed to care about this &quot;hero&quot;. Character development starts out well, and fizzles into shallow stereotypes. The plot, initially engaging, drops into a predictable &quot;when will he lose all the money?&quot; and &quot;will he stop sleeping with the model to get back with his married ex-girlfriend?&quot;. In a phrase, who cares? Definitely NOT Grisham's best, or even most mediocre, work."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham's novels always start out great, but end up leaving me vaguely dissatisfied. The King of Torts was no exception. The first half of this book is some of his best writing yet, the second half isn't even worth reading. It's as if the author just gave up half way through. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham touches upon an interesting idea in The King Of Torts. Clay Carter leaves his position as a public defender and becomes a ruthless and wealthy tort lawyer. In this novel, Grisham brings out provoking thoughts: How much does finance control the law, and what will people who are involved in law do because of finance? And - overall, how is the world affected legally, financially, morally by what goes on under the surface in society. I found this book to be just as - or more - pleasing as I found &quot;The Firm&quot; and other Grisham firsts."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"All the books I read from John Grisham, The King of Torts might be one of his best books. The King of Torts thrills the reader so much, that you just can't put it aside. The second you start it you will always wonder what will happen next. The King of Torts starts out with a poor Office of the Public Defender (OPC) lawyer, Clay Carter. Clay Carter always had plans of quitting the OPC office, since all the bad cases would land on there shoulders. Then he gets stuck with a strange murder case. This murder case opens the gates of wealth, and hell at the same time. A strange man contacts Clay Carter, promising some clues on the investigation. Max Pace tells him that more than ten of similar murder cases were due to drugs that healed people from addictive drugs. That's where Clay Carter biggest his journey to becoming the King of Torts. The first case was easily settled, and involved a lot of money. Clay Carter receives his share of the wealth, and is kind of clueless of what to do next. Then Max Pace comes again, and tells him of yet another bigger law suit. After his third successful law suit Clay start to wonder where Max Pace gets all these vital clues from, but it's to involve making more money that he doesn't really realize that Max Pace is doing something illegal. Clay keeps on going until the train stops. Will Clay Carter be able to keep going at this rate without really knowing Max Pace?

Oddly, but not enough with his scruples, he agreeds to it and suddenly becomes the new &quot;wunderkind&quot; of Class action attorneys, getting the attraction of colleagues and the envy of many others.Not to spoil the whole story, the plot (superbly narrated as usual) goes around the rise to the pinnacle of this young guy and his abrupt and profound fall, leaving you with a moral precept."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Sorry John. I must say that I shall not pick up another of your novels after having labored through this one for three days. With every turned page, I felt as though I myself were being gaveled by some judge who condemns people for reading such mindlessless. Maybe the idea was to force your readers to experience, first-hand, emotions like frustration and disappointment, the same ones often suffered by the helpless victims represented by tort lawyers in class-action law suits. In that regard, you have succeeded.It may very well be that Mr. Grisham has finally lost interest in producing quality work. He has, after all, had a nice run at it. Of course, the author's early legal thrillers are quite compelling page-turners of the variety that we as readers hate to see come to an end. To the contrary, this tale of greed and revenge is painfully predictable and, worse, follows its alleged climax with a drab denouement.I live in Shanghai, China. Last week, I visited Beijing for a week and stayed in a hostel. Like many such establishments, the lounge area had a small book exchange. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to whoever ends up with this novel. Additionally, I would like to say that the book I received in return, the Scott Turow classic, Presumed Innocent, could teach Old Grisham a thing or two about, first of all, high-quality legal fiction writing and, second, the art of suspense."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"It'd been awhile since I've read a Grisham novel and someone suggested that this one was fun to read. I did enjoy it. There's sleazy lawyers and back room deals, women and money and expensive jets. Basically Grisham pokes fun at lawyers and sort of spoofs some of the stuff that goes on in the world of law, specifically mass torts and class action.I realize that some of his works are not nearly as good as the first novel he produced, 'A Time to Kill', which really is a more serious novel than many of his others, but none the less, this one is fun to read, just don't expect serious literature and you'll probably not be disappointed. If you want a strong plot with meaningful characters and realistic situations and no fantasy, go elsewhere, but otherwise, it's an enjoyable read if you like the genre."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Clay Carter is a lawyer tired of serving the poor, tired of his girlfriend's country club parents, and ready for a change.

Business is good, as he pulls in many millions of dollars, barely staying ahead of his sudden spending habit. But you know something bad is lurking. Will greed catch up? Is he over his head? Well, duh - what else would you expect? I loved to see Grisham expose the dark side of this somewhat disruptable industry. In the end, it makes you appreciate the value of earning an honest dollar. Yes, this is the best book Grisham has written in a long time."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"I USED TO BE a Grisham fan. I realize Grisham is an activist, and tries to instill his political views into his books. I am normally willing to overlook this, because John Grisham has always had the inate ability to \\"draw you in.\\" You simply can't put his books down. This book has that same ability for 430 pages. While the plot was typical (Lawyer + Money + Greed = Self Crisis), his writing was catchy, cute and addictive. However, the last 40 pages make up what is the worst ending to any book I have ever read, no exaggeration. Not only is the ending predictable, it's depressing as well (a common theme among his recent works). It's as if he deliberately thought up the worst thing that could happen to the protagonist (short of death), and that's what happened. It was one of the scenarios I predicted he might have chosen for an ending, and sure enough, there is was. Grisham's message was simple and predictable (It was really a hidden political message): If you're greedy, bad things will happen to you. In summary, his writing style has improved, but this is overshadowed by his political activism and predictable plots and endings. He's going to have to write another GOOD book before I give him any more of my money. I have already wasted money on his last three, I will not get burned again."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"A frustrated 30-year old public defender, intimidated by his girl friend's rich parents, opts to chase the big bucks offered by a shady character representing a major pharmaceutical company as a tort (class action) lawyer.

The plot never came full circle...characters were introduced in the beginning and played up, then never reappeared....it's as if Grisham just gave up in the middle of the book. Since I'm a devoted Grisham reader, I'll try again, but if the next one bites the dust, he won't get a third chance."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"We've all seen tv ads for lawyers soliciting asbestos victims. King of Torts is about the legal specialty of soliciting large groups of people who have been hurt by a productSeveral of the cases in this story are prescription drugs gone wrong. One of the drugs induces tumors in its victims. Another, if you can believe this, causes some of its users to go out and kill strangers. That pill is a bit hard to swallow.But I don't think it is utterly farfetched to the point of impossibility, considering that all of the children who shot their classmates in school were on prescription drugs at the time, a fact only mentioned in passing in the papers and media, but a fact that deserves BOLD CAPITALS when you are asking why kids kill.Those drugs, including ritalin and its close relatives, come with warnings that they may cause homicidal or suicidal tendencies. So the bad prescription drugs in King of Torts are not that farfetched.Our hero, lawyer Clay Carter, is not on a crusade to punish corruption, to punish those who knowingly sell dangerous prescription drugs to the public. Rather, he is on a crusade to make hundreds of millions of dollars for himself.And of course you have your obligatory romance. And the girls are, of course, knockouts. What goes up (financially) eventually comes down. In other words, the story is formulaic. But so is pretty much every other story out there, and almost without exception, every movie you see.Next time, John, give us a love interest who is a worse than average looking girl with a weight problem, keep the rich folk the hell out of it, and let's have some people we can identify with.Anyway, the story does carry you along. I read it in just a few days. I just wish it was a little more real, a little more relevant to my life, and a lot less focused on the obscenely wealthy and the beautiful. Screw them. Who wants to read about them."},{"Title":"The King of Torts","review":"Grisham is one of the best, and this book is another fast-moving, page-turning, interesting one.The story is about a young, frustrated, underpaid lawyerin the D.C. public defender's office, barely dreaming ofa better life and career, who suddenly has a fabulouscase dropped in his lap by a mysterious stranger.Yes, that is quite a stretch in our imagination, but strangethings do happen,and this author can make it verybelieveable and fascinating.The kid's new case, involving medical malpractice where hemanages, with advice, to enlist hundreds of sufferers,thrusts him into the limelight and the forefront of hisprofession, and he is quickly being touted as the new&quot;King of Torts,&quot; the master of the mass-tort field.The first 2/3 of the book goes like wildfire, with ever-increasing tension and action.Unhappily, about that time, the author telegraphs his ending,and then the tension melts away, and the book is not quiteso demanding or interesting.The ending is a foregone conclusion, so that ending is a bitof a let-down, and we can't quite maintain our high level ofinterest through the length of the book.But it is a very good read nonetheless, and readers of a goodstory won't want to miss it."},{"Title":"Airlines of Asia - Since 1920","review":"Over almost 600 pages, Davis traces the history of Northeast, Southeast and South Asian airlines since 1920 through to the the mid 1990s. Coverage is comprehensive and includes airlines from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Hong Kong, Philippines, China, Taiwan, Japan, North and South Korea, and Mongolia, among others. Chapters cover the historical development of the airlines and include, among other things, route maps, information on fleet development and some other highlights. For the interested reader there is a two page bibliography of books related to Asian air transport at the end of the book.One major shortcoming is that the author does not reference his sources, which is unscholarly to say the least. For a book that was the result of 20 years of reseach, a two page bibliography is rather disappointing und undermines the credibility of the author's undoubtably extensive research. Moreover, Davis has a habit of littering his writing with general comments on the airline business that are irrelevant and make the author seem high-browed (e.g. pg 180, \\"Airline people are airline people and seem to be a special breed whose devotion to the cause of air transport tanscends petty prejudices or even major ones\\").Nevertheless this is a unique book and useful compendium of Asian aviation history and despite its shortcomings deserves its place on the shelf of anyone interested in Asian airline history."},{"Title":"Storybridges to French for Children (Sfr125)","review":"The storyteller tells the background story in English and conversation, exclamations, etcetera are in French.

It reminds me of some of H. P.

On the other hand, the author has a gift for saying things in a way that feels more blunt than malicious.My biggest complaint is the quality of the printing, which seems a bit blurry or pixilated on alternate pages. It's still perfectly readable, just a bit annoying. I'm not sure if this is a problem with every copy, or just mine."},{"Title":"Attic Access","review":"Novel is written with an ear for real speech and an accurate eye for real people.

Mr. Battaglia proves that he's done his reading on the subject and articulates his case well. The book shows real promise for the future, when hewill give voice to perhaps a better vehicle than Thunk. But then, what shape would anyone give to the balancer of the universe. Perhaps the image of jello is as good a vehicleas something more subtle. Perhaps it reflects the author's sense of humor or irony. The narrative is left open for continued reflection from this dealer of &quot;consequences&quot;.

There is good information in the book on the size of seed beads, needles and the type of threads to use. The illustrations are rather crude, but still easy to understand and use to make the desired design. There are some color pictures but not all of the designs have a colored picture to see what the design looks like when finished. I liked both books by Sigrid Wynne-Evans. They were very helpful in learning the brick stitch or Comanche Weave as it is sometimes called. This is the first book I bought to learn the brick stitch. It is a good book for beginners."},{"Title":"The Big Idea of Biblical Preaching: Connecting the Bible to People","review":"This book is required for Preaching I at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. It has some good examples of how to do good preaching (homiletics). It is also in honor of famous preacher Haddon Robinson, a professor emeritus.Being a collection of essays, there are a number of famous names, including Bruce Waltke, Paul Borden, Bruce Shelley, Scott Gibson, and others.The book is divided into 3 sections: first is why a single idea lands the biggest punch, the second is the biblical and theological power (foundations of exegesis and how to do some exegesis and how to apply to preaching), and the third is communicating the point.This is also a book that applies Haddon Robinson's book, Biblical Preaching. The first section is two essays, one of which asks questions Robinson poses (&quot;What is the big idea?&quot; &quot;What are the subject and the complement?&quot;), and then applying this to be text-centered and audience-focused. Then, the sermon is developed with examples, illustrations, it is applied, proved, or explained, for development, and constantly re-iterated (repeated) for force. There is also necessity for the preacher to know his people and is clear, and applies theological and biblical principles, applying the right texts to address pertinent issues.The second part of the text looks through how to do proper exegesis (for instance in Old Testament sources and challenges, such as poetics or wisdom literature, or New Testament challenges like defining the right texts and limiting the text) and applying this to preaching. In addition, Borden's essay in this section tries to address the issue of finding the big idea within a narrative. Then Terry Mattingly has an essay on 'exegeting the culture,' dealing with the issue of the audience, being composed of cultures and subcultures, to be pertinent, relevant, and clear in communication. Bruce Shelley then has the final essay in this section to relate the biblical theology's grand theme to the big idea: Christ. This leads into &quot;What shall we do?&quot;The final section starts with an essay by Sunukjian on developing a flow in a sermon, applying Robinson's methods (inductive and deductive preaching, applying, proving, or explaining propositions, etc.) Joseph M. Stowell III has an essay on &quot;Preaching for a Change,&quot; where the preacher must have his life and doctrine the same, that teaching (patient instruction) must come with preaching, and that application must be grounded in the text. He is concerned with the process (of sanctification) rather than the product (perfect holiness) in the lives of individuals, transforming them through preaching in and about many contexts (regarding individuals, small groups, local contexts of regions, all humanity, etc.) John Reed writes an essay on finding the right questions to ask in the sermon as well as finding good illustrations. Gibson wraps up the text restating the major points, and shows how flexible (adaptible) this method is."},{"Title":"The Big Idea of Biblical Preaching: Connecting the Bible to People","review":"Talking about preaching with a friend a few years ago he kept on saying, Haddon Robinson, make sure you read Haddon Robinson. The book 'Biblical Preaching' arrived, and every word was worth reading. In this collection of essays in his honour there are is some good material: not every word is worth reading. There are two essays though that caught me and I wanted to read carefully. One was by Terry Mattingly on understanding our advertising film saturated culture. His thesis about the need to read the signals coming out from the TV and cinema and then deal with them in preaching was worth a whole book. He started off with what happened when he mentioned the film Thelma and Louise in a seminary class - a lot of fun. The other great essay was by Paul Borden on how to get the main exegetical idea from the stories of the Bible and then how to turn this into a sermon. He goes into lots of useful details about the process, which could be used in a class. Pity there wasn't space for him to give a concrete example. I liked Bruce Waltke's analysis of Proverbs showing how there is a central idea and effectively reminding us all not to get too bogged down in source and form criticism. And the other essays, they're fine....but not much new."},{"Title":"The Big Idea of Biblical Preaching: Connecting the Bible to People","review":"The content of this read was impactful for me at this stage of my ministry in that I have had a number of years to reflect upon as a practitioner in the pulpit. Much, if not most of this time has been a learning experience of understanding what NOT to do. Although exposed to the concept of \\"Big Idea\\" preaching in my seminary training, it was delivered along with mixed messages about giving equal priority to exegesis from the language department. For this reason, from an educational standpoint, the theme was neutralized in my actual ministry (preaching) experience. More than ever, having experienced the challenge of communicating from the pulpit, the concept of Big Idea communication is of greater interest. Oftentimes, or at least in my case, the seminary experience produces students who are carefully trained to plunge into the cryptic or hidden truths in the passage through in depth language study and analysis. Unfortunately, these habitual practices work in the opposite direction in that the Big Picture is abandoned for the microscopic. The expositor quickly becomes lost in the forest for all the many trees that he has discovered along the way. This is not to say that the necessary exegetical spade-work should be abandoned. However, it is important to carefully determine what is considered necessary to communicating the text effectively, in confidence. I believe this to be the central message of this text - what is the primary truth or principal to be gained by the listener.Overall, Stowell's piece had the greatest impact in my overall estimation in his insistence that we \\"preach for change\\" in the life of the listener. He takes the profession of preacher from merely an entertainer to a physician of the soul who sees his task as life-change and eternal impact. The idea of restating the central theme to a contemporary context and then the careful alignment of this with specific needs of the audience seems rudimentary, but frequently overlooked. It is my belief that culture is becoming increasingly less attentive which will call for greater strides in this area of constructing a clear message that simulates a precise rifle-shot, rather than a random spray of shotgun pellets. The life-long learning process continues for many of us as we seek to become more effective in this manner."},{"Title":"The Big Idea of Biblical Preaching: Connecting the Bible to People","review":"This is a collection of around 10 articles all on the subject of preaching. Though it won 1999 Book of the Year from Preaching Magazine, I'm not sure what the fuss is about. Some of the articles are indeed interesting, such as the one about researching one's own culture in addition to the biblical culture. We will be unable to connect our listeners to the text if we are not knowledgeable about the situation and culture of our listeners.This book is a tribute to Haddon Robinson, and the contributers don't let you forget that. Many of them re-explain &quot;Big Idea&quot; preaching, so that you end up reading the same thing several times.Anyway, there are some good points. The main gist of the book is that Big Idea preaching is a philosophy which can be applied to almost any biblical passage and any preaching method."},{"Title":"Introvert to EXTROVERT","review":"Give me a break!

The author (and his editor) obviously do not understand what an introvert or an extrovert is."},{"Title":"Introvert to EXTROVERT","review":"With a title like this, yes, I would want to read it.

He wrote many works (e.g.,The Great Awakening (The Works of Jonathan Edwards Series, Volume 4),Apocalyptic Writings (The Works of Jonathan Edwards Series, Volume 5) (v. 5),The religious affections;: Jonathan Edwards works (Puritan devotional library),A Narrative of Surprising Conversions, etc.).This book contains the Treatise on Grace; Observations Concerning the Trinity and the Covenant of Redemption; and An Essay on the Trinity. It begins with a 25-page historical Introduction.In the \\"Grace\\" treatise, Edwards makes the observation that although we often read in the Bible of the Father Loving the Son, and the Son loving the Father, we never once read either of the Father or the Son loving the Holy Spirit, or the Spirit loving either of them. He explains, \\"It is because the Holy Spirit is the Divine love itself, the love of the Father and the Son.\\" (Pg. 63)In the \\"Observations\\" essay, he suggests that \\"there is a subordination of the persons of the Trinity, in their actings with respect to the creature\\"; nevertheless, the persons of the Trinity are \\"not inferior one to another in glory and excellence of nature.\\" (Pg. 77)In the \\"Essay,\\" he notes that the Father is the \\"fountion of the Godhead,\\" which \\"has led some to think that He only was truly and properly God\\"; but he attributes this to their individual \\"oeconomical office,\\" which allows the Holy Spirit to \\"proceed\\" from the Father and the Son, \\"and yet that all the persons should be coeternal.\\" (Pg. 122)This is an interesting brief collection of some of Edwards' lesser-known writings."},{"Title":"True Heroism in a World of Celebrity Counterfeits","review":"&quot;True Heroism&quot; is a fascinating book that explores the seemingly contradictory virtues of heroism and humility.

It is built around several news articles that can be accessed for free by simply typing the phrase &quot;Dirty Bomb&quot; into Google. Penguin has some nerve charging $12.95 for this."},{"Title":"Dirty Bomb: Weapons of Mass Disruption","review":"This book is so indescribably awful that it is actually funny, in the same painful way that watching \\"the office\\" is funny. It was written by someone who blends no knowledge of his subject, with a non-existent grasp of english grammar:- A lethal cocktail indeed. He also did not bother to engage the services of an editor, which presumably kept costs down, but which lead to some pretty troubling typographical side-effects. There is, I grant, an \\"editor's note\\" - which for some bizarre reason appears well into the book - but it is so clearly written by the author (no two people could actually write this way) that I would apply a pretty high discount rate to it.The book is a random stream of disorganized and unrelated statements, is vastly repetitive, full of enormous contradictions (it either is, or is not easy to build one of these things - the book forcefully asserts it is both) and is padded out to a commercial length by vast chunks of utterly irrelevant material. It has the EXACT feel of a poor quality, sensationalist, high school term paper.The only redeeming thing about this book is that the author frequently cites experts who actually do understand the subject and can speak in coherent sentences. Their observations are reasonably useful, but as another reviewer notes, all of this could be googled in about 30 seconds.There is only one lesson to be gleaned from this book - the right timing of the right title can be very lucrative. Shame on the publishers for this disgrace. Perverse credit to Mr King for making a lot of money out of 20 minutes of internet research."},{"Title":"Dirty Bomb: Weapons of Mass Disruption","review":"This book is a waste of time for the informed reader. The author tries to scare the uneducated. The facts are qualitative and have no valid references.

One that warrants a poor grade.Third, as a scholar in the subject matter, the book contains many ideas and concepts that aren't fully investigated or researched. I am truly suprised that this book was even allowed to be published. All ideas and thoughts were committed to print with no investigation as to the sources. I would have definitely done more research if I were going to quote internet web sites.If you are someone interested in learning more about the subject, I would recommend other books on the subject. Hopefully one that has been researched better.I read this book just to see what type of information is being portrayed to the average citizen and ended up very dissappointed about the content.

For someone recently interested in the wars in the FRY region, Sudetic's book is a fantastic introduction that provides much more than a basic understanding.

The photos and maps are very helpful in following the events from this complex region - and this book is the best I have read on the subject."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"The book is confusing because the wars were confusing. The names present difficulties in the manner of a Russian novel. There is a chart of the main characters. It is extensive. By 1993 the author was in his fifth year in Bosnia reporting on the conflict for THE NEW YORK TIMES. Traveling through Bosnia's mountains as a student had been an adventure. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims were uprooted in Bosnia by Serb forces. In 1995 the author learned through television reports of Serbian army attacks on Srebrenica. He decided to seek a month's leave to return to Bosnia to see family members, the Celiks.Huso Celik had raised his family in eastern Bosnia. Latin had been the language of the Drina valley at the time of the Roman Empire. Later the Roman roads fell into disrepair and the Slavic language replaced the Latin. Ottoman Turks invaded in the fourteenth century. The Serbs threw off Ottoman domination in 1804. By 1875 the Ottoman Empire was bankrupt. Hasan Celik, born 1908, never learned to read. Huso Celik was born in 1941. During World War II there were two resistance groups in Yugoslavia, one headed by Tito. In the fall of 1947 Serb teachers taught the peasants on Mt. Zvijezda, the ancestral home of the Celiks. Half the people killed in Yugoslavia in World War II had been killed by each other. This was passed over in the Titoist revisionist history of the war. Social prosperity was introduced. A restored minaret was opened in 1959. In Tito's army national service duty took place outside of a soldier's home area. Huso went to central Serbia and served with Croats, Muslims, Slovenians, ethnic Albanians. Subsistence farmers of Mt. Zvijezda became wage earners. Serbs went to Belgrade, Muslims to Sarajevo. Huso worked for a construction company. In his spare time he played his clarinet. In 1974 Yugoslavia recognized Slavic Muslims as a constitutional nation. By the late 1980's the young men had left the mountain to find jobs. Having televisions, the people watched the Cold War ending. That Yugoslavia was coming apart had been in evidence for years. Workers pilfered, Serbs were hot-tempered, Slovenians demanded free elections. Economic breakdown, (there was massive embezzlement), became clear to everyone.Milosevic rose in the Communist bureaucracy and took control. The Croats, Albanians, Slovenes, Muslims saw the emerging Serb hegemony. Nationalist euphoria swept over Serbia. The author and his wife Ljiljuana moved to Yugoslavia to report for THE NEW YORK TIMES. Belgrade was dusty. Ljiljana's sister Gordana Celik and her husband Hamed Celik, (Huso's son), lived nearby. Slovenia and Croatia elected non-Communist governments. Milosevic sought to expand Serbia. There were Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia. Tudjman in Croatia antagonized the Serb minority. Nationalism spread to Bosnia. It was forty percent Muslim. Karadzic headed the Serbian party in Bosnia. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. In 1991 Milosevic overran Vukovar.A month before the Bosnian War began in 1992 the author and Hamed saw Huso. A month later Huso had a second heart attack and there was talk of war everywhere. After the Vance-Owen Plan was conceived, the Commander of the UN in Bosnia was General Philippe Morillon. He was no match for General Ratko Mladic, Commander of the Bosnia-Serb Army.Celik family members are pictured in July 1995 at a tent city at the Tuzla Airport following the fall of Srebrenica. Hiba Celik is shown near the ruins of her house in 1997. By 1993 Srebrenica had become a diplomatic nightmare to officials working on the Bosnian problem. Srebrenica was swelled with refugees in addition to inhabitants and everyone depended upon humanitarian aid. It was both a Muslim enclave and a UN safe area when Mladic sought to close down entry points and choke-off supplies. NATO bombs fell, Serb forces shelled safe areas. There was hostage-taking. After the fall of Srebrenica Muslim men were called out and transported out of the area. Some were killed, and others were held, it was said, for the purposes of a prisoner exchange. Action from Croatia caused some abatement of Serbian aggressive action. Some of the Celik family members were able to move to Canada and begin a new life.The author has engaged in a tremendous undertaking to trace the fortunes of war through the experiences of family members. He certainly makes the reader feel the pain of the conflict."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Other reviewers' claim that Sudetic is \\"anti-Serb\\" simply isn't fair--the guy's married to a Serb, for cryin' out loud. If his account of the war in Bosnia seems to be biased against the Serbs, it's perhaps mainly due to the following reasons: the people responsible for starting the war, Milosevic and his henchmen, were Serb; the Yugoslav army, who had all the big guns, was dominated by Serbs and did Milosevic's bidding; Serb soldiers summarily executed thousands of innnocent, unarmed Muslim civilians near Srbrenica near the end of the war, the largest massacre in Europe since World War II.Sudetic does not make light of atrocities committed by Muslims and Croats, but that Srbrenica massacre looms large. The book follows a Muslim famliy from their homestead to the killing fields, so the Muslims tend to exude the most pathos, but this family's lives are intertwined with those of their Serb neighbors, and both sides are given adequate coverage as Sudetic chronicles life in the peasant Bosnia ultimately destroyed by the war. Sudetic is careful to point out that Serbs suffered, too, and that many of them didn't want war any more than the Muslims, remained loyal to the Bosnian government, and risked their lives to save their Muslim friends and neighbors.In all fairness, it's worth mentioning that Serbs were manipulated by the anti-Muslim propaganda monopolizing the media in the former Yugoslavia, whereas the Muslims had nothing comparable to cloud their judgment. It's also worth mentioning, by the way, that a good part, if not the majority, of Serb forces came from Serbia, not from within Bosnia.All in all, Sudetic paints a portrait of mutlicultural country whose people were living together more or less peacefully until their dormant ethnic hostilities were awakened and manipulated in a war of aggression (NOT a civil war) brought on by a few people with a thirst for power and a score to settle--that's where the title comes from: Serb tradition demanded blood vengeance for past crimes against them. It's hard for Westerners to go along with that, as we consider magnanimity the noble thing, so again there's a tendency for the Serbs and their culture to appear unsympathetic at times, but it's not a question of bias, it's just the way it is.The impression you will get from this book is what is likely the most accurate one concerning the war in Bosnia, that the war was not the mandate of the people, Serb, Muslim, or Croat, and the revulsion you feel towards people like Milosevic, Bosnian Serb Army general Ratko Mladic, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic cannot be extended towards Serbs in general. Besides, it's the United Nations and Western diplomats that take the worst beating in this book.Anyway, Blood & Vengeance is the best account of the war in Bosnia I've read (quite a few), in addition to being the most moving book I've read in some time. If you come down in the end on the side of the Muslims, it's not because Sudetic hasn't played fair--this is probably the most honest account of the war you will read, from someone who has no reason to be partisan when his wife is Serb and he's related to Muslims through marriage to her. He's simply telling it like it is (was). Keep in mind that the focus of this book is eastern Bosnia. The other theatres of war receive little attention, as they shouldn't as this is not a history book. I also recommend Malcolm's brilliant Bosnia: A Short History for more background information, and Maass' Love They Neighbor for a less in-depth but equally moving account of the war from the perspective of another American journalist."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"A very personalized account of the many forces that were in motion. Masterful storytelling, making the transitions for the major national participants to one peasant family's struggles is technically very difficult, the fact that the author was able to do so shows his skill as a writer."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"If you a fact based assessment of what happened to a family living in hell this is a great book. If you want the overall picture of the Bosnian war then look elsewhere.The author is anti-Serb. The Serbs were excrutiatingly brutal during the war, however all the other sides are not without blame. I witnessed such by the Serbs, but also by the Croats and BiH armies. The Serbs are not the only source of blame albeit a large one.As one who witnessed atrocities and was told to do nothing about said atrocities by some do-gooder in the NY (UN) wearing a suit these both, shocked and deadened your senses'.Had the author merely indicated that this is a snapshot of a families life and not an overall indication of WHY the war happened I would have given it 5 stars.It IS a great book but bear-in-mind the slant against Serbs."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"The village of Kupusovici high in the mountains above the Drina River Valley in Eastern Bosnia today is a ruin. Two dozen bombed-out stone habitations are scattered around a tumble-down weed-filled mosque. A sturdy car can reach the place, but the dirt road is so eroded and rocky that it's best to hike in. Ancient paths, tilting headstones, and a still-functioning spring-fed washbasin are evidence that there once was a bustling little civilization here. Now, the only movement is the wind against the sheer stone face of the mountain behind.When the Serb army poured South up the Drina Valley in the early weeks of the war in 1992, they quickly took Visegrad, the nearest city to Kupusovici, drove out 10,000 Muslims, and slaughtered another 2000, many of them by shooting or throat-slitting on Ivo Andric's famous bridge. So many bodies were dumped into the Drina that it was said no one would fish in it for three years. In their ethnic-cleansing ardor, the Serb forces took the trouble to find their way to even the remotest villages in the mountains. Kupusovici was one of those.Kupusovici is also the jumping-off place for Chuck Sudetic's brilliant, tragic tale. He was related by marriage to a Muslim family that had long lived there, Huso and Hiba Celik and their four children. During the Serbs'1992 sweep, the Celiks were fortunate to escape over the mountains to the North, and to find a habitable abandoned house in the \\"safe\\" town of Srebrenica. This book is the story of their ordeal.Sudetic also fills in the background history of the region, the country, and the war. There are other books more comprehensive and more scholarly, but none more illuminating about what this war was, and meant. It is one of the most vivid books ever written about any war, and hands down the best about this particular one. (Believe me. I've read just about all of them.)As one example of Sudetic's inspired style, he recounts Bosnian Serb General Mladic's final assault on Srebrenica in July 1995 by cutting back and forth between the movements of the Serb force as it closes in during the night and the anxious talk and movements of the Celik family, huddled in the dark in their house in the middle of the town. Gripping, chilling, cinematic.Anyone who has found this review was probably led here by an interest in the Bosnian war. I hope others with a wider interest in war and in modern European history will also find it, and read and be enlightened by this classic."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Blood and Vengeance is a moving account of what happened in the Balkans not long ago. In fact, I read this book during a visit to Sarajevo and talked with residents there about their lives and about the war. This is a unique region with its own geography and it just happens to be between East and West, between major religious fault lines and containing microcosms contained by mountainous landscape. The suffering there as a result of this war was beyond my comprehension. Sudetic tells it like it happened."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"We all know that the war is a terrible thing. But for those who have never experienced it like myself it is another story from the news. We watch it, we feel sorry or even horryfied and than we go back to our everyday lives. After reading this book it is hard to just go back to normal life without thinking of all the victims of the war. The book \\"Blood and vengeance\\" takes us right there, in the middle of the war.Into peoples lives, their houses, mothers fears, families tragedies. The book describes real events, real people. Day by day. It is a document but reads like a novel. Worth reading by all means. If you want to understand those who are less fortunate than you and to be aware of what could happen to any of uu - read it."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"An original work on the Bosnian conflict, covering it from both a journalistic perspective and as well from the perspective of a family that endured this terrible war.Sudetic manages to give a strong analysis of the Bosnian conflict, an inside look at the Srebrenica massacre and at the same time, trace the roots and struggles of a Bosnian family who went through the whole ordeal. I had a hard time putting the book down, and eventually myself felt somewhat attatched to the members of the family.Some say Sudetic is biased towards the Serbs, however this seems to be untrue, when looking at the fair analysis he gives on the history of the region and the criticisms he gives on the actions of the Bosnian government as well as the Croats. This is definitely a valuable book."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"The majority of Serbs who claim their massive crimes against humanity in the Balkans over the past 8 years are lies and propaganda, should read this book.

However, this is blatantly anti-Serb. Chuck seems to want to portray the Serbs as bloodthirsty animals and the Muslims as weak innocents. I was rooting for the Serbs by the end of the book because they had so much going against them yet they still pushed on with their goals."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Required reading for my college history class, I haven't put the book down since I started. Good mix of history and a family's story. I don't know if this is my own bias or something I'm picking up from the text, but I seem to be developing an anti-Serb way of thinking and have to keep reminding myself that they suffered too."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"If we were to take off away the virulent bias of this book and just leave the details of the families struggle we might have a wonderful book. The wiritng is superb, the characters are deep and portrayed well, the history however is deeply flawed. The central theme of this book is that Milosevic conspired to steal land and in doing so launched a war that destroyed the Balkans. We are told the Tudjman, Croatias Catholic president was his 'ally'. THis is however not proven by the burden of history. Tudjmans army rampaged through Bosnia and slaughtered and ethnically cleansed serbs as well as muslims.We are told here that the idea that the conflict was base don ehtnicity was a scam, which is interesting considering it was the west, like this author, who created the myth of ethnicity and 'ethnic cleansing' in the Balkans. However it is true the conflict is not based solely on land, but rather the diverse nature of the region, with Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims and in this war it was as common for the catholics to be brutal to the orthodox christians as for eithe rto brutalize the muslims.This book presents a one sided story, a story where Serbs are portrayed not as people but animals and in this books attempt to dehumanize them we see the same ethnic hatred that the book claims doesnt exist. If it was about land then why must this book only tell one side and pretend that half the party to this conflict were wilde beasts and not humans, thinking and breathing like others.As a tale and as a novella this ia masterful account. it is not history and the judgements on the history of the region either lack understanding or are based on myth.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"During the war in Bosnia, I am ashamed to say that I understood very little about what was really going on. The situation seemed so complex that I was put off reading any articles that might then have shed light on my ignorance. Now, with this remarkable book, I have finally come to understand what really happened. Chuck Sudetic skilfully takes you from the birth of Christ, the Romans, the Ottoman invasions and finally to the situation today. He narrates the war period from the point of view of the Celik family. And in so doing he succeeds in breaking your heart as he recounts the human disaster that took place. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Chuck Sudetic has written one of the most important books of the 1990s. I can attest from first-hand knowledge of the Balkans that this work is astonishingly unbiased, even as it is wrenching in its descriptions of the effects of an unwanted war on average men and women. By mid-book, the reader may begin to feel that too much detail has been accumulated on the families the author follows through the Bosnian nightmare--but then, in a matter of pages, the horror begins. First, comes a series of random cruelties, then broader atrocities, until the book climaxes in its unforgettable description of the siege and fall of Srebrenica, one of the worst (and most preventable) tragedies of our time. This is when the richness of the family saga begins to resound--Sudetic recreated a now-lost world then let us witness its destruction. It is a work of great commitment and honesty. This book captures the desperation, ignorance, cowardice, heroism, corruption and indestructible hopes of men and women swept up in a war they never fully comprehended. This, not the diplomatic headlines, is the bitter reality of our times for millions of human beings, from the Balkans to Indonesia. Sudetic is not an elegant stylist, but for the purposes of such a grim narrative, his &quot;Joe Friday,&quot; deadpan prose serves far better than would a more self-consciously literary approach. While other fine books have been written about the self-destruction of Yugoslavia (Tom Gjelten's &quot;Sarajevo Daily&quot; comes to mind), I find &quot;Blood and Vengeance&quot; an indispensible work. By telling the intertwined stories of Muslim and Serb Orthodox families on one mountainside, Sudetic encapsulates the broad tragedy of a region. I cannot recommend this book too strongly, and feel it would better serve as a text for today's university students than a library full of theoretical works on international relations. Chuck Sudetic has captured the harshness of our world, as well as the ineradicable human will to survive, in a book that deserves far greater recognition than it has received. Please read this book--and give it as a gift to those around you who merit a richer understanding of the post-Cold War world. I only wish I could place a copy directly into the hands of each person reading this review."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"After reading tremendous books like David Rohde's &quot;End Game,&quot; Holbrooke's &quot;To End a War,&quot; Kaplan's &quot;Balkan Ghosts,&quot; Rebecca West's &quot;Black Lamb, Grey Falcon,&quot; Michael Sells' &quot;A Bridge Betrayed,&quot; and a host of others, this one stands out as the very best yet written on Bosnia. Sudetic successfully weaves the macro policy issues with an in-the-trenches view of one family's experience in Srebrenica. The end product is a devastating indictment of the international community for allowing atrocities like this to occur again, after similar incidents occuring in WWII Germany, Post Vietnam Cambodia, Guatemala and Rwanda. After seeing the aftermath of Srebrenica's downfall in person and knowing many of the people involved, I can say that Sudetic has unquestionably written the definitive account of this tragic chapter in Bosnia's history."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"This great book exposes truths that the world needs to hear, and acknowledge. First, the convenient fallacy that all sides in the Bosnian war were equally guilty of the evils perpetrated there. They weren't. Sudetic also dispenses with the international community's implication that the corrosive violence of 1992 - 1995 was inevitable. It wasn't, but rather was deliberately manipulated by nationalist Serb leaders. And he damningly shreds the fiction that the U.N. did what it could to prevent the Srebrenica massacre, exposing an unbelievable moral cowardice &amp; incompetence, particularly of Bernard Janvier &amp; Yasushi Akashi. Riveting, searing, ultimately heartbreaking. Read it."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Blood and Vengeance is a gripping account of the date of the unlucky people who were trapped in the Srebrenica &quot;safe&quot; zone. Like no other book, it details the extent of the massacres and the direct participation of ordinary citizens and Serbian higher ups in the massacre of thousands of civilians. A witness even places Gen. Mladic personally supervising executions in a vast killing field that went on for hours. The ineptitude and cowardice of the UN is truly bewildering. The author has trouble getting the story going. The narrative jumps abruptly from the daily life of a Bosnian Muslim family before the war, to the unfolding political events, to Balkan history and even the author's comings and goings. Much attention is paid to minute details, while fundamental areas are glossed over. It is not until the second half, when the featured Muslim Bosnian family is forced into Srebrenica, that everything comes into place. The unfolding international events begin to flow seamlessly into the personal story line, and the book ends up reading like the best (and saddest) of thrillers. Yet the question remains unanswered: How could your neighbor turn into your torturer overnigh"},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Chuck Sudetic has written an excellent book which weaves the experiences of one family in the Serbian conflict with the Muslims Bosnia into the larger political and social context of violence and aggression. The book is a page turner, written in a very engaging journalistic style. The author's criticism of Muslim and Serb atrocities alike appears balanced, and his anger at the failures of politicians and peacekeepers shines clear. The experiences of the Celik family make the massacres and assassinations very real, the reader will be riveted as to the welfare of each family member as they try to escape the violence.The reader will find that the book gives them an excellent overview of the conflict both in the experiences of individuals and in the political and military decision making."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"What struck me at first about this book was the clear and concise history of Yugoslavia Sudetic provides in the opening chapter. He draws together the salient points of hundreds of years of Balkan history to set the stage for the recent troubles.Following the Celik family as they are displaced by the war and eventually holed up in the ill-fated town of Srebrenica is moving. The larger picture of how the war progressed and the atrocities committed, by both sides, is infuriating, as is the military inaction of the western governments and the UN. (In fairness, western military action may have only added fuel to the fire - I recommend Rohde's End Game to see the perspective of the troops on the ground and the difficulties they were faced with.)In all, this book leaves a very real feeling of loss with you, and you will probably come away feeling like people in the Balkans do today: sad at their loss, hungry for revenge, hopeful for a better future."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"This book enabled me to understand the Bosnian war from an individual angle. For someone recently interested in the wars in the FRY region, Sudetic's book is a fantastic introduction that provides much more than a basic understanding. It is a personal story interwined with the techinical workings of the war, the politics of the Serbian government and the reactions of the international community. It was a great read. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"If you read only one book about Bosnia, about war, or about one writer trying to commemorate the countless victims of senseless slaughter, BLOOD AND VENGEANCE should be the book. This is the best, most devastating book I've read in years; something every American who cares about what's happening in the world must read--now."},{"Title":"Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia","review":"Widely acknowledged as one of the best books on the war in Bosnia, Sudetic's book offers a unique insight into the horrors of the Bosnian war. What is it then that separates Sudetic's book from the other books on the war in Bosnia? First, it is extraordinarily well written and highly interesting from the very beginning to the end. It captured my attention from the very moment I started reading it. Even though this book contains almost 400 pages it never becomes boring.The first section of the book contains a brief yet momentous introduction of the history of Bosnia. It helps explain the root causes of the war in Bosnia, an aspect that will prove invaluable to novice readers on the subject matter. Sudetic then allows the reader to follow one Bosnian family (the Celik family) throughout the entire Bosnian war. As a reader, one inadvertently becomes part of the Celik family; one empathizes with them and shares their deepest emotions and concerns. When the war in Bosnia began, the Celik family fled from their village of Kusupovici to Srebrenica. Srebrenica was by then already under siege and about 40,000 people from the neighbouring villages sought shelter in this little eastern town. Srebrenica was constantly shelled by Bosnian Serb army and only a few U.N. convoys were allowed to enter Srebrenica in order to deliver food and medical supplies to its approximately 40,000 refugees. For three long years Srebrenica's people were isolated from the rest of the world, they had little food, no clean water, electricity and virtually no medical supplies. Diseases and infections were commonplace. People were dying from hunger daily.Sudetic brilliantly describes the experiences of the Celik's family throughout the war. Will all members of the Celik family manage to survive the war and how will this gruesome war affect their future? What will happen to Paja, Huso, Hiba and Sanela? As a reader, one gets to know their deepest fears, concerns and desires. It is virtually impossible to remain indifferent to their plights when reading the book. Sudetic's book thus stands out from the other literature on the war in Bosnia because it is personal. It is not simply another book about Bosnian people in general, not that there is anything wrong with that. However if you follow one particular family for an extensive period of time you become one with them. You experience their suffering as well as their joy.As is well known, Srebrenica fell on July 12, 1995 after three years of Serb occupation. What followed in the ensuing days constituted one of the most severe human rights abuses in Europe since World War II. In only a matter of days, Bosnian Serb forces summarily executed approximately 8000 Muslims, one of whom was my grandfather. I remember that day perfectly well and it was one of the worst days of my life. In my opinion, Sudetic provides one of the most detailed accounts of the Srebrenica massacre. Days leading to the massacre are also described in detail. While 8000 Muslims were being slaughtered before the eyes of the entire international community, the U.N. did nothing to stop the bloodshed despite the fact that Srebrenica had been designated a \\"safe area\\". In point of fact, the U.N. was completely indifferent to the plight of these people. Sudetic explains this well and also provides numerous documents that corroborate this fact. The U.N. was in fact authorized to order air strikes against Bosnian Serb army but deliberately chose not to do that because they did not want to \\"exacerbate\\" the conflict. Instead, they gave Serbs the green light to kill 8000 Muslims and to expel all women and children. The Muslims who were trying to escape from Srebrenica to Tuzla were frequently ambushed by Bosnian Serb army; many of them never made it to Tuzla.Sudetic further provides a comprehensive account of the atrocities that took place in Srebrenica after the town was overrun by Bosnian Serb army. Muslim men were taken to different locations to be shot. Those who survived have been able to testify about these heinous atrocities. Hurem Suljic had been taken to a meadow along with other Muslim men. Bosnian Serb army then opened fire and one man fell on Suljic. Suljic remained there motionless until the executioners left the site. Another man had also survived the massacre and together the two men managed to escape. Hurem Suljic later testified that the Muslim prisoners were tortured; some had their throats slashed while others were hit on their heads by an axe or a hammer.Sudetic's book thus gives us a comprehensive and well researched account of the Bosnian war. I have one problem with this book though and that is a flawed and sometimes biased analysis of Bosnian Muslims. When describing Bosnian Muslims, Sudetic frequently relies on the life of the Muslims who lived in the countryside. Sudetic sometimes wrongly assumes that this way of life is characteristic of the entire Islamic community throughout Bosnia. For example, the Muslims who lived in the countryside frequently dressed in \\"dimije\\" (traditional clothing for Muslim women of the countryside) and they sometimes covered their heads. One gets the impression that Bosnian Muslims are a primitive people. However, for the overwhelming majority of the urban Muslims this way of life was obsolete and atavistic. Most Muslim women who lived in urban societies dressed and behaved as any contemporary woman of the West. Furthermore, according to one of the foremost experts on the history of Bosnia Noel Malcolm, Bosnian Muslims were among the most secularized Muslims in the world. Therefore, one must conclude that Sudetic's description of Bosnian Muslims is misleading and inadequate.Aside from this minor shortcoming, this is irrefutably the best book about the war in Bosnia. It is an extraordinarily well written account of the Srebrenica massacre. There are many brilliant books about the war in Bosnia but Sudetic's book stands out from the rest for the following reason: it involves the reader in the story in a way you never thought possible. It makes you angry, happy, sad, agitated and devoid of hope at the same time.A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Ghost Legion","review":"Dion has ruled for three years since he took back his crown.

I particularly like the photographs of the Grand Duchesses having reached womanhood. This book unlike many others I have encountered provides us the reader with an (dare one say it) almost 'too' intimite insight into the family's day to day lives. One senses the individuals as they actually were....., rather than as court photographs typically portray them. Photographs perhaps more than any other medium serve to remind us that people before us were just as much flesh and blood as we are, 'The family albums' has demonstrated this fact admirably."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra: The Family Albums","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of pictures, nicely organized to bring out different dimensions of the story of Nicholas and Alexandra. However, I found two mistakes early into the book. The first was the the statement that Victoria Melita married Grand Duchess Boris, when in fact she married his brother, Cyril. The second was the statement that the marriage between Victoria Melita and her first Husband, Ernst of Hesse, foundered after the death of their daughter. In fact, the child's death occurred well after the separation of her parents. Given the author's family relationship with his subjects, these lapses are surprising and indicative of extremely careless editing. It causes me to discount the accuracy of the volume, overall."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra: The Family Albums","review":"There are many books of pictures of the Romanov family, but Nicholas and Alexandra: The Family Albums by Prince Michael of Greece is probably the best of the bunch. Since Nicholas became tsar and husband at almost the same time, their family life is very well documented in pictures. There are the usual official photographs taken by professional photographers. But the Romanov's were also big shutterbugs. They all owned cameras and it is in these candid shots that we really get a chance to see life within the palace walls. In addition to formal portraits, we see the Imperial Family at work, at play, on vacation and just relaxing. We also see extended family members (most of them European royalty from England, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and others). Many of these photographs were taken from the albums of individual family members, and were hidden in communist archives. They were only made available after perestroika.This book also gives us a glimpse of the many residences of the Romanov's. While the Alexander Palace was their primary home, they also spent time in the Crimea (Livadia Palace), Spala (their hunting lodge in Poland), Standart and Polar Star (Imperial Yachts), and The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Some of these photographs are of never before seen interior shots.Nicholas and Alexandra are criticized for being ineffective rulers, but in one thing they can't be faulted--they were loving and devoted parents. The closeness of their family life comes through very clearly in The Family Albums. There are also pictures of their captivity, that are extremely haunting. But looking at this book just magnifies the tragedy of their fate. They gave up not just palaces, jewels, clothes and priceless objects, but because of poor leadership, they also cost this beautiful family their lives. That is the most heartbreaking loss of all."},{"Title":"Nicholas and Alexandra: The Family Albums","review":"It's really too bad that this wonderful book is out of print. It's a gold mine!

Mahabharat is a scripture revered by people all over India. It has nothing to do with Hindi/Hindu. It was originally written in Sanskrit and when no Hindi existd. That the serial was made in Hindi was because of commercial reasons than anything else. By this logic I can conclude that a program on Bible will reinforce a Semitic worldview. Will it Flavia???Again Flavia says \\"Dr. Mitra concludes that there exists a hegemonic system informing the centralized production of television programs does exist in India, the author suggests that it is possible to challenge this system through regional and alternative programs.\\" Again, this is the usual nonsense from leftists who are uncomfortable with the popularity of the serial. The author conveniently forgets that same Doordarshan broadcast \\" Bible Stories\\" after Mahabharat. But that was not at all popular like Mahabharat. Leftists cannot digest that (By the way, are you a missionary Flavia? ). And hence, they launch a vilification campaign against innocuous things like a television serial like Mahabharat. The real reason behind this is leftists fear that serials like Mahabharat will expedite the rightist movement and will marginalize the left. Serials like Mahabharat present history form Indian perspective and which is in contradiction with the lies propagated with leftist historians ( or their masters elsewhere???).And finally, the religious strife in India is a result of political skullduggery and has nothing to do with a television serial. It has been there for ages and is because of historical reasons which I would not like to go into here. Get a life Flavia and show some rationality in your arguments."},{"Title":"Television and Popular Culture in India: A Study of the Mahabharat","review":"Ananda Mitra's \\"Television and Popular Culture\\" is a path breaking study, which considers television in India as a distinct cultural form with a specific role in the production of popular culture. Dr. Mitra presents a set of conclusions about the state of television in India and its ability to produce a national image. He discusses the political, social and cultural movements in India with an emphasis on religious fundamentalism and the struggles over issues of language and gender.. The first chapter \\"Introduction and History of Doordarshan\\" talks about the various developments in Indian television and gives an overview of the different time periods in the history of Doordarshan.. The second chapter \\"Reformulating Culture in the Indian Context\\" examines the position of Doordarshan in the cultural map of India. Mitra here examines the relations between television and the nation, television and religion, and the role of television in relation to gender and language. He reconsiders the notion of culture as a combination of a variety of practice that are often in conflicting relationships, pulled together by ideology and circulated by a hegemonic leadership. Ideas of Gramsci and Althusser are also incorporated in this chapter with respect to ideology. Chapter three \\"Doordarshan: A Critical Glance\\" examines television formation as an independent cultural element. Mitra considers the variety of texts like Mahabharat and Ramayan in depth to obtain some conclusions about the position of Doordarshan in Indian culture. Chapter four \\"Mahabharat on Doordarshan\\" examines the position of the religious soap opera and its relationship to Doordarshan in variety of cultural practices. This textual analysis makes it clear that programs such as Mahabharat reinforce a specifically Hindu-Hindi/North Indian image of India, thus marginalizing other regional, linguistic, and religious groups. He specifically examines the role television plays in shaping as well as reflecting Indian popular culture. Defining culture as a set of everyday practices that reflect the lived experiences of various groups of people, Mitra explores and interprets the way in which it is presented in the extremely successful serial Mahabharat. Chapter five \\"Beyond Mahabharat\\" examines the way in which the struggles represented in the serial are connected with the ongoing tensions in India. Dr. Mitra argues here that Doordarshan is redefining what is currently considered the preferred combination of social, religious and cultural elements. He says that Mahabharat is redefining the image of a secular India to a Hindu Fanatic India. Chapter six \\"Television and the Nation: Doordarshan's India\\" examines the same concern as in chapter five of India's representation through Mahabharat. This qualitative look at the serial concentrating on its signifying practices and narrative strategies leads to a discussion of the ideological effectively of Doordarshan. Mitra says, \\"Doordarshan selects a small set of interconnected elements for representation on television and this in turn, produces a national image of India on Doordarshan\\". Chapter seven \\"Doordarshan: Its Internal Contradictions and Positions in Everyday Life\\" comments on the Mahabharat serial and its increasing popular culture, where the dominant articulations are between Hinduism, Hindi, Northern India and a male patriarchy. He also considers the position of television within the everyday material practices of the people who watch it. Dr. Mitra concludes that there exists a hegemonic system informing the centralized production of television programs does exist in India, the author suggests that it is possible to challenge this system through regional and alternative programs. Finally, a broader perspective of India's current political, social, and cultural movements is suggested to rethink the phenomenon of television in India. \\"Television and Popular Culture\\" by Ananda Mitra analysis the extremely popular serial Mahabharat in the 90s and describes a set of relations drawn between the narratives, its representation on Doordarshan and its relationship with the popular culture of India. There are hardly any books of local origin that are based on a cultural studies approach. \`Television and Popular Culture in India' attempts to redress this imbalance and is arguably the first exploration of its kind in the Indian context. This book is based on the cultural studies approach combined with its policy implications for the future role of television in India. The understanding of popular culture in India will be an invaluable resource both to students interested in the methodology of cultural studies as well as those who are on the look out for a critical introduction to television in India. It should stimulate an interest in an exploration of the underlying connections between popular culture and the complex, multivariate terrain of cultural politics in India.Althusser referred to ideology as a false consciousness. He explained how myth is naturalized, contrived and constructed to blindfold people. Mitra in his book tries to expose this ideology by a textual analysis of the serial Mahabharat. One important aspect that puzzled researchers was why the serial was so popular.. If we examine Mahabharat in the light of study done by Rossen, we come to the conclusion that Mahabharat has impacted the general public by its conservative dogma. . But in context to the religious soap opera, Mitra shows us how such serials try to portray a Hindu reality depicting the \\"Hindu Sensibility\\" and didacticism.What Mitra questions in this book is very true as in reality these religious soap operas project a Hindu macho image and fanaticism which has swept across the country, bringing in its wake miserable violence and threatening the very integrity of India as a secular and united nation. We have witnessed this in the 1993 bomb blasts on the Ayodhya issue.While reading this book one realises that Doordarshan is not free of internal contradictions. The struggles over language, region, religion and gender are textually reproduced in the diversity of texts that are available on Doordarshan now. A textual analysis such as this takes a step towards rethinking the issues that are often considered as normal and natural, pointing out that there are indeed contradictions that exist."},{"Title":"Stage Managing and Theatre Etiquette: A Basic Guide","review":"Great guide for beginners-enjoyable, quick read.

You will be taken on a tour of the wine producing areas of the world, portraying the author's love of the drink. Each story is highlighted with artwork as further interpretation. I especially enjoyed the account of a bottle of wine's ability to transform a mountain of greasy fish, chips and extra peas at a local chip shop to a culinary masterpiece. The writing is honest, expressive, humorous and straight-forward. Those who appreciate a witty turn of phrase will be delighted. Those too drunk on wine to notice will wonder why they feel suddenly lighter.The artwork is quintessentially Steadman. If you are not familiar with his work, you need to be sure to approach this book with an open mind - as it is not for the faint of heart. Figures can be what some would describe as ugly - maybe even grotesque, there are great splatterings of ink and often quite a bit of mayhem.

Focusing on small but premium producers (hence the title) from around the world, Ralph intersperses his personal editorial on the state of today's wine world along with descriptions and renderings of what he's seen.A great read for wine lovers, and well worthwhile for anyone who enjoys the intersection of memorable art and great writing."},{"Title":"Untrodden Grapes","review":"This was almost too good to be true -- a new book and FAR less than what I would have paid in a book store."},{"Title":"The Riddle of Joy","review":"A nice collection of 17 essays by lovers of Lewis and G.K.C.

Her father is furious and does not want her to go, preferring she stay with him and help run the family restaurant that she'll own some day.Joanna Baird is supposed to get married when her fianc&eacute; has to go to Nam. She continues to plan the wedding, and they expect to be married when her returns from the war. When he comes home with a pregnant Vietnamese bride, Joanna is heartbroken and six months later joins the convent, believing she has a calling to the vocation.Both girls find contentment and even happiness behind the walls of the convent. Angelina is a high school teacher and Joanna a nurse at the local hospital. Then Joanna falls in love with a doctor at the hospital, a Vietnam vet. Angelina grows very attached to a young girl she teaches, but then that girl dies from complications due to an illegal back alley abortion. Now both women are Changing Habits and must resolve their respective crises of faith outside of the religious order.Wow, even in abridged format that completely erases the story of a third young woman at the convent, Changing Habits is a very powerful story. These young women join the church at a very tumultuous time for the Catholic Church and for the country. While the focus is on the girls' lives as nuns, we get quite a glimpse at current events happening all around them, from the scandals of the Nixon presidency to church politics.I was pulled right into the story, engrossed in the lives of these young women. Macomber is brilliant when it comes to portraying the hearts of her characters, which in turn makes the readers emotionally invested in the story. I cried with Angelina as she lost a student so very dear to her and I felt empathy for Joanna as she struggles to resist passions denied to nuns.I'm very disappointed Kathleen's story was completely eliminated in the abridged book though. From the book descriptions I found, hers sounds like it was quite a story. But due to the nature of her story, I wonder if it was eliminated due to this book being published right around the time so much scandal in the Catholic Church was being uncovered.I also was thrown a little at the end of the story when the women reunite after many years apart and they suddenly appear to be best friends. Since the bulk of the story was divided out as each nun's story was told, we never saw the development of the bond these women appear to share at the conclusion of the novel. Whether this was because the book was abridged for audio or because it was never really portrayed in the novel I am unable to save.What I do know however is I am so very glad I recently \\"discovered\\" Debbie Macomber. With the sheer numbers of books she has written over the years, I'm amazed I never tried anything by her until recently. She has fast become a beloved author of mine however and Changing Habits is a perfect example of why I love her writing.Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2008.

Though they enter the same order, each is a very different person.Kathleen has always felt called to the convent, Angie enters despite her father's opposition, and Joanna goes in to help heal a heart broken by betrayal. As the years pass, each one is called upon to make sacrifices, to face humility, and to use her gifts to the maximum. Through the changes wrought by Vatican II, Vietnam, and life's own quirks, the girls are brought to the point where they must choose whether or not to remain as they are or to rejoin the world outside the convent doors...This timely, serious novel will face critsism as anti-religious by some, yet the opposite is true. It shows how you can serve God, even if it's not always the way you think you are meant to at first. Love and duty can sometimes be at war.

But each was devoted to her faith, and despite the strict, complex rules of the convent and the swirling controversies of the outside world, each stayed true to her call.But one by one, each woman suffers an unexpected crisis of faith. And ultimately, all three leave the sisterhood for the exciting, confusing world outside the convent walls. It's not an easy choice, and it's not an easy change.I found this book fascinating - I had no idea what a nun's life was like, and I felt that Macomber did a good job of exploring and explaining the maze of regulations that rule a so-called simple life. She touches on controversies within the church in dramatic, poignant ways, weaving storytelling in with historical facts.I do wish the women's lives had been more entwined - while they're all nuns and they all know each other, they don't interact that much, and I found myself wishing for that deeper friendship that's often woven through Macomber's novels. Also, since the book covers such a large span of time - starting in the late 50s and ending in the new millennium - there are large chunks of time that are glossed over.

None of the three was fey or silly about her decision; each prayed long and hard and believed she was making the right choice.

Unfortunately, the characters are quite one-dimensional, and the situations not treated with any depth. The general effect is of a poor play.The attraction to convent life is peripheral in all of the subjects, and they do not ultimately confront true convictions or their own motives. The odd effect is of women in young adulthood (all leave the convent while still in their twenties) who are shaken by confronting troubling situations, common in some form to any adult life, and who find some vague solution merely by departing from convent life. The two who marry seem childish and impulsive in the choice (one drawn by a handsome face and the idea that she's got the man to return to church, the other suddenly contemplating marriage to her spiritual advisor, who cannot deal with having a homosexual priest in his parish) - though, at the end, there is a sense of 'happily ever after, one as Catholic, the other renegade.'Though Macomber writes of an era when convent life was in tumult, neither the overall situation nor a directly related conflict in the lives of the Sisters is treated. The Sister who is unjustly accused of 'doctoring the books' for her own advantage, and the other who blames herself for a student's having a back alley abortion, seem to be running from their first look at tragic but common parts of life. The reader seems to be told that the Sisters are departing from an unfair Church, yet incidents such as these are never developed as quite common paths to mature knowledge of oneself.The 'fudged' ending has no resolution or purpose. We learn that they have no regret for having been nuns, yet still cannot see what drew them to the life or how leaving was the answer to their problems.The deficiencies in plot, theme (if indeed there is one), and characterisation are all the more unfortunate because a premise such as this could have been fascinating. The potential for reflecting history, exploring spiritual and psychological aspects, and treating of the complexity of human nature was ignored. We are left with one-dimensional characters who cannot even consider the larger picture of their own community."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the early sixties, three young girls make a decision that will affect the rest of their lives. For one girl, it would divide her family; for another, it would devastate her father; for the other, it would be the family's shining moment. Each girl has her own reasons for making the life-changing decision. One seeks to heal a broken heart, one feels a calling from God, and one just did what she knows her family wants her to do. The girls leave behind their families and all their worldly possession, and join into a new family and a new way of life when they enter a convent to become nuns.In her new book, \\"Changing Habits,\\" best-selling author Debbie Macomber explores a world that fascinates many but has remained a mystery for ages; the world of the sisterhood of nuns.Three young women join the sisterhood of St. Bridget's Sisters of the Assumption. Angelina had gone to Catholic schools all her life and had a special affinity for the nuns who taught her. She felt she had a calling from God, and despite her father's objections, entered the convent determined to return the gift of learning by becoming a parochial teacher. Kathleen had known she would become a nun since she was six years old because it was what her family expected of her. Joanne entered the convent broken-hearted and searching for peace after her fianc&eacute; returned from Vietnam married to another woman.Each woman goes through the process from postulate to novice to sister, and each finds her vocation within the sisterhood. Angelina and Kathleen become teachers, and Joanne becomes a nurse. Although secluded from most of the \\"real\\" world in their early years, as they mature and become more involved in their community each sister finds that events of the world soon affect their own lives, and eventually causes each to reconsider their place among the religious order.Angelina loves her position as a teacher, but when she feels that she has failed a young pregnant teenager she finds herself longing to return home to help her father in the family restaurant. Kathleen helps out the young and handsome parish priest with problems with an older priest, but when evidence turns up that she helped the priest cover up money problems she is forced to leave the sisterhood amidst betrayal and shame. Joanne finds that she is drawn to the Vietnam Veteran doctor she assists at the hospital, and leaves to become a devoted wife and helpmate to the man she loves.The stories of their individual journeys back to the world are complex and enriching. Although they are no longer called \\"Sister,\\" Angelina, Joanne, and Kathleen find that they are influenced throughout their lives by their time spent as nuns.Normally considered a romance writer, author Debbie Macomber has entered the world of mainstream women's fiction with great success. In this novel, Macomber was inspired to write this intriguing story by a cousin who had been a nun, and had also left her order to pursue life in the \\"real\\" world. Her depictions of women who lived the cloistered life and who returned to live full and satisfying lives as wives, mothers, and successful business women is realistic, warm and enlightening."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"After working in a bookstore for a few years, I am ashamed to admit that I sometimes still judge a book by its cover and, more often, by where it is shelved.Changing habits is written by Debbie Macomber, who is shelved in romance. Yet, somehow, she just doesn't fit there. This book more than any of her others shows that.Changing habits is a group of very well told tales that are also very well blended - a challenge for any author. The stories span time and yet somehow are all contemporary. There is romance, but not in the bodice-ripping or even sassy-female kind of way one comes to expect these days.The stories are about faith and the loss of it, religion and the turning from it, the struggles within the Catholic church, and, at its best, life, and how some very different women live it.I enjoyed this book.

But three young women decide to use their lives to serve God and become nuns.Kathleen O'Shaughnessy, from a large Boston Irish family, has always known she'd become a nun. There was never any question from the time of her first communion on. And a more wonderful and devout nun you'd be hard pressed to find. But when Kathleen's naivet&eacute; allows her to get into a very sticky situation, her fellow nuns have no problem sending her away... .Joanna and Greg became engaged before he left for Vietnam. They had become intimate before - conflicting with Joanna's morals. But she knows they are meant for each other and while he is gone she spends time planning the wedding. But Joanna is in for a shock when he returns, giving her all the impetus she needs to enter the convent. She becomes a caring nurse and in her caring ends up devoting herself to more than just her patients when a troubled young physician forces her to take stock of her life.Angelina joined the convent despite her father's vehement protest. The young Italian girl has been primed to take over her father's restaurant business from an early age. Sister Angelina becomes a schoolteacher, caring deeply for her students. But when she is unable to help one of her favorites, leading to tragedy, Angelina is unable to forgive herself.Debbie Macomber has given readers a glimpse into a world that has many a mystery to many. As a non-Catholic the depth of the isolation forced on the novices, especially in the late sixties, surprised me. But Macomber has chosen to set the bulk of CHANGING HABITS in a time that saw many changes in the Catholic Church and for the nuns in particular.The poignant stories and choices made by these three women make for one of the most compelling books I've read in a very long time. In spite of the subject matter, there is romance as well, but the story really belongs to Kathleen, Joanna, and Angie.This book is very highly recommended not only for its interesting subject matter but also for the compassion with which Macomber tackles controversial issues, as well as her trademark poignancy. It certainly proves why she is one of the most beloved authors writing today."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the 1960s, three young women from diverse lifestyles enter St. Peter's Parrish in Minneapolis with the belief they are destined to become nuns. Angelina Marcello, Kathleen O'Shaunessy, and Joanna Baird had different reasons for becoming \\"Brides of Christ\\", but shared an idealism to serve God and help the community.In 1972 the three nuns struggle with crisis of faith. For Sister Angelina, it was the simple failure of the Church to deal with the problems of a pregnant teen Corrine that sent her back to her father's restaurant. Temporarily taking over the accounting journal led Sister Kathleen to Father Brian Doyle with both wrestling between their vows and a very human love for one another. For Sister Joanna, the return of Viet Nam vet Dr. Tim Murray reminds her that she joined for the wrong reasons as she begins to fall in love with the still recovering medical practitioner. Will the church lose three more dedicated people or will the vows prove strong enough to keep these Sisters within the fold?CHANGING HABITS is not the typical fare from Debbie Macomber, but is an insightful look at some of the problems the modern day Catholic Church is confronting in America. The story line is well written as the trio of nuns seems so genuine and human. The support cast enables the audience to understand their motives from entry into the Church until the individual crisis of faith occurs. Readers will feel strongly what each one of the Sisters contends with as Ms. Macomber powerfully focuses on the critical loss of nuns facing the Church today.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I just finished reading \\"Changing Habits,\\" by Debbie Macomber, who is, to me, a new author. I'd never read her books until recently, when I read two of the books in her Blossom Street series, which, while they aren't deep writing, are feel-good and satisfying. It seemed she gives some of her characters more depth than others. In both of the books I read, there were 2 or 3 characters that I felt I 'knew' and could see in my mind but others that just weren't developed beyond the basics.So I wasn't expecting that \\"Changing Habits\\" would be deep and extremely detailed in the way of character development. It wasn't. BUT, the author does have a gift for developing a good storyline and hooking the reader. This book follows three women in three different states and in different situations, as they each decide they are called to be nuns. I learned so much about nuns that I never knew, and I was raised Catholic during the time in which this book is set.I enjoyed reading this; it was light reading, great stories for each character. I thought the ending was kind of untidy. Some of the dialogue was stilted (particularly between one of the characters, Joanna, and her husband, who have been married 30 years. The conversations between them sound like talk between a couple that's just met! I just didn't find it believable.) and I was left wondering about parts of the story lines.Anyway, if you want a quick, interesting read, give it a try. I loved the author's Blossom Street series and will continue reading Debbie Macomber's books."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I absolutely loved this book and the author's style of writing. It was the first book I read by her but it won't be the last. In my opinion, this author works very hard to make her characters believable and interesting. Great book."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the late 1950s and early 1960s, three young women decide to become nuns. Angelina has a sudden calling while on a school retreat. Kathleen had always planned on being a nun. And Joanna had planned to marry but felt her calling when her fiance came home from Viet Nam with an Asian bride. As noviates and as nuns, the three learn a great deal about themselves and their faith. Yet, even behind their cloister walls, the events of the 1960s and 1970s cannot leave them unaltered. Each suffers a crisis in their faith--for one, the realization that the Church's views on birth control can be destructive; for another, desire for a man; for a third, the sisterhood's unwillingness to stand up and defend her when she needs it most. Somehow, the three women must learn to reenter the common world and make their place in a nation that has been transformed while they had turned inward.Author Debbie Macomber has a knack for developing fascinating characters and seeing them through traumatic life changes. CHANGING HABITS, with its emphasis on the three women and their shared journey to faith and beyond, lets Macomber run with this strength. Each of the three women is interesting and becomes more interesting as they leave their youth behind them and struggles to find their place in faith and back in the profane world. Macomber's deft touch lets her bring in the events of the 1960s and 1970s (the assassinations of Kennedy, King, and Kennedy, Watergate, and especially Viet Nam) and the transformations of the Catholic Church (Vatican II, the debate over birth control, and the Church's self-inflicted wounds as it tried to hide renegade Priests from their punishments) in a way that will resonate with those who remember them, yet without detracting from the fundamental issues of the novel itself (this is alway a challenge in dealing with issues that remain controversial today).CHANGING HABITS is sometimes episodic. Rather than a continuous story line, Macomber gives highlights of the lives these women experience, focussing on the key transitions and decisions that each must make. The language is occasionally simplistic and CHANGING HABITS sometimes reads like it was intended for young adults. The interesting characters and the decisions they face, though, will appeal to all ages. Macomber delivers an enjoyable Woman's Fiction story."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"It is one of the best books I have read of Debbie Macomber's. The three girls and their stories kept me up all night reading."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Debbie Macomber presents an honest look at the lives of three young women who discover that there are many ways to &quot;serve God&quot;. Without resorting to the all too common Church bashing attitude, &quot;Changing Habits&quot; shows the complex interaction of individuals, family and the world in shaping institutions and the people working within them. Although a bit predictable, this book does an excellent job of portraying the evolution of the Catholic Church and the efforts of people to remain faithful to themselves and to the truth in an ever changing world."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"LIKED THIS BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT READ FOR ME,BUT REALLY ENJOYED IT DEBBIE MACOMBER DOSE IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GREAT READ"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I'm not a Macomber fan. I've never liked her shmaltzy style or poorly researched story backgrounds.I want to give credit where it is due when I find the opportunity.Ms. Macomber did a very fine job of exploring the issues which Nuns can confront and which can force them to reevaluate the decision to continue with that life. I felt that she was able to present an unbiased view of the three women in this story revealing the way that each resolved those issues.Good job."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"What a change from the regular stories she writes. This was a great book and I loved it. Wow she is always giving us new themes to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Changing Habits is an extraordinary book. It introduces us to three young women from different backgrounds, Kathleen, Angelina, and Joanna, and their journey through the convent and later life outside the convent. Told through their eyes, each chapter features one of the girls experiences and how it affects their life in the convent and eventually the women they become.When I picked up the book, I didn't know how wrapped up in the story I would get. Each girl had their own story to tell and how their personal struggles affected themselves and their faith. I didn't know much about the Catholic Order, but with reading this book, I got information that was both interesting and not overwhelming. This book touched me in ways that most books can't even begin to match. It's a wonderful book that will make you think differently and look at your life in a whole new light.A must read for anyone looking for a heartwarming and touching book!"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Heard the taped version of CHANGING HABITS by Debbie Macomber . . . it is the story of two women who enter the convent, then both leave it for various reasons . . . their respectivetales were interesting, and I enjoyed reading about both of them--until the ending . . . Macomber seems to have gotten tired of writing at that point in time and fast forwards thingsto a reunion of all the sisterhood members . . . I wanted to know more about what happened to the two women; instead, the last 30 years of their lives were condensed into a few minutes (pages, I imagine, if you're reading) at the end . . . Trini Alvarado--an actress I've admired but who just hasn't been in that many films to suit my taste--did an excellent job of narration."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"What a great beach book! I loved the way the author took 3 young ladies from different areas and time periods and weaved their stories together into a perfect tapestry. What a step back to the 1960s; it evoked many memories. It was fascinating to see how the church changed over the years and the impact it had on the women. From the first page to the last Ms. Macomber has written a compelling novel with no loose ends. Sometimes it seems like authors rush to finish a book, resulting in a weak ending. That is not the case with this one--it's quality through the last tissue in the box! It was my first Macomber book, and it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was very interesting and held my attention to the end. All of Debbie Macomber's books are well written. I like her style of writing."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I agree with the positive things that the other reviewers said about this book. However, this book left me feeling the same way as I did at the end of Cast Away. There just wasn't enough time spent describing how the sisters assimulated into secular life. 30 years were wrapped up in a chapter or two.I gave this book 3 stars because while it was good while it lasted at the end I felt down. I won't keep this one in my library to read over again."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Did I read the same book? I wish I could have those hours back.

It is not just for teens, but for anyone who needs a ray of sunshine in their life. In each of these true stories, we see God intervening in the lives of young people, often through angelic appearances, in such a way that lives are saved, or more importantly, changed. A runaway boy finds his way home, a hapless girl is able to escape an attacker in a way that could only be a miracle. A sister's prayer for her brother gives them extra time together. A girl who should not have even lived regains the use of her legs.***** Real life is filled with the incredible, the miraculous. Many people want to dismiss the coming generations as being godless heathens. As long as there are a few who sparkle as the ones in this book, and as long as there is a God who has such great love for them, though, there is hope and there is joy. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Miracles for Teens: True Stories of God's Presence Today","review":"My granddaughter loves to read,however, she just does not read something she does not like; she puts it down.

AS AN AMAZON MEMBER I HAVE HAD NO RESPONCE TO THE FACT IT NEVER ARRIVED."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"It is hard to overstate the value of this relatively short introduction to Middle Eastern history. Rather than attempting a traditional narrative, Gelvin's history emphasizes ways of conceptualizing Middle Eastern history, allowing readers to see, for example, the Constitutional Revolution in Iran and the the Young Turk Revolution in the Ottoman Empire, as part of the same general process. This makes Gelvin's work unusually valuable for readers with some basic knowledge of the Middle East while helping newbies to understand the basic outlines of Modern Middle Eastern History without getting lost in a sea of names and dates. Gelvin is one of the brightest and most original thinkers in Middle Eastern studies today and, even when one disagrees with him, there is an intellectual verve here that is sure to engage.The weakness to Gelvin's thematic approach is that readers with limited background may sometimes feel the need to remind themselves of basic facts. If the glossary, timeline, and biographical sketches at the end of the book do not suffice for this, William L. Cleveland's A History of the Modern Middle East would make an excellent companion volume."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"This book is great not only for those who are well-versed in the history of the Middle East, but also those who are interested in the subject but lack an extensive knowledge of it (i.e. those who became genuinely curious only after 9/11).This book places events in the history of the modern Middle East in the greater context of world history and world events which were happening at the same time. Looking back at the book, it's now difficult for me to understand why all historians wouldn't do the same thing.And while the author is obviously an expert in the field and has done a great deal of research and analysis, it's also clear from his style of writing that he is a teacher- it's written in such a way as to help the reader understand: organized, very interesting, rational, backed up by facts, humorous at times, etc..., as opposed to many other books on the Mid-East that simply don't flow, and are based more on speculation and bias than they are on fact.Also, it's a pleasure to read- lots of great stories are included- and in fact, if you tend not to be interested in history books, the stories alone (separate from the text of the book and therefore easy to find) make this book worth picking up; the kind of stories that leave you thinking, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\"Finally, I think it's worth mentioning that the chapter on nationalism is absolutely groundbreaking, at the very least (*Note to students of the history of any part of the world: read this chapter. It will forever change the way you study history.)I give this book five stars all the way...highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"I have taken many classes on the Middle East and have had to read many books about it as well. This is the only truly enjoyable history book I have used. Not only is it understandable and easy to read, but the author's side comments and jokes make it really enjoyable. Because of this book, I am finally comprehending much more of the modern period within the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"Gelvin's history of the modern Middle East is a great start for someone who wants to become more acquainted with the region. It gives an adequate amount of background information, comes complete with useful primary documents, and presents good critical analyses of the historical events it discusses. It mostly covers the former lands of the Ottoman Empire and Iran--nothing about the central Asian countries further East like Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, or Pakistan, etc. It's one of those books that you should read cover to cover because its organization does not render it a useful reference book even with the index. It definitely gave me a great grasp of the region broadly, and can help you decide your interests should you want to delve into one subject more in depth. After all, it's a pretty short book that strives to convey a lot of information about a lot of countries over a long period of time (19th and 20th centuries mostly). A good starter book but it may be a little too broad for someone who already is knowledgable about the subject."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"Gelvin writes a concise, clear history of the Muslims world (that is, mostly the middle-east). He writes in an enjoyable fashion - being true to historical objectivity, yet throwing in personal analysis when appropriate. What makes this book even better is that it was written in 2005 and could thus position itself within a post-9/11 world. Overall, Gelvin's history is not only rich, but entertaining to read. Perfect for a student whose brain might be frazzled by semesters of reading."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"I would happily agree with most other reviewers; this is one of the best texts that a reader will find on the modern middle east. That said (and I did not notice this the first time through the book), the author does not deign to address many of the atrocities that have happened in the region. For example, the whole of the Armenian Genocide (the deaths of 1.5 million people) is reduced to 3 sentences in the opening remarks of a section. The Shelling of Hama, the Iran-Iraq war, the invasion of Kuwait, and Sabra and Chatila are also glazed over in roughly as much detail."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"Also it is condensed in its analytical approach, this books remains a major source of reference on the modern aspects of the Middle East; including all the political ramifications and socio-political metamorphoses.

The author adds uncommon facts, which added enjoyment to it's reading. I really enjoyed the book. Do note though, that there is a newer edition of the book.

Gelvin's historical accounts sound like current events in US and the World. Apparently the world's politicians never read this book so we are repeating it."},{"Title":"The Modern Middle East: A History","review":"Studying the Middle East is not always easy. Depending on the book you read, the bias can be very strong. For those that really want to know the truth and see how the Middle East grew and developed historically, one needs a book that can show the good, the bad, and the downright ugly. James L. Gelvin's The Modern Middle East is one book history lovers need to read.This book does not spend an exorbitant time on ancient history, but it does give it over twenty pages of discussion. From there, the book dives into the modern world of the Middle East. When the author states modern, he is not talking just the twenty-first century. He begins his detailed analysis in the 1800s as so many events during that period lay the ground work for the issues and triumphs of this century.The print of this book is very small. Though there are over three hundred pages of reading, the amount of information is much more than a standard book of that size. If you have trouble reading small print, this book could prove to be a problem for you.There are several things that make this book such a great resource aside from the numerous pages of reading. The author has included pictures and maps which helps those that are visual learners. Mr. Gelvin also includes biographical sketches, a timeline, excerpts from various documents, as well as a glossary. The glossary can come in handy when you are not familiar with Middle Eastern terms or titles. The timeline is great for keeping the events in order and as a reference.What are the disadvantages to this book?- Does not cover ancient history, but it is a book on the modern Middle East.- Extremely small print- Read can be a little dry. This is an academic book and not a summer beach reading book.What are the advantages of this book?- Great resource for the study of problems today in the Middle East- Timeline- Glossary- Biographical sketches- Document excerpts- Visual aidsIf you are interested in studying the Middle East, you really need to check out this book.

Australopithicus africanus used tools, which means that he willfully and imaginatively altered his environment, and -- even though he was not a true human -- probably did the one thing that we humans do best when not making decorative cuts in our enemies, which is to make decorative cuts in ourselves. People trim, style and color their hair, tattoo their bodies, daub on paint and enhance or minimize sundry parts for the simple reason that they can. As soon as a new way of altering the body comes along, we greet it with glad cries and rejoicing. It's not a fad, it's the human condition. True blondes -- blondes over the age of six -- are as scarce as hen's teeth. But blonde, as Natalia Ilyin discusses in her witty, poignant book \\"Blonde Like Me,\\" is a state of mind that disregards exterior reality in favor of the inner vision. Beginning with the title, itself a clever play on John Howard Griffin's 1959 \\"Black Like Me,\\" the book explores the social condition of people who, because of their coloration, are treated differently by their fellows. In Ilyin's case, better, and in Griffin's case, worse, but the kicker is that neither is what they seem. Natalia Ilyin, 6'2\\" in her stocking feet, armed cap a pie with blonde hair and high heels has \\"caused minor traffic accidents,\\" as well you might imagine. Blondeness is a metaphor for beauty and allure. Blondeness confers instant sexual power. What do I mean when I say, in cryptic shorthand, \\"Tonight I have a date with a blonde\\"? Natalia knows, and if you read \\"Blonde Like Me,\\" she'll tell you.David Lance Goines"},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"Natalia Ilyin has written a masterful little book, filled with insights on the blond archetype in our culture, brilliant descriptions of blond subtypes (the &quot;Armpiece Blond&quot; and the Martha Stewart segments are hilarious), and warm memoirs of her own blond childhood to adulthood.As a brunette with a California blond daughter, and an East Coast mother who had a blond childhood but elected to grow out of it, I was intrigued to find every blond I've known (practically) described almost flawlessly in this little book. The value we place on golden hair is obvious in this society. But as we become more diverse, and as people with darker hair and skin become more dominant, the value may change. I recently had a compliment from an African-American woman who admired my summer tan. &quot;But you're not dark enough,&quot; she added.It would be interesting to have had a footnote, at least, from the author with some comment about women of color. I wonder, will the value change enough as our races merge so that blond eventually looses some of its mystique.&quot;Blond Like Me&quot; is a quick read of interest to both scholars and casual readers. It should be taken seriously by reviewers and social commentators."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"I picked up Blonde Like Me because I needed something light to read on a plane. It turned out to be much more than humor and entertainment, although it was that in spades. This story about the meaning of blondeness, and its meticulously researched and scholarly explanation of why so many women (and men) yearn after the golden crown blondness implies, is a metaphor that reveals much deeper stuff about the ways people search to matter in life. Anecdotes from the author's own life that form the core for each chapter reveal a fresh, civilized attitude totally lacking in pretension. As Howard Thurman wrote, we all long for relationships in which we do not need to pretend. I, for one, found that the candor and vulnerability displayed without vulgarity (imagine reading a book these days where you are not obliged to be constantly scraping scatalogical images off your consciousness), and layers of insights through feelings graciously and generously revealed made me feel heartened on my own journey. Although Ms. Ilyin's depth of learning is carried so lightly on waves of truly delicious wit and engaging stories, deeper insights kept surfacing. I felt this was a book that could accompany many different journeys and I subsequently gave it to friends young and old who were experiencing various life challenges. Without exception, each reported back that they found in it something that mirrored their own circumstances. For them, as for me, the book provided a good companion, lighthearted but compassionate, on the road to menschdom."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"Unlike the author, I'm a currently natural blonde, so I know I'm not her target audience. That hardly matters; any woman could relate to this book. Natalia Ilyin's point isn't really about &quot;going blonde&quot;: it's about being female.Ilyin does a lovely job of dividing and defining the different kinds of women we choose to be, and what those types mean in a world where we are always visible. It's postmodern and funny -- wait for the scene where the recently-retired &quot;Armpiece Blonde&quot; meets her male counterpart on a plane -- and the author's tone is resolutely cheerful. Natalia Ilyin is like a good friend who mixes a great martini: a few pages in you'll feel fabulous, you'll be laughing, and you'll have no idea why."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"Natalia Ilyin is that most seductive of writers--she knows how to educate by telling a story. The entire utility of myth is being able to find our human selves in a confusing modern world. You can take the long road by consulting learned academic texts and risk losing yourself completely in the railroad timetable of indexes and exhaustive bibliographies from now until the cows come home, and never, never in spite of all the outlandish post-modernish jargon that permeates the texts of our professional class of cultural explainers, understand how myth, one of the engines of culture, expresses itself through the lives of ordinary people (or is it the other way around? Dr. Freud? Dr. Jung? Are y'all out there somewhere? Never mind. We've got Natalia Ilyin.).Blonde Like Me, a personal meditation on how the myth of blondeness affects women who respond to its demands, is written as a series of connected personal essays, which makes it the perfect vehicle to express in human terms our tendency to conceive and measure perfection, only to struggle in vain to personify its qualities. Ilyin starts close to home, telling tales out of school, mostly on herself, mostly hilarious, and then warms to her point as she informally and lucidly describes the dilemmas and the paradoxes facing a woman as she tries to decide how to express who she wants to be by manipulating her appearance. Ilyin elegantly benchmarks (and circumscribes) the range of her choices by the hair coloring products arrayed on a drugstore shelf, which promise not only allure, but essence of personhood--of identity. But then Ilyin, and this is her genius, expands the ramifications of this deceptively parochial dilemma until she is grappling with, well, pretty much everything. I mean, why not?As a man, reading Blonde Like Me, I feel as if my deepest and most paranoid suspicions are being confirmed at the same time I'm being given a privileged guided tour of the female psyche--an inexplicably authorized tour. Still, as I read I find myself feeling guilty, shooting furtive looks over my shoulder and thinking--am I supposed to be here? Suddenly I know what it must have felt like to crack the code for the enigma machine back in the \\"good\\" war.There's the pedestal; there's the woman. She may as well get on the escalator and enjoy the ride. That seems to be where we want her and where she wants to be. So what if the pedestal is an illusion. So is personality; so is perfection. So am I with my GQ Quarterly, my Hemingway first editions, my top-of-the-line car, and my obscene bottom line ledger.Men: if you want to understand the woman latched on to your arm as you charge through the world, or if you want to find a woman to latch on to your arm, buy this book. You will be entertained, educated, and perhaps, if you're lucky, transformed by Natalia Ilyin's subtle wit, charm, erudition, and compassionate insights into our drive to be more than we are. Blonde Like Me may address a dilemma closest to a woman's experience, but it really is about all of us."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"So, what's the \\"blonde myth\\"? What are its \\"roots\\" in \\"our culture\\"? Don't ask Natalia Ilyin; she doesn't know or care. This book is straight-up memoir, with occasional citation-free references to ancient mythology and pop psychology. Most chapters center around listing characteristics of blonde archetypes (eg., the innocent, the warm, the \\"crazy\\"), and when Ilyin gives real-world examples, it's to describe how various celebrities don't quite fit. Well, obviously; women are people, not archetypes, but where did these archetypes come from, and why do they persevere? The author never gets there. In fact, Blonde Like Me rarely gets past the word Go on any idea and repeatedly assumes all its readers are straight, cis, and marriage-minded. Race is only discussed on one page, and with a title like that, this seems particularly irresponsible."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"I really wanted to love this book and sadly that was not the case. I am fan of non-fiction and though this book has great bones- the writing is a bit scattered making it difficult to focus on the points being made in each section. The best parts of the book are the authors personal reflections about her own blondness which was a tad disappointing to me since I had hoped the book would be a touch more academic in feel. Overall an interesting book and sparked good conversation at our book club, but not something I would unequivocally recommend."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"The 70's and 80's were saturated and soaked in fashion images that depicted the only beauty was the flaxen-kind. This social commentary explains a bit why. Blondes are like diamonds, because they are rare they are treated in the same kind of esteem. However, one trip to Scandinavia with her black hair, made a brunette friend of mine feel like a blonde. It's all a frame of reference.

She discusses contemporary blonde goddesses. Often touching but more often hilarious, she wryly comments on her own life as a blonde. She obviously loves language-has \`waifdom' been a word for long?-and frequently polishes off a straightforward paragraph with a witty zinger in the last line. The book is a pleasure to read.I want to give this book with all my friends who are blondes like Ilyin and me: blondes at age four and therefore entitled to live life forever as a blonde."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"This book is good for entertainment; in fact, it's a page-turner. It's like a really long &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; article. I wasn't sure who her intended audience for this book was--I don't see _BLM_ as scholarly. Also, I think it's a little ignorant to say that natural blondes are as rare as albinos. My relatives always told me when I was a child that my hair would turn brown in my teens. I'll be 26 in October, and my hair is still the same color it always was. At the beginning, Ilyin talks about her cyclical ritual with getting highlights and then &quot;double-processing&quot; and then dyeing it brown again. I wonder, why doesn't she just stay blonde all the time if that's what she likes? Still, I recommend it: I would put it in the same category with humorous books by Maryln Schwartz like _A Southern Belle Primer_ and _New Times in the Old South_."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"Don't wait!

My 57 year-old mother just dyed her once-brunette Italian coif blonde. I needed to read this book, and so do you. Ilyin covers not only fashion and consumer culture, she dips into myth, symbolism, history, and gender. What made this enjoyable was the spin placed on her personal anecdotes. She looks back with a critical eye and, it's an eye capable of seeing beneath the surface. Taking on popular culture, religion, and (of course) hair coloring, Ilyin shows us that appearances can sometimes be deceiving. And most of the time, they simply are."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"First of all, I do not believe that was really Ilyin who posted here. Ilyin's intelligence level comes across brilliantly in the book. I do not believe the real Ilyin would have said some of those things, much less misspelled &quot;disdainful.&quot;Now. The passage that struck me the most in the book was when Ilyin was telling about going back to school at a ritzy graduate school and how real education rearranges your mind. Then she &quot;turned the kleig lights of [her] education&quot; on blondeness. I am glad she did. But aside from the topic of the book, that one passage made me want to get more education.I think it is a scholarly book. That was fascinating about the bounty goddesses (Summer Wheat and California Sun.)I wonder if stunning brunettes like Catherine Zeta-Jones symbolize anything at all? Or are they, too, thought to be associated with (I guess) impurity? As a brunette, I have picked up on the association of blondes with purity even though it didn't seem fair (if by implication brunettes are associated with impurity, and I think in my experience we are.) There isn't a thing I can do about it; much less women of color. I look at old Rita Coolidge albums and I can't help it; the woman was *beautiful.* I am not criticizing Ilyin, but the culture that wouldn't recognize the beauty of a Cher or Rita Coolidge if they came along today. Ilyin explains why. It isn't fair, but at least Ilyin acknowledges that I didn't make this up in my head."},{"Title":"Blonde Like Me: The Roots of the Blonde Myth in Our Culture","review":"This book should have been titled, \\"Natalia Ilyin's whimsical and subjective musings about her life, having little if anything to do with the roots of the blonde myth in our culture.\\" A discussion of the blonde myth within American culture that the book is purported to contain is nowhere to be found. Rather, we find a blurry barrage of Ilyin's personal memoirs and reflections on the meaning of blondeness in her own life. Ilyin's \\"culture\\" is replaced and limited by her own subjective experiences. The text would have been more suitable for an autobiography, not a commentary on blondeness in our culture. The book's title and back cover description betray its actual content.

I had mistakenly assumed that it was a survey of blonde myth in culture, in which I would have been interested in reading. Unfortunately, this book is really a collection of stories about the author's life with a little myth interwoven. I'm extremely disappointed and couldn't even finish it. The title should not say \\"Roots of Blonde Myth in Our Culture\\", it should state: \\"Personal Stories that Have Little to Do With Culture\\"And another thing: where in the world is the INDEX? How can the author use direct quotes or paraphasing and not site anything??? Maybe I would want to read a little more about the books or people she talks about - oh wait, I can't, because she apparently didn't have any other sources.

She helps the reader to see that blonde alone is just a color but the wearer of the blonde makes the blonde.Sometimes it seems as though she digs too hard to find evidence and examples.

I didn't really understand measure until reading this book, which does a great job of laying out the various competing ideas of the time and how they evolved into the current notion.Further - and perhaps most important for a math book - is that the proofs are very clear and complete. It's true that many important concepts are left as exercises, but those that are covered in the text are covered well. In contrast, I have suffered too many math texts that attempt to cover every important result but with only short, uninformative proofs (e.g. \\"Proof: By Radon-Nikodym and Corollary 2 of Theorem 5 QED\\")."},{"Title":"Real Analysis","review":"I'm taking a course in Real Analysis and using this text.

Though it does provide some fascinating historical tidbits not found elsewhere, the power of this work lies in its discussion of the underlying theory of computing. For example, Mr. Agar's initial take on Babbage, i.e. that in designing the analytical engine he was merely recreating a manufacturing center, with which he was intimately familiar, is just the first of many profound observations that seem to be tossed off without further comment. Portraying Bletchley Park as a computer itself with the various huts being distributed processors was also a sound analogy and would be a tremendously effective segue into a story about the Internet. The story of Mr. Zuse's machine is likewise a fine example of Mr. Agar's thesis that the increase in computing power merely reflects the increasing complexity of our world. He raises a brilliantly multi-faceted what came first--chicken or egg--argument. Did complexity give birth to the computer or vice-versa? However, I think his ideas go well beyond that premise--though the comments on modern bureaucracy and corporate management were rather cryptic, isn't it true that in the world of \\"google\\" we are all distributed processors in a gigantic Universal Machine?I am surprised that the author didn't fully develop the swiss knife analogy with which he began the book. In a real sense any stand-alone computer is a special purpose machine because it is limited by its user. It is only when programming is universally understood or, better yet, a transparent part of using the machine that we have a truly universal machine. And that is developing right under our noses--the internet has in just a few short years completely changed the educational experience (given the power of the internet my kids have never had to worry about not being able to find the right books in the local library), it has dramatically changed the marketplace (the most obscure books or materials are but a click away), it continues to redefine modern media (Drudge?) and to churn out innovation. But is the latest step towards a truly universal machine--the Internet--the result of society's changes or the cause?We are blind to the significance of the computer because we are surrounded by its effects. Something huge is coming--the machine envisioned by Turing is still being developed--will we be ready for it, will we be able to understand its power, will we even recognize it when it arrives?"},{"Title":"Turing and the Universal Machine: The Making of the Modern Computer (Revolutions of Science)","review":"This curious little book is a pleasant read for those with a knowledge of the history of computers -- heaven knows what others will make of it! It begins with a brief survey of Charles Babbage, which is generally accurate. Followed by some excellent information on Hollerith and the history of punched cards. Agar then covers Konrad Zuse in much more detail than I've seen elsewhere. (Zuse is one of those computer pioneers who was lost to history for a bit and now rediscovered. He built computers in his living room to help design Nazi airplanes.) There follows a whirlwind tour of early American efforts by Aiken, Atanasoff and Mauchly.Then things get strange as Agar jumps to an in-depth explanation of the basis of modern mathematics (way over my head) with a discussion of Hilbert, Godel, Riemann, Cantor, etc. The book then winds up with a discussion of Turing's contributions to mathematics and code breaking, with an overview of British code-breaking efforts and post-war computer development. All of this overlaid with some peculiar attempts to philosophize on the nature and future of computers.Whew! You can't do justice to all this in a 150 page paperback, and he doesn't. But the book is well-written and travels down some less-traveled roads, so it's a fun read for computer folk."},{"Title":"Turing and the Universal Machine: The Making of the Modern Computer (Revolutions of Science)","review":"I picked this book up randomly at the library between classes. I only got about half way through before I had to leave but I made sure to tuck it away and finish it later that night. Excellent read for one sitting. Even if the author doesn't accurately present the true intentions and motivations behind Babbage and Turing's breakthroughs, he still manages to establish that computer science was an evolution of thought not some spontaneous stroke of brilliance. By the end of the book you feel a little starved for information but that is what makes this book such an excellent primer for additional reading on a number of subjects. This book really is a primer, don't read it if you have PHDs in history and computer science. I don't want to see Dr. whats his face giving this book half a star. It's a good book period."},{"Title":"Turing and the Universal Machine: The Making of the Modern Computer (Revolutions of Science)","review":"This book presents a credible history of the development of the modern computer, albeit through deeply-tinted, rose-colored spectacles. The treatment, though, is rather superficial, and this volume reads more like a juvenile history than a work for adults.The author filters his story through the lens of a Dickensian view of industrial development. It would seem that the nineteenth century was a hellish world of alienated workers slaving like drones in chaotic, out-of-control facories that cried out for organization and control. This despite the fact that the nineteenth century saw the greatest increases in standards of living in history.Curiously, the author confuses the nineteenth century quest for a universal computing maching with the eighteenth century quest for The Longitude. It would seem that the development of the computer was spurred on by the need to keep the Royal Navy off the rocks at the Isles of Scilly, a problem which had been resolved in the mid-eighteenth century by John Harrison's method of determining longitude, which required only relatively simple navigational computations. There is precious little discussion of the insurance industry, whose growth during the nineteenth century created a need for detailed and lengthy actuarial tables was the original impetus behind Charles Babbage's efforts to build a 'difference engine' in the nineteenth century.The material on Turing and twentieth century work towards a universal computing machine is better. But even here, the author's biases show through. The material on the Nazi engineer Konrad Zuse isn't always covered in works of this sort. Yet Zuse is portrayed as \\"only a young engineer, in a lowly position in a large company...\\" (p. 45). This sort of thing has long since grown tiresome. One wishes the author would simply get on with the story.Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of this history is the author's penchant for describing people as if they were computers. Right off the bat, the author characterizes us as living in a \\"two-tier modern world of general-and special-purpose humans...built in the nineteenth century.\\" (p. 11) Or later, when the British civil service is described as being comprised of \\"generalist 'intellectuals' and rule-following 'mechanicals'...\\" (p. 143)And therein lies the true theme of this book. We live in a two-class society, made up of intellectuals who think for us and the rest of us, who follow the rules they create. And we are all quite happily managed by the electronic computer. This thesis would be laughable if the author set it up as a straw-man, to then attack in moral outrage. But incredibly, Professor Agar seems to view it as the natural and desirable order of things. It makes for very interesting, if somewhat naive, reading.If you have never read a history of computing and are interested in the subject, thenthis isn't really a bad book. It's just that there are so many books out there that are better than this one. I'd suggest a search on \\"computer history\\" here on Amazon. You will get a list of a dozen or so histories that tell the story with more distance and less bias than this volume."},{"Title":"Turing and the Universal Machine: The Making of the Modern Computer (Revolutions of Science)","review":"I was really hoping for a more detailed time line of the events leading upto the ENIGMA and what eventually lead to the first commercial computers during the late 50s and mid 60s. The author spent a great deal of time detailing the mathematical advances and controversies that spurred the technological advances we see today.

It really teaches kids to appreciate each and every letter. The subtle messages of appreciating language, value for the individual, and good, old fashioned enunciation, come across as playful and fun in this wonderful book. The pop-ups and tabs are really great and the characters are bright and lively, so that even the youngest children can play and learn."},{"Title":"Elemenopee: The Day L, M, N, O, P Left the ABC's","review":"ISBN 1581172095 - Made in Thailand (boo hiss to Los Angeles-based publisher Piggy Toes Press for that bit of offshoring jobs). Kids' books, especially books with hooks - like pop ups! - are great, fun ways to interest young readers. For that, and for finally recognizing that Elemenopee is a word, I love this book.L, M, N, O, and P are picked on by the other letters because children always run them together when they sing the alphabet song, making it sound like they have one long name - Elemenopee. After a great deal of ribbing, and right before school starts, L, M, N, O, and P leave the ABCs and join the numbers on the other wall. The numbers, happy to add, welcome them, but things begin to go wrong. In the morning, the teacher can't take attendance, math is a jumble and the ABCs realize they need to get those letters to come back.For a smart parent, there's a lesson here about ridiculing people and making them feel bad, as well as a lesson about working together. That, of course, is on top of the obvious lesson of the alphabet, all 26 letters. I'm not as fond of this book as I'd like to be, for a few reasons.Author Pamela Hall fails me on two points. One, there's no apostrophe in ABCs, unless it is possessive (the ABC's wall) and that's not the case here. I realize it's a small thing, but if we're teaching children to read, we're also teaching them how to write, and the people who write the things children read should be more literate (and possibly have better editors). Two, the rhyming pattern is off every now and then. Just when you get a cadence to your reading going, the rhyme flops. The rhyme wasn't necessary, but if Hall went for a rhyme scheme, it should work throughout, not on and off.James Williamson, the illustrator, is credited in a strange place on the back cover. Everyone else's name (the author, editorial director Dorothea DePrisco, designer Treesha Runnells and paper engineer Renee Jablow) is on a fun \\"black\\"board (it's green), while Williamson's name is tucked into the copyright information. I found this weird because he's the star of this book. His illustrations are bright, lively and fun, full of amusing details but with just the right simplicity for an empty classroom.Paper engineer Renee Jablow lets me down here. The pop ups and tabs are different on each page, so for variety, Jablow did a great job. What is weird to me is the way each function works. On the first page, the blackboard and teacher's desk pop upward (toward the top edge of the page), so it only works properly if the book is laid flat. Later, when the ABCs serenade L and friends, the pop up pops DOWNward, so that if the book is still laid flat, the pop up blocks some of the text; the book must be tilted upright to see all of the words. Then, on the very next page, some cute items dangle from the pop up, but only dangle properly if the book is laid flat again.

It will renew your trust in your own mind and will set you free to ask questions bravely and, possibly, find some answers."},{"Title":"God and Other Famous Liberals: Reclaiming the Politics of America","review":"I am the author of The Liberal Contradiction, and Mr. Church's very title is a classic example of that phenomenon. His complaint is that the Far Right claims God is on their side, yet his answer is to make precisely the same claim for the Left. He claims to be concerned about the Right's injection of religion into politics, but then says that a &quot;proper&quot; understanding of Chrisitianity justifies his own politics. With such a contradictory premise, Mr. Church unwittingly offers himself as an example of th"},{"Title":"God and Other Famous Liberals: Reclaiming the Politics of America","review":"As one who cherishes the difference between right and wrong, and bases right and wrong on reason as well as revelation, I do not see how America's God-loving Christians that I know can be labelled \\"far right\\". None of the ones I know are. It makes me sad that this author, especially being a man of the cloth, is injecting political correctness into religion. What ever happened to moral sense?"},{"Title":"God and Other Famous Liberals: Reclaiming the Politics of America","review":"Church is funny! As a Christian I have to ask why do I want to recover the bible, the flag or the family. Each of these are nothing more than another form of idolatry when placed within the conflicts of Church and his straw enemies. This is a bad book that needs to be read to see how far Unitarians will go to pretend to be religious in the name of democracy. Hey Church, join a church and abandon the social club of Unitarianism and you might be able to experience something more than a civil religion of the state."},{"Title":"More Food That Really Schmecks","review":"The recipes in More Food that Really Schmecks are interesting, easy, use ingredients that many of us have on hand and above all, yield food that everyone loves. This is one of my &quot;desert island&quot; cookbooks. Among the 400+ in my collection, this is one of the top five! (Likewise Food that Schmecks, the first in the series.) I also love the little stories about Edna's mother and friends. There is a strong influence from old order Mennonites (similar to the Amish in the US.)"},{"Title":"More Food That Really Schmecks","review":"Edna Stabler is one of the best cooks, and writers, I've ever encountered. Her very readable cookbooks are packed with solid information and mouth-watering recipes and I've had rave reviews on everything I've tried. I can't recommend this book highly enough, and if the first column, Food That Really Schmecks, can be bought or bagged or stolen or otherwise annexed into your cookbook collection you'll be ready for anything."},{"Title":"More Food That Really Schmecks","review":"It's great to see that this book has been reissued, as the original has been out of print and copies difficult to find. Like Food that Really Schmecks, More Food that Really Schmecks is a great cookbook filled with many Mennonite inspired recipies that Edna Staebler has gathered from her friends and family, and is complimented by numerous anecdotes about the Waterloo region (and more) of which she is a native. I am not a big cook, but I really enjoy this book, and am greatful that Edna Staebler has done so much to preserve some of Canada's German cooking heritage."},{"Title":"More Food That Really Schmecks","review":"I was very happy to get the book and it was in good condition too despite being previously owned. I've already made a recipe that I had been looking for and hope to make many more. The old recipes to me are better than what's in new cookbooks and I plan to buy the first book Edna Steabler wrote also."},{"Title":"More Food That Really Schmecks","review":"This was one of my first cookbooks in the 70's. I recently reached for it, and found that it was missing - I was delighted that it was still available after all these years. Although there are no pictures, the recipes are easy, use staple ingredients and are fun to read. Lots of comfort food. I own close to 200 cookbooks, and this is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"The author obviously knows his stuff. The book is chock full of useful information, and not a lot of fluff. It's hard to compress the important facts of PC interfacing into just over 900 pages -- including a hefty appendix. The author manages to do a good job, without dumbing it down for the beginners or making it too lofty for the rest of us.However, the book suffers from poor language throughout, enough that it often gets in the way of the message. I understand that there were some problems with the editing staff at McGraw-Hill before the book went to press, and perhaps that is the reason for the language difficulties. While one can normally overlook typos, grammar, spelling, usage and sentence structure in a strictly technical volume, it's difficult to do so with this book. Sometimes the English is downright hard to read. Had it been better edited, it would merit five stars and not three.Based solely on the strength of the author's knowledge and the information presented in this book, I would purchase other books by the author."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"The PC Ph.D. is one of the most authoritative and comprehensive books about the PC Architecture available. The book provides a good coverage of not only PC Hardware but it also contains a through survey of the available software development environments across multiple operating systems. I particularly enjoyed the History of the PC Section. The PC's evolution is truly interesting. Predko's liberal use of hardware and software projects provides a solid set of examples for the reader to learn from. I found the book to be valuable resource while developing an ISA Interface card and I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"I picked this book up from a local Chapters because I was looking for something to help me out at work (I repair PCs).

Included on the CD-ROM are a couple of utilities that I have used to help me understand what is going wrong with PCs and what is and what isn't being installed.The history of the PC was really useful and it helped me to understand what was going on - especially when I get an old '486."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"This book is NOT everything you need to interface your PC with outside devices. Like most of Myke Predko's books it is full of filler material and misrepresented.

I am very dissapointed with Predko's books and feel that he writes to sell books and not primarily to educate and inform."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"I bought this book because I liked Mykes &quot;Programming and Customizing PICmicro Microcontrollers&quot; and I was happy to see that it is different from the other ones, like &quot;The Indispensable PC Hardware&quot; book.In Mykes book, he explains what is happening in the PC and what you can do to take advantage of it. This difference makes the book a lot more useful.There are a number of example circuits and programs that you can use with the book to help you understand how the PC works and give you a start on developing your own applications.Great book from a great Canadian author."},{"Title":"PC PhD: Inside PC Interfacing","review":"If you want to learn about how PCs work, and especially how they access external devices, this ambitious book covers it all.

This textbook is great for an easy understanding of anatomy and radiographic exams. The one-page exam layouts are very efficient, and again easy to comprehend. It will come very handy too, later on, when you've graduated and end up pulling it out for those rare exams you do, maybe one or two times a year, (Cough), Mastoids! (Laugh). So please, do not throw it in the trash or give it back to your bookstore!When I was in my clinical setting, I worked along side with other students from a different program. They were very jealous of my one large textbook, compared to their 3 large textbooks! Apparently their text was divided amongst three volumes, crazy!Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this text for any student and for any program that is presently not using it.

I plan on doing the same for his second book, which is even more comprehensive and should be part of any investors' reference library."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"If you are less afraid of legal documents than most people and like to do some things on your own, this book is not as useful as are other books, e.g. Dennis Clifford, \\"Estate Planning Basics\\". If you are somewhat afraid of legal documents, this book will probably make you more afraid. Although they talk about people being able to create some of their own documents (with software programs, etc,) they really think that such people are in a grave danger zone and ought to go to an attorney. In other words, I think that they are attorney biased. I think if one were to ask them about going to the toilet,they would probably say that you better ask an attorney."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"In guiding my clientele through the ever-changing maze of estate tax planning law, I have found JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax to be an invaluable body of knowledge that I have referenced again and again. The easy-to-read layout allows quick focus on particular issues and topics that are presented in clear and concise laymen's terms."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"Let's face it. Keeping track of changing tax laws and estate laws isn't much fun. The new laws mean we must re-evaluate our financial situations. Where do you start? I'd recommend this book. Here's why:Harold Apolinsky is the single person most responsible for getting the estate tax repealed. Stewart Welch III handles the financial porfolios of the nation's wealthiest individuals. These two are a financial dynamic duo!You'll be getting the best information that's out there in a remarkably easy-to-read, logical, organized fashion. You don't have the read every page. Just skip to the topic you're interested in and Viola! begin digesting the contents. You'll appreciate the bullet points and short paragraphs. Though the subject is dry, the book is anything but.In my opinion, the best aspect of this book is that it focuses on the important stuff. Stewart and Harold tell parables or stories about what happens when one fails to plan. Then they take the time to walk you through all the questions you should ask yourself. I appreciated the way topics were discussed, followed by case examples to illustrate the point.The book is sold as a paperback--so you can easily read snippets of it while you take the commuter train to work, or while waiting at Johnny's baseball practice. The bottom line is that professional advice from these men would ordinarily cost hundreds of dollars. By reading this book, you can pick their brains for less than 20 bucks.This book would make a great gift to baby-boomers and young people alike.If you are not a do-it-yourselfer, Welch and Apolinsky supply a list of professional advisors.

This book is easily readable, and is written through the eyes of both a financial planner, and an estate planning attorney. There's no reason with a book like this why anyone can't keep a responsible eye on these personal matters. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"This book provides a good overview of estate planning. I am an attorney who is going to be adding estate planning to my practice in the near future and this book has a lot of good information.Some people have complained that this book is too focused on using an attorney for estate planning. This is a strength and not a weakness. Estate planning is not something that a person should try to do without an estate planning attorney. Tax law is too fluid and there are too many subtle nuances for the lay person to stay on top of changes in their state probate law and federal tax law.There are three really good reasons to have a professionally prepared estate plan: 1) minimize stress on your heirs after you pass; 2) ensure that you maximize the amount of your money that goes to your heirs and not Uncle Sam; and 3) ensure that your estate goes where you want it to go after you pass.This book will save you money. A client who comes into their attorney's office properly prepared, will require less of the attorney's time, and will therefore be billed less. Understanding the basic concepts of proper estate planning and properly organizing will minimize the amount of work necessary to prepare the estate plan and help you explain to your attorney what you want the goals of your estate plan to be."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"This book does a wonderful job of making a difficult subject into an easy to understand reference guide for both professionals and individuals.It is a how to guide for achieving a great plan for thoes who want to avoid the landmines in the tax code."},{"Title":"JK Lasser's New Rules for Estate Planning and Tax","review":"What a great book!

It examines what the new tax law means, not just what it says. Stewart Welch III and Harold Apolinsky have addressed the questions all of us are asking, and a few we may not have thought of yet.

On a 3 week trip through Germany in May-June 2006, I used the Germany LP and was unpleasantly suprised time after time at the outdated or just plain incorrect information in the book. Not little things like prices, which always go up, but major problems like listings for buses to the airport in Berlin, that I discovered after much searching, had been discontinued two years ago. This type of thing happened repeatedly. At the end of the trip I actually felt cheated and as if I had wasted my money, and worse, valuable time depending on information provided in this purchase. The only thing it ended up being good for was finding hotel listigs to make reservations with during the planning stages. I don't have another guide to suggest instead, but leaving basic transportation info outdated for so long is just negligent. I'm going to to try Rough Guide next time."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Germany","review":"For my one-week-only trip (I circulated around Frankfurt and Wiesbaden) the book did it's job.

There's lots of great history and culture, and although far from perfect, you'll do a lot worse with other imprints in my experience. Very helpful on a recent trip. And a personal hint to travelers - buying used copies is often better since the previous owner(s) - as I did - will correct, add, or cross out information that makes it even more helpful. A decent book about a lovely place - recommended!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Germany","review":"The best thing about Lonely Planet guide books is it gives you tons of useful information from customs and culture to language to the nitty-gritty how to, where to go, and what to see and do. We just returned from a one week trip to Germany. It was wonderful, and we took the Lonely Planet guidebook with us everywhere. It led us to many great cities, sights, restaurants, and places to stay. Highly recommended! We have also used Lonely Planet guidebooks on our trips to Thailand and Japan. It has never led us very far astray. :)"},{"Title":"Ministry and Spirituality","review":"Henri J. M. Nouwen does it one more time in this compilation of three of his most popular works. This is a book for all those involved with any type of ministry, especially those with a leadership role in ministry as a whole. Priests, Ministers and so forth would do well in improving their ministerial lives by reading this materpiece. Nouwen is not focusing on all the technical aspects of the ministerial experience, e.g. psychological, counseling, and so forth, but he has the reader realize that what is truly important in ministry, above all, is the encounter we have with the other person we are ministering to.Ministry is not some abstract experience, but is something that is real, in the here and now of it all. Nouwen, in this very prolific compilation, demonstrates how ministry is truly a fruitful experience between the person being ministered to and the minister. Ultimately, Christ is the center of our experience in ministry, and we need to try to find the face of Christ in the other at all times, as well as try to unveil him in us."},{"Title":"Will God Heal Me?: Faith in the Midst of Suffering","review":"I am a 39 year old woman with Multiple Sclerosis and Chronic-Late Lyme Disease.

The only way that I can endure these losses is through my faith in our Lord.

Rasey'sbooks and from the title I thought it was a Vampire book. I was a little disappointed to find out it wasn't, however when I got into the book I realized it was a great read because I just couldn't put it down, the story drew me in.Set it 1920's New York & Denver, Colorado, this Romantic Suspense has you wondering whodunit from the getgo! It'll be total surprise, I assure you, and I've read a lot of mysteries.Foster Taylor is a man who has raised himself up from nothing to be the owner of a several hotels in Georgia, New York & Denver. It seems someone is out to get him by going after those he loves, as a result he's afraid to love. He's become a ladies man who refuses to settle down and moves on when any lady tries to get too close.Brooke Abel has had a tragic life. Born in poverty, seeing her parents murdered, trying to live with an abusive relative, then finally going back home to Denver to make a home & a living, she opens, Body Apparel inside the latest hotel belonging to Foster Tyler.There are several characters woven into the the story that create a realistic time capsule and a mystery that will keep you going to the very end!The only flaw I really thought I ran across was the hero having long hair tied back with leather. I don't think the 1920's was a time for long hair on gents, but then I wasn't there.I was impressed with this book and will look for more of Patricia Rasey's books!"},{"Title":"Merrill Chemistry","review":"Our school recently upgraded to this chemistry book for the honors level. personally, i like it a lot. all the math examples have clear instructions, and the pictures really helped. a few chapters were a bit fuzzy, but more intense topics (ie, subatomic particles &amp; thermo) made up for any lack of information. ... . i would definitely recommend purchasing a SAT II review book, as it contains valuable information that goes along nicely with the book itself. the book covers nearly everything one would find in a college-prep chemistry course, so i would definitely recommend taking the SAT II in may."},{"Title":"Merrill Chemistry","review":"Confusing explainations, and poor overall graphics and coloring.

Coal is now as valuable in his country as gold, and whoever obtains it is likely to win the war. With ambassadors, government officials, and agents constantly changing sides and selling each other out, D. is unable to trust anyone. Formerly a professor of medieval French and an expert in the Song of Roland, D.'s world has been shattered. In the past two years, his wife has been killed, and he's been buried alive, tortured, and jailed. Soon he meets an attractive, young Englishwoman, is implicated in the deaths of two people, has his credentials stolen, and ends up on the run from both the police and his own compatriots.Published in 1939, this is one of Greene's most exciting &quot;entertainments.&quot; A thriller of the first order, this novel also deals with big themes, not religious conflicts of his major novels, but the idea of justice, as a good man finds himself hunted for his political allegiances and learns that his own survival and that of his country depend upon his willingness to kill his enemies. A formal, courtly scholar, D. has discovered war is not glamorous, as it is in the Song of Roland, that innocent people are killed, and that survival is not a matter of divine intervention as much as it is a result of forethought and cleverness.Told entirely from D.'s perspective, presumably the &quot;right&quot; perspective in Greene's mind, the reader sees D. as less heroic than he might be and the villains as less villainous. D. is well developed and realistic, however, and he wrestles with issues as his readers might. Set just before World War II, Greene here foreshadows some of the themes with which he struggles in his more contemplative novels--the nature of good and evil, man's constant struggle with guilt, the trauma of betrayal, and the fear of failure. Though there is a female love interest, Rose Cullen, the daughter of Lord Benditch, who owns the coal mines, she is neither plausible nor sufficiently thoughtful to add to the themes here. Ironies abound, and while the novel lacks the light touch and humor which make a novel like Our Man in Havana so successful, this is an exciting story which casts light on important ideas.

The backdrop is The Spanish Civil War (though never mentioned) an agent for the Spanish Republic comes to England to try and buy coal--I won't giveaway the plot. Greene uses his \\"thriller\\" to explore the questions of loyalty betrayal--faith commitment revenge--a whole series of moral problems that preoccupied him the rest of his life. Though Greene is a man of the Left there are no slogans or pat answers in thi book.He wrote it in 6 weeks while working on Brighton Rock--quite something!"},{"Title":"The confidential agent,: An entertainment","review":"Here is what the author says about his novel:\\"\`The Confidential Agent' was written in six weeks in 1938 after my return from Mexico. The Spanish Civil War furnished the background...I was struggling then through \`The Power and the Glory', but there was no money in the book as far as I could foresee. Certainly my wife and two children would not be able to live on one unsaleable book...so I determined to write another \\"entertainment\\" as quickly as possible in the mornings, while I ground on slowly with \`The Power and the Glory' in the afternoons.The opening scene between two rival agents on the cross-channel steamer--I called them D. and L. because I did not wish to localize their conflict--was all I had in mind, and a certain vague ambition to create something legendary out of a contemporary thriller: the hunted man who becomes in turn the hunter, the peaceful man who turns at bay, the man who has learned to love justice by suffering injustice. But what the legend was to be about in modern terms I had no idea.I fell back for the first and last time in my life on Benzedrine. For six weeks I started each day with a tablet, and renewed the dose at midday. Each day I sat down to work with no idea of what turn the plot might take and each morning I wrote, with the automatism of a planchette, two thousand words instead of my usual stint of five hundred words. In the afternoons \`The Power and the Glory' proceeded towards its end at the same leaden pace, unaffected by the sprightly young thing who was so quickly overtaking it.\`The Confidential Agent' is one of the few books of mine which I have cared to reread--perhaps because it is not really one of mine. It was as though I were ghosting for another man. D., the chivalrous agent and professor of Romance literature, is not really one of my characters, nor is Forbes, born Furtstein, the equally chivalrous lover. The book moved rapidly because I was not struggling with my own technical problems: I was to all intents ghosting a novel by an old writer who was to die a little before the studio in which I had worked was blown out of existence. All I can say as excuse, and in gratitude to an honoured shade, is that \`The Confidential Agent' is a better than Ford Madox Ford wrote himself when he attempted the genre in \`Vive Le Roy'\\".From \`Ways of Escape', pp.69-71"},{"Title":"The confidential agent,: An entertainment","review":"A foreign government has sent agent D. to England on a confidential mission, alone. D. is to buy coal at a fair price now with a bonus promised later. But the other side has sent their agent to foil D. in accomplishing his mission. The story tells about D.'s adventures on his trip to London. Greene's \\"subtle characterization and accomplished craftsmanship\\" result in a slow-paced story. It is the dialogue that moves the story along. D.'s mistake allows his enemy to search his coat and take his notebook of schedules. When he arrives at his hotel he learns of an appointment at a language school. The language teacher is his contact. D. seemed to be surrounded by enemies, or people he could not trust. D. learns of a new danger from a beggar in the street.D. sleeps that night, then leaves to meet Lord Benditch and negotiate a sale. He meets someone on his walk there. At the meeting he found he could not complete the sale. Then things get worse: a dead body was found. The police come for D. but he manages to escape. D. changes his appearance. D. has failed at his mission; the other side made a better offer. [Greene creates a comedy from the travel of D. and K. This highlights the tragedy of this story.] K. tells what happened. D. continues to hide from the authorities.D. travels to the coal mining town. If his side can't get the coal he will try to prevent the other side from getting it. His appeal falls short, and he must escape again. D. gets unexpected help. But D. is finally arrested and jailed. The police can't make the charges stick due to a lack of identification by eyewitnesses. D. finds he has some friends, and is released on bail. But he must be smuggled out of the country that night. The publicity over this has accomplished D.'s mission: the coal contract was canceled. There is a surprise at the ending. [Is it believable to you?]"},{"Title":"The confidential agent,: An entertainment","review":"I liked the book a lot because it is a very interesting story. At the beginning it is a little bit hard to understand the plot because there are so many characters, which you do not know. I did not really understand either what D was supposed to do. I realized it after a while and there it became really fascinating. You can feel for D and you do understand his fears and thoughts.I only did not like the ending. I guess it is too simple. Not everything should come out this perfectly. That makes the story less dramatic and somehow untrustworthy.

This lover of animals has endured the death of her mother and a traumatic childhood she still carries around. In Oakland, Kaj, an ex-college football hero, now working in construction thinks he wants to find the lady of his life and settle down. But when he first meets Dana in downtown Oakland at the bank, after seeing her at the bus stop for sometime, he thinks she is nice, but a little bit plain, while the sister who passes by his construction site in her convertible is flashy enough to catch his eye. Kaj, too has much baggage to hold on to. He feels trapped by his mother's excessive wants and the bitterness and jealousy of his once best friend's pro football success is eating away at him. When Dana and Kaj bond after a tragedy, it seems there may be a way for these two people to heal one another. But, ex-lovers, family schism, and of course old wounds set the stage for a dramatic and revealing climax. I would have liked to see more development in the conclusion, however Ms. Gilmore-Scott has brought a realistic story that delves into the depth and character of individuals' lives with compassion and skill."},{"Title":"Ties that Bind Way Down Deep","review":"Lots to chew on here.

I like reading novels which deal with characters who are dealing with 'life', good and not so good. Life situations is what this book presented. Not everyone was happy or content and there were some real issues presented by this novel. I could almost feel the pain Kaj experienced when he recounted the story of what severed his relationship with Rodney. Likewise, I could understand how Dana's childhood experiences caused her to be the person she was in the novel ( i.e., no makeup, baggy clothes etc).The author should be commended for fully exploring and developing these issues and the impact it had on the characters. Although some may feel that this is a love story in the traditional sense, I felt that this was a story about the ultimate love, which is self love and ultimately self acceptance. One of my favorite parts was the dialog between Kaj and the homeless man which I felt was the heart of the novel. Although much easier said than done, we have to let go ( or resolve) the past in order to live in the present and the future. Finally, I also loved the the dialog between Kaj and his mother just before Xmas dinner. Good read!"},{"Title":"Ties that Bind Way Down Deep","review":"This book is definately all that.

This book proves that the Biblical evidence supporting Evangelical Protestant teaching is demonstrably stronger than for the other two streams of Christianity.

It is a definite gem to add to any library of reference books for the edification of the Christian faith.Bias, NO, Fervent YES, Pastor Rials in his quest to write a factual reference guide for the common man, has also presented the most legitimate interpretation of scripture I have read in a book of this sort.The previous negative ratings were vengeful words and though justified in their own eyes, do not reflect the love that flows through an honest Christ centered person.I disagree with those who say this book should not make angry the two opposing religions to Protestantism because as the old saying goes, it's the truth that hurts. Facts are facts, no matter how they are delivered and you can't deny them nor can you cushion there affect.You have to live with them and justify them if you can in your own heart and mind. The ecumenical order that is administered within the auspices of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, are shown to be riddled with certain fallacies along with several protestant denominations.I'll bet you the church Fathers don't agree with recent doctrinal changes in the Episcopalian churches concerning Leviticus 18:32, Rom. 1:27 as ordaining ministers!For anyone looking for a truthful reference book and a no nonsense approach to finding their way to salvation without a bunch of legalistic stubling stones, then I say READ THIS BOOK!If you haven't found Christ then use this as a guide to simplicity in the faith and an open door to the cross of Christ. I am a Born Again Christian since 1975 and the Spirit of God witnessed to my spirit in determining the value that this information provides.I will be happy to answer any questions concerning the content of this well written book in regards to the protestant faith.I will not argue with legalism from disgruntled advocates of the Catholic or Orthodox faith, God be your judge!If theres any Catholic parishioners or Orthodox layman who don't know Christ as their personal savior, than that explains the negative controversy that they are trying to interject into these ratings to cause an agnistic attitude of possible new beleivers and subscribers to the Biblical basis of this well written book.maldrich2002@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"While the book does do a good job with a general overview of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox beliefs, it is not very extensive in regards to differentiating between Catholic and Orthodox beliefs.

If you're a fundamentalist evangelical, then this tract that was too big to stuff under a windshield wiper will reinforce every superficial, strawman misconception Brother Jim told you about Catholics and by extension Orthodox (as Mr. Rials would have it). been an on-and-off again visitor (haranguing troll might be more descriptive) in the east-orthodox listserv, though generally unresponsive to sober dialogue. Rather than trying to understand what the Orthodox faith is about, he's been more concerned about sharpening his blade against other Christians who don't believe as he, which would be the vast majority of them. Moreover, he posted a blurb or two from this tract but was rather insistent on clinging to basic errors about Orthodoxy though sober minds adequately demonstrated otherwise. Let's look at a few...Kerby writes:\\"Orthodox practice does use a rosary, but instead of prayers to Mary, it usually prays the Jesus prayer: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\"\\"Factually inaccurate. Did he consult an Orthodox scholar, and if so, whom? Orthodox do NOT use a rosary. Perhaps he was meaning a prayer rope? Surely he could have said \\"prayer rope\\", but rather chose a term to associate Orthodoxy to another scary Catholic practice. Amusingly, he then changes subject and says Orthodox pray to Jesus... and this has what to do with \\"Unique Orthodox beliefs about Mary?\\"Kerby writes:\\"The most popular prayer in Catholicism is about Mary, the \\"Hail Mary.\\" Most Protestants do not use the prayer at all, and it is rarely used in Orthodoxy.\\"Factually inaccurate. Did he consult an Orthodox scholar, and if so, whom? Orthodox sing a hymn to Mary in every Sunday Liturgy.Kerby:\\"Orthodox doctrine agrees with the Catholic that Mary never committed any sin8 but it doesn't accept the Catholic doctrine ofthe Immaculate conception, (that Mary was conceived in her mother's womb without the stain of original sin).\\"Did he consult an Orthodox scholar, and if so, whom? A usual confused mixing of Orthodox and Catholic beliefs. The Orthodox Church does NOT accept the doctrine of original sin... but most Protestants do. Shouldn't this bullet point go under \\"Common Catholic and Protestant Beliefs?\\" What's fascinating is that he supposedly references p.257 of Ware's The Orthodox Church below, yet on p.259 it's clearly written that Orthodox don't accept the doctrine of original sin. Did he really read the book or did he skip past what didn't suit his polemic?Kerby:\\"Mary had a normal marriage and other children.\\"An affirmation not taken by all Protestants since it's not clearly stated in Scripture. Nowhere does it say she had other children. The \\"brothers and sisters\\" of Jesus in Scripture are never identified as offspring of Mary. An outright rejection of the perpetual virginity is held only by the Baptists, Pentecostals, and their offshoots. Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Wesley, and Zwingli held to the Orthodox/Catholic view. None of those traditional Reformed denominations have rejected the perpetual virginity. Not only that, the word used for \\"brother\\" is applied in Scripture to denote non-sibling relationships. The words for \\"brother\\" and \\"cousin\\" in Hebrew and Aramaic were the same, \\"brother\\", and the Greek translations maintained the literal definition. In other words, Aramaic and Hebrew have no word for cousin. Throughout Scripture, we see the word \\"adelphos\\" used for non-brotherly relations - in Gen 14:14 with 11:26-7, Lot, called Abraham's \\"brother\\", is actually his nephew. Jacob is called the \\"brother\\" of his Uncle Laban (Gen 29:10,15). Cis and Eleazar are described as \\"brethren\\", whereas they are really cousins(1 Chron 23:21-2). \\"Brethren\\" is used to denote \\"kinsmen\\" in Deut 23:7; 2 Sam 1:26; 1 Ki 9:13; 2:32; 2 Ki 10:13-14; Jer 34:9; Amos 1:9. Jesus uses \\"brethren\\" in a non-brotherly sense in Mt 23:1,8 and Mt 12:49.Kerby:\\"(Catholic/Orthodox leaders use one Greek word for worship of God (latreia) and three others for veneration of Mary and the saints (proskunesis, dulia and hyperdulia). ) Even Orthodox Bishop Ware says this is a difficult thing: \\"Orthodox theologians clearly make the above distinction between the veneration of Mary and the worship of God by the use of these different Greek words (as is done also by Roman Catholics). However, the strong exaltation and veneration of Mary in words and practices raises the question of whether this clear distinction is always made in the minds of the lay worshippers.\\"\\"The section on the Mother of God is covered on pgs. 257-261 in Ware's book, but this quote isn't there.Kerby:\\"Protestant believe only Jesus redeemed us from our sins.\\"As do Catholics and Orthodox.

There is no place in the Old or New Testament where Christians are found praying to Mary or where they venerate her.\\"I didn't know Mary and Christians were in the Old Testament.And this pedantic exercise can go on for hours.

For example, there was no Hebrew canon before the Jewish council of Jamnia in 90AD. Before that date, there was no official Jewish canon as there were multiple competing Jewish groups. The Sadducees only regarded the five books of the Torah as inspired Scripture -- in fact, that's why they denied the Resurrection of Christ because the prophecy of such couldn't explicitly be found in the Torah (but could be found in Isaiah and 2 Maccabees). The Pharisees embraced a much larger set that included the Apocryphal books found in Catholic and Orthodox bibles. One fourth of the Dead Seas Scrolls is made up of Hebrew versions of the Apocryphal books of Tobit, Letter of Jeremiah, Ecclesiasticus, Psalm 151, 2 Esdras, Judith, Sirach, 1 Enoch, and Jubilees. In other words, the early Christians and pre-Christian Jews were using books that have been arbitrarily thrown out by the extreme end of Protestantism in relatively recent times. These Protestants are not practicing an early Christian faith.What does this prove? That the idea of \\"sola scriptura\\" was not an idea of pre-Christian or even early Christian communities, but can only be found after the year 1500. Before then, as continues to this day, the canon is largely determined by the religious organization as it see fit to edify members according to the traditions and doctrines they wish to impart to those members.Fundamentalist evangelicals would have others believe that the Septuagint was written by pagans or Martians, when in fact it was written by Jews. Every book contained therein was a book used for the edification of Jews during the life of Christ and the Apostles. Hannukah is nowhere to be found except in the Apocryphal book of Maccabees. There are passages in the New Testament where it's written that \\"...which is called in the Hebrew tongue\\", implying that Greek was the base language being used for the OT references. Philo and Josephus, whom no serious Protestant scholar (who's a Christian) would denounce, wrote highly of the Septuagint.The truth is that the NT we recognize today -- the books determined as Scripture by none other than Orthodox Catholics -- has references to the Septuagint and proto-MT Hebrew texts. (Not only that, but a dozen or so OT books are never quoted or alluded to in the NT, which shows how fallacious it is to use the NT as \\"proof\\" on the canonicity of an OT work.) The Masoretic text that Protestants use today and erroneously assume was the exact same text as used by first century Jews actually didn't exist at the time. It was edited and compiled in the middle ages. And before the printing press, you can compare any two handwritten sets and find discrepancies.As far as the supposed \\"multitude\\" of Apocryphal sets, don't forget that the concept of a binded book as we think of it today didn't exist in the early Church nor in pre-Christian society. How books were divided, named, and organized was far from an objective science and often arbitrary. The books recognized as the Apocrypha are the same material regardless of the canon (be it Greek, Russian, Ethiopian, etc.). However, this is all irrelevant. What's important is that those reading and teaching from these books are teaching the same, and in fact that's what you see among the Orthodox Churches. Rather, it's in the Protestant world where supposedly the \\"clear meaning of the Word\\" is followed that you see 30,000+ sects that can't agree on basic doctrines like the nature of Christ and what's required for salvation."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"This book is an excellent and easy to read reference work concerning the Protestant, Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. Each chapter contrasts the teachings of these groups and shows where the so called Orthodox church and Roman Catholic church strays from the explicit teachings of the Bible to form their own traditions. The author gives quotations and ample notes from leading Roman Catholic and Orthodox sources to show from their own words what they believe.The negative reviews for this book are angry at the Scriptural conclusions of this book and not the scholarship. Cries that the book \\"misrepresents\\" the Orthodox or RCC are not valid. As mentioned above, the author gives full quotes and references from RCC and Orthodox scholars themselves."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"The book is very interesting and scholarly. It is well-written, thoroughly researched and answers several questions I and classmates have had regarding the differences in Protestantism and other Christian faiths. My one area of disagreement is that I feel from my heart that prayer--whether for the living or the dead--never hurts. Even if the dead soul is beyond help, the act of unselfish prayer benefits the worshipper simply by the fellowship it creates through the Holy Spirit with the Father.Timely and relevant, this book clearly delineates the differences in the three great churches. Moreover, the author has illuminated, in a simple two word sentence in the chapter on relics, the central theme that unites them, and, indeed, provides the key to life itself: \\"Their faith.\\""},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"To my knowledge no work has ever delved into the subject ofthe three greatest churches in the world. It was extremely interesting and enlightening to read the pages of analysis of these three great church movements in the world. I believe that the insight given to us through this work and the tremendous challenge that it represents to us as faithful communicators of the gospel of Jesus Christ to our world is invaluable to every reader. I wish everyone had a chance to read through the pages of this work and to gain a new insight into the challenges that we face and to the great responsibility we have as 21st century Christians."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"The historical data is indepth and amazingly correct. Very well written. I can find no discrepancies. An invaluable source for those who are curious or want to know the background of certain doctrinal procedures. I think it is absolutely the best. It is wonderful to read a non-confrontational book that delivers the facts. I have had Catholic friends buying this book. They are interested in knowing why they do what they do. They don't look at the book as controversial."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"As said by other reviews, author makes numerous errors and misquotes source. Treatment of non-evangelical Christian is shoddy if not dishonest. This book is directed to stemming growing tide of evangelical converts to Orthodox Church where fullness of true faith in Christ is to be found. (Yes it's true - we worship Christ only and we don't sacrafice babies and drink their blood.)"},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"As a Protestant, I take exception that this work does anything to promote \\"Bible-centered\\" Christianity while \\"the other two guys\\" don't. Statements like that are the height of ignorance and I'm sure this is the sort of writing intended to reinforce the brainwashing one learns in certain church environments. A word to my Catholic and Orthodox brothers and sisters... dime novels like this do not represent the mainstream Protestant point of view. Don't let the fundamentalists shade your view of us."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"There are no other books I have read that covers the subject as well as this one. It has well-documented information I have seen nowhere else. For instance:the four versions of the apocrypha (I thought there was only one), the contradictions between the church fathers, the evidence that all the church fathers until the fourth century (including Chyrsostom and Augustine) were baptized as adults even though raised in Christian homes since infancy.Many religious books are utterly boring and seem to be written by people who delight in big words and showing their own knowledge. Rials seems to have the ability to present these topics in a way that keeps your interest right to the end of the book.I especially was pleased with the way the author starts each chapter with quotes from the various Catholic and Orthodox sources, and lists their reasons for what they believe. This seems fair and unbiased. The latter part of each chapter, of course, presents the evangelical Protestant view, and it is clear that the author is a Protestant, as he gives more space to the Protestant position than he does the other two. Nonetheless, it is not done in a vindictive or biased way, and seems to be a book that anyone could read, Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox, and not be offended. I gave a copy to my brother, who is Catholic, who read the book and liked it.Usually books on religious subjects either are way too \\"politically correct\\" or way too biased. They either try so hard not to say anything offensive that they end up saying nothing, ignoring obvious things, or they are so opinionated that none but their small flock can tolerate them. In that regard \\"The Three Great Churches\\" has succeeded. It clearly presents the heart of the differences in the preface to each chapter. The reader has a good grasp of where the conflict really lies between the three, and then it presents a more detailed explanation of the reason why each of these three churches has taken the position it has.The footnotes were well done and as far as I can tell accurate. The bibliograpy is short and could be expanded, however. I liked the pictures and the charts.As others have said, this is a book that many would do well to have in their libraries, as a reference book, as it allows the reader to quickly find the various views on these topics, quoted verbatim from their own sources.Of course, one of the inherent challenges in a book of this type, is summarizing the protestant position. There are many protestant churches, and they don't all believe the same thing. But the author seems to have covered the main topics where they differ from the Catholic and Orthodox churches, and on these there is a lot of unanimity among the protestant churches. Where there is not, he notes it (for instance, on the subject of infant baptism). Areas where Protestants definitely differ, such as on calvinism vs. arminianism, or charismatic gifts, are not touched on in the book, as they don't bear on the differences between the three main churches.Given that the author is protestant, and evangelical, his conclusions will not likely please extreme Catholics and/or Orthodox, but the average Catholic and Orthodox will find nothing here that is offensive.I recommend the book, and will keep a copy on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"I found this book easy to read, with simple descriptions of the different faiths, so that I can easily understand the differences of the many faiths and how those differences came about. This is an excellent history book and a book of facts, and once I started reading it, it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"Though I'm not Orthodox, I've a deep admiration for the beauty and depth of the Orthodox liturgical life and theology. This is a heavily biased work towards a fundamentalist Christian position and is geared primarily towards polemicizing against Catholics/Orthodox, most likely for fear of those faiths gaining so many recent converts in recent years. A nice attempt, though ultimately the long run has and will be favorable towards the Orthodox faith and its adherents :-)"},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"This is an excellent book which I highly recommend. Even though I have been a serious student of the Bible for over thirty years, I have to say that I learned a lot from this book. The book covers a lot of topics in a concise manner with a multitude of footnotes. I found the comparison of the competing beliefs and practices among the Protestants, Orthodox and Roman Catholics both interesting and disconcerting. As someone with a protestant background, I find it disturbing that these three church traditions are so far apart on so many doctrines and practices. The author, however, lays it all out for us to read, ugly though the differences are, considering that all three traditions profess faith in Jesus Christ and look to the Bible for their beliefs. The author, to my way of thinking, dose a good job of laying out the diferences and then spends time explaingin the biblical basis of why the Protestants don't agree with the Catholics or Orthodox where they differ in doctrine or practice."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"Not really much to add -- the material was really good and clearly presented. Good job with the Apocrypha. As you mentioned, Jesus and the apostles referred to a specific body of books as \\"Scripture,\\" so there was a canon at that time. They endorsed the Hebrew canon when they referred to the Old Testament as \\"the Law and the Prophets\\" (Mt. 5:17; 7:12; 11:13; 22:40; Rom 3:21), and once Jesus called it the \\"Law, Prophets and Psalms\\" (Lk 24:44). This reflects the fact that they used the Hebrew canon and not the Septuagint, which has a different organization (Law, History, Poetry, Prophets). Also in Mt. 22:35 Jesus refers to \\"all the righteous blood shed on earth\\" and defines that as being \\"from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah.\\" This also supports the Jewish canon of the Old testament, because chronologically therewas at least one other prophet murdered after Berechiah -- Uriah (recorded in Jer 26:23). Jesus wasnt speaking chronologically, then, but canonically. Abel's murder is recorded in the first book of the Hebrew canon, and Berechiah's in the last (2 Chr 24:21). Great job, too, with Mary. I would suggest providing a literal Greek translation of Matt 1:25, since the Russian Synodal translation mistranslates it: Purgatory is fine as well. The explanation of 1 Pet 3:18-20 isnt the most convincing Ive read, but it's a hard passage to explain by any interpretation. Wish you lots of success in publishing and distributing the book. I trust it will be a blessing to many."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"It's a good reference book. A lot of my friends are using it for information. Very well researched, and well-documented."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"Although Kerby Rials writes this book from a Protestant point of view, his treatment of the Catholic and Orthodox churches and their beliefs has been carefully researched, and it should be an excellent resource for an objective and fair evaluation of these doctrines. His book was reviewed by several authorities in the Catholic and Orthodox faiths to make certain that his portrayal is accurate. Though Catholics and those of the Orthodox church may not agree with Kerby's conclusions, it should be an interesting study for them to view what Protestants think of their beliefs. I am certain that Kerby would be interested in a thoughtful refutation of his conclusions and especially if his portrayal of Catholic and Orthodox beliefs is inaccurate in any way."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"The book is very practical. Have been teaching through it on Thursday nights to a class of my church members . It should be required reading for candidate ministers and in Bible Schools for that matter. It will enable people to clearly understand how people have been raised and what they think they believe."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"Rials seems to have an inane ability to miss the big picture or ignore the obvious, but then strains a gnat in order to find differences no matter how shallow and irrelevant. There's also a habit to excise important Scriptural passages, even when they are continuous within the same Biblical chapter. An example on the topic of baptism, the author will make note that Acts 2:38 calls us to repent and be baptized and thusly infants shouldn't be baptized because they can't repent. But he leaves out the very next passage, Acts 2:39, which tells us that his command and gifts are for children as well. Together, the passages 28 and 29 read, \\"Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, EVERY ONE of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you AND your CHILDREN and for all who are far off-for all whom the Lord our God will call.\\" The entire two passages are needed, not a hack job. No prohibition can be found in any Scriptural book against baptizing infants, or prior to the Anabaptist movement for that matter. The Christian baptism followed the Jewish custom of initiation by circumcision, in that infants are initiated by baptism/circumcision without a confession of faith but adults are required to make the confession. First century Christians, not burdened with knee jerk anti-Catholic hostility, would have understood this and accepted it as uncontroversial.The author has other hermeneutical issues as well, though it's probable that won't matter if one agrees with his initial assumptions."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"A poor treatment of non-fundamentalist Christianity.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"Book lists supposed references, but when you dig a bit deeper it's apparent that name-dropping rather than accurate citations is at play.

It was helpful to me when discussing religious topics with people at my church. It is very well done. Everyone has an opinion about their own church, and of course they believe it is the right one.

It is fair in presenting the arguments of each of the churches, right from their own books and then presents the Protestant point of view very well. This is not the kind of book you read and then get rid of at a garage sale or give away because it has a lot of information that is good to have around for reference. I really like that the author is not mean in any way in what he writes. I can't say that for many people who like to run down other churches. Anyone can read this and not have their feelings hurt, because it just presents the facts and leaves it up to the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. Of course he is a protestant and that comes through. I like also the history in the book of the filioque controversy, the sign of the cross, the hesychasm councils, infant baptism, the seventh ecumenical council and so on. It was very interesting and entertaining. I think all Christians woudl benefit from reading this book. As the apostle Paul said, \\"let each one be fully convinced in his own mind\\" (Romans 14). Everybody may not reach the same conclusions, but it will at least allow for some common ground. I like especially the chapter on division in the body of Christ. I agree that real Christians are united by their faith in the Lord, and I also don't believe that there is only one true church (Catholic, Baptist, or what have you). Everyone who walks with God in repentance and faith is a Christian and a member of Christ's body, regardless of where they go to church on Sunday. I recommend this book, although some things could be changed. There is no index to it, and in some places the author's opinions are a little too obvious, but just the same it is far better than many religious books I have seen. It is understandable and clear and takes a unique approach. The charts and photographs are nice. That is what makes the book special -- there really isn't anything else like it out there."},{"Title":"The Three Great Churches: Comparing the Beliefs of Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox","review":"I found this book extremely well documented and especially loved the way the book flowed.

Iliad, the war poem, is the literary factory of serveral different characters. Before the poet, mankind was massified and static. The millenial eastern civilization built the vast amorphous massive population and the suffocant impression of immobility. The halted millennia. Iliad as opposing mass colective fate offers Aquilles the supreme individual.Cruising the rarefied atmosphere of the war our hero, Achilles the somber, enraged or gentle, driven by a solely purpose, obstinately pursues the aim of his life: be the bravest and most famous of the greeks, rather Achaeans, later Hellenes. For a brief moment he recalcitrates, halts, thinks about leaving the warfare. Nevertheless the dark grimace of revenge loudly call him back to the 'agon' under a fierce fight. Surrounded by Achaeans but absollutelly alone in his quest. Created on the battlefield gives no truce to his enemies, being Trojans, Greeks or even Gods. Maximal expression of individuality the Peleu's son fights for himself, for glory, not for homeland or moral maxim. Authentically expresses what we call pride or even vanity. Exposed to the mankind and to gods, everything suffers without resorting to cynicism or escuses. Devoid of all sympathy of men and gods, goes Achilles: brave, vain, whatever it is, does not matter. Achilles did not waive paternity of his own actions. Thus pure self implies total responsibility.Finally, quoting Goethe.

The Samuel Butler version, by the way, which I have in The Great Books (Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., 1952), IS a prose translation. I just wanted a copy of it on my Kindle, but after getting over being pissed at the false advertizing I found myself really enjoying the music of Homer's muse through the words of Edward, Earl of Derby. It's rendered in very good Shakespearean blank verse iambic pentameter and seems faithful to the ancient Greek original.Of course the scanning technology used for e-readers so far doesn't understand verse or line breaks, so that it looks like prose at first, until you see that the first word of every line of verse is capitalized. An editor would have to go through the OCR scans and put in the line breaks and that would cost money, so let's not bitch about a free book. You soon get into the Earl's rhythm and your brain automatically inserts the line breaks.

She has already decided she will marry the young and handsome viscount, Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. She loves poetry, he loves poetry. And he seems to be as much in lover with her as she is with him. So Nicola feels everything is going well when Lord Sebastian proposes to her. That is, until Nathaniel Sheridan, Nicola's best friend's brother, questions the viscount's character and motivation in marrying her. Nicola is convinced though that Nathaniel is just making pointless accusations. But, what if Nathaniel is right, and Lord Sebastian has an ulterior motive for marrying her? It's up to Nicola is piece together the facts and find the truth, and to also search her heart to figure out who she really is in love with...The fifth book of the series, \\"Nicola and the Viscount\\" is an Avon True Romance for teenage girls. And even though this book is first and foremost a romance novel, there is plenty of intrigue, humor, and excitement to entertain a variety of teens.Nicola is a very interesting character, far from being perfect. I thought that Meg Cabot made Nicola's fascination and infatuation with the viscount very realistic. It's very often that many young woman mistake love with a physical attraction. Yes, Lord Sebastian was handsome but it was not until later on that Nicola truly poses the important questions. Besides his physical appearance, what dis she REALLY love about him? As we go through the book, we can see a change come through Nicola as she realizes that the truth is that she and the viscount had very little in common. Then there's Nathaniel who's such a tease and much like an annoying brother, but later on Nicola comes to realize that they just might be perfect for each other. The ending is so sweet and I assure you that you'll like it!If all the other Avon True Romance novels for teens are anything like \\"Nicola and the Viscount\\", I'm definitely picking up another in the series! So far, \\"Catherine and the Pirate\\" and \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\" are my favorites."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"This book is a great read. It is perfect for teenage girls. The wonderful, witty, sarcastic writing style of Meg Cabot brings the well developed charecters to life.Nicola Sparks dreams of nothing but having the 'God' (Lord Sebastian Bartholomew) propose to her. She is the typical 16 year old girl. Idealistic, excitable, and seeems to have a wonderful fashion sense that brings much humor to the book. Especially Nicola's thought on the daily attire of her not so cherised cousin, Harold, whom she nicknamed 'Milksop'.Nathaniel Sheridan is... very... surprising. Some of the things he does in the story are very sudden unexpected, and some of them even made me embarassed for him. The witty hater of poetry casts doubts on Nicola's engagement to Lord Sebastian and infuriates Nicola to no end with his remarks and critisism.Nicola is annoyed by Nathaniel's doubts on Lord Sebastian and sets out to prove him wrong. In the process, she discovers a few things that change her mind about her engagement and Nathaniel...It is a wonderful read. I highly recommend it to any fans of Meg Cabot. Craftily written, it combines romance, humor, mystery, and even a little bit of action and adventure in one intriguing story that will hold you till the end. Very sweet ending.

Reading over what I've said, it sounds very patronising, but I'm a big Cabot fan. Love 'The Princess Diaries' 1-3. Was a little disappointed in the 4th, yes, but despite tone, I really do like the book. OK, I'll begin:I almost enjoyed 'The Princess Diaries: Mia goes Fourth'. 'All-American Girl' was disappointing. Luckily, Cabot almost simaltaneously releases a delightful bit of froth that does exactly what it tells you it will.A book cited as 'teen historical romance' isn't expected to be very deep, and because it's 'teen' there's got to be quite a few less 'heaving bosoms' etc than adult romance. The 'historical' part is a bit of a laugh. A nod to London society and a little history of the train is meant to warrant this at a guess.The romance is quite, quite charming, being quite, quite light and quite, quite predictable, which is always comforting.The plot is rather incredible (in the sense that it's not believable), although Cabot paints a mean hunk. Her male protagonists are droolworthy to say the least. Her main character, Nicola, is meant to appeal to us as the intelligent bimbo type, but is - generally speaking - just annoying. You get that though, and overall, this is a charming bit of froth that doesn't pretend to be anything else. Refreshing. If you want something heavier, try 'Les Liasons Dangereaux'. Or chocolate cake. Mmmmm. Chocolate. ..."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"I was utterly disappointed by this book.

Don't get me wrong, it was ingeniously written (like all of Cabot's work), but I'm just saying that it gets a little boring to those romantics at heart.

Her choice has already been made: a handsome viscount known to Nicola as the \\"God\\" Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. Nicola is sure that she made the right choice.

Entertaining, fun, adorable, all the right amounts of romance, humour, and suspense. This is the kind of light chicklit historical romance that you'd think so many should be able to pull off, but they don't. I LOVE the element of the love interest whom she's known her whole life and is too stupid to see right in front of her and oblivious to the fact that he's falling in love with her. There is nothing particularly surprising about the plot and characters, it's just all done so well that you wonder why others can't replicate, why something so simple that can produce such delight isn't replicated more often. Hilarious, warm, consistently entertaining, this made me smile the whole way through and I absolutely fell in love with Nicola and her..for the purposes of not spoiling the plot, let's just say her man.

Then I got so involved into the story that I had to finish it at once(in one day)! It's quite different from the style of writing in The Princess Diaries, because Meg Cabot used more difficult words in this book but not writing in English and slangs in a diary style. I don't think Nicola is 'annoying', she is a quite intelligent lady indeed! I think girls can relate to her because most girls like to romantizise love like Nicola does. She finally realizes that the very handsome guy she has a crush on is not her true love, but should be an other guy she really loves. The climax is a twist because I didn't think the 'God' is so shallow,although he is so gorgeous and always talks honey to Nicky. He really disappointed me. I would like to read Victoria and the Rouge too but I couldn't see it in the book shop! And I am looking forward to the new Princess Diaries book which should come out in July !

A really quick read when you want something fun and light to read.

She does somewhat rely on friends to take her in, so she can go to all the amazing social outings that they had back in the day. Her best friend Eleanor and family are wonderful and take good care of her. Both girls have a crush on the God (yes they refer to him as this,P please rolled my eyes.) Nicola is naive, and after one thing because of her station, a man well not any man the God to be exact. She is not a very deep person, very in the moment, proper, shallow, but she does get a little better, and the story is still a good story. Eleanor, is a little more grounded but not much, they are both just silly girls and typical for the time period. The god is gorgeous, and a little to agreeable in my opinion, but for good reason. The characters and the story are both written really well and were fun to read.

This is just such a book and I enjoyed it thoroughly.Nicola Sparks is a gently bred sixteen-year-old orphan of small means, possessed of an indomitable spirit and a keen sense of fashion. Having just completed their course of studies at Madame Vieuxvincent's Seminary for Young Ladies, Nicola and her dear friend, the Honorable Miss Eleanor Sheridan, are preparing to embark on the London Season of 1810. Nicola sees herself as 'a thistle on the wind, blown about by life.' She is, however, a thistle with a lively intelligence and a plan to capture the heart of 'the God,' also known as Lord Sebastian Bartholomew, Viscount Farnsworth, one of the most eligible bachelors in London. To that end, she has accepted an invitation from her school friend, Lady Honoria Bartholomew, to spend the London season with the Bartholomew family.Once in London, Nicky's plan begins to enfold just as she had envisioned. Lord Sebastian seems more than a little interested in her. Surely a marriage proposal is in the offing? The only thing not perfect in Nicky's world is one Nathaniel Sheridan, Eleanor's annoying, if exceedingly handsome and intelligent, older brother. His dark hints that Lord Sebastian is not all that he seems have Nicky fuming. Then Nicola uncovers a plot to destroy her home and it is Nat Sheridan who proves himself her friend and ally. Is is possible that Nat was right about Sebastian all along? And could she have set her sights on the wrong young man?"},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"I bought this for a gift for a 13 year old girl and she was thrilled. She loves this author so I bought her numerous books from Meg Cabot. It made her Christmas. She loves to read and I gave her plenty of reading material to last her... for about a week. :) She doesn't put the books down until she's done reading them."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"This is a historical book for teens, and is definitely a take-off of Jane Austen in many ways. The time period is the early 1800s and the young women of that era (those about 16 or 17) are already seeking husbands and becoming engaged. Nicola, an orphan, is no different. She has become engaged to one of the most eligible bachelors in town - Lord Sebastian. But, is the fair-haired Lord all he seems? The book is part mystery, a part growing-up tale, and a cutesy romance. I really enjoyed Nicola and her headstrong ways, and she was a lot of fun because she spoke her mind and did what she wanted. I loved the old-fashioned way of writing, but Cabot definitely interlaced the book with a lot of modern humor. For instance, Nicola has just completed a finishing school for women, and tries desperately to fulfill the duties of a proper lady. She is hardly ever successful, and Cabot uses almost ever social outing of Nicola's to inject humor over her lack of ladylike qualities. A really different approach from Meg Cabot and a really cute book for female readers."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"A fan of Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries, I expected to get the same or similar type of writing or style in Meg Cabot's other teen romances. But this is like reading a book by someone else. It doesn't have the bite or wit of the Princess Diaries, and sounds like any of the many regency romance novels sold at supermarkets. I hate to feel this way about any of Meg Cabot's books, but even as a regency novel for teens, it was not as good as other regency novels."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"What a change of pace from Ms. Cabot's delightfully pithy and fresh Princess Diaries books! But Ms. Cabot proves she can work within the romance-fiction format, and writes a nice tale set in Regency England. The book tells the tale of Nicola, a teenage lass caught between the man she has a crush on, and the man whose opinion she realizes she values above all others. What's a girl to do? The book doesn't quite seem authentic, as Nicola has far more freedom than ladies in England likely did at the time. The excuse given is that she's an orphan, and so is given more leeway by society's leaders--but really, they'd have been far more likely to ostracize someone without a powerful family to back her than they would be to smile indulgently at such escapades as Nicola's. But oh well, it does allow Nicola to get into and out of some fun situations. The climax is a bit forced and incredible, and the romantic conflict isn't as strong as it could have been (all is forgiven too easily, really), but all in all, the book is a fun read."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"This one was ok but it wasn't really anything to get excited over. The romantic plot line was a lot like the one in The Princess Diaries which was ok with me. I wanted to smack the heroine a couple of times but I did like the overall plot of the book. It's worth a read if you like Meg Cabot or the Avon True Romance line."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"it was great how she ended up loving Nat, at the end it really gave it a good twist i loved this book!i couldnt put it down.i would recamend it to everyone"},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"I would label this as a poor man's Jane Austen, or more accurately: an introduction to Ms. Austen's works for young women.The story is surprisingly captivating and the novel takes an unexpected more adventerous turn towards the end as Nicola unravels a dangerous plot for industrial progress.Ms. Cabot has already proved herself able to enthrall the hearts of young women all over the world with her bestselling Princess Diaries series and this Avon True Romance is no exception. It will introduce teens (and younger) to the language of the time and prepare them for more intense works by authors who wrote about the time period (see Charlotte Bronte, Ann Radcliffe, Fanny Burney, Emily Bronte, Ms. Oliphant, Maria Edgeworth, Anne Bronte, and Jane Austen).All in all, it was a fun read but the tacky cover art is an abomination to such an otherwise decent novel."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"This book can't hold a candle to the other Avons. Those books are full of passion, romance, adventure, and great heroines and heroes. This was a catty, historically inaccurate story with just about the most annoying protagonist on the history of the planet. Lets explain:The Protagonist: Ohhh...poor old Nicola Sparks. An orphan who manages to live a luxurious lifestyle. She is, for lack of a better word, (sorry for language) a bitch. She is catty and really annoying. Everyone is so jealous of her total perfection. She is a master seamstress, and EVERYONE is dying to wear her clothing. She has perfect skin, and perfect hair. She also, manages to be great a stealing things and spying on people. She gives everyone good tongue lashings, and just seems to speak better than everyone. She is extremely ladylike yet manages to be still somewhat of a tomboy, and in short, is just prettier, braver, smarter, a better sewer than anyone else.The style: The book is a typical Meg Cabot. The protagonists are catty little control freaks and their friends are just all so in awe of them. She is obsessed with poetry and always expects men to declare their undying devotion to her. The book seems like it was written now, but with historical type words in it and details such as dresses to make it more period.Yet, it manages to completely butcher the era and make it sound like a frilly, prudish sort of time period where Nicola is the only one who manages to have any modern ideals. From first words, it seems fairly period. The dialogue is alright, the prose could be worse. Then, as you read more into it, it seems to get worse. Nicola, in completely public places, kisses, right in front of everyone, 2, count e'm, 2 boys in the entirety of the novel. Almacks seems like a modern dance club, just with ladies with frilly dresses floating around and everyone saying the word \\"shall\\".This is an utter failure of a book that made me want to just kill the characters as I read more into it. Don't read it or the other Avon by Meg Cabot. She can't write historical.You want some good Regency Avon True Romance? Go pick up Anna and the Duke. That book is great."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"This book surprised me because Meg Cabot generally writes more modern themed books. That is one of the reasons I got it, to see if Cabot wrote another excellent book. I was happy to see that she had! Nicola and the Viscount is about an orphan girl named Nicola who lives in the late 1800s. She is madly in love with a gentleman named Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. When she learns that Lord Sebastian isn't quite who she thought he was, she doesn't know what to do.This book was nicely written and the story was good, but it lacked excitement. Everything just happens to fit into place perfectly, when she is in danger there just happens to be somebody there to save her. Theres no feeling of, \\"OMG whats going to happen next!\\" like there is in most of Cabots books.Luckily, that is my only complaint! Another great book by Cabot!"},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"Being a huge fan of Cabot's other books (The Princess Diaries, 1-800-Where-R-U, and the Mediator - both written under pseudonames), I was tempted to check this one out too. It isn't as great as her other books, because of it's setting (1810, London) it lacks Meg's funny, pointed sarcasm.Nicola Sparks is an orphan, but she thinks it's okay (because she never met her parents, she can't feel as bad about missing them, as she puts it). Her and her best friend Elenor both think Lord Sebastian \\"The God\\" is dashing, and Nicola gets to meet him during a stay at his familys house. Soon enough, Nicola and Sebastian are head over heels in love. But Nathaniel, Elenor's brother, feels that he's up to no good, and tells Nicola so. Even though she doesn't believe him, she checks things out for herself, and sure enough, he isn't who she thought he was.This book's good, but I recommend The Princess Diaries or When Lightning Strikes more than this book."},{"Title":"Nicola and the Viscount","review":"I recently got interested in Avon True Romance books by my best friend, who's quite a romantic. She recommended me Anna and the Duke, Emily and the Scot, and Victoria and the Rogue. I bought this book because, when I read the back, it sounded quite good and also because it is written by Meg Cabot, author of the Princess Diaries series and Victoria and the Rogue. I personally thought that Victoria and the Rogue was one of the best books in the Avon True Romance series thus far, and because Meg Cabot is such a great writer I thought Nicola and the Viscount would be a good read, too. I was wrong. Nicola did not have a personality whatsoever, and the plot wasn't as good as Victoria and the Rogue. However, you may think otherwise. Buy Nicola and the Viscount (if you have not already done so) and read for yourself.

Easy to look things up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that \\"Oliver will not be asking for more\\" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow. The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work.

I have listened to it also on Audio CD more than a few times. I occasionally just listen to any randomly selected track(s) at any randomly selected part of the story in it's unabridged version.I was excited to hear it in an abridged version and with several persons portraying the various characters.As much as I love the unabridged reading of the story; I was quite pleased with the acting out of the story in this radio-presentation-like recreation of Great Expectations.It was refreshing that Pip's dialogue was a faithful recreation of the actual text due to him being the character telling the story; so the Dickens' wonderful wordsmithing was not lost.It is a great story for all ages, to listen and learn to love; and I hope for their sake, to encourage them to read the story in its entirety."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I bought this book on Amazon about a year or so ago & just was really turned off by how much writing they cramed into even one page & the font is pretty small, it turned me off to the point that I never did even read the book, to those that did, hope it was good."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"A great reading but the sixteen discs are not labeled as to chapters on the disc nor are there any liner notes.

She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness. The consequences of these acts varies greatly. Dickens seems to be unconcerned with passing judgement on the acts themselves, instead he prefers to humor himself by exploring of their unpredictable outcomes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens explores various sides of human nature in Great Expectations, as he tells the story of Pip, a common, lower-class, laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman. Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend.A very well written story, Great Expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations reveals the life of an orphan, Pip, who is alone in a desolate world even though he lives with his sister. Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life. This novel, in all its intensity is filled with details that make reading enjoyable and very realistic. Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Thirteenth of Dicken's four major novels, Great Expectations has the most dramatic and gripping start that unfolds a story that drives eagerly forward, full of emotion and humor and many unforgettable characters. As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip. But after some years, when i'm reading it again, now i can see it like Dickens do... It's a novel that anybody can selfexplain on any time of his life. If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book. If you haven't already read it, you should."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"All that can be expected from great English classic is here.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times. Though by no means a cliff-hanger, the work is suspenseful and the reader's interest is expertly sustained throughout.Extremely well written, peppered with tongue in cheek humour, this archetypal novel is strongly recommended to any audience, particularly in audio form."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I needed to purchase 3 books at one time for my daughters high school assignment, I was given a \\"short\\" notice.

I think its awful that I was forced to read what amounted to an 18th century serial out of a tabloid.The reason the book is filled with so much meaningless drivel is that Dickens was paid for each installment and the longer the series lasted the longer he had a steady job, At least thats my theory. I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her.

Like the title, Great Expectations were had, but not realized. None of the characters were likable, there was no character growth, and it rambled. I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point.

My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens most famous books. Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens.

He was wrong, because the social class division leaves Pip a worker, and Estella was a lady.

Pip has no idea of who is benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.

Great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes, the Character and the writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book is affection, loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The Character of Pip made me feel quit e sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous.

It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off).

This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining.

It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear.

Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before.

The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story.

And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you.

Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens.

Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book in high school years ago and just recently read it for the second time.

I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Every high school kid who has written a review complaining about this book being boring should be boiled with their own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through their heart!Well, thats from A Christmas Carol but you get my point.This book is just great, you can't get any better than it except for maybe David Copperfield.

I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Do not give this book as a gift.

Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on.

The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books.

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night.

Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer.

I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise.

I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored.

Never! So when you're teacher asks you to read this book, don't do it. Read the Cliff Notes or watch the Wishbone version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Almost every negative review about this book was made by a 15 year old 9th grader. I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down.

A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact.

I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action.

No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing.

It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered.

AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman.

We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book.

Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same.

He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear.

The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"After having finished the novel and feeling uncertain as to what was meant by the ambiguous ending, I did some research in some critical journals. Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin. I won't be buying anything further from them in the future."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had thought of reading this book many times and am glad I finally gave it a read.

It was not predictable like so many modern stories."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I just read this book for school (10th grade) and really enjoyed it. It definitely was tough to get through a few of the chapters, but overall I really liked it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is a great classic. One of my favorite books by Dickens.A book everyone should read at least once....(though you will probably read it more than once!!!!)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully. Just reread it and I absolutely loved the story. The depth of the characters is amazing. You feel like you have know them all of your life. Much more enjoyable now than at the high school level."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I cannot fathom how this novel only has a rating of 3 stars. It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch.

The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well.

If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I have never read a more stupendously boring book.It's almost 500 pages long and has a story that could be told in half that.A poor, young orphan has aspirations to one day be a respectable gentleman.Big deal.

We had &quot;Great Expectations&quot; before the matinee last week. The matinee was &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse.&quot; It was Martian Thanksgiving, so &quot;Awful (great (yeah right!)) Expectations&quot; was a good choice, because it is so freakin' long, and low in cholesterol. I am on a strictly bad classics diet. The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast.

Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this.

It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.

If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is Charles Dickens classic novels that portrays the story of Pip, born into a destitute and poor family, with little hope for a bright future. We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time. Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining.

This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I have now listened to three of the five available Dickens' readings from Martin Jarvis and, whilst there are other fine readers out there (e.g. Robert Whitfield for Blackstone Audio Books and Patrick Tull for Recorded Books), I truly don't think there is a finer performer in this particular market.As Great Expectations unfolds through a vast range of character voices, Mr Jarvis' obvious empathy with the text makes this an effortless yet utterly engaging way for the listener to experience the genius of Dickens, whilst Amazon's price makes this item an absolute bargin.I cannot recommend Great Expectations read by Martin Jarvis highly enough..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Over the last few years, every other book I've read has been Dickens.

If you are new to Dickens, this would be a great place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Great Expectaitons&quot; deserves to be called great. While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had to do a report on Great Expectations, and this audio cassette helped me out so much.

It lacks some of the comic energy of his earlier works, but makes up for it with a compelling story, characters, and haunting images: the convict on the moor, the decaying wedding cake, the frigid Estella, honest Joe. This is painful, thoughtful material. See if you can find an edition that contains both the original ending and the rewritten, happier one. Both are wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is a magnificent metaphor of humanity vs. life. It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I found that this novel was quite wonderful, really.

I realized Pip's selfishness once the wealth settled on him, and realized his turn-a-bout after losing everything to his name.

I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone.

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury. Also look for the edition with the forward by Irving and the original ending.Check them out and buy while prices are cheap!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations read by Michael Page, unabridged on 16 audio CDs, was a great listening experience. I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad. The audio book was produced by Brilliance Audio of Grand Haven, Michigan. The bio on the box says that Michael Page is a Professor of Theater at Calvin College. I was impressed and entertained by his reading. He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape\\"\\"Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before--more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle\\"\\"There either is or is not, that's the way things are. The colour of the day.

I'm not going to tell you the story the way it happened. I'm going to tell it the way I remember it.\\"Overall:Beautiful and one of its kindRecommended?Yes, to everyone.

We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book.

Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life.

I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you. I enjoyed this story and recomend you read (reread) this enlighting story of growing up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great book!

Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read.

But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome.

Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.\\"Great Expectations\\" is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called \\"Great Expecations\\" his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the \\"Masterpiece\\" of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is an exciting story dramatically done in this audio presentation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Many people may find Charles Dicken's \\"Great Expectations,\\" dated, due to it's time period and its flowery 19th century language. True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose.

A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination.

I decided explore the classics. Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also.

However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic.

But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy.

However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family.

After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

Of course, the moral of the story is, even when you have everything you want, money still cannot buy you love nor necessarily happiness.Other than that, this is yet another one of Charles Dickens' reads, that is classical, and will help expand on your vocabulary, and build on reading comprehension. My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Really good book.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"* * * * * * * * *&quot;Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of ourtears, for they are rain upon the blinding dustof earth, overlying our hard hearts.

Dicken's &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called &quot;Great Expecations&quot; his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading.

First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today.

My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild.

Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Read the review from the high school student who thinks he's a martian, and I think you'll agree that most of the bozos who give this novel less than five stars are full of snot."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book.

And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good.

While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers. Oh, and by the way, if you don't have to read it for school, I highly recommend you listen to the audio tape."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations.

However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"One of the best books I've read to date.

The story begins with Pip visiting his parents' grave sites. Here he meets a runaway convict and begins a new journey. The convict persuades young Pip to get food and a file for him. Pip does and the convict is thankful, but later is captured and confesses that he alone stole the food. Pip is sent for by Miss Havisham, a middle-aged woman whose whim it is to live in the bridal dress she wore on the day she was jilted by her lover. She hates all males and sends for Pip to enjoy the sight of him being tormented by Estella, a proud, beautiful young girl. Pip falls in love with her. Pip's sister dies before he comes of age, and Pip receives money from an unknown benefactor. During this time he learns about himself, his love for Estalla, and the unknown benefactor. This book is about a young mans life who has a few unique experiences and what he learns.Charles Dickens uses imagry that takes the form of real objects. The detail and words he uses gives more meaning and detailed images. It allows each situation to be clearly seen. The imagery also comes from the analogies and metaphors. It gave the book more life, more meaning.

Dickens was so against some of the evils of his time that he had to do something to speak out against them. And he did. He represents in the lives of his characters the thousands of children forced into inhumane working conditions. And that is just one of wrongs he set out to correct. Carefully read, Dickens provides countless details of English life with its evils and triumphs.

But I'll say this, Great Expectations is one of the most compassionate novels a person can read.

The story itself teaches us to never give up hope and that our destiny does not depend on our social status; but rather, the quality of our character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is a very interesting book to read, from the beginiing scene with Pip at the graveyard to the touching ending of Pip with Estella, Charles Dickens has described wonderfully the plot and all the characters involved and how they all finally fit into place.

I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again!

One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it.

But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages.

First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads.

I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more. A lot more about the novel and a lot more about your own self.We all have Great Expectations, and this one by Dickens beats them all!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb.

After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on. Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself.

Michael Page is one of those rare narrators who can bring male and female characters to life with equal credibility."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable.

In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park.

One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???).

Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important.

It takes some getting use to the style and manner of expression. I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have.

The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions. The notes are a useful addition, as is the introduction by Angus Calder. A brilliant read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"What a wonderful masterpiece.

One Christmas, Pip accidentally crosses paths with a criminal on the run and he provides the criminal with supplies---under duress, but he does it and doesn't give the guy up. Years pass, and Pip begins spending time with the lonely Miss Havershim on her derelict estate with her daughter, Estella. Pip falls in love with Estella, but like her mother, Estella claims she cannot return anyone's love.When Pip enters young adulthood, he discovers that any anonymous benefactor has given him a large sum of money and moves him from the colorful and calm fields of the country to the dreary dampness of London, and a life of sophistication.Through this adventure, Pip explores his sense of integrity, his values, and the depth of his faith in the goodness of others."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Like practically every other American student, I encountered Dickens's \\"Great Expectations\\" (hereafter GE) in an abridged version in junior high, then the complete text when I was much older. In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free.

This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power.

Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling.

The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't.

I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts.

I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations.

(So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE).

It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that.

The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader.

Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way.

Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders.

While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read!

It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending.

His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received.

I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully.

They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending.

The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love.

However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate.

Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas.

Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did.

Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Hi, Great Expectations is probably (besides David Copperfield) my favorite Dickens novel. I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself.

It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works.

Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it.

Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

It was the best book that I read in my junior year, it wasn't required reading, BUT IT SHOULD BE! And Miss Havisham and Estella!

To me, it is not dissimilar to David Copperfield in its themes; however, David Copperfield moves me to tears every time I read it.I came across an original review of Great Expectations at The Atlantic Monthly's website. The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine.

It will give you a whole new prespective of love, family, and yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"It's rather amusing to read some of the comments -- obviously written by people (i.e. teenagers) forced to read it for sophomore English class. Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21.

It is beautifully done.

I recently had that experience with one of my favorite books, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which was so appallingly read by a horrible ham, I would have thrown the CDs out the car window if they hadn't belonged to my local library.This GREAT EXPECTATIONS is probably the best \\"book on CD\\" I've ever heard. Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My biggest complaint concerning many audio books is that they're poorly narrated--often in monotone, or with one character's dialog sounding much like the others. Not here though--this version is expertly narrated.

I first read the story in high-school and immediatly fell in love with Dicken's eloquent style. His descriptions of Pip's surroundings, emotions and experiences never fail to capture my imagination and tug at my heart. Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius. Great Expectations provides a nice into into his style and prepares readers for his more challenging stories.The story is long, and detailed but extremely captivating.

I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book. I was 15 when i first read this book, and have since read it again and it is probably my favorite book of all time. Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull. If you can, it will probably become one of your alltime favorites."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \\"must read\\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"As I complete my reading effort of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations I feel both satisfied and enriched. This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella.

With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \\"classics\\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Much easier to read and get into than A Tale of Two Cities.

I guess it's just a case of \\"too each his own\\". I'm sure there are some books that I would think were terrible that others rave about. Having said that, I loved this book. I don't know why it took me so long to read it. I've been reading a lot of classics lately - mainly classics that my son is reading or will have to read for homeschool this year. For some reason I thought this book was on his list, but later, after I was in the middle of the novel, realized it wasn't. No matter. I'm very glad that I read it. I was surprised by how involved I became with the characters and the book when I was reading it. I couldn't put it down. I thought a book by Charles Dickens was going to be dry and boring. How wrong I was. I actually found myself grieving with the characters. I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed. Some of the language and unusual expressions that are used in the book can be difficult, but, if you are a fairly well read person, you should be able to do fine. Great book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much i did like it. Usually the books that they force you to read i don't enjoy. Although this was never forced on me during high school, i know it is a popular book on high school curriculum. I found that i loved it and has become one of my favorites. I really liked the storyline and thought the characters were enjoyable. I will definitely have to pick up more of Dickens' works.SPOILER: a lot of people didn't like the new ending that Dickens wrote, saying it is too happy and that the original depressing ending was superior. I actually didn't like the original ending and didn't find the newer one to be too joyous. I read the new ending as Pip being doomed to always love Estella, making it more depressing than the original. Anyway, that was my take."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens could put in some really cool surprises for the plot through his books, and this one is no different. When Pip learns who his benefactor is... whoo! I suppose some of the surprises could be predicted if you read enough, but it still makes for an interesting story, and especially good for the time it was written in.I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book truly shows how well written a novel can be.I read this book for school, for all those who are having to read this book for school, I reccomend reading it beforehand because not doing so means finding the book dull and unnatractive while answering all the tedious questions that can ruin a book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes.

I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's.

There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup, that falls madly in love with a young lady name Estrella. He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

This typical Dickens, great characters, several plot twists, and a lot of description. For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review. Totally uncalled for, caught me on a bad day. Everybodys different and everyone has their own opinions and just because someone else doesn't like something is no reason to put them down. Its just frustrating because these kids reviews always say the same thing, &quot;this sucked&quot;, or &quot;this was boring&quot; and thats all they can say about it. But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book. It's totally awesome.Charles described the people and places so well, it's like its real and your there with everybody.Pip and Estella's love story might be the greatest love story in history.

You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially \\"working out\\" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction.

But I don't see why that's necessary."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickins is a really good book. I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.)

It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"...this book and I are!

I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak.

I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book.

I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other.

Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again.

Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book.

Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students.

There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story.

Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect.

We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!! (well, a little bit for me because i read the book wuite quickly, seeing as how i loved it) i kept saying betwixt instead of between, which i enjoy saying now because it makes me feel smarter than evryone else (jk).... anyway, i was the single person in my class that absolutely LOVED this book... the only thing that i didn't like was taking EXTENSIVE nots throughout the book, which ruins many of the other books we read (such as the amazing lord of the flies).... aside from that, the book is quite good... not only is dickens able to hold my attention through most of the book (when i say most, i;m excyuding the part where they are planning that escape with provis, which i thought was boring), which is a huge feet for someone such as charles dickens, who i expected to bore the living daylights out of me... overall, the plot is very good, but the messages that it carries are even better... pip is driven by greed all throughout the book, until he becomes mentally ill... when he realizes what he's done, he becomes a new person, and is at peace with himself... the realationship between him and estella is very complex, too.. until very late in the book, he is captured by her beauty, he partakes in a blind love for her. by the end of the novel, after all he has been through with her, he gains a true love for her based on her qualities, not because she is rich and beautiful.. this love was always there, he just did not uncover the exactness of it until he grew as a person through his sever low. so many vivid characters, i can't even explain how good the characterization is int he book... IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, READ IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED LATER ON!!!!!! if you can, read it twice, as i plan to (probably next summer, so it isn't so fresh in my mind)... group discussion on the book really accentuate the meaning of the book... the meaning is really deep, and most people don't catch all of it. the lake is much deeper than the top of the seaweed, don't be afraid to plunge to the bottom...though this book did not completely enlighten me and totally change my life, i did learn from it, which is something that rarely comes in spades. in this case it comes in spades, hearts, diamons AND clubs...enough rambling for me, im sure your not even going to read that whole review, it was quite long...review in a nutshell: good book with good messages (plural) and an engrossing plot... READ IT!!!!!other good books: bleak house by dickens (my man), heart of darkness by joseph conrad, farhenheit 451 by ray bradbury, lord of the flies by william golding, siddartha by herman hesse (not many people have read this, WHY?!?!!?!?!??!), don quixote by cervantes, old man and the sea by earnest hemmingway... can't think of any more off the top of my head... oh yeah, dracula by bram stoker...thank you, good bye"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions.

It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it. When I googled it, I found that Dickens often changed the endings of his books in to go with the times..... not a big fan of that!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I just graduated with a Literature degree and, amazingly, had never read anything by Dickens. I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome.

This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman.

It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead. Pip has many scary and shocking experiences throughout this novel. It really shows how much Pip changes throughout the novel, from being poor to being a gentlemen, and at last realizing what really matters.Pip is an interesting and exciting character, who really makes the best of this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations because my Accelerated English teacher made us. I do not think the novel was very well thought out and was much too indecisive in many parts. Dickens did not seem to know really what he wanted to do with the plot. He even made two endings!!! He was much too descriptive and that made the story even more boring than its story line made it in the first place. I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have.

It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books.

Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again.

I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on.

I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you....

I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I had to do this for school.

It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat!

Who needs food?\\" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"My grandad recommended I read this. I will admit to being very skeptical on the first few pages. I had to read and re-read some of the passages quite a few times to undesrtand what was being said through the old english slang. However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story. Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Signet classics)","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story.

It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it.

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again.

It's an interesting read, just to see how the writer manages to make a poem of this length flow together into a story.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"Imagine life as a fourteen-year-old girl who has just been informed her sister is a witch. In Bras and Broomsticks by Sarah Mlynowski, you enter the life of Rachel Weinstein, a New York teen who is a freshman in high school. Rachel has a younger sister named Miri, a vegetarian single mom, and a loving father who is being controlled by his beautiful fianc&eacute;e (a.k.a. STB.) When Miri discovers her supernatural powers, she is told not to use them until she is fully trained. However, Rachel uses bribery to persuade inexperienced Miri to cast a dancing spell on her and an ugly charm on STB. Rachel lands a part in the school fashion show and even gets a date to Spring Fling before she realizes she left her true friends behind.I enjoyed this easy and light-hearted read a lot because I can relate to Rachel. She is facing everyday problems such as pimples, boys, and homework. The book is full of humorous parts that keep the reader laughing. Mlynowski does a superb job on her first try at teen writing. The sequel to this book is Frogs and French Kisses and the upcoming trilogy is titled Spells and Sleeping Bags.I would recommend this book to female teenagers and adults looking for a fast-paced read."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"Rachel's little sister Miri seems to be the one that gets everything first, even though she's younger. For instance, her chest outgrew her sisters and how fair is that? But even worse, now it turns out Miri has inherited their mother's magic powers and Rachel hasn't!What's a girl to do? Talk her sister into casting spells for her, that's what. Besides wanting to get in with the A-list at school, Rachel also wants to stop her dad from marrying STBSM (Soon to be Step Monster), or STB for short. The sisters combine and try to come up with ways to foil the marriage from giving STB a really bad case of acne to making a spell that causes her to only speak the truth.Meanwhile, Rachel's wiggling her way into the popular crowd, often with unexpected results. But then things suddenly come tumbling down when their mother discovers what is going on.This is very fun book told in Rachel's voice. Yes, she's a bit pre-occupied with getting on the A-list. Yes, she's a bit selfish. But she knows it and truly loves her little sister, despite Miri getting everything first.I recommend this book primarily for girls ages 12 and up and anyone who likes a good laugh.---Kimberly Pauley, YA Books Goddess @ yabookscentral.com"},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"What would you do if your sister was a witch?

Eagerly snapping up the book at the store I didn't realize that this book was written for a younger audience. Although it became obvious early on that the target consumer was younger girls coming of age, I really enjoyed reading Bras and Broomsticks. It's the story of an ordinary teenage girl, Rachel who finds out one day that her younger sister and mother have extraordinary talents- they are both witches! The fun begins as Rachel tries to convince her sister to use witchcraft for her own selfish reasons. This book was cute and a quick read. I enjoyed it and plan to read the next novel in the series.

That's what Rachel has to deal with suddenly. Miri, Rachel's sister, has gotten the gift of witchcraft passed down from her mother. Rachel asks Miri to give her a popularity spell, but Miri says no, but Rachel asks Miri to put a spell on their father, so he won't marry his evil fianc&eacute;. Miri decides that since the rest of her father's life is in her hands, she says that it would be ok to use her magic, even though her mother told her no magic until her training is done. The first spell Miri tries is a dancing spell on Rachel. Miri's first spell works, and Rachel is a dancing queen. Miri tries a spell on STB and her father, but it fails. Miri finds another spell, for honesty, but again the spell fails. Mean while, Rachel's dating one of the most popular freshmen, Raf, her crush. Will Miri find a spell before the wedding?I enjoyed reading the book \\"Bras & Broomsticks\\". It kept me reading and interested. I would defiantly recommend this book to any girl who likes reading about fantasy and realistic-fiction. This was a great book, and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"Sarah strikes again!I've loved Sarah Mlynowski from day one, and this book is as fantastic as the rest of her fabulous works! I was leery of reading teen fiction (being in my mid-twenties), but I often forgot I was reading teen lit! The characters and storyline are both well-developed, the premise is adorable, and the end left me wanting more! (Luckily there's a sequel out in 2006: Frogs and French Kisses!) It wasn't \\"dummed down\\" for a younger audience, and yet Sarah flawlessly shyed away from topics not-quite-fit for the younger audience.A definate must-read for Sarah fans and their young-adult offspring/friends/family! I'd recommend it to all!"},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"I've heard a lot about Sarah Mlynowski's chick lit novels. I've even got a couple on my shelf, but I haven't gotten around to reading them quite yet. I recently learned that Mlynowski has been writing a young adult series about witches and magic. I thought it sounded enchanting and made it a point to read the first in the series as soon as possible. I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed; Bras & Broomsticks is a wonderful start to what I'm sure will be a thoroughly entertaining series.Mlynowski's writing is very smooth and it's really easy to fall into its rhythm. I picked up Bras & Broomsticks intending to just give it a try and ended up reading the entire thing in one sitting! The characters are well-written; Rachel and Miri act like normal teenagers. Rachel is unsure of herself and insecure. Though she makes some bad decisions throughout the course of the novel (and let's face it, what teenager doesn't?), it's clear that she has a good heart. She wants what is best for herself and her family - though this sometimes leads to amusing consequences. Miri isn't supposed to use her magic, but Rachel tries to convice her to. I thought I would be annoyed by this, but I really wasn't; it seemed like what a normal teenager would do.The Magic in Manhattan series was originally supposed to be a trilogy, but Mlynowski recentely released the fourth book in the series. Here's hoping she keeps going - I can't wait to find out what happens to Rachel next! I feel like this is a great book for adults and teens alike."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"This is a great book for pre or younger teens, such as 13 or 14. It tells all about a whitchy tale of a 14 year old girl who goes through some tough times when her sister becomes a witch(the good kind), and her divorced mother starts smoking. But, she meets a wicked cute guy and some secret romances and hot partys. I would also recomend the second and third book to the series, \\"Frogs and French Kisses\\", and \\"Spells and Sleepovers\\", and the forth, coming out next year."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"Bras and Broomsticks by Sarah Mlynowski is a hilarious, knock your socks off your feet book. It tells the story of Rachel, whose younger sister inherits the witch genes from her mom. Rachel tries to get her sister to use some spells on her to make her popular in school. Does having a sister for a witch come in handy when you want something? Or does it bring about other troubles?This book was an amazing book that I just couldn't put down. It was amazingly funny and I can't wait to read the sequel. Bras and Broomsticks is the book you should read if you want a good laugh."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"This book was a very good read. It is about a girl named Rachel and her sister Miri. When Rachel finds out her sister is a witch she is amazed! How could her socially challenged, Tae Kwon Do loving sister get all the power! Rachel and Miri go through lots of stuff together in this good and funny book. I reccomend it for all girls 12-14!"},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"Being fourteen is hard work--and nobody knows that better than Rache Weinstein. She's got a major crush on the two most popular guys in school, Raf and Mick; she's been dumped by her best friend since preschool, Jewel, and instead has hooked up with not-so-popular Tammy; she's got the rhythm of a baboon and so didn't get to audition for her school's all-important fashion show; she's a quasi B-lister instead of a coveted A-lister; her dad is getting ready to marry the most annoying soon-to-be-stepmother in the world; and now, to top things off, she's found out that her younger sister, Miri, is a witch. Seems mom is a witch, too, her decided to live life without her powers, and Miri's inherited her mom's special gift.Oh, the horror, the unfairness, the indignity! Not only did Miri get the boobs, but now she got the special super powers! Miri, who makes anal retentive, obsessive-compulsive list-makers look like chaos magnets, can now do just about anything she sets her mind to. Things which include, with a little bit of nudging from Rachel, giving her big sister a dancing-is-my-friend spell, getting their dad to break up with STBSM, and banishing pimples from their lives once and for all.Things don't work out exactly as planned, though, the way things tend to do when you mess with the powers that be. Just when Rachel thinks she's finally got it all--smooth skin, a hunky maybe-boyfriend, a spot in the coolest gig in school, a dad and mom that could be getting back together--things come crashing down.BRAS & BROOMSTICKS is an absolute riot! I loved this first book in a new series by Sarah Mlynowski. Rachel and Miri make great sisters, the situations Rachel gets herself into are hilarious, and the overall feeling is that life is hard, but sometimes you just have to deal with it. I can't wait for the next book,Frogs & French Kisses (Bras & Broomsticks Trilogy), to be released!"},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"I was excited when I heard Sarah Mlynowski had written a teen chick lit/fantasy book - especially since she is one of my favorite chick lit authors!Meet Rachel. She is 14, unpopular and and suffering from the usual teenage angst. That all changes one day when she discovers that her younger sister Miri is a witch. Yes, a witch. Apparently it was passed down from their mother. While Rachel wonders why she didn't inherit her mother's powers, she knows that she can convince Miri to help her cast spells to help her out. (Behind their mother's back, of course). For instance, there is a freshman fashion show coming up. Rachel knew if she got chosen to be in it, she'd become popular and get invited to the A-list parties. Too bad that normally she couldn't dance to save her own life.Although the girls' mother warns Miri not to use her powers until she is fully trained in them, under Rachel's begging and pleading, Miri begins doing some small spells to help out. First it's just to help Rachel become a dancer. Then there is the zit-away concoction. Then the girls decide to try and break up their father's soon-to-be-wedding with a woman they feel is horrible and two-faced. Meanwhile Rachel is ecstatic with her newfound popularity - not only did she get chosen to be in the freshman fashion show as a dancer, but she suddenly is dating one of the most handsome boys in school, and the A-list is inviting her to parties.But after a few disasters and spells-gone-wrong, the girls realize they might be in over their heads. Maybe their mother was right. Will Rachel end up losing her new popularity and best friend? Will she make a complete fool of herself in front of the school? Will the girls' dad end up making the biggest mistake of his life? Find out this and more by reading this delightful novel.This book was a wonderful read. It has all of the ingredients you could ever want in a teen fantasy chick lit novel: family angst, friendship and popularity dilemmas, crushes, parties, magic, and more. Mlynowski's trademark wit, warmth, and addictive storytelling come through in this book stronger than ever. Reading her novels is usually like having your best friend confide juicy secrets to you, but even better - and Bras and Broomsticks is no exception! The characters and dialogue are realistic, and the plot is original and absorbing.I highly recommend Bras and Broomsticks to all chick lit and fantasy fans of all ages. Adult readers will forget they are reading a teen novel as they get lost in the pages of this book, and teen readers will be delighted.

We did it mainly based on my kid's definition of \\"I would probably not re-read this book\\", and I agreed with her, that it would lose most of the charm on the second reading.Unless you have more than two readers for these series, or you are hard fan of chick lit, I would recommend borrowing the book at the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"I am eleven and i thought this was such a great book!

But how did they get there? She persuades herself into believing her mother bought them as a surprise and, uh, Rachel was so sleepy that morning she put them on without noticing. Yeah --- that must be it.But when she calls to thank her mother, Mom insists Rachel head directly home, where she gets some totally bizarre news. Rachel's little sister, Miri, is a witch. She can actually make dead animals come back to life (as a vegetarian she definitely livens up a lobster feast!).Rachel's mom informs her that witchcraft runs in the family and that she is a witch herself, which causes Rachel to believe that her mom is delusional. But then Mom levitates Rachel's new shoes, and suddenly Rachel is a believer.It turns out that Miri conjured up Rachel's new green sneakers as a condolence present to soften the blow of her being the only female non-witch in the family. Rachel is jealous, but she is also thrilled. Her mind races at the thought of all that Miri's witchcraft can deliver to her --- a perfect life! Their mom, though, insists, \\"Every spell has a consequence.\\" Mom makes Miri promise not to cast any spells until she finishes her training, which will take an entire year.However, Rachel is excellent at manipulating her sister. Can't she persuade Miri to use magic to stop their dad's imminent marriage to their \\"Soon To Be Step-Monster\\"? And surely she can talk Miri into making Rachel part of the popular group. As time goes by, though, Rachel has to consider some heavy topics: How much is it worth to be popular, anyway? Is it worth destroying friendships?BRAS & BROOMSTICKS is a fast, funny, and original read. At times, though, I found Rachel to be outrageously selfish --- so focused on what she wants that she happily lays waste to everyone around her. Although Rachel's self-centered ways made me cringe occasionally, her hilarious and fresh wit gave me hope for her story's outcome and also made the book extremely hard to put down.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"I think I had just graduated High School when I read this...It was an easy, fun read for my downtime while procrastinating my college coursework."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"this book was an amazing book to read. i loved it. it was wickly smart and hilarious. i truely think this is one of my favorite books, i can't wait to read the next book, FROGS AND FRENCH KISSES, out in 2006."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"I was totally impressed by this book and cannot wait for the sequel.

The spells go awry, but not without some fun first... the girls try to make their father fall back in love with their mother, give Rachel some talents and boyfriends, and create anti-acne spells. It's just a lot of fun, and the humor and wit is awesome. The writer is very funny and interjects such humor into the story that I didn't want it to end.

It is a really fun book."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"In my opinion, this book has its ups and downs. For one, it seemed to be a typical story about someone who gets a taste of popularity and then realizes that she left her true friend behind. But then for another, add to the fact that her sister is a witch and they're both willing to do anything to get her dad from marrying the \\"Soon To Be Step-Monster\\".So, in a way it was just like a lot of other stories.

Rachel, like any teenager wants to be popular in school, wants \\"A-list\\" friends and of course a boyfriend, of her very own. When she discovers her younger sister has the power to make all her dreams come true, she believes that her worries are over. But are they?Bras and Broomsticks was bewitchingly entertaining.

Having enjoyed her adult fiction, I decided to give this one a try. Rachel is just like any teenage girl: worried about wearing the latest fashion, crushing on the cute, popular guy in school and trying to maintain her friendships. It's not like she doesn't have enough already on her plate when she discovers her younger sister and her mother are both witches.After getting over the shock (and the disappointment that she's not a witch), she convinces her sister to use some magic (against their mother's orders) to help her win over the \\"in\\" crowd and break-up her father and soon-to-be step-mother. What Rachel doesn't realize is, she should be careful what she wishes for because she might just get it.Although Rachel makes poor choices and uses her sister's spells for selfish gain, she soon realizes what she thought she wanted isn't better than what she currently has. Bras & Broomsticks is a light, fun read, however it speaks to an important message: do not take for granted the important people in your life. Also, we sometimes may need a reminder that we cannot force other people to always do or be what we expect of them.I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Bras & Broomsticks","review":"This book was so good, and I really got in to it.

In particular, the book provides an excellent manual for those who prefer to replace marinated meats with higher quality cuts of meat with dry spice rubs. This approach aids a shift to smaller meat portions in meal design.Other palates may find nirvana in many of the recipes that didn't appeal to me. I'm just not ready to make four cups of barbecue sauce using black coffee, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and not-quite-salsa. Other sauces called for ingredients I have no pressing need to add to my kitchen. I may revisit these as my cooking style evolves to new ingredients. Still other sauces contain lots of sugar or wine and run counter to the simpler tastes of my own cooking.

In contrast, blacks all over the US have faced severe, organized, legally enforced discrimination on all these essential fronts. However, most white ethnics have created for themselves the myth they their predecessors overcame the same sorts of obstacles faced by blacks. My father's elders had a phrase they used to demean black people: &quot;We made it, why can't they?&quot; My dad wrote this book as a PhD candidate in history at the University of Chicago. He examined two of the claims of his elders: (1) Just like Chicago's enormous black ghetto, the city had many white ghettos (i.e., ones for Irish, ones for Italians, ones for Jews, etc.); and (2) just like blacks, members of these white ethnic groups faced severe discrimination in their attempts to elevate their lots in life. What my father discovered is that claims of white ethnic ghettos and discrimination are purely mythical. None of the ethnic neighborhoods contained a majority of any particular white ethnic group. He found, for example, some supposed &quot;Italian&quot; neighborhoods would contain more, say, Jews than Italians, and vice versa. (He writes that his mother told him she had been raised in a Jewish neighborhood, but that the census data revealed her contained more Irish than Jews during the time she lived there.) He also found that for jobs and education, there really was no effective discrimination against any groups of white people. (Enrollment caps against Jews at Harvard or strictures against Jews at country clubs being minor exceptions that look quite silly compared to the discrimination faced by blacks banned from public elementary schools and union jobs.) He found for example that businesses with &quot;Irish need not apply&quot; or &quot;No Jews Allowed&quot; in fact employed Irish and served Jews. Ultimately, he showed discrimination among white ethnics against each other are most usefully viewed as resulting from ethnic rivalries in which all the participants &quot;win&quot;, in terms of achieving full US citizenship and all the rights and privileges that go along with that. One of those rights and privileges turns out to be a subordination of these rivalries in the name of discriminating against blacks, of denying them full US citizenship. All white ethnic groups, according to my father's research, have throughout history united together to ban blacks (but not each other-with the rare and ultimately insignificant exception) from their places of employment, from their neighborhoods, from their schools, from their public facilities, their professional societies, from their families (i.e., intermarriage), from their political parties, and from their public institutions (i.e., voting, testifying in court, holding office). Granted, you can argue that blacks have in recent years have overcome all these bans (though my father didn't necessarily think so). However, no groups of whites have ever been faced any of these bans. I regard this book as essential for understanding why white immigrants have succeeded as a whole, whereas blacks have not."},{"Title":"Beauty and The Beast","review":"The story you know and love, by \\"Marie LePrince de Beaumont,\\" with afterword by Jean Cocteau. The book is illustrated by Hilary Knight, (who also illustrated the \\"Eloise\\" children's books written by Kay Thompson). Illustrations are in a sort of Art Nouveau style, but have a very 1960s look, too. There are 15 full-color illustrations in this book. Printed in Italy. Large print.Jeanne Marie Leprince de Beaumont was a French novelist who lived from 1711 - 1780. Her version of the traditional fairy tale is actually an abridgement of an earlier work (1740) by Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve. De Beaumont's version was first published in 1756.Jean Cocteau is significant because he directed the French movie of Beauty and the Beast (La Belle et la B?te) which was made in 1946."},{"Title":"Beauty and The Beast","review":"Why on earth is this beautiful book out of print? Everything about this book makes it absolutely indispensible--- it belongs in every home library in the country. The story itself is beautifully written and subtly didactic as well. However, it's the art that is really worth the price of admission. The paintings in this book represent the finest work Hilary Knight has ever produced, in my opinion. Gothic, frightening, grotesque, macabre, fanciful and oh yes, shockingly beautiful; the paintings that grace these pages are something that I would hang on my walls. If you can't track down the Hilary Knight version online, try finding it at your local librabry. You will be forever changed by it."},{"Title":"Beauty and The Beast","review":"I loved this beautiful book as a child and really would love a new one... just like the 1963, not the 1990.

There have been many books that have had the title 'Book of Common Prayer' since the first one appeared in 1549; it has been used continuously in one edition or another in the Anglican tradition since 1559; the 'main' edition remains this 1662 edition. Churches in other nations (Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United States, Canada) have done revised Books of Common Prayer, but they always use this as the touchstone.A bishop in the Episcopal church once said to me, 'We don't have a theology that we have to believe -- what we have is the prayerbook.' Please forgive the absence of context for this phrase -- while he would say that this statement in isolation is an exaggeration, and I would agree, nonetheless his statement serves to highlight both the importance of and the strength of the Book of Common Prayer.To be an Anglican, one does not have to subscribe to any particular systematic theological framework. One does not have to practice a particular brand of liturgical style. One does not have to have an approved politico-theological viewpoint. One can be a conservative, liberal or moderate; one can be high church, low church, or broad; one can be charismatic, evangelical, or mainline traditional -- one can be any number of things in a rich diversity of choices, and the Book of Common Prayer can still be the book upon which spirituality and worship is centred.The Book of Common Prayer is not, in fact, a book that changed my life. It is a book that changes my life. Even though it is not the primary book of my own church, it continues to provide for spiritual insight and development; it continues to guide my worship and my theology. It continues to help me grow. The words are part of a liturgy now shared by Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian and other liturgical churches, in different combination and priority.Gerry Janzen, an Anglican professor at my seminary, said to me recently as we were lunching and having a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation (in a unique way that only Gerry Janzen is capable of doing) that he strives for that kind of memory and understanding that is so complete that one forgets what one has learned. He recounted to me his experience of working with his book on Job -- he had done a lot of research, development of ideas, writing, and organisation, and then set it aside for a time. When he picked up the topic later, he decided to begin by writing, and then go back to the research, other notes and writings he had done earlier. He was surprised to see, in comparing the work, that he had in fact duplicated much of the material -- he had internalised the information, incorporated it so well into his thinking and being, that it came forward without effort. It is this kind of relationship I feel I have developed with the Book of Common Prayer.To be sure, there are pages of information that I don't know. I haven't memorised the historical documents; I still consult the calendars; I haven't learned all of the collects by heart. But it has become a part of me. When was asked to put together a liturgy for a houseblessing for Episcopalian friends, there were rooms that called for collects that had not been written -- I wrote new collects and inserted them into the liturgy.'Can you do that?' the householder asked, worried about the flow and the approval of the priest doing the blessing.'I trust Kurt to write collects -- his probably belong in the BCP,' the priest said in response, and I appreciated her vote of confidence. That was perhaps the first confirmation to me of this sense of incorporation of the book into my life.From his first edition, Cranmer distinguished in his terminology the words minister and priest, and the two should not be viewed as interchangeable. A priest is a minister, but a minister need not be a priest. This become part of the early development of the idea of all people being ministers to each other, which is also a concept that has varying acceptance and fulfillment in actual practice over the history of Anglicanism.One of my favourite prayers derives from this book, part of the English prayer book from the very first one in 1549:Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication unto thee, and hast promised through thy well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his name, thou wilt be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be best for us, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come, life everlasting. Amen.This prayer, like many things in the BCP, has moved to a new location from the first edition, but nonetheless the spirit of the BCP shows a circuitous but continuous development from the first English Prayer Book to the current varieties. Likewise, other denominations have gleaned insights, prayers and structures from this and other versions of the BCP.The Book of Common Prayer, as a single unit and as a greater tradition of which this book is a part, is an Anglican gift to the world."},{"Title":"Grandmother's Gift: Stories from the Anishinabeg (Native American Studies)","review":"A gifted writer and a fabulous storyteller, Anne Dunn will takes you eons away into traditional Indian folkore, a land of wisdom and wonder."},{"Title":"Grandmother's Gift: Stories from the Anishinabeg (Native American Studies)","review":"Those stories will remind you of your own grandmother if, like me, you were lucky enough to have a grandmother that told you stories of the past.

Philip Thody was Assistant Lecturer of French at Queen's University of Belfast at the time of publication (1959).The chapters are 1) The Expression of The Absurd 2)Resistance and Revolt 3) The Plague 4) Two Plays 5)True Rebellion and False Rebels 6) The Creative Revival and 7)Achievement and Limitations.It is paperback bound.Philip Thody dicusses pertiant existensial topics and uses the philosophical allegroies found in most of Camu's works with excellent focus on 'The Plague'. The language is concise and clear. I found both disagreement and agreement with many points and observations made. The Reference section is robust and helful for further study. A solid find in any used book store. Recommended for any entry level, moderate or self studied student of the French Existensialists. It may also be a useful for anyone who simply doesn't 'get' what all the fuss is about for Camus."},{"Title":"Deep Type","review":"As Alan Gilburg notes in his Introduction, many people have been through \\"typing\\" exercises before, yet for various reasons have not been typed accurately. Let me say up front that I love the MBTI tool, and have been a certified practitioner with it for over 15 years. It is one of those hip pocket frameworks with a great deal of depth that has helped me, as an executive coach, begin to observe tendencies in the external behaviors and interior states of a client's personality type (whether or not they've taken the instrument). So, when I was first exposed to Alan's Deep Type method five years ago, my cozy relationship with the traditional MBTI methodology whispered in my ear: \\"resist, resist.\\" After all, I already had an efficient vehicle to get me where I wanted to go. Why complicate matters - one vehicle was enough.Yet, the more I watched Alan use type with clients, the more I became attuned with his method for making discernments and accessing the resulting depth of awareness in the client. Soon, I relaxed into his process for typing that, in turn, opened more subtlety around what type revealed - for me and for the client. I found myself expanding conceptually to a two-car garage. In this book, he effectively translates his unique method to a wider audience.Alan's insights and written contributions around the tertiary and inferior functions helped me substantially at a practical level. It was also through his mentoring that I learned to pick up on the significance of the extraverted and introverted attitudes of the four functions. And, theoretically, he helped me (through providing a Jungian explanation) to crack a persistent mystery regarding the logic of the MBTI J/P scale.Up to the point of learning the Deep Type process, I had a beginner's abstract appreciation for the inferior and shadow, based on my reading of Naomi Quenk, whom Alan first recommended to me. Alan grounded her insights and his own in practical terms that I was able to use immediately in coaching conversations.Aside from his many years of consulting and coaching, my guess is that his leadership in The Mankind Project also helped inform his insights and affirm his methodology. Alan's original handouts, worth the price of the book, are made available in Deep Type, and invite their use with clients for immediate reflection and exploration on their type tendencies. The handouts on the 16 types make the type-learning process intimate and personalized. And it exposes to the light of day the underlying dynamics between the functions.For practitioners who use type already, I highly recommend exploring Deep Type as a break-through, complementary methodology. I believe you'll find a good share of \\"a-ha\\" moments in both theory and practice, deepening your understanding of and applied-value with Jung's classic typological insights."},{"Title":"Deep Type","review":"I have been using the Deep Type approach in my work as a coach and leadership consultant for 6 years, having learned it directly from the author. As a model guy-and perfectionist-by type (INFJ), I tend to be picky when it comes to adopting new tools for my toolbox. I have put Deep Type to the test with dozens of clients and friends and have found it reliably accurate, engaging for me and my clients and fun and easy to use. Having worked with other typing tools, including the MBTI and DiSC, I now consider Deep Type my tool for typing individuals.I strongly recommend Alan's book for it's relevance to leaders, coaches, consultants, counselors and teachers; for it's clarity of purpose and pragmatic approach; and for it's brevity!"},{"Title":"Pure As He Is Pure: My Struggle With Homosexuality","review":"Is there hope for the homosexual? Can a homosexual change? \\"Yes,\\" is the answer to both of these questions by the author, a former homosexual and former minister in a pro-gay church. In his book, Roberts takes a candid and revealing look at his own homosexuality and states common environmental traits as the cause of his, and other's homosexuality including: sensitive temperament, sexual abuse, passive father/domineering mother, lack of affection/affermation from same sex parent and picked on by peers, among others. These environmental aspects created the same sex attraction in him and others, and steps are shown that can be taken to overcome and change them.The book also examines with sensitivity what the bible says about homosexuality, dispelling some major misconceptions, but always showing the true heart of God. The perspective is complete and in depth and takes a revealing look at homosexuality. I was not surprised at all by the outcome, as these were things I actually heard speaking to me in my own heart.Don't be scared off by the academic appearance in some parts of the book. In it there are practical, obtainable and achievable applications that I found out to have actually helped me overcome my own struggle with homosexuality. They really do work.Through the book I was able to realize that God still loves even me, in spite of all my shortcomings and that change, something I desire most of all in the depth of my heart, is possible and can be accomplished. By applying the methods outlined in this book, I have seen change in my own personal life and I know that complete victory over homosexuality is feasible. What the author states in the book works. I know, without a doubt, that there is hope for all homosexuals and that change is really possible."},{"Title":"Pure As He Is Pure: My Struggle With Homosexuality","review":"The author has no knowledge of Hebrew and Greek. This is clear from his \\"evidence\\" regarding Hebrew and Greek words used in scripture. He relies on Strong's concordance, which gives only root forms. But Roberts doesn't seem aware of that fact, and thinks that the words he sees in Strong's, with the classic mispronunciations common in that work, are the actual words used in scriptures. An example from English would be the word \\"walk.\\" In the dictionary, you will find only the root form listed: Walk. But the word has other forms: walks, walking, walked. In Hebrew and Greek, many more forms of a word will exist, but Strong's lists only the root form.The author claims that the word \\"sh'kobeth\\" is found in Lev. 18:22 and 20:13 (p. 79). But such a word does not appear in either verse. This is the danger of people who cannot read the original languages trying to argue translation. They use Strong's, which can be a useful tool in the right hands, but which contains known errors, and they wind up with serious errors in their work.In dealing with 1 Corinthians, he confuses the adjective malakos with the plural noun malakoi (again, because he cannot read Greek and is using Strong's, which only lists root forms.) Further, in translating arsenokoitais, he makes the mistake, thanks to Strong's, of linking it to the noun koiten, rather than its actual source, the verb keimai.In referencing the former Presbyter of the National Gay Pentecostal Alliance (which is now known as the Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals), he fails to mention that this person does have knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and has, in fact, had experience in teaching Hebrew since 1979. So I am at a loss to understand how a man who cannot read Hebrew and Greek, and who must rely on Strong's Concordance, without even understanding how to use it properly, is qualified to rebut the research done by the afore-mentioned Presbyter. The research done is available from Amazon in the book Gay and Christian? Yes! by Rev. William H. Carey.Gay and Christian? Yes!"},{"Title":"Pure As He Is Pure: My Struggle With Homosexuality","review":"I THINK THATS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE RUN FROM CHRISTIANITY IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WANTING TO CHANGE PEOPLE THEY DON'T EXCEPT THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.

Every castle ever built, it seems, appears to have its own White Lady, its own ghosts walking the gloomy halls at night frightening the people who happen to see them, and their own myths and legends about gruesome deaths and unhappy love.This becomes extra clear after having read through Haunted Castles of the World. Every chapter looks the same; Coulombe begins by offering a short description of the history of the castle and its inhabitants, followed by stories about different ghosts and how they have appeared throughout the centuries, and the chapter is then closed with a lively remark and the address and contact information in case the reader too wants to go there and see what all the fuzz is all about.Which is both good and bad. It's good because you'll always learn where the castle is, what ghost or ghosts it has, and how to contact the owners if you want to go there yourself. But at the same time it's pretty dull, because you really don't learn very much about the ghostly phenomena themselves. The book is actually more of a history book than a ghost book, because the chapters all have a lot more text dealing with history than with ghosts. And also, there's no bibliography whatsoever, not even when the author uses direct quotes, and all in all the entire book very easily feels boring and repetitive.But on the other hand, it's written as a guide book about different castles and their ghosts all over the world - England, Scotland, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and much more - and as such a book it works perfectly. As long as you're aware of the fact that it's a guide book you probably won't get disappointed, but if you want to learn more about the ghost phenomenon itself you're a lot better off picking a different book."},{"Title":"Haunted Castles of the World: Ghostly Legends and Phenomena from Keeps and Fortresses Around the Globe","review":"I bought this book because I love ghost stories and pictures of haunted castles. However, this book provided none of that. It is more like world guide of haunted places, and each place gets a couple of pages of fanciful description and then the address. It did not provide the beautiful castle pictures, nor the involved, ghostly stories based on history I was looking for."},{"Title":"Haunted Castles of the World: Ghostly Legends and Phenomena from Keeps and Fortresses Around the Globe","review":"A great book that is informative, but would like it to have more substance and more ghost phenomena written down for the castles. it feels like a quick run down of certain local tourist hotspots, and does not give much information about the particular hauntings that go on at the locales."},{"Title":"Haunted Castles of the World: Ghostly Legends and Phenomena from Keeps and Fortresses Around the Globe","review":"First of all the title of this book is misleading, eitherthe Author is not aware of other hauntings or selective withhis list.

The Old Iron Road: An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West is the literary result of this undertaking. Part family history, part US History, part true travelogue, the book is a wonderful and highly informative look at the often sad and tragic history of those who settled the west.Although it's the history that is especially compelling in this mix, that history is delivered in the way it must have been during the trip itself. Bain is the master of the odd fact, such as the revelation that Malcom X, Marlon Brando and Fred Astair were all born in Omaha, Nebraska. The traditional figures, such a Buffalo Bill are included, but it is Bain's anecdotes about more marginally known characters-such as Phillip Sheridan and Brigham Young-that really hit home. Bain also goes to great lengths to cover the ways and results of the pioneer's relations and actions towards the various Native Americans disrupted by the Anglo western migration.However, it is the pace itself that so obviously moves Bain. His treatment of the many isolated and wasted ghost towns they encounter and how the development of the west proved boon to some, disaster to others is both insightful and, often, quite moving.In the end, the family interactions and this \\"history\\" of their travels prove to be moving as well, especially when one is cognizant, as I was when reading it, that not long after the trip Bain's wife died of heart disease. In the end, the book proves to not jst be informative, but heartwarming as well.A truly unique book that is, all in all, one of the best anecdotal historical books I have read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Old Iron Road : An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West","review":"I normally do not write reviews but felt compelled to say a little something about this wonderful book and this man and his ability to peel away at layers of stuff to get down to the nitty-gritty of railroad and western history and do it with a flair that makes you want to read more. I have tried to read every book there is on the Transcontinental Railroad and after reading Empire Express, felt that I had finally read the best. Shortly after I read this I also read Steve Ambrose's fluff on the same subject and realized what a masterpiece Bain had written.So of course when I saw Bain's new book come out about his travels with his family I had to read it (I'm a great fan of folks like William Least Heat Moon also and love this kind of travelogue). I really didn't think I would learn much more about the history of the railroad but he added more and more to material about places in my back yard that I have walked and driven to (including a long ago trip across Promontory Desert retracing the Old Central Pacific grade when I was 16 years old with my mother and sister in the 4 x 4 with me!).Mr. Bain, you do a great job. My heart goes out to you and your children to the loss of your wife, Mary. She sounds like the partner we all wish we could have. I look forward to any and all of your books that I hope you will write in the future."},{"Title":"The Old Iron Road : An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West","review":"As this is written, I am reminded that Walt Whitman reviewed his book entitled \\"Leaves of Grass\\"; and while I did not write THE OLD IRON ROAD, I sure was along for the ride.That being said, Mark Twain called his guides \\"Ferguson\\" in Immigrants Abroad, this because, Mr. Twain tells us, he was unable to pronounce the unfamiliar names that were furnished him by his guides. Hmmmm, David H. Bain often called me, and still does, Old Bud, perhaps out of respect for the beer of a similar name.With that being out of the way, I can attest to the accuracy of this tome. David, his wife and kids met Chuck Sweet, Bob Chugg and I \\"cold\\" in Ogden Canyon, in a most brief dinner meeting on the eve of a three week trek across the West. Our goal, Chuck, Bob and I, was to give this Eastern writer a true taste of the West, dust, sagebrush, blue skies and heat. We succeeded in our mission.As God is my judge, none of the three of us expected to be quoted in any manner; we just wanted Bain and family to experience what life was like in 1863-1869 in California, Nevada and Utah, as well as introduce Bain (we called him, out his ear-shot, \\"Exhaused Rooster\\" due to the long days, and from time to time, longer nights, that we provoked him into)to the REAL WEST.99.9% of what he has written actually happened; the guys in the Goldfield, Nev. jail were playing Monopoly, and one of them did end up, 'in jail'; we all got darned dirty chasing the old CPRR grade across three states; everyone was richer for the experience. Neither Chugg, Sweet nor I can attest to the final .1% that is chronicalled between the covers of this book, as somethings are written that we were not privy to experiencing with Mr. Bain.I would guess that if you enjoyed \\"Blue Hiways\\" by Wm. LeastHeat Moon, you will enjoy THE OLD IRON ROAD. Flat tires, ghost towns, boot hills and all.Reading this book, a few years after the actual experience, makes me want to go out and experience the Real West, again.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Old Iron Road : An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West","review":"The book chronicles a family trip from Missouri to California, following old highways (the Lincoln), railroads, and side trips. The author is a fine story teller so we experience his family's adventures as well as the history of the people who helped develop the West, including Native Americans. There is enough historical detail so the reader is made aware of time and place, current and in the past. The book would be a useful guide to other present day travelers. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Old Iron Road : An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West","review":"In The Old Iron Road author David Bain has achieved a wonderful mix of living in the present with his family's journey across the west, living in the 1930's with the Lincoln Highway movement, experiencing the 1860's and the transcontinental railroad (see his magnum opus Empire Builders) and recounting history with the first European settlers. Having studied each era I could fully appreciate the detours he took to fill in little nuggets of history all along their 7000 mile two month journey across the west.As a planner of similar, though shorter, family vacations, I found a kindred soul in a man who would read every historical marker, examine and enjoy every dusty museum display, and fret over his kids wandering off the trail and stepping on a rattlesnake. The way he weaves this travelogue in with the history and geography and spirit of a place is very well balanced. When introducing a new town not only does he tell the history and significance but often mentions the elevation, the touch of a detailed researcher that the informed reader appreciates. His description of sites his family saw along the way has inspired future trips for my family.This book anything but a dull read and is alive with personal stories like meeting other railroad enthusiasts along the way, thrilling to the little discoveries like an old railroad spike or tin can, and admitting to falling exhausted into bed and letting the kids space out on the hotel cable TV. He even laments over the journey their vehicle, the Grenville Dodge Durango, suffered when trucked back to Vermont, backwards, to arrive heavily encrusted in bugs and dust. I think my favorite moment in the book is toward the end of the journey, after a long evening of meeting history buffs and fellow authors, the kids are exhausted and asleep, while Bain and wife Mary sit up late pouring over new books and dreaming of places to revisit and explore, and scenes to paint in the years ahead. Poignantly his life partner Mary only had a couple of years left before health issues took her on a final journey. The book moves along at a nice pace and is fulfilling for those who love history and a good travel tale. My only regret is the epilogue which left me in tears. I am inspired to plan our next great family vacation along the Old Iron Road."},{"Title":"The Old Iron Road : An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West","review":"Picked a copy of the book up at a Hobby Train Exhibit for $5.00.

P. PalmerThis book should be on any science teacher's bookshelf: it is inexpensive and a delight to read. Firstly, however a little information about the publication.1. This small paperback volume contains not one but two separate books. Mr Tompkins in Wonderland was originally published by Cambridge University Press in 1940. Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom was published by Cambridge University Press in 1944. The two volumes have been through different editions and reprints ever since and in 1994, Cambridge University Press marked more than half a century of Mr Tompkins by bringing out a joint paperback volume of all the Mr Tomkins stories.2. Mr Tomkins in Wonderland explains Einstein's theory of relativity. Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom explains atomic structure and some of the ideas of quantum mechanics. He does this through the introduction of three main characters, Mr Tompkins, a clerk in a big city bank, with an interest in, but little knowledge of, science and a strong propensity to fall asleep and dream during the \\"Professor's\\" scientific lectures, the \\"Professor\\", who gives the scientific explanations, and his daughter Maude, who develops a romantic attachment to Mr Tompkins.3. Relativity and quantum mechanics are explained very well through these stories and Roger Penrose in the introduction states that with a few minor exceptions these stories still give a useful explanation of these 'difficult to grasp' concepts.4. Gamow wrote the first of the Mr Tompkins stories in 1938 and was unsuccessful in finding a publisher. Eventually he offered it to C. P. Snow, who then edited Discovery and who published it and subsequent Mr Tompkins stories in Discovery.5. The original illustrations were drawn by John Hookham, but after Hookham had retired, Gamow did subsequent drawings himself following Hookham's style.I suggest that the whole new volume would be very suitable for teachers who want a reasonably accessible explanation of relativity or quantum mechanics or for interested students in Years 9-12.Original review in The Journal of the Science Teacher Association of the Northern Territory, Volume 14, pp.134-135.BILL PALMER"},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"George Gamow, an absolute physics legend of the mid-twentieth century, has a classic here with Mr. Tompkins in Paperback. The book covers many of the things that you'd like to know about physics and the physical world (but may have been afraid to ask); and covers them through the prose of the affable Mr. Tompkins. Mr. Tompkins keeps the book moving from topic to topic as he gets his education in physics, and all the while the reader finds him- or herself (of course) getting the same education. In this way, Mr. Tompkins is a narrative device to make learning physics non-threatening. A must read for those interested in learning about physics, those who know physics (as Gamow is a famous personality in the history of physics), and those who just want a good read."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"The physics are just a little out of date in this classic by George Gamow, but it is still a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"It was a great transaction, Good prices, Great quality, and FAst delivery"},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Like most of us, Mr tompkins does not understand the world of relativity and quantum mechanics.

The book is informative and gives the reader a chance to really visualise concepts that otherwise may be out of reach."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"George Gamow has a gift for getting at the essence of modern physics and explaining it. The reader still needs to have a fair amount of sophistication. This book is not &quot;dumbed-down&quot; at all."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"The book is about a very curious man, Mr. Tompkins, who decides one day that instead of going to the movies he will instead attend a physics lecture. This one lecture sets him into a series of interesting events that will affect him for the rest of his life. Mr. Tompkins is apparently a very tired man, for he falls asleep almost every lecture and dreams of this \`Hypothetical World'. Mr. Tompkins becomes obsessed with the physicist and his lectures and begins to attend his lectures on a regular basis, falls asleep, and then enters the physics world along with the professor who teaching the lectures. The professor takes Mr. Tompkins to many exciting places; first he travels solo in his own town, but eventually he is taken to space based on the \`curved space' lecture and is able to see how the physics and astronomy worlds are quite intricately associated together and are still \`expanding'. He also gets to travel to the \`quantum jungle,' buy an elephant and hunt tigers; travel to the woodcarver, who looks an awful lot like Gepetto from Pinocchio, who instead of making puppets makes and paints atoms; meet geishas who feeds him a \`Japanese meal'; and best of all, he gets to go on a vacation with the professor and his daughter to not only learn about physics, but also meet his future companion. Yes, this story is not only a physics book, but it is also involves chemistry; both kinds of chemistry, the scientifically aspect as well as the romantic aspect. We are able to learn towards the end of the book that Mr. Tompkins does take the professor's daughter to wed and they live happily with the hypothetical world and real world often colliding.The book is organized in a consistent, clever manner. Mr. Tompkins will attend a lecture, fall asleep, and dream about the lecture. These dreams help to magnify exactly what the lecture was talking about since there are many equations and the language is for those higher educated. The certain scenarios he is involved in put the material in an easy format to understand and also make the story quite interesting. Reading just a regular physics book is not too exciting, however, Gamow puts the book in a more colorful spin that allows the reader to stay interested and actually follow the idea content. Without this twist I do not believe I would have endured the book till the end. Not only that, but Gamow putting the little spin of Mr. Tompkins meeting Mrs. Tompkins is just a precious ending. At least Gamow could attract many audiences. I also felt that I learned a lot from this read. Gamow did a great job introducing the information and arranging the content into a building block learning experience. As mentioned, not only was physics introduced, but Gamow made sure to teach quite a bit of chemistry and to make sure at atom was understood. This particular subject was a couple chapters long. The different safaris Mr. Tompkins went on helped certain confusing aspects to be cleared up for example, the relativity principle. Gamow really illustrated how these principles can only be relative to (in the instance of this book) Mr. Tompkins.In all, I found this book to be quite helpful and interesting. Would I read it again? Probably not, but it still shows how well thought out this book was and how creative Gamow was, in that, he could create an entire story based on complicated physic theories. If needing some extra help on physic concepts, this is a great introductory course. After all, like the professor said, \\"Curiosity makes a scientist.\\""},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Mr. Tompkins in Paperback\\". In this book George Gamow takes difficult physics principles and makes them easier to understand. The author's method of simplifying physics is by comparing physics principles with real life examples that are easier to see.The part of this book that I enjoyed the most is when Mr. Tompkins has a dream about relativity. In his dream, Mr. Tompkins goes to a world where the speed of light is greatly reduced. While there, Mr. Tompkins noticed a bicyclist coming towards him. The bicyclist appeared to be thinner. This is because in Mr. Tompkins reference frame, the size of the bicyclist has been contracted because he is traveling at a speed that is close to the speed of light. Later, Mr. Tompkins got on a bike and then noticed that everything around him appeared to be shorter. This can be explained by considering the reference frame of Mr. Tompkins. In that reference frame, the space around him is contracted. I think that these examples used in this book will make it a lot easier for me to remember these principles of relativity that involve length contraction.Another part of the book that I found really interesting is when Mr. Tompkins sees a game of \\"quantum billiards\\". In that game, when a ball gets hit, it spreads out and goes in all directions. The author uses this comparison to describe quantum mechanics and the probability of where things are located. I also found it interesting when Mr. Tompkins puts the pool ball inside of a triangle to see what would happen. He finds that it is impossible to get a ball to stop completely. Mr. Tompkins also notices that the pool balls can \\"leak\\" out of the wooden triangle. I found this to be very interesting when comparing this phenomenon with quantum mechanics.Overall, \\"Mr. Tompkins in Paperback\\" was an interesting and educating book to read.

When I was in junior high school, I read the original Mr. Thompkins series by George Gamow, who was one of the leading nuclear physicists of the mid-20th century. This was one of the influences that steered me into physics as a career. I am pleased that these books have been reprinted, and I recommend this book to anyone interested in physics, even though it is over sixty years old."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"If you think physics is boring, get this book. You'll enjoy everyday stories merged with relativity theory, quantum physics, etc."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland was a good read. It describes some principles of physics that are typically difficult to understand to the average person in a playful, simple way. The story illustrates the adventurous dreams of Mr. Tompkins after he attends a series of physics lectures given by a local professor. In one of his dreams he sees an expanding universe where some of the physical laws of gravity have been altered. In another he enters a billiards hall where the \\"quantum constant\\" has a different value then ours, causing him to see a blur of different balls as they travel across the table. This has reference to atomic theory, where we become increasingly uncertain of an objects velocity as we become more certain of its location and vice versa. He visits this world again with the professor and sees a blur of tigers and gazelle which are near impossible to hunt. In another world he sees the speed of light has been altered to a mere 10 mph. Here he learns firsthand how the laws of relativity are experienced. While he travels at the speed of light, he notices his time passes much slower than to those stationary around him. All these physics concepts become very real to him in his dreams. Lucky for Mr. Tompkins, he gets the girl in the end; who new physics could open up romantic options?!This book was a pleasureable read. It was generally simple to understand after reading the chapters. While I enjoyed this short story, I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because I realize that such a book is not for everyone. The writing is understandable one who is at least somewhat familiar with the principles involved. Luckily the appendix offers the text of the lectures upon which Mr. Tompkins' dreams are based. One should be at least have heard of some of the principles behind quantum theory and relativity to get the best benefit out of this book."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Mr. Tomkins in Paperback, by George Gamow, is an excellent book for anyone looking to broaden their knowledge of how science applies to the real world.After having read this book for my physics class, I feel that this book deserves a 3.5 out of 5 stars.In particular, Gamow focuses this book on the study of physics using his character C.G.H. Tomkins (even the initials of Mr. Tomkins are derived from concepts of physics). Mr. Tomkins, a bank clerk by trade, is a curious man who decides to jazz up his life a little and attend physics lectures instead of going out or going to the movies. He has a strange desire to learn more about modern science. In his first lecture he falls asleep and enters into his own \\"Narnia\\" (in his dreams) where the concepts of physics are real and magnified, so that they appear almost supernatural. Thankfully the professor is there to help and explain things to Mr. Tomkins along the way. As Mr. Tomkins explores this realm of physics he encounters some danger and excitement in his adventures. However, he never fails to take home the message of each situation and ends up learning through his experiences. This book covers several topics such as relativity, space curves, gravity, and more. Mr. Tomkins learns not only about physics but also of love as he meets the professor's daughter.I enjoyed reading this book and surprisingly, for being a science related book, it was an easy to understand and quick read (the hardbound version contains only 186 pages with many illustrations to help the reader visualize different situations). This book helped me understand many concepts I have learned about in my college level course as it explains them in a simple and concise manner. However, some concepts can seem over the top and overwhelming, because not all are explained so clearly (like the topic of relativity related to motion where Mr.Tomkins meets the anti-aging-grandpa coming off the train). But this shouldn't be the determining factor whether or not you will read this book, when reading any book there is always something to be learned. One thing I really liked about the book is that Gamow used mini stories to explain concepts, but the fact that he keeps them short helps in the understanding process and keeps the book interesting. Overall, having the principles and concepts of physics explained to me in \\"real life\\" or \\"everyday\\" terms helped me better understand physics and how it can be applied in all aspects of life. Would I read this book again(?) Probably not anytime soon, but it was strangely interesting and even sparked a small interest in physics. Good luck reading."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland, and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom, are two adorable gems by physicist George Gamow.In story format, Gamow presents important concepts to the general public. The themes are dated -- e.g., Mr. Tompkins attends lectures in order to win the favor of a professor whose daughter he wishes to court; however, the style is nevertheless effective -- and funny.There is a contemporary version, an \\"update\\" of Gamow's Mr. Tompkins works, which may be more readily accessible to modern students. Even so, I recommend this original version because it is the first of its kind -- a creative, innovative approach by a physicist who was present during the time of these ground-breaking developments in physics."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Took me years to reach for it off of my shelf. Wonderfully entertaining and insightful book with all of the physics to back it up and the storytelling to keep you reading (once you start). Should have read it years ago, glad I eventually did."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"A lovely reprinted edition of a peral from Gamow. The original edition has been out of print for a number of years. This 1993 edition has added commentary and a fascinating bio of Gamow. He was born in Odessa, in what was then Russia, --before the Soviet Union. The story of his escape to the West is straight out of a thriller. Only it is real! Gamow was referred to by a journalist, some time during the Cold War, as &quot;the only scientist in America with a real sense of humor&quot;. He can take the most technical stuff and make it simple. Fun too! The book:--Intellectual treats, whimsy, but deep. Illustrated with lovely drawings by Gamow himself. Much of it can be understood by a child, and other parts might require a little concentration. All of it is great fun. Follow your imagination, and while you explore, you will learn about Einstein's theory of relativity. And in unexpected ways! You will see the wonders of physics thru the eyes of a child. With his unexpected thought experiments, Gamow has captured the imagination of generations of readers, and he has inspired a degree of curiosity that comes naturally to children.The author George Gamow started in nuclear physics, during the Golden Age of Physics, worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, then later in the US, on the Manhattan Project during WWII; and after the War, he was professor in Boulder Colorado. He has a building on campus of The University of Colorado named after him! He is one of the few scientists who wrote popular books. They are precious pearls, and they have been equally popular with my parent's generation as with mine. For awhile they were out of print, but luckely some have now been reprinted in recent years!Other Gamow titles: Biography of Physics, Atomic Energy [dedicated to the hope of lasting peace], Physics of the Strapless Evning Gown,...We are lucky that Dover has reprinted some of them. Gamow's list of scientific accomplishments includes a 1948 landmark paper on the origin of chemical elements, the Big Bang model, and later work with F. Crick on DNA and genetic coding.-- Do more Gamow editions, Dover!Review by Palle Jorgensen, September 2003."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Whe I taught introductory physics, the section on modern physics was pretty hard to grasp for some of my students. When I found this text, then titled &quot;Mr. Tompkins in wunderland&quot;, I began to use it to help them (and me!) with the less intuitive concepts. I wish I could have met the obviously delightful man. What all physics teachers should be. I am so glad to see this back in print after all these years so a new generation of budding physicists can be delighted with their physical world."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"I first read this about 50 years ago in graduate school, and was wonderfully stimulated. Despite many advances since, this book is still thoroughly up-to-date (except for particle physics and quarks). I remember mainly how Mr Tompkins suffers in a room where the speed of light has been reduced to 100 mph. Could never again think of simultaneity again in quite the familiar Newtonian way. That is but one example of the freshness of view that Gamow's fun-loving mind creates. It taught me more than most formal texts; and with so much more ease.I hope that he and Lewis Carroll have found each other in Heaven, and are discussing how to educate and amuse."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"This book is about 50 years old, but it has aged well. The basic ideas discussed in the book have not changed, although some discoveries in the intervening years have made a few parts obsolete. Gamow's writing is witty, yet rigorous. Without compromising scientific accuracy, he manages to make his narrative engaging and entertaining.Gamow touches on some classical topics, as well as relativity and quantum mechanics. For instance, he explains probability theory and how it relates to thermodynamics using a vignette about a gambling system to win at Monte Carlo.The author, renowned for his contributions to 20th Century physics and to its popular exposition, assumes a fair amount of sophistication on the part of the reader. This does not mean that it will be beyond the reach of most people, but it will challenge the reader.This book is one of the recommended readings for a class I teach at drphysics.com. Many of my students have found this book to be helpful."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"I am nothing more than a humble interested amateur and my formal science education is limited to some advanced classes for my high school diploma many years ago. I picked up \\"Mr Tompkins\\" following a conversation with a physicist sitting next to me on a long flight. I found it to be an excellent introduction to modern physics in general and quantum mechanics in particular. I found it challenging and I wouldn't claim I understood every last detail, but it is definitely not necessary to have a profound knowledge of mathematical and physical concepts to read this book. The writing is witty, precise and thoroughly enjoyable. In fact I was so intrigued that I went and picked up two other books (Alice in Quantumland and Taking the Quantum Leap), both of which I found harder to read and not as suitable for the uninitiated as Mr Tompkins."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"I'm a novice at this subject matter, and I've recently started reading introductory books on quantum physics for fun. I read, &quot;The New Quantum Universe&quot; prior to reading this. This easy to read book filled in some gaps that that I had. It helped me grasp some concepts that had otherwise passed over my head when reading the other book.I understand that this is a classic text and I can see why. It's fun to read, and provides a foundation for further understanding. It explains uncertaintity, radioactive decay, and electron shells especially well.I may not fully appreciate the concepts I was able to internalize from this book for quite some time.

Concepts covered is Relativity and Quantum Mechanics where speed of light is reduced to very low valus or Planck constant is increased to managable levels. You can see the strangness in everyday experiences.Very fun to read or to give as a present to young future Physicist."},{"Title":"MR.TOMPKINS IN PAPERBACK","review":"Here are Gamow's two 1940's Mr Tompkins books popularizing modern physics, in one tidy package. An earlier reviewer has suggested that this book be produced as an animated educational film, a good idea, but I picture it as being more of a computer enhanced live action video. The chapters on relativistic geometries and cosmological models could really be audio-visual treats, and it's hard to imagine a better basis for a script explaining the strange new world of physics to the interested lay public. The lions-share of what science now claims to know about the world was developed from a seemingly strange handful of theories thrashed out in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Gamow was both a party to this theoretical explosion and a gifted writer. Most of what has occurred in physics since these books were first published, has essentially been the refining of the ideas discussed here, so, for the most part, the science is still significant. But while Gamow had some important cosmological ideas -- he predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation, the discovery of which earned Wilson and Penzias a Noble Prize (in which Gamow should have shared, but did not) -- he also bet on the wrong horse when it came to cosmological models.Gamow cleverly and artfully presents the three basic cosmological models being argued from the 1930s through 1965.* The context is a night at the opera in which noted physicists sing the virtues of their respective theoretical opinions. First up is no other than the initial developer of the expanding universe ('big bang') model, the Belgian physicist and cleric, A. George Lemaitre. The Lemaitre universe is a majestically wondrous, one-off, elegant masterpiece. He sings, \\"Z' splendeur of z' origine. . . Worrk of Z' Lorrd!\\" Second is the oscillating or 'bouncing' model, and this piece is sung by Gamow, who at that time favored the concept of an eternally recycling universe (bang, expand, contract, re-bang, expand, contract, ->, etc). The third and last piece to be sung is of the Bondi-Gold self-maintaining or \\"steady state\\" universe, so famously preferred by Hoyle. Appropriately, this singer is generated mysteriously from intergalactic space, singing \\"Was never formed in time gone by. . . But is, has been. . .shall ever be. . .\\"Well, on this question we seem to have a winner, and no, it isn't Gamow's model. As Roger Penrose relates in the foreword, Gamow's bouncing universe and Hoyle's \\"steady state\\" model are both dead ducks these days. Seventy-five years of observation and mathematical fine-tuning have made something like Lemaitre's general understanding look like the only serious cosmological game in town. But don't hold that against this artful and thoroughly fun book. Gamow discounted the 'steady state', and most of the science here is still sound and relevant.*[File this under 'is there nothing new under the sun?': 1600 years ago, Augustine of Hippo recorded (City of God, Book XII) that classical cosmographies all distil into three basic models, the same three considered here by Gamow. (These same three models subsume the \\"innumerable universes\\" of Epicurus' speculation and of the recently famous so-called 'strong anthropic principle'.) Augustine bet on the right horse though, reasoning that the 'cycling' and 'eternal' models both seek finally to avoid rather than admit a true explanation. Only the universe-from-nothing (ex nihilo) model admits that the universe has an explanation -- albeit a grandly mysterious one.]This volume is classic science writing in a most entertaining package, it awaits some creative screenplay adaptor and video genius to make from it the best popular science audio-visual experience ever. Have at it."},{"Title":"Pieced from Ellen's Quilt: Ellen Spaulding Reed's Letters and Story","review":"I am an avid reader of quilt history and found this book to be a remarkable sideline item. It deals very little with the actual quilt, but rather uses it as a jumping off point to study the life of a woman who owned it.

This book is nothing but a collection of various stories which I read on the net, magazines and heard on the news. The only new part is the Osama & Ibrahim connection.Being a journalist myself, I find this book a shocker.Spelling mistakes are galore (Confidante is spelt confident, Hit is spelt Him etc.) which even a Grade 5 student will pick up. Facts have not been researched into at all and they just pile up according to King's whims and fancy.As a journalist, I have done a lot of research in this field, not for publishing but just as part of my curiousity, and Gilbert King is lacking in every aspect.Factual mistakes:1. Babri masjid is claimed to be in Bombay (It is in Ayodhya)2. Sharad Shetty clamied to be shot in his office (He was shot in India Club, Dubai, UAE)3. Rohit Verma claimed to be informer and a.k.a Michael. (In fact Michael D'Souza was a different person all together). Jagdish Shetty(India) was the informer not Verma. Why would Verma call the assassins and have himself killed ???? Hello Gilbert King ???Verma was Rajan's closest friends who did his dirty job. Sarita was not Verma's wife but his mistress.There is absolutey nothing about Dawood's early Bombay days. Just a para about the Pathan gang. In fact his early days are more interesting than everything else. His split from the Pathan Gang was the major move in his life. And how from 1983-1987 he eliminated each and every rival by sitting in Dubai.This book needs a lot to be desired. I give it One star for the nice cover and the other star because it did induce me to buy it !!!!!Spare yourself the change, more accurate info with photos can be had on the net for free. There are no photos as well in this book!"},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"Great subject, there is very little about a man who influences the lives of so many people.However, I found little or no new information about Dawood Ibrahim, that is already not published in any other source. It is a summary of most published material.The book is also quite repetitious and repeates the same information quite a few times. I wish there was more information about his empire and about his rise to power. I guess the reason cited in the book about journalists being afraid to write about Dawood hold true here.Anyway a good attempt. I hope somebody builds further on it and comes out with more voluminous book."},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"I bought this book only because Amazon had it listed at a bargain price. This is a classic example of the old saying that \\"you get what you pay for\\". I'd be shocked if it took more than a week to write the book, and if the author had to use more than his web browser to find sources. Almost every source citation listed can be found on the Internet. I say \\"almost\\" because I think there's at least one book cited, so you might have to make a trip to the library too. But everything else is out of Time, the Economist, Vanity Fair, the New York Times, NGO whitepapers, etc.I found the book difficult to read, due to the breathless hype over the subject (I mean, he's the MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN THE WORLD after all) and the fair-to-poor writing. There's no new information here, just a recap of what other people have written. And that's my main problem with the book- half an hour or less with Google and Wikipedia will tell you as much if not more about Dawood Ibrahim than this book will."},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"The book's name is a misnomer. Initially, it talks about how Dawood made his way upto the top in the shady underworld, but then the focus shifts from Dawood to Afganistan, Pakistan, CIA, ISI etc, and ends up in establishing the relationships between these entities. What role Dawood plays or is playing in these tie ups is not mentioned. Only few pages do justice to the book title."},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"In this hastily prepared book it doesn't take long to discover that you are reading a manuscript written for those unfamiliar with Dawood Ibrahim and his operation. What I hoped to find was a detailed explanation of the inner-workings of the D-Company and the powerful hand which guides it from behind the intelligence cloak. Without a detailed knowledge of India and its history of strife between the Muslim and Hindu communities, it is difficult to understand where Ibrahim fits into the picuture. You're not going to get a clear understanding of the dealings of where Ibrahim's D-Company activities end and Intelligence groups like Pakistan's ISI begin. No elumination on the shadowy connections between the D-Company, ISI, Al-Qaeda and the CIA. These confusing alliances remain unresolved. In painting a picture of Ibrahim as a ruthless drug smuggling foreign mob boss with ties to terror organizations and foreign intelligence operatives, the average American citizens worst fears post 9-11 are realized.Most irritating about this title is the lack of new information. The book is filled with information you can find in the archives of the Mumbai newspapers. The information on Al-Qaeda and Ibrahim is purely speculative and no information has been produced since this book hit the shelves to explain the alledged ties between the two groups. Most disturbing is the failure of the author to examine the true nature of the D-Company. Is it indeed a criminal organization or is it a wing of the Pakistani ISI operating within India? Are the battles between Dawood Ibrahim's followers and Chhota Rajan's hindu mob truely based along religous lines or are there factors pushing both groups which remain hidden from the public?"},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"Perhaps now western media will begin to understand the power and influence of Dawood Ibrahim. Pakistan gladly hosts this dangerous terrorist and he pays off the Pakistani government with billions reaped from opium and other illegal businesses. Most Dangerous Man in the World presents an accurate and horrifying picture of the man who has the power to corrupt governments, advance his terrorist agenda and make himself and his D Company bhais rich.As the author points out, it is probably just a matter of time until the world learns the name of Dawood Ibrahim. This book also paints a disturbing picture of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence and its involvement with Dawood. Pakistan will not like this book because there is a great deal to answer to. I highly recommend anyone interested in current events, especially concerning terrorism to read this paperback. It is timely and up to date and a solid investigation into the inner workings of a true global terrorist."},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man in the World","review":"Fascinating read. Initially, I thought some of the author's claims about Dawood Ibrahim were purely speculative--especially the nuclear black market chapter. But the Times of India recently did a story about this book and intelligence sources confirmed Dawood's involvement. This is frightening.Some of the book is hard to follow since the major figures all have aliases, and the Indian press is notorious for getting stories wrong. (I especially love the chapter where Rajan is reported dead for days, then gives an interview from his yacht in Europe!) Indian journalism is as entertaining as Bollywood itself!The connections between Ibrahim and Osama Bin Ladin/al Queda are very interesting too, and it's a good thing the US is finally taking Ibrahim seriously as a terrorist. I would have liked to know more about how Ibrahim's D Company really gained its power in Bombay, but it is understandable how no journalists have had success penetrating Dawood's world. After reading this not very long book, it's clear that Dawood Ibrahim really is very bad man!"},{"Title":"The Awakening (Cliffs Complete)","review":"Metzger's analysis and synopsis of THE AWAKENING was carried out so deftly, with such poise, that I began reading the actual novel. Apparently, Kate Chopin's work was a seminal novel in the struggle for women's rights, depicting a woman who decides to drown herself rather than face subordination to a husband, lover, or children. I'm midway through the actual book, and I find that it pales in comparison to the Cliff's Notes. I wish that Mz. Metzger had written the book, and Kate Chopin had written the Cliff's Notes, because Mz. Metzger has a far more pleasant, economical and less turgid writing style. It's hard to get through Kate Chopin's actual book, to be honest, because she pontificates endlessly and tends toward rather unpleasant self-pitying (obviously, since she drowns herself.) I may continue reading the book, but I may stop--since I enjoyed the synopsis so thoroughly, and, thus far, the book is spoiling that."},{"Title":"LITTLE GRANNY QUARTERBACK","review":"The words are fun to read aloud, and the pictures are darling.

The book covers the era by breaking that timeframe into three periods and works well in doing so.Unlike the massive and famous \\"War and Peace\\" with the focus on life of the gentry, this very comfortable book gives the view of things mostly from the perspective of some soldiers - along with that of Napoleon, when he was mired in Moscow. At times, this is a real page turner.The presence of Alexander is felt in policies, but he is largely invisible from much of the narrative - which is refreshing. The book paints portraits of the terror and tragedy of the fire and times like nothing else I have read. The author seems to be almost entirely accurate about the historical context within which he writes.What is the impact of this being written during the Soviet era? Nothing. This is an allegory, with the burning of Moscow representing the burning of the hope for change that Alexander talked about and his successors failed to act upon. Such a view of the failure of the Romanovs is one held by many far beyond the censors of the former Soviet Union.This old book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Things We Said Today: The Complete Lyrics and a Concordance to the Beatles' Songs, 1962-1970 (Rock & Roll Reference Series)","review":"This book seemed intersting, but it was really confusing.

The one talent that underlies all of human evolution's ebbs and flows is curiosity. Curiosity drove the first humans to ask the questions, Why? What? When? Where? and our own creative talents answered those questions with scientific explorations into the natural concrete world as well as with more ineffable, spiritual answers of Religion. However, some time ago, as Raymo explains, religion and science suffered a rift and that rift has grown wide . . . losing the recognition of their common beginning. Raymo moves between the vastness of the universe and the equally vast human need for &quot;God&quot; and ties them together again, promoting an appreciation for the big bang, evolution, creation, the unknown recesses and reaches of the world, and the undeniable miracles of life. A sit down, curl up by the fire, read aloud piece that eases all mundane frustrations!"},{"Title":"Honey From Stone: A Naturalist's Search for God (A Ruminator Find)","review":"Chet Raymo's Honey From Stone is a heart-warming collection of essays. It shares deep and thoughtful ideas with the generous grace of a dear friend. By using the monastic hours as the framework for his essays Raymo gently reminds us of the sacred nature of the universe. By discussing the this universe through the awesome display of its skies he reminds us of the dramatic grandeur we are part of. And he uses the rocky Dingle Peninsula of Ireland to tell us that this awesome splendor, this grandeur and these miracles are right here beneath our feet. In his search for God, Raymo finds it revealed in the stones, the skies and the hedgehogs that delight and inspire his musings. The amount of science that informs his delight is impressive. He teaches geology, astronomy, history, botany and zoology on these rambles as easily as lying on great stones, watching a brilliant meteor shower silently illuminate the skies."},{"Title":"Honey From Stone: A Naturalist's Search for God (A Ruminator Find)","review":"Chet Raymo's book beautifully reconciles the traditions of mysticism and science. In a form which follows the monastic hours, he uses the natural environment of the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland to discuss the wonder of the Universe.

And what poems they are! If poetry is supposed to be a subjective and emotional art, Mr. Dunbar has mastered it. I felt my heart wrenched over more than one poem. This is a very nice volume to have if one wants a sampling of Mr. Dunbar's art in an inexpensive format. Dover has done a great job in the selection, balancing the dialect poems and the standard English ones.

That's until I started reading Jack Womack. Not *only* does he write works of lucid and humane beauty (which are typically if regrettably marketed as genre SF by the same boneheaded quants who sent PKD to his early grave), but he's the most incisive critic of English-language-as-annihilator-of-meaning since George Orwell. Read *Heathern*. Then go get *Elvissey* and *Random Acts*. For a non-SF, non-Dryco, bitterly funny book, try *Let's Put The Future Behind Us*.The stuff is *that* good. You'll feel a little sadder and a little wiser and somehow more hopeful after having read *Heathern*, and you won't have to have been polluted by &quot;Touched By An Angel.&quot; Verily, if the whole human race were on trial for its life, Jack Womack is the kind of writer you'd want to hold up and offer as evidence and argument for redemption."},{"Title":"Current status and proposed improvements to the ANSI/ANS-5.1 American National Standard for decay heat power in light water reactors","review":"If you're looking for a messiah,look no further than the pages of Jack Womack's novel Heathern. This novel tells the story of the marketing of a reluctant messiah and is set in a futuristic New York City that defies the word condemned. If you aren't looking for a Christ child, believe me, baby, the future according to Womack is desperate for deliverance. The reader is thrown headlong into the deceptive and duplicitous dealings of a man named Thatcher Dryden who is rumoured to have gained control of the city, the president, and quite possibly, the world. His discovery of the fact that an unemployed school teacher is working miracles in the gang-infested slums of New York leads him to try to gain control of the one thing that would offer him the key to total population control: redemption. The story travels to the top of the anthill, where the rich and overfed survey their lessers feeding upon themselves like so many rats; to the intestines of the earth, where mutants and other castoffs of humanity fester in abandoned subway terminals; and provides the reader with a compelling, satirical look at the future, its progeny, and the power and commodification of a messiah."},{"Title":"Current status and proposed improvements to the ANSI/ANS-5.1 American National Standard for decay heat power in light water reactors","review":"Jack Womack is one of those writers I find myself recommending to everybody, albeit his subjects aren't for everybody. Its not so much the content (which is horrifyingly brilliant) but the prose, the new argot that enmeshes me into a world I can't stand, and yet want to learn so much about.HEATHERN is the 3rd release in Womack's Bibliography, and the 2nd novel to be read chronologically in Womack's AMBIENT series. But, it can be read at any point, in any order, or can be the only AMBIENT novel you chose to read (and frankly, its a fine choice) for it has all the magic of continuity while appearing as a stand-alone story. It is only more pleasurable to read the rest of the novels (TERRAPLANE, GOING GOING GONE, RANDOM ACTS OF SENSELESS VIOLENCE etc) for it grounds in more details into the story's characters and their setting. Even though RANDOM ACTS OF SENSELESS VIOLENCE came out much later in his career, its the starting point in the AMBIENT narrative, making it a perfect novel to read before reading HEATHERN, but not essential to read. The choice is completely in your hands.Womack himself didn't consider his science fiction to be cyberpunk, but its hair-raising description of New York City occupied by Army tanks and hilariously rich CEOs just screams everything the genre stands for. Completely in the tenor of William Gibson's BURNING CHROME (just minus the hackers).The plot arrested my attention. I couldn't stop reading, and with the finish of each chapter, I was prone to keep going. This novel stands true with all the cyberpunk surroundings, and glimpses of the future, and completely warrants multiple reads."},{"Title":"Current status and proposed improvements to the ANSI/ANS-5.1 American National Standard for decay heat power in light water reactors","review":"Womack's &quot;Heathern,&quot; another installment in his brutal near-future satire (collectively known as the &quot;Dryco Chronicles&quot;), hinges on concerns expressed in &quot;Elvissey&quot; and &quot;Terraplane&quot; (and, to a lesser extent, his ultraviolent &quot;Ambient&quot;). When a schoolteacher demonstrates the ability to resurrect the dead, marketing kingpin Thatcher Dryden launches a campaign to exploit his potential as a messiah. The world outside Dryden's corporate corridors has fallen into ecological and social catastrophe: a haunting, utterly dehumanized caricature of late 20th century. Womack's narrative skill lies in his ability to make his future, as well as his characters, seem inevitable. This is the stuff of millennial nightmares."},{"Title":"Current status and proposed improvements to the ANSI/ANS-5.1 American National Standard for decay heat power in light water reactors","review":"Heathern is the third installment in the Ambient series. I must admit that I accidentally picked this one up without reading the second, Terraplane, so I can only compare it to the first of the series, Ambient.Heathern sees Womack showing a bit of restraint. While his story is brutal in its own right, its much more tame compared with Ambient (or Random Acts of Senseless Violence which might be seen as the predecessor to Ambient). Because of his focus on the story, the reader is left guessing about certain developments in this futuristic New York City.All in all, a good story but its not as strong as the beginning of the series."},{"Title":"In the Kingdom of the Fairies: A Memoir of a Magical Summer and a Remarkable Friendship","review":"Lately I've been having the worst time trying to find something truly worthwhile to read.

Susan discovered an abandoned fireplace in the hedge between her family house and that of the next door neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Moir. Her dad explained to Susan that the elves built the fireplace. Feeling some form of kinship, Susan leaves small presents for the elves that are gone by the next day. One day Princess Nootsie Tah on behalf of Queen Mab writes a thank you note. With the help of her nanny, little Susan responds. Soon an elf and a human child become pen pals even while Susan spent plenty of time with the retired Mr. Noir listening to his stories.This true story is a great book that shows how one caring person can make a difference. Princess Nootsie Tah obviously cherished the classics and sprinkled much of that love into the letters (the allusions are brilliant) that fired the imagination of a child. The letters are incredibly written as Mr. Moir treats his young friend with respect and intelligence. Perhaps starting with that one summer provided the foundation to the dream of becoming an actress that Susan Coyne later fulfilled.

Sometimes it takes a person who is not related (or closely related) to take away the...not loneliness but the, sameness? that may happen when people live with each other day after day. It can create a bit of mystery to enliven the imagination.Susan Coyne has written her memoir with care and sensitivity about her five-year-old self.

Sunshine, lazy days and another Philip Craig novel about the charm and easy pace of Martha's Vineyard.Retired Boston cop J. W. Jackson moved to the island of Martha's Vineyard for a lifestyle change, only to find that trouble always has a way of finding him there. A couple of Beantown mobsters show up at his home and try muscling his wife, Zee, for some information about one Tom Rimini, an apparent missing gambler who is in deep hawk with the loan sharks. The thugs get physical with Zee, so she manages to modify their behavior by grabbing her pistol and shooting. With one dead and one wounded, the mystery begins to unfold about who Tom Rimini is and why the Soprano types are looking for him on the island.Once a cop, always a cop. J.W. Jackson's instincts lead him to a series of clues that allow him to piece together the puzzling story of Tom Rimini and his myriad of problems, including those involving the Boston crime family. All this while taking his kids out for an occasional ice-cream, and playing with his two cats, Velcro and Oliver Underfoot.Philip Craig's books, about the adventures of J. W. Jackson and his family on Martha's Vineyard, are fun and laid back. Yeah, there is usually a mystery to solve, in between getting stuck in the traffic jams at the A&amp;P supermarket, or the long queues at the standby auto lines at the ferry dock in Vineyard Haven. Craig has captured the nuance and magic of sleepy Martha's Vineyard while delivering a light-hearted mystery laced with humorous dialog and usually dumb bad guys. For less than the cost of a ferry ticket, and with no waiting lines, you can enjoy the essence of the island and understand why so many people, famous and otherwise, enjoy trekking to this island every year for some summer fun."},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"I read \\"Vineyard Shadows\\" by Philip R. Craig because one of my favorite mystery writers, William G. Tapply, had written a Brady Coyne/J. W. Jackson novel with Craig, and I wanted to get to know J. W. before I read their joint effort, \\"First Light\\". J. W., his wife Zee and their 2 children, Joshua and Diana live on Martha's Vineyard. The book opens as 2 thugs come to J. W. and Zee's house looking for Tom Rimini. When Zee tellsl them she knows of no Tom Rimini, the thugs attack her, and she shoots them, killing one and wounding the other. When J. W. returns from a clamming trip, he learns that the thugs were looking for Tom Rimini. J. W. knows that Rimini is the husband of J. W.'s ex-wife, Carla. It seems that Rimini owes gambling debts to Sonny Whelan, a Boston mob boss. When Rimini does come to J. W.'s house, J. W. agrees to hide him out at a neighbor's house more to help Carla than Rimini, whom he dislikes. There was little mystery and the plot was a bit thin for my taste. I liked the characters, but certain things about this novel annoyed me. The children who are small act like they are 10 years older than they really are, and are more polite than most children. This novel was average, and certainly not up to par with the Brady Coyne novels by William G. Tapply. At least when I read \\"First Light\\", I will know about J. W. and his family."},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"While not great literature, this novel is a very readable mystery. It is recommended for a long airline flight, relaxing at the beach, or a rainy evening at home. It is mystery No. 12 in the Vineyard series. While some people prefer to read the series in order, this one can be read as a stand along book. J.W. Jackson has his past catch up with him when he becomes involved with his ex-wife (after 15 years), her second husband, and the criminals he left behind in Boston.J.W. is retired on disability from the Boston P.D. after being shot while on duty. He lives on Martha's Vineyard with his wife, Zee, their two young children, and two cats (but no dog in spite of his children's pleas). His preference for retirement is fishing, claming, occasional boating, and socializing with family and friends. His quiet life is disrupted by intruders from the mainland, in this case his ex-wife's husband and the hard cases looking for him for reasons not entirely clear (the man is not overly truthful about circumstances).Yuppies spending themselves into debt, gambling, drugs, two timing men and women, criminal elements, and J.W.'s old Boston friends all figure into the plot. Two thugs make a bad mistake (fatal for one) when they try to rough up Zee. Zee then gets irked when J.W. tries to help his ex-wife by pulling her husband out of the hole he dug himself into. The plot, as they say, thickens. It takes a major effort by J.W. to restore things to a peaceful retirement. His children acquire some goldfish, but no dog, at least not yet."},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"This installment of the J. W. Jackson and family adventure continues the slow degradation of this series and provides another disappointing read. The plot is weak, the action limited, and the toddler age children talk like adults. The whole combination makes for a disjointed novel that is not at all close to an average read.Years ago (and many novels ago) J. W. was a cop on the mean streets of Boston. He was shot in the stomach and the bullet nestled itself against his spine a hairs breath away from permanent paralysis. During the gun battle, he managed to shoot and kill the female thief that had shot him. The resulting trauma of the shooting, caused him to take his pension and disability benefits and move to the tranquility of Martha's Vineyard. There he was able to find peace and solitude as a year around resident. He eventually met and married Zee, a nurse at the local hospital. By the time this novel opens, they have two toddler age children, Joshua and Diana who do not act or talk like real children in any sense of reality.As this novel opens, J. W. and Joshua went off clamming while Zee got ready to take the younger child, Diana, to the local gun club so that Zee could practice her shooting. As a healer, she is conflicted about the competitive target shooting, but has slowly discovered that she likes it and is quite good at it. Those skills come in quite handy when strangers appear at the house. After asking repeatedly for someone Zee does not know, violence erupts. To save her child's life as well as her own, Zee kills one assailant and seriously wounds the other.J. W. comes home to find his injured wife and daughter being loaded into an ambulance in a front yard full of police and chaos. There is a good reason why Zee never recognized the name of the man the men were looking for but J. W. knows of him. Tom Rimini is the schoolteacher J. W.'s wife left him for after he was gunned down. She could not handle the life of a policeman's wife and wanted someone safer and more stable. They clicked and after the shooting, Carla made sure J. W. was physically okay and then announced she wanted out.The only person that could have sent Tom to J. W. would be Carla. Soon, Rimini contacts him and spins a story about gambling debts, the mob, and a cop seeking a conviction against a powerful mob figure. It has been fifteen years since J. W. last saw Carla, but he still has strong feelings for her and he agrees to do what he can to help Tom. Of course, Zee is less than thrilled with this arrangement and it strains their relationship a little more, but she has learned that J. W. will do what he feels right.Unfortunately, this novel sounds better on paper than it actually is. This latest effort continues the weaker plots, less action, and unrealistic kids of the last several novels. Joshua and Diana are portrayed as miniature adults in action and dialogue and for any parent; it simply does not ring true. Kids just don't act this way and with the kids being a large focus of the last several novels, the books are weakened considerably. As in the last several, J.W. takes his kids to crime scenes and other places that no rational parent would. My suggestion would be to skip this one and start with the beginning ones and work your way forward. You will know when to stop.(...)"},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"Philip Craig's &quot;Vineyard Shadows&quot; is a pleasant piece of summer reading for mystery lovers.

What really disappointed me was JW's character flaws, as exhibited toward his ex-wife and some of the harsh words he had with his kids. Zee performs admirably, becoming an early heroine in the story, yet torn in her soul over what she had to do. Much of the mystery regarding Tom Rimini, Sonny Whelen, Graham, and Grace was somewhat fun to think about during the unfolding of the story, but the ending was a wimper, rather than the bang I was wanting."},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"J.W. Jackson used to be a Boston cop. As the book opens pale June people are on the island. School is out. Vacationers have arrived. Zee, J.W.'s wife, is a natural marksman. She is going out to practice when two men appear. In self defense and in defense of her daughter Diana she shoots them. The newspapers have a heyday with stories describing a housewife shooting mobster intruders. It seems the men are enforcers from Charlestown.Clearly this opening is dramatic. Reader interest in the outcome has been stoked. The issue presentedd is how far is the reach of the bad guys. (In our community two or three police officers are school board members and another moonlights as a substitute teacher. They are community activists of a sort. They seek to insure harmony. One senses that J.W. Jackson is cut from the same cloth.)The men from Charlestown are looking for J.W.'s first wife's husband. In the scheme of things there is no reason for the intrusion-- there never is. New England mobsters and the rackets are part of the story. The Boston mob seems to be, in this reader's mind, the preserve of Robert B. Parker, but there is room for other aspirants.I like this writer for presenting the seaside and small town as a setting for the series. Also, spending time with with J.W. and Zee and their children is a pleasure. Craig really does a great job with his portrayal of J.W.'s two small children. Casting J.W. as a house-husband and the narrator inserts the children into the foreground. Additionally, I learned in this book that the expressions Down East (to Maine) and Up to Boston derive from sailing terminology, the prevailing southeast winds."},{"Title":"Vineyard Shadows: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery","review":"After a great start, this ones slows to a crawl and gets tedious.

They injure her and her daughter, forcing Zoe to kill one of them and injure the other.Zoe and her child go to the hospital for treatment. After visiting them, J.W. returns home only to find Tom there. He admits to being married to the former's ex-wife. Tom also confesses that loan sharks are after him. J.W. agrees to help Tom, but quickly learns the man lied to him. Unable to leave well enough alone, J.W. enters the fracas in a manner that disproves fifteen years of investigative rust.VINEYARD SHADOWS contains all the excitement of the showdown at the OK Corral with none of the subsequent violence. Zoe comes into her own as a strong &quot;I am woman&quot; persona and J.W. continues his up the middle practice of justice. Phillip R.

The six stories take place across the entire run of classic \\"Star Trek,\\" from the early days of the original series to the movie-era continuity.Of course, this being a series of novellas tied into a linking theme (in this case, a planet ravaged by an environmental disaster), there are going to be some stories that work better than others. The strongest offering comes from Christopher L. Bennett, which shouldn't come as a surprise. Set in the era between the first and second classic \\"Trek\\" films, Bennett has shown before how good stories can be told in this time frame and his entry is no exception. The weakest is the second installment, a story set during the original five year mission and one that comes off as feeling like little more than an homage of all the elements that make up a stereotypical classic \\"Trek\\" episode.

Suspend your belief long enough to read this book, for by listening to this author you will gain new insights and perspectives. As I pondered the profound conclusions in the book, I decided to send a copy to a friend, a respected professor (Harvard trained scientist and published author) an academic with a strong background in pathology, cell biology and virology. As a scientist who happens to head a well-funded research facility at a top U.S. medical school I felt his opinion of this controversial book would be relevant. A short time later he called to say that he agreed with Dr. Al-Bayati's findings and conclusions, and he said that the book blew yet more holes into a crumbling HIV rhetoric and mythology. I concur with the professor that it is with sound scientific methodology, common sense and grounded logic that Dr. Al-Bayati provides an indictment against HIV as a cause of AIDS. This book gives new insight into the subject from a unique perspective and challenges the HIV/AIDS establishment.Reading Dr. Al-Bayati's book and researching the shortcomings of HIV test methodology -with its pointless results- has helped me to understand the truth about AIDS and the inability of HIV tests to provide anything consequential; HIV testing is a meaningless exercise and scientific misinformation at its worst. HIV tests are neither an accurate measure of infection nor a measure of one's health. As product inserts clearly state, HIV tests are not approved by the FDA for diagnostic purposes. I have even read that dogs can test positive for HIV, and they don't get AIDS (perhaps people will begin to test their pets just for fun)This book explains what does and does not cause AIDS, a must read for anyone who wants to understand AIDS more fully.

Al-Bayati. Dr. Al-Bayati Graciously Intervened at that time in my behalf and completed an in-depth, comprehensive And completely neutral medical review and evaluation of my case records. His Conclusions were that my diagnosed illness, Pulmonary Fibrosis. had been Produced by my exposure to JP-4 &amp; JP-8 Aviation Fuels plus other toxic Chemicals in the workplace. Kerosene, one of the key ingredients of Jet Fuel Also created lesions in my airways, lungs, and other tissues, as well as Instituting memory loss, but, unfortunately, my HMO was bewildered for the Reason my overall general health was progressively deteriorating at an Alarming rate, and, was completely unresponsive to Steroid treatments.Thus, further in-depth Toxicological and Pathological investigations were Warranted by Dr. Al-Bayati, he discovered that the steroid treatments, Prednisone and Azathioprine had completely destroyed my immune system and Were the Culprits that were not allowing my bodily systems to repair themselves.

My CD4+ T cells counts was 255/ul, furthermore I was cured from AIDS following 22 days Of my last dose of prednisone intake, my CD4+ T cells Count was 657/ul of blood.Dr. Al-Bayati's book, specifically chapter 14, makes mention of a powerful Antioxidant, Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), also called thioctic Acid.

This is a textbook example in faulty reasoning. One can, even without medical knowledge, identify the two major arguments his whole work is grounded on as nothing more than critical failures in logic.The first logical gap consists in arbitrarily calling all immune breakdowns AIDS. In his preface (p.xiii), Dr. Al-Bayatis describes the story of &Ograve;A 60 year-old-white male, HIV-negative, developed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) following treatment with a two week course of prednizone (&Eacute;) and a two week course of azathioprine for lung fibrosis&Oacute; as &Ograve;the spark that ignited this in-depth investigation of the causes and pathogenesis of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)&Oacute; (p.xiii). Dr. Al-Bayati does not say how a doctor could have diagnosed a patient with AIDS while he tested negative for HIV. But before we advise that patient to hire a lawyer, the case gets thus restated on page 1: &Ograve;a 60 year-old-white male who developed Immunodeficiency syndrome SIMILAR TO THOSE (our emphasis) described in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)&Oacute;. Thus, as incredible (or derisive) as it may seem, Dr. Al-Bayatis entire endeavor is apparently grounded on a false association of all immune breakdowns with AIDS; thus can he talk about HIV negative people having AIDS. But having symptoms &Ograve;SIMILAR TO THOSE&Oacute; of AIDS and having AIDS are two different things and equating the two invalidates the proof.Secondly, the logic Dr. Al-Bayati uses to try to prove his point is based on the false postulate of &Ograve;mutually exclusive&Oacute; arguments. Dr. Al-Bayati appears to believe that showing that an illness described by the CDC as AIDS-defining can also have another cause, would prove that HIV couldnt have caused it. The rest of the book is devoted to the laborious (and completely useless) enumeration of all possible other reasons of some AIDS-defining illnesses. For instance, demonstrating that TB &Ograve;has been known for more than one thousand years&Oacute; (p.84) or that TB can occur in people who do not have HIV is completely irrelevant to the point because it does absolutely nothing in the way of excluding HIV as a possible cause. All of Dr. Al-Bayatis proofs, enunciated in a syntax just as broken as his reasoning, rest entirely on such patently absurd and illogical premises.Yet Dr. Al-Bayati doesnt shy, once in a while, from uttering such enormities as &Ograve;most people in America are diagnosed with AIDS based on symptoms alone even if HIV negative&Oacute; (p.97) or &Ograve;There are thousands of cases of AIDS reported in the medical literature were HIV-negative (sic)&Oacute; (p.34). It is highly regrettable that with the &Ograve;more than one thousand published articles and standard medical textbooks&Oacute; (p.6) Dr. Al-Bayati claims to have reviewed, he would not have taken the time to include one single citation to substantiate those comical claims.Such utterances also shed a cruel light on Dr. Al-Bayatis total absence of clinical experience with AIDS patients. This leads him to rely heavily on the old clich about who gets AIDS while remaining curiously silent about the majority of people now affected by this epidemic. One may also wonder why Dr. Al-Bayati has chosen to single out AIDS to blame its causes on behavior and medications alone rather than, say, cancer. It would have been just as easy to him, using the same skewed logic, to deny the existence of cancer and blame its deaths on chemotherapy and/or behavior if it wasnt for the fact that AIDS carries a much heavier promise of self-righteousness in those who like to look down on those who may be different (ethnically or sexually) from them.Dr. Al-Bayati ends his work with an impassioned plea for more toxicologists (of which he is, naturally). Should they all be like him, we need not one more but rather, more philosophy teachers. Ultimately, his sorry effort proves absolutely nothing but its authors sheer inability to think critically. Mohammed Ali Al-Bayatis prescriptions will be just as successful to cure AIDS as disposing of cemeteries would rid human kind of death."},{"Title":"The Destinies of Darcy Dancer, Gentleman","review":"JP Donleavy may well be the most hilarious writer on the planet. Darcy Dancer is a Bildungsroman about the coming of age of a young, educated member of the landed gentry in Ireland. He learns about love first- and second-hand through the auspices of a broad range of tutors including the brilliant Mr. Arland, a stablehand named Foxy, the sublime Miss Von B, the artist Clarissa, school chums, butlers and Rashers Ronald. Kildare wanders from one total fiasco of his own making to the next from the hunt and the stables to the mansions of the gentry and private schools and Dublin high society. He always emerges through chance and pluck and the kindness of others none the worse for wear and perhaps slightly wiser. What are we to make of this dubious young \\"gentleman\\"? As Kildare correctly surmises: \\"Every madman thinks everyone else is mad.\\" Donleavy writes with a unique pointillism, using words as brush strokes, that is engaging, endearing and even breathtaking as each chapter ends on a brief poetic note, a pithy line of stacked type. The dialogue is outrageously real and human and uproarious. The character development is precise and each character lives and breathes with a separate unique identity that only a supremely talented writer can render so credibly. Having read nearly all his novels, Darcy Dancer is his best: it's truly a well-written, literary comedy. Discover JP Donleavy -- possibly one of the most under-rated and gifted writers of our era. You'll laugh your head off."},{"Title":"The Destinies of Darcy Dancer, Gentleman","review":"You know - I've always found it odd that the few, the proud, the wierd, who share my literary tastes have never even heard of J.P.

Some things never change."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Edmund White writes beautifully and this narrative is flowing, interesting, and compelling. White writes as if he is developing a 1980 memoire about the 1960s. But at the core of this novel is a dilemma that is never fully answered in the novel and is probably never really answered in the lives of gay men and women. Other reviews and reviewers do an excellent job of telling the narrative details of this novel, but underneath this narrative is a question regarding identify and identity development.The basic question is whether gay men are born gay and thus they come out through a process of ever more intense and meaningful gay experiences and friendships and relationships with a broad cast of characters or whether gay men learn to be gay and take on a gay identity through emersion into various relationships with significant persons who teach the youth how to be gay. The brilliance of The Beautiful Room is Empty is that White is able to weave both of these concepts together into a whole cloth of experience, never fully answering whether the power of the instinctual sexual identity is paramount and is revealed in a series of vignetts and character studies with friends and lovers or whether the passion and identity are more diffuse and coagulate around core external experiences where gay identity is learned and reinforced. Both are deterministic models, whether it be a biological determinism or a social structural determinism. Internal reality is always checked against external reality in White's narrative. The drive to sexual expression is the impetus toward self discovery in much of the book, rather than a less sophisticated approach wereby sexual expression is taken as just one component of a series of relationships.Overall the book is a very good read, shocking in some parts as public bathroom sex is described, but always about an unfolding reality that is heavily influenced by events and relationships."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"A continuation of A Boy's Own Story, this book is no less well written and no less brilliant. It is no wonder that White is considered--by the worthy, literate critics, at least--the finest gay writer in America. I would modify that to say he is one of the finest writers (gay or otherwise) in the world today. This book cronicles the life of ABOS from shortly after that book leaves off through the Stonewall riots in New York in June of 1969. The narrator's growth is evident from the end of the last novel through the end of this one. This is one of the most important works by one of our most important writers; White is the nearest writer to Proust to write since, though minus the cork-lined apartment and with quite a few more social graces."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"I loved it!!!!! Again I really identified with the author. It made me think and I learned a lot about myself in this book. I guess I could say I learned how to think in this book. Please read it and you will understand what I mean. It is worth it"},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"The author apparently wrote this book over a long period, while making a living on other writings. As a result, his style was inconsistent and labored in much of the book. His frequent, if not constant references to sometimes obscure literature suggested he was giving the reader a look into another, more literate world than most of us inhabit, which was interesting. His experiences while living abroad were a good vicarious experience for the reader, though the fact that his entire experience seemed submerged in the gay world made it difficult to identify with much of what he was saying, though again, perhaps it was an important vicarious learning experience for most readers."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"This is the majestic second autobiographical novel by Edmund White, told with such elegent honesty that one is simply entranced by each scene.I don't believe that this novel is better in any arguable way than A Boy's Own Story. The first book in White's autobiographical series is just as serious, but less enjoyable, simply because adolescence is SO much more interesting (for me at least) than the childhood White dealt with before. Both books illustrate (with great candor!) their respective periods of life (and the author's specific grappling). But it's just that this is when it &quot;gets good&quot; for me, when the protagonist is more sophisticated.Edmund White paints with honesty a believable portrait of life as he has lived it. Of course, his own experiences differ significantly from certain scenes in his novels, but nonetheless, he writes with blunt honesty, which is often the way we experience life: bluntly. A quote characteristic of White:&quot;Because a novel -these words- is a shared experience, a clumsy but sometimes funny conversation between two people in which one of them is doing all the talking, it will always be tighter and more luminous than that object called living. There is something so insipid about living that to do it at all requires heroism or stupidity, probably both. Living is all those days and years, the rushes; memory edits them; this page is the final print, music added. But for an instant imagine the process reversed, go with me back through the years, then be me, me all alone as I submit to the weight, the atomospheric pressure of youth, for when I was young I was exhausted by always bumping up against this big lummox I didn't really know, myself.&quot;White has a flair for the everyday things. He makes them seem beautiful, horrible; they are the little things, and this author writes them down in their warts-and-all glory.A previous reviewer said that reading this book is much like experiencing a grand opera while sitting in the bathroom, &quot;a darkly exciting, unorthodox and revealing artistic encounter that one would curiously find oneself wanting to revisit&quot;. It's a very insightful comment and best tells the potential reader what he awaits.Edmund White's prose will sweep you along to relive part of his youth along with him. I can say nothing more but read this book!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Reading Edmund White's work is, I suppose, what experiencing grand opera in a latrine would probably be like - a darkly exciting, unorthodox and revealing artistic encounter that one would curiously find oneself wanting to revisit. 'The Beautiful Room Is Empty' - like its successor 'The Farewell Symphony' - is sumptuous, exquisitely paced and compels its possessed possessor to gluttonously read and re-read its skilfully connected, intricately descriptive, abjectly human and majestically imaginative scenes.Xen Andreas"},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Edmund White's 'Beautiful Room' is a moving, wonderful story, crafted around the late teens to late twenties of the narrator, known only as 'Bunny' to his friend Lou, one of the many lively, memorable characters encountered along the way, as well as Tex, a flaboyant bookstore owner, who gives 'Bunny' his earliest education in 'gay slang.''Bunny', at the beginning of the novel, is a prep-school student coming to terms with his homosexuality, by engaging in anonymous sexual encounter after encounter in the boy's bathrooms, where his lovers are seen only from waistline to knees. He dresses and plays the part of the dutiful prep school student by day, but once class is out, he drifts toward the bohemians, gracing the coffee shops of their 1950's and 60's lives, watching them paint, sharing their surrealist literature and poetry, and secretly lusting after the males. A child of divorced parents, his father determined to make a man out of him, his mother convinced that all he needs is a cure, the narrator carries us along on his ride, meeting many notable characters along the way, that shape and influence his gradual acceptance that he is gay.Following his school years, when he enters the work force and the real world, the words of a school-friend come back to haunt him, that 'some day he will have too much freedom,' freedom to choose where he goes, what he does, and who he is. He drifts along from job to job, from lover to lover, Lou, Fred, and the frequent pick-ups from Christoper Street, until he meets Sean, a closeted young man who leads 'Bunny' to question his own identity as they both enter group therapy to try and overcome their 'illness' and go straight, with very different results.Culminating at the famous Stonewall site, Edmund White provides readers with a grand tour-de-force of growing up gay in the 50's and 60's in Chicago and New York.Sometimes poignant, sometimes emotional, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, 'Beautiful Room' is a beautiful book, with a beautiful story to tell. The narrator, presumably White himself, as the book is supposed to be autobiographical, slips from identity to identity as he tries to find his own. Young and unsure of himself, he tries to be what everyone else wants him to be until he finds himself.Although this story centers on a gay man, the book speaks volumes to anyone struggling to find their own identity, and the choices and mistakes we all make along the way."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"The Beautiful Room is Empty by Edmund White is a wonderful additon to the inspired A Boy's Own Story. It is not exactly a sequel but it does loosely form the middle in a semi-autobiographical trilogy (between A Boy's Own Story and A Farewll Symphony). All can be read and enjoyed on their own but also fit together smoothly to take the reader through different times in the life of a gay man. This volume takes the reader from the repressive fifties into the time of Stonewall as the main character grows from a young man in the midwestern college into a gay urbanite going to the gym. The growth of the narrator is more honest and well written than in many gay novels and will resonate with the reader with painful or humourous , at different times, recognition whether he grew up in that era or not. It is a fine novel that plays all the right notes."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"This book is the second in the trilogy beginning with A Boy's Own Story and ending with The Farewell Symphony. To get the full impact,read them in sequence.White is one of the finest writers on his subjects, both in language and content. The era of the 60's from the buttoned down end of the Eisenhower era to the Stonewall Uprising are compellingly seen through one man's eyes. (White was a participant in Stonewall and the book ends on that note.)Read this book and you will learn or remember a lot."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Being in a mood of reverence for Edmund White's biographies of Jean Genet and Marcel Proust and having enjoyed &quot;The Married Man&quot;, I have returned to White's career-making novels and find that they not only withstand the test of time, they are indeed truly even finer novels than remembered. &quot;The Beautiful Room Is Empty&quot; is the best summation of the agonies of growing into adulthood and finding that niche of destiny as any book around. But not only is this one man's journey to self acceptance, it is a journal of sociologic change that peaked in the Stonewall Bar and forever changed the way sexuality is viewed, lived and accepted. White's descriptive powers are at their peak as is his ability to draw characters so believeable that they seem like old personal acquaintances. And they are that....for those who met them in 1988 when this book first burst on the scene. This is history, psychology, a dissection and appreciation about Love all eloquently and entertainingly told by a master craftsman!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Ranked 63 on the 100 best Gay and Lesbian books list. I decided to pick it up thinking it seemed interesting. I had never read anything by White. In short, I was so pleasently surprised. I had tried to read some of his work previously but it seemed quite overwrought. The character in this book (like in any great book) come to life and you (the reader) feel they are tangible / that they exist. As it ends on the night of the Stonewall upriseing I had goosebumps, chills...Some books are so powerful with the feeling they give you. This is one of those books."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"This is the second book in an autobiographical-fiction trilogy by Edmund White. The first book, A Boy's Own Story--was an amazing read, but this sequel turned out to be even better. This picks up shortly after ABOS left off, and continues right up through the riots at Stonewall. I cannot tell you any better about the plot, because, like life in the span it covers, it consists of a great many events. The mood of the book is absorbing, and as beatiful as the tittle (&quot;The Beautiful Room is Empty&quot; is one of the best titles I've heard, along with those like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes.&quot;) It is also an essential work--as all of White's are--in understanding gay literature. White is truly one of the best writers the genre has ever seen, and will be one of the fathers and inspirations of what will come later."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"Edmund White's &quot;The Beautiful Room Is Empty&quot; is an impressive coming of age novel of how young gay bohemians in the arts and literary circle struggled furtively with their secret and self acceptance long before they had the confidence that came with political recognition as a minority group in liberal America to emerge from the closet. So, it shouldn't surprise us to find the narrator and his friends coping with their own sexual condition as a malady, each unconsciously but surely searching for a cure to restore himself to the mainstream. Indeed, with parents like the unnamed narrator's, who can blame them for developing a complex ? The protagonist worries that he isn't thin or handsome enough. His friend, Sean, suspects he isn't intelligent enough. Even Maria, the jokey intellectual, finds herself on shaky grounds, flitting from being a radical activist one day and a sloganeering feminist the next. She only lets her mask slip when she falls briefly in love with Maeve. What's clear is that despite the honesty they uphold with each other, they're in denial over their &quot;condition&quot;. That's why the spectacle of young gay males lining up at public toilets (even school toilets) to indulge their fetish is both sad and funny. That's also why there's an unmistakably celebratory feel about the coming out of the narrator's sister during more progressive times. In her own words, &quot;there's nothing secure about suffering&quot;. The novel ends on a pregnant note of expectation, with the uprising at Stonewall Tavern marking the beginning of the gay movement to gain political rights for itself as a minority group. White is both humourous and serious and his intimate understanding of the subject lends a special authenticity to his writing. &quot;The Beautiful Room Is Empty&quot; may be the second of a three part trilogy but it succeeds well enough on its own. I haven't read either the prequel or sequel but those who have seem to find it even better."},{"Title":"The Beautiful Room is Empty","review":"White is clearly one of the finest prosaists in the last half of the 20th C. America. His mellifluous writing and lucid exposition have earned him the wide respect that he deserves.\\"The Beautiful Room is Empty\\" is a sequel to his earlier \\"A Boy's Own Story,\\" the evolving process of coming-out gay in the Sixties. The first novel scouts the adolescent years; this novel covers early adulthood. Much has changed in the way that people come-out today, versus the time when being gay was stigmatized by everybody. Curing homosexuality was seen as viable by both the queer himself and by the anti-queer establishment. Fortunately, while coming-out may still be a demanding process, it is far less traumatic than a few score ago, because of these earlier pioneers.In an almost plotless chronicle of coming-out, the focus is on the author's first-person's introspection of dealing with himself and the gay world as it was then. The ways in which people connected were far more convoluted, clandestine, and often illegal. It wasn't much of a life, until the Stonewall riots liberated gays from their false imprisonment. It not only opened new avenues by which to meet and socialize, but it also rejected the premise that gays should be neither heard nor seen. The toll these older restrictions had on men and women must have been truly appalling, causing much externalized homophobia to turn inward.To see how far the GLBT community has come in the past 40 years is itself a witness to these earlier pioneers. We owe it to them to hear their story, especially when it's this well-told."},{"Title":"100 Years of Bicycle Component and Accessory Design: Authentic Reprint Edition of The Data Book","review":"The edition of &quot;The Data Book&quot; that I own has all of its text--what little there is--in Japanese. The book is almost all pictures, all of those line drawings, and most from the late French illustrator Daniel Rebour, the best technical illustrator that the bicycle world has ever been blessed with. I am a professional bike mechanic and an amateur custom frame builder who reveres French machines of the 40's to the 60's. Most of the illustrations in this book are from 1948 to 1959--where the chronology stops.

On the surface, this seems like a fairly routine choice, but in the world of Joseph Conrad no choices are ever easy. Readers who come to this novella from HEART OF DARKNESS are well aware that Conrad likes to place hesitancies in the minds of readers, most of which are couched in symbolic language which suggest a tapping into their psyches. In the case of the Captain, his choice is confounded by his perception of the man Leggatt who climbs aboard his ship. As the Captain sees Leggatt, he sees a man who is described in terms of one who is physically incomplete. Leggatt appears to be headless and as he ascends the rope from water to deck, Conrad's imagery suggests a watery re-birth. The Captain sees Leggatt and in the pages that follow calls him terms that circle back to himself: my double, my secret sharer, and my other self. It is clear that in Leggatt the Captain sees more than just a little bit of himself. They went to the same school with the Captain graduating only a few years prior. At this point, Conrad suggests that the Captain's decision not to hand Leggatt over to justice may not be simply a matter of identifying with Leggatt on a superficial level in that they merely share some common traits. With the Captain's heavily symbolic language, Conrad probes more deeply in the Captain's psyche and by extension in the reader's psyche by suggesting that the Captain's willingness to protect Leggatt even at the cost of his own career and the safety of his ship and crew lies in his subconscious linking of himself to Leggatt. For the Captain to hand over Leggatt to the law and to possible execution would be tantamount to being complicit in his own doom. To further complicate matters, on an even more subconscious level, Conrad raises the possibility that there is no Leggatt at all and that their entire relationship, replete with conversation, mutual interaction, and hiding Leggatt in his bathroom may have existed only within the Captain's mind. If this latter interpretation holds water, then in order for the Captain to maintain the illusion of Leggatt's existence, he had to act as if Leggatt truly existed, even to the point of endangering his ship by approaching too close to shore to allow Leggatt to jump off and swim to safety to a nearby isle. Conrad leaves the reader to ponder the state of mind of the Captain. When the Captain sees a floating hat at the end when Leggatt has jumped ship, that hat serves to remind the Captain and possibly the reader as well that the difference between reality and illusion may be no more significant than whether an abandoned hat floats or sinks in a stormy sea."},{"Title":"The Secret Sharer and Other Stories","review":"Conrad knew how to pack a punch in a small number of pages. He knew how to evoke dread. And he knew how to tell a story of the sea. It's not as involved or incredible as Heart of Darkness (but few things written in the English language have ever been)-- this little story about a stowaway is tightly told. Still, it will leave you with an appreciation of the abilities of a master."},{"Title":"The Secret Sharer and Other Stories","review":"The Secret Sharer was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Even though it is really short there is a large amount of importance in every line. Whether its symbolism or some type of hidden meaning its there and it is what makes the book great.Conrad puts you in the mind of of his characters and you seem to experience what they are going through. It gives you the sense that you are right there on the boat with the captain and his hidden passenger. You feel as if your the only one in on there little secret and if they are found out you will be too. Conrad then puts so much description into his characters you can actually get a feeling of what they look like and the way they act. The similarities between the two main characters is so great that at points you can't see a difference between them. This constantly keeps you on your toes and thinking about what is going on.What makes the book though is the symbolism and how much meaning each little thing holds. You can read a paragraph and just take it s a regular story or you can think more into it and it holds so much more. It almost completely changes the way you look at what is happening.This book is definitely worth reading. It makes you appreciate the genius that some people hold in there writing abilities. You will come out of this book with a changed perspective on the way things happen in life."},{"Title":"The Secret Sharer and Other Stories","review":"Contrary to what other reviewers imply, this excellent collection has three of Joseph Conrad's most acclaimed shorter works: The Secret Sharer, Youth, and Typhoon. Anyone who does not have them would do well to get this; it is convenient, and the price is near-unbelievable.\\"The Secret Sharer\\" is one of Conrad's final works of major short fiction and one of his best. It finds him returning to the sea after a long absence and has much of the suspense and adventurous spirit of his early works. Indeed, it may well be his most suspenseful and conventionally entertaining work of all; its influence on later writers is easy to see. This is so much so that it can be enjoyed by nearly anyone on this surface level, but as always with Conrad, there is deep symbolic value. \\"The Secret\\" again dramatizes outsider status, though more subtly and ambiguously than prior works. It also deals with other important themes, including the clash of rules and personal morality, authority vs. individualism, etc.\\"Youth\\" is one of Conrad's most famous and acclaimed stories but is in my view the weak link. Like the better-known \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" it is told by the character Marlow through another first-person narrator, but the plot is more akin to the symbolic, adventure-esque seafaring stories of prior Conrad. There is more traditional excitement and suspense than in most Conrad, especially later work, which may attract those who usually dislike his fiction. However, as nearly always with him, symbolism is the real point. As the title suggests, this is a tale about youth and all it stands for and arguably one of its best literary representations. Marlow recalls the excitement and elation he felt when he first captained a ship, fondly recalling exuberance and navet&eacute; long since lost. However, as so often in such situations, nearly everything goes wrong, and youthful ideals are put to experience's harshly dramatic test. \\"Youth\\" is thus a sort of mini-bildungsroman, though Marlow's mad rush for the symbolic finish at the end of his story proper shows he learned very little at the time. However, he is now wiser and older, and retelling the old story brings several ambivalent feelings. He sees how much he has conventionally grown and learned but cannot help lamenting the loss of idealism that is possible only in youth and that steadily dissipates with age to the extent that it becomes hardly recognizable. Many will unfortunately relate strongly to this, and there is a good dose of Conrad's always beautiful prose and, very unusually for him, even a little humor. \\"Youth\\" would easily be most writers' masterpiece but lacks the scope, ambition, and style of Conrad's best works.Though not Joseph Conrad's most ambitious or important work, Typhoon is a strong short novel that fans will like. Like nearly all Conrad, it can be enjoyed on a very basic level as an exciting adventure. As the title suggests, the majority of the action describes a typhoon's monumental effects, specifically how it impacts a ship. The extended scene portraying it is one of the best of its kind, recalling a similarly strong depiction in The...Narcissus (Amazon won't allow the full title.) We get a powerful impression of nature's astounding force and just how insignificant humanity and its creations can be in the face of it.Engrossing as this is, it is of course really just fodder for Conrad's larger themes, the most immediate being the vast amount of things beyond humanity's control; for all our arrogance, there are many situations where we can do little or no more than sit back - or, in this case, hold on - and hope for the best. Typhoon is also in part a bildungsroman, though a somewhat unconventional one. The middle-aged Captain Macwhirr is ostensibly the protagonist, but the young Chief Mate Jukes takes center stage here. He enters the voyage with a considerable ego and pokes much fun at the literal-minded Macwhirr but comes to see that, for all his eccentricities, the latter's simple practicality, level-headedness, and strict determination are not without worth. Hapless as Macwhirr may be in numerous ways, he succeeds where many - perhaps most - ostensibly more intelligent people would fail. Jukes comes to see his value even if he cannot bring himself to give all deserved credit. The same is true of other characters to a lesser degree. Macwhirr himself also learns something in the course of the tale; though experienced and in many ways competent, he had never sailed through harsh weather and is tested in a way he never thought he would be. His near-surreal stubbornness means he perhaps did not learn nearly as much as he should have, but he made it through after all. Conrad leaves it open whether this is due to subtle strength or pure luck; it is certainly debatable whether Macwhirr is capable and even heroic in his own way or simply a fool. In any case, he and other characters find that, as he repeatedly says, you can't learn everything from books; Conrad leaves no doubt that there is often no substitute for experience.The setting and some of the action are very similar to several other Conrad works, but Typhoon also has its own strengths and is in some ways unusual. For example, characterization is very strong - not in the sense of being rounded, Macwhirr in particular being almost a Dickensian caricature, but in being simply memorable. The characters may be archetypes but are very entertaining - and many readers will see people they know in them. Typhoon is also quite humorous, which is surprising in an author whose humor is nearly always black in the rare cases where it exists at all. Macwhirr is of course the butt of much comic fodder, but there is a light-heartedness to many descriptions outside the central scene. Some, such as those in the sailors' households, have satirical bite, which will please those who miss Conrad's cynicism, but those who normally find him too dark may well be pleasantly surprised overall.This is certainly not Conrad's strongest story; the frustratingly abrupt way in which the storm's second half is passed over even seems to suggest he grew bored with the work and rushed toward the end. I personally think further storm descriptions would have simply been too much, and he perhaps thought so too, but there certainly should have been a less jerky transition. Some will also dislike the indirect narration toward the end, but I found it a successful, if not overly ambitious, experiment from an author renowned for constantly pushing narrative's proverbial envelope. More fundamentally, Typhoon lacks the astonishing psychological depth and dense philosophical dramatization that were always Conrad's top strengths. The latter is here to a certain extent but far less so than elsewhere, automatically putting the book below his best, though some of the other elements partly atone.Anyone at all interested in Conrad should certainly read these works, whether here or elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Secret Sharer and Other Stories","review":"Great book...good overlying story, but there's so much more, dealing with the Captain's &quot;Id&quot; and his initiation (which Conrad believed everyone went through).
