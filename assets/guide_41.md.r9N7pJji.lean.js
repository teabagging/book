Initially, I was concerned that my lack of interest and background in aviation might limit my enjoyment of the book. However, that was not at all the case. Saint-Exupery masterfully brings to life the excitement of aviation and the craft of piloting. Through his series of essays, I gained a great deal of appreciation for his profession, its place in European culture and was captivated all the while. I would highly recommend Wind, Sand and Stars for both young and old."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"A wonderful, wonderful autobiographical work by the French aviation pioneer. Antione de Saint-Exupery was among those first who flew the scheduled air mail runs over the Sahara in the 1920's and 30's. Engine failures, crahses, and falling into the hands of hostile Bedouins was not uncommon. Those stories alone would make for fascinating reading.Add to that the author's genuine talent as a poet philospher, and this is a unique and great piece of historical literature. Saint-Exupery finds magic and value in everything . . . the lights of his primitive dashbord at night, the world scrolling under him while in flight, the hallucinations while dying of thirst face down in the desert sand. And his observations of people! - the love-hate relationship with the Arabs of the desert, a pair of little princesses living in fantastical (because the author makes it so) house in a remote jungle village, the heroics of Spanish revolutionaries and patriots.The adventure aspects rival any fiction I have read . . . flying while held stationary in a tremendous offshore windstorm off the South American coast . . . the magic of nightfall while in flight . . . slamming into the Libyan desert floor while flying blind.As he is wont to do, Saint-Ex frequently treks off into the motivations and worth of mens' efforts, and the human situation in general. But always good stuff, some of it ingenious. Thoughtful, posing many truths and questions.A wonderful work. I had to read it in English, and doubtlessly something has been lost in the translation from French (transl by Lewis Galantiere). Still, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is a beautifully written book exuding a sense of mystery and adventure perhaps no longer possible to experience. Antoine de Saint-Exupery was an aristocrat and pilot who chose to fly lonely postal routes -- a romantic adventurer with incredible sensitivities who was filled with wonder and musings about what he encountered. No one should pass this by. It could be read to a child though it is not a children's story. A popular children's story also written by Saint-Exupery, The Little Prince, was published five years later."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This book makes you very sad to think what happened to Europe during the first half of the twentieth century, that men like this died. Doesn't bear thinking about. This is an excellent translation. A fabulous book; part poetry, philosophy and memoir. One of my very favourites, along with his 'Flight to Arras'. One of the two has a very memorable description of why some people become terrorists (boredom basically)."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Some authors will serve a decent story and nourish a reader's sensibilities adequately enough that the reader feels satisfied to have read it. But Saint-Exupery, in \\"Wind, Sand and Stars,\\" lovingly prepares and serves a sumptuous banquet in his story that not only leaves us readers feeling very well nourished, but also immerses us in the sensual pleasure of tasting and savoring the dishes he sets before us.If your literary taste runs to the gourmet, read this book."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"the first and last chapters were philosophical reviews of life (comparing the exciting aspects of flying which makes life seem so vibrant) against the mundane life of bureaucrats and peasants who live and die without seeing the world (as he does from the air). A line in the closing chapter is poignant: the infant that he is sitting next to has the potential to be anything and everything; but due to its parents and its probable future life, it wont ever realize its potential (they killed Mozart).the second to last chapter is a number of stories of the war in Spain (Franco; remember this was written about the late 1920s to the 1930s), with people fighting; it's a social commentary on war from the perspective of life and death (and has NOTHING to do with flying). This is a very long chapter (50 pages out of a 229 page book) and I was disappointed because I was'nt into reading about this.all the other chapters were of flying (and crashing, such as surviving in the desert), were good, and I wished there were more of them.overall, its an uneven book because it covers more areas than just flying (or even flying from the perspective of life & death). As a recommendation, I could take it or leave it."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This book is a gem. I was lucky enough to find a copy a great used book store and have treasured it. Knowing how he died it is especially poignant to read his experiences flying in the early days of flight through fantastic countryside. You will love this book."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is quite a famous book and well received generally. The language is very poetical and the metaphors beautiful.Besides being a thoughtful individual what struck me most about Exupery was his sensitivity to all around him. He has many perspicacious observations about humanity. The famous quote (paraphrased here).. love does not consist of looking at each other, but looking together in the same direction.. is from this book.Many times the author's views are hard to comprehend..That might be due to the structuring of the writing or just inadequacy on my part!Overall a very beautiful book opening up the brave world of early flying."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"\\"a sheaf, a bouquet . . . of the sensations, emotions and reflections of the airman; something akin to what Conrad's admirable Mirror of the Sea is for the sailor\\" -- the airplanes and flying are, once again, only the vehicle: this book is for the voyager, whether traveling over oceans, desserts, mountains, or through an uncelebrated but wide-eyed life.Most famous for his children's tale The Little Prince, the author was also an accomplished pilot in the early days of \\"air mail\\". His stories of flying across the deserts of Northern Africa and the mountains of South America are full of thought and feeling, a \\"mile-high\\" perspective on the natural world. He wrote, \\"It is not with metal that the pilot is in contact . . . It is thanks to the metal, and by virtue of it, that man rediscovers nature . . .\\" For example, he mentions that only after flying over so much of the world did he appreciate what a small percentage of it -- and not just the oceans, but the land -- is habitable. A simple thought, but when it comes after descriptions of the barren lands of southern Chile and the uncaring mass of the Andes, the simple thought impresses a complex image.And it's just beautifully written, plain language that flows like poetry."},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Appellate Advocacy (Coursebook Series)","review":"I had to buy this book for class, but I was silly and got the wrong edition.

This book explores the mental processes between dominant and submissive with great tenderness. Not a book on protocol, this concerns real world relationships."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"There are a lot of 5 star ratings for this book and yet a lot of people reading them said they weren't very helpful. I hope that helps mitigate what people are mistaking as praise for this book. I have to agree with another reviewer who remarked about the typos in too many places. While this might be forgiveable in a first edition and I highly stress the word might, it is unacceptable in a second edition. Although the book jacket hypes the Ph.D. of John Warren, this is anything but a scholarly book. In one of the unnecessary appendices, Mr. Warren uses to term idosyncratic. I guess that would describe this book. It seems like a random collection of thoughts hastily thrown together and, at least to me, seems more the subject for a vanity press than anything else. John Warren is definitely full of himself and what he feels is his expertise. I think the added publication, in yet another appendix of raw survey data without any analysis was meant to reinforce the validity of his statements. His partner's contribution is little more than touchy feely new-age crap and cheesy song titles that only demonstrate their lack of knowledge of good music. I gave it 3 stars although maybe 2 or 2.5 would be sufficient. This book is a quick easy read and, by and large, harmless but it is a far cry from a definitive introduction into the world of BDSM. I gave it 3 stars because the blurb on the back cover states that this book \\"offers the greatest breadth of subject of any basic BDSM guide available today,\\" which I guess basically means that it touches on everything but really does nothing very well."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"I have spent the last twenty years dabbling in the art of BDSM.

That's all it is thoughm a beginners book. If you're looking for something more in-depth, then this book will do nothing but disappoint you. I ordered this book along with Different Loving.

His experience has given him the wisdom that he passes to his readers in this fine book."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book is an excellent resource for any man or woman involved with a dominant person, one that guides & informs. Excellent & easy reading for the bdsm novice & experienced alike. This is one of the first books you should buy."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"*The Loving Dominant*, by John and Libby Warren, is one of those titles that inevitably come up in any discussion of BDSM nonfiction, and for good reason. John Warren is an experienced player with an engaging and highly personal writing style. His prose is colorful and easy to read, and he fills the pages with amusing, arousing, inspiring, and illustrative anecdotes from his own experience and that of his friends. Unlike many authors, Warren explores the psychological landscape and possibilities of BDSM as extensively as the physical skills and techniques; being myself far more drawn to the mental and emotional aspects of dominance and submission than to the pleasures of kinky sex per se, I was delighted to find a book with this particular emphasis. Although I am a submissive with no interest in switching, I appreciate the existence of a book like this addressed directly to dominants and their special needs and concerns. My husband/Master has sworn by this book for years, as have many of my dominant friends.I do have a few minor quibbles, however. Although I enjoyed the psychological emphasis in Warren's exploration of BDSM, I was rather disappointed that his focus was much more on the experience of play than the dynamics of a D/s relationship outside the bedroom or dungeon. I'd hoped a book with a title like *The Loving Dominant* would deal more with the kind of relationship that I'm in, a lifetime commitment in which our D/s dynamic enters (in theory at least) as much into the most mundane concerns of life as into our lovemaking. (Of course, since 24/7 relationships are relatively rare even in the world of BDSM, few potential readers may see this as a drawback.) I was also disappointed by the portion of the book written by Libby, supposedly exploring her own experiences and mindset as a submissive woman. I found very little in her words that I could relate to, which is fine - Libby and I are two separate people. I just hate to think that a dominant might read this and think that the motivations and desires of which she speaks are somehow essential to, or even typical of, the submissive mindset. I was particularly annoyed by the section in which John Warren explores the reasons a person might want to be submissive. I'm sure there are some submissives out there who are powerful people in their everyday life who enjoy letting go of responsibility for a little while, and I'm sure there are some who take pleasure in submission because it relieves them of feelings of guilt about enjoying their sexuality, but I don't fit into either of those groups and I'm tired of listening to people try to gloss over the complexity of my nature with pat explanations.On the whole, if you're willing to overlook a few weak passages (and some very poor editing), you'll find *The Loving Dominant* a worthy addition to your BDSM bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"If you are new to the world of BDSM, or know someone who is, and you or they have questions, this is a good book to start reading to get some of the answers. It is not the most comprehensive book on the subject, but it was not intended to be. It is a book for people to read, learn at a basically introductory level, and feel comfortable about themselves and their desires. I have recommended it to many people and all have enjoyed it.The author is a very well respected contributor to the national BDSM community."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"Informative without being preachy, this book provides a good basis for self-evaluation, if you are either in the D/s lifestyle or considering exploring that side of your sexuality. NOT JUST FOR DOMS, THOUGH! submissives need to read this and realize what they can expect from a quality, loving Dominant is not torture, but release and power..."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"John Warren's updated version of the book that made his name known in the SM scene worldwide is definitely worth a peek! His years of experience, as well as his skill in reporting and writing make this one of the books that should be a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone beginning to experiment with this intense, but often overwhelming and confusing lovestyle.While there are many great introductory-level books on SM on the shelves, Mr. Warren covers many often-neglected areas of SM in his book. He discusses some of the spiritual aspects of Dominance &amp; submission, with input from his wife, Libby; and also discusses some forms of psychological trickery that dominants can use to make their play more exciting, and also some ways to make some of the edgier forms of play safe for all participants. This books fills in some of the gaps in others.All in all, a worthwhile addition to the collection!"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"i think this is the book to read from whichever side of the power exchange you find yourself. its discussion of the lifestyle is so comprehensive, i respectufully suggest that even if you're not a beginner you will find value in its pages. i recommend it to submissives, for personal reading and to keep it (or have an extra copy) handy so that when you mention the title in conversation you may gently offer, 'Sir, i have a copy of the book to lend if You would like ...'. please watch for this to come back in print, and grab it! :-)"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"... I find his ethos completely credible. Certainly his range of experience and his resulting expertise can't be doubted; Warren has been in the community for many years and knows whereof he speaks. It's particularly interesting reading for those new to the scene; both dom and sub will learn a lot from Warren's upfront, knowledgeable, humble (Mentor?? Humble??) approach. And he isn't a bad writer, either, on top of it all.I'm glad the book is available, and it would be a shame if anyone believed the personal attacks on Warren's character and didn't read the book because of them. An evil array of consensual head games to play with subs, constant reminders of safety, discussions of the various elements of the scene, and Libby's chapter on submission are invaluable for the newbie and the expert alike. Thanks to John Warren for making his undeniable expertise available."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"BDSM is a touchy subject at best - and those of the Real Life Scene World who do practice what they preach ... are often reluctant to write about it. This reluctance stems from the very same attitude expressed by the wannabe's and commentators who try to pick apart the grammar and lack of cohesion in plot development, in a book that has no plot, because it is not fiction.I found The Loving Dominant to be an extraordinary book in explaining the facts of life in a new kind of society to newcomers to the BDSM Lifestyle, and while Mr. Warren's writing style could use some professional polish, it is easily apparent that what he writes is from the heart, coupled with years of experience in helping newcomers. ... Mr. Warren and his book are a Class Act in the truest noble sense of the word Class."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"The Loving Dominant has long been one of the standard books that teach how to make D/s work for you.

Easy to read, full of great ideas that run the gamut from fun and light-hearted to heavy and edgy; a must-have!"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"John Warren, an experienced Scene player, writes a comprehensive and helpful guide to BDSM that should be required reading for anyone who has an interest in this lifestyle. It's filled with valuable information for everyone from the newest newbie to the most jaded professional. This book opened all sorts of new horizons for me, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"Warren presents this book as largely a primer on BDSM. Indeed, it's ideal for a newcomer to the scene. If you are more familiar with BDSM, you'll still find enough fresh ideas to make the book worthwhile. Warren's upbeat, almost breezy voice makes it a very enjoyable read, too."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book definitely lends itself as a \\"how-to.\\" Not necessarily in the way that it gives you a step by step lesson in how to domme someone in a specific scene but it is more of a lesson in how to achieve a safe, sane, and consensual domme/sub relationship. I feel like a lot of books lately have given the impression that a BDSM relationship is more about hate than love. This book definitively does NOT do that."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"Warren's highly personalized approach is enjoyable, and his dominant personality leaps from the pages (he's sure to point out the chapter written by a submissive was \\"at [his] request\\").The title tells the rest.However, numerous typos and other minor issues pop up at annoying times."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book is good for a beginner because it gives you a more philosophical view of being in a sub/dom relationship.

Excellent introduction and good reference text. The book gives an in depth review of the dominant's role, gives a good picture of the BDSM scene and gives a good overview of the various tools / techniques. It also offers additional reading resources on individual topics. Well done."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"Finally a book that isn't just BDSM 101. This book really closes the divide on creative instinct...gathering ideas and building the frame of mind needed once you have your submissive. Passing the basics,(which most books spend nearly 50% of the material on and thank God this one just has a list of references if you need the basics), I felt I could finally get a bit more of a hold on the PRACTICE of bdsm, not just the knowledge. A great book if you are ready to apply the heart of bdsm with the practice. Beautiful book, thank you."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book has some very good information and the author is very experienced in all things S&M but the lack of photos and/or diagrams is very disappointing. Trying to learn about decorative bondage from text on paper is ridicules, and the knots illustrated won't do much good to a novice unless they are shown in the context of actually restraining someone. I would strongly recommend \\"screw the roses send me the thorns\\" or \\"sm 101\\" as a first book."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This is an excellent how-to guide for BDSM scenes and activities. It provides good practical advice for safe and enjoyable play. It also provides some social advice about BDSM clubs and such. It doesn't provide much relationship or out-of-the-bedroom advice."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This is a very good book that is quite helpful.

Redundancy abounds as case after case leaves you glassy eyed begging on bended knee for it all to end. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. I give it two stars for the sheer skill of Mr. Warren, a pompus egomanic, but shrewd marketeer. To bad he can't write."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"this is a topaz book so it won't go on my reader; no way to cancel the purchase; got screwed by Amazon again..."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"I have read many books on &quot;how to&quot; for D/s. No book combines the physical and mental/emotional aspects of D/s so well. And for D/s, the importance of emotions and feelings cannot be overstressed. The comprehensive treatise on safety deals with psychological safety as well as phsyical safety - something that, while desperately needed, has been overlooked in most other attempts at this very difficult subject. Yes, BDSM is a difficult undertaking as it requires not only deep knowledge but even deeper caring and ethics. Knowing that your Dominant is concerned and knowledgable in, and for safety, will create a bond of trust. A big step for a lasting relationship! The section written BY a submissive is a stroke of genius for the purposes of providing the submissive POV. Imagine! a book that tries to teach the Dominant what a submissive sees and feels. Understanding the submissive mind is a powerful tool for a Dominant that truly cares.I would combine this book with Jay Wiseman's &quot;S/M-101&quot; as the foundation for a beginners' entry into Domination and submission. Seeing these two books on the shelf of a Domme will perk my interest in persuing a relationship. In closing: I would expect any &quot;Loving Dominant&quot; to have their submissive(s) read these two books.Sincerely:Tom"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This is the question John Warren asks in Chapter 2 of this book and if you're a Dominant, it's a very good question to ask yourself. This book is an excellent introduction to the 'kinky world' some of us live in from time to time.While there are numerous other excellent SM books on the market, John's book covers topics not normally covered in other &quot;introductory SM books, like how to act at a play party, and taking memorable pictures of your own private scenes. Also included are sections on First Aid, &quot;Stalking the Wild Submissive,&quot; (very important!) and ways to do scenes that are exciting both for the Dominant and the submissive.I felt the chapter that John's wife, Libby wrote (A Submissive Writes About Submission) gives an excellent insight for Dominants into what (at least for her) submission means and what it's about.This book's second edition is now available on Greenery Press and it's an excellent addition to any kinkster's library, whether they are Dom, sub, or switch.Also recommended: SM101 by Jay Wiseman; Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns by Philip Miller &amp; Molly Devon"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This is a great book for the beginner and the expert alike. Warren approaches the subject of BDSM with humor, seriousness, safety in mind, and perhaps most of all a love of the subject. The book has obviously been well researched and well written. It is a no non-sense work in which aspects of BDSM are covered. Whether it be games to play in the playroom like whipping or bondage to the intricate relationship between a dominant and their submissive. I had a great time reading this book and I learned a lot about the subject. I would highly recommend this book to anyone at all even remotely interested in BDSM. In fact I would have given this book 5 stars but for one reason, whoever was the proofreader missed so many obvious spelling and punctuation errors that it continually drove me to distraction. I would be avidly reading a section and then WHAM, a spelling mistake. The first few times I ignored it, after that it got really annoying. Grammatical errors aside, I would still recommend this book to anyone and in fact already have recommended it to several of my friends. My copy is currently on loan to a friend in Indiana (and I am not sure that I will ever get it back, he said he wanted to borrow it to a friend in Michigan). A great book to read on your own, with a playmate, or with a spouse. It will give you a lot of ideas and probably make your life just a little bit more kinky!"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to those seeking to explore their dominant side. It is quite clear how John Warren earned his name of &quot;Mentor&quot;. His love and caring for the women in his life shines off of every page in the book. The book serves not only as a wonderful technical book, it serves as a benchmark of what a good &quot;Master&quot; should be. In many ways I found that to be the best part of this book, it clearly shows that healthy loving relationships can exist in this scene. Because of his sensativity, I found this book to be a wonderful way to introduce women to the &quot;scene&quot;. A wonderful read and a must have in any good library."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"Mr. Warren is an extremely talented author and knowledgeable about his subject. This is one of the most informative and helpful books out there to date, an excellent source not only for the &quot;old-timers&quot; in the alternative lifestyle, but for those who are simply seeking knowledge and information in their quest to learn as well as to make informative decisions in their choices. He is a highly respected member of the lifestyle and most helpful to newcomers. &quot;The Loving Dominant&quot; is one of the definitive guidebooks. I highly recommend it, don't miss out!"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"The Loving Dominant is not just for the novice and experienced dominant player. It is also for the submissives, masochists, and bottoms within the scene.This book is a valuable resource for those of us into submission and masochism. It allows us to look at BDSM from the top perspective and learn more about what we enjoy having done to us. This book delves into it all from knots, safer techniques, first-aid, various forms of play, consent, to submission written from the submissive point of view.Whether you are new or experienced, dominant or submissive, you will learn a ton from John Warren's superbly written book. And, if you are submissive and ever asked &quot;How do I know if I am with an experienced dominant or with a safe player?&quot; then look here. It can't answer it all, but it gives you a good look at how an experienced and safe dominant plays.I love the book and will recommend to anyone interested in BDSM."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"I bought this book for my husband, a budding dominant. Thanks to John Warren, he is now a budding Loving Dominant. My husband had to fight me (a submissive) for reading time though, because I was continually amazed at how well Mr. Warren knew my own heart, someone he has never met! His expertise at illuminating the all-too-often 'dark' world of BDSM is refreshing - finally, a book that addresses the needs, wants, and desires of dominants while adeptly expressing the viewpoint of the submissive. I would recommend it to any dominant, regardless of experience. the insight into the submissive nature is amazing."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"I have read this book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it for anyone interested in their Dominant or submissive tendencies. It can really help you sort out where you fit into the BDSM lifestyle and where it fits into your life. It has lots of ideas for play as well as how to bring up the subject with your significant other."},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"&quot;The Loving Dominant&quot; is the first of two titles I offer to persons who are curious about the world of Bondage, Dominance, Submission and Masochism. It was my own guidebook from the realm of my own imagination into the reality of a sexual subculture which is often sensationalized and vilified.Mr. Warren's considerable experience, his observation over years in &quot;the Scene,&quot; are invaluable. He leads the reader to the self-examination which is key to safety and pleasure, and includes a great deal of practical information often difficult for the novice to find. As I am myself submissive, I found the chapter by Mr. Warren's wife most helpful.The writing style is fluid, the content is accurate, and the perspective is remarkably objective. Mr. Warren writes without pretension. Those who wish to explore alternative sexuality are fortunate indeed to have such a &quot;Mentor&quot; so readily to hand!"},{"Title":"The Loving Dominant","review":"This book was read and practically worshipped by my significant other during the time that we were together. At the time, I never had the chance to read it myself, but even though much of the information that was contained in it would be assumed to be stuff she knew long before, she kept coming out with tidbits from that book that continued to inspire her.Years later, I managed to come across the book myself and read it. There are some great things in there. I've been a regular writer and reader of much of the literature in this field for many years now, and I can say without a doubt that many of us hold this author in great esteem because of works like this one. The book has a lot to offer for everyone, including people who are just exploring the scene and those who have been part of the scene for most of their adult lives."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"Steely Dan are noted for their exacting and meticulous recording style. Unfortunately 'Reeling In The Years' by Brian Sweet is written in almost the complete opposite of Steely Dan's style. Long on gossip and hazy recollections by Steely Dan alumni Sweet's account never gives us what we want: Steely Dan!After informing us that he could not get any interviews with either of Steely Dan's principals Walter Becker or Donald Fagen in his preface, (&quot;for reasons best known only to themselves, Becker and Fagen, declined to be interviewed despite several earnest requests.&quot;),Sweet then spends the next 36 pages detailing Fagen's childhood (but not Becker's), the songwriters school days at Bard College and then a long study of a terrible film the duo wrote the score for in 1971 ('You Gotta Walk It, Like You Talk It'..so bad that it's never been aired on tv).One of the things that die hard 'Dan fans hoped for before this book came out was a detailed account of how and when the group came into being when they were signed by ABC Dunhill Records in 1971. Despite lots of details and a plethora of non-source credited quotes (in fact none of the quotes in the entire book are sourced!)the reader will still come away somewhat confused as to how the original group (which toured for three years) was first assembled. Sweet himself seems confused, on p. 40 he states that Denny Dias, a longtime guitarist for the band, was the first to join the band. Five pages later he states that the group had already recorded and released their first songs before Dias had &quot;yet to arrive in California.&quot;Aside from compiling a sloppy chronology Sweet gives off obsessive tones with comments like &quot;What more do they want?&quot; as he demands they release a new album in his introduction. Later he takes on the roll of psychologist with, &quot;Fagen seemed to be blaming his parents and the American lifestyles in the Fifties for his thirtysomething creative problems.&quot; What lifestyles of the 1950's were a! ffecting Fagen some 30 years later one can only guess but Sweet seems confident in telling us the true psyche of this person he's never interviewed.Now I don't blame all of these faults with the book on the writer..... But what you get is a half baked account, slapped together (complete with a picture of Donald Fagen in kindergarten)for a quick buck....maybe Fagen and Becker are saving their version of the Steely Dan story for Hollywood!....I can see it 'Steely Dan: The Trip We Made To Hollywood..(and back)!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"While British author Brian Sweet should be commended for compiling the first ever account of Steely Dan in book form, the publishers should have realized that Sweet was not a first rate author. Or a writer in the usual sense..he was the creator of a sloppy fanzine that even to diehard Steely Dan fans was both obsessive and idiotic. Omnibus perhaps should have subtitled this 'A Britsh fans' view of Steely Dan' for it is quite ironic that Steely Dan, perhaps the most American of all the great 1970's bands, has yet to be recognized by the US rock historians. While Sweet does fill in some of the holes in the early Steely saga he spends too much time on banal trivia, is it really important that we know what color tie Fagen &amp; Becker's first manager was wearing when he met them? Did we really need a picture of Donny Fagen age 12? The publishers should have realized that they had hired an adoringfan of the composers and not a writer or researcher. My father said that you can alwaysjudge a book by its index and bibliography...this book has neither...no index + no bibliography= sloppy writing...Steely Dan deserve better."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"This biography of Walter Becker and Donald Fagan is loaded with interesting information about the lives and near maniacal recording practices of Steely Dan. I believe this is the pretty much the only biography of Steeley Dan available and as a huge fan I could not put the book down. Note, however, that great literature this is not. The book is extremly poorly written, bordering on offensive at times, but the content more than makes up for it."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"A mishmash of speculation, hearsay and interviews taken from uncredited sources, Sweet's book will probably still find a fascinated audience among most hardcore Danfans. Those who are well-read in the interviews of ex-band members and related studio guys will instantly recognize many of the quotes in this work, however Sweet does not credit any of the actual sources of these quotes and would lead the less investigative reader to believe he spoke with many of these musicians himself (instead of simply culling the quotes from Modern Drummer or Guitar Player). In that regard it is somewhat of a hack job. The writing style itself is somewhat poor, and there are some embarassing factual errors. All this said, I'll admit I gobbled it up, simply because I was it does provide a hearty dose of Dan information and folklore in one convenient package."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"Guessing a book's ambitions for itself typically is a matterof reading its forward. Despite his catchy title, BrianSweet's forward does and, alas, MUST stipulate that he couldnot convince Steely Dan's key members to participate in thethe production of &quot;Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years.&quot; As weare soon to learn, the characteristic retiscence with,occasional manipulation of, and general disdain for popularmedia by Mr.s Fagen and Becker are an essential part of theexposition of this &quot;band.&quot; If J.D. Salinger has a musicalcounterpart, it is Donald Fagen, and perhaps Walter Becker isa psychedelic Hemingway. In either case, the deliberate, ifuncalculated, mystery of Steely Dan is Sweet's most obvious&quot;take&quot; on the Fagen/Becker collaboration. Anyone who has anabiding interest in the work of either of these figures knowsthis full well, but one cannot blame Sweet for thematizing it.As a result, Sweet must rely on an assemblage of extant pressaccounts and interviews, which really turns the book into asecond order cut and paste job. This said, however,what &quot;Reelin' in the Years&quot; does successfully is lay out somebasic facts about the band in chronological order, using anapt phrase or song title to characterize each period. Thispresentation is satisfactory, but perhaps avoids the mostdifficult interpretive work to be done here: Namely, to dosome enjoyable figuring on just what the hell is going on withthe music. It is true that &quot;Only a Fool&quot; would pretend to getat anything like an &quot;essence&quot; here, if for no other reasonthan there ain't one to get. Nevertheless, as unprecendentlypostmodern and ironist as Steely Dan was (and, incidentally,the solo Donald Fagen of &quot;Nightfly&quot; and &quot;Kamakiriad&quot; wascertainly not), there are chunks of coherency and discernibleirreverency in the lyrics and particularly the music of SteelyDan that is there for the taking, the surface of which Sweetreally does not limn. Incidentally, if you want a coherent,third order, take on the history of the band, listen to&quot;Kamakiriad&quot; with Sweet's account in mind--the clues areeverywhere--Fagen denials notwithstanding. For example, thefact that Becker lives in Hawaii and Fagen in NYC is notentirely inconsistent with &quot;Kamakiriad's&quot; first cut about a&quot;Trans-Island Skyway.&quot; But even though it is intriguing tothink about &quot;Kamakiriad&quot; as a Freudian prelude to Steely Dan's&quot;rebirth,&quot; this is not an objective exam and will not begraded. This is another way of saying that I wish Sweet haddone less to try to &quot;find&quot; a coherency in what were highlycontingent, accident-ridden, and thoroughly brilliant years ofsongwriting and studio sessions. Instead, I'd like to seewhat he makes of what Becker and Fagen assembled. This said,I think Sweet has skillfully begun excavation on a site wherethe artifacts are never quite stable in shape or location.&quot;Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years&quot; whets the appetite andmakes me look forward to the next dig."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"If genius is infinite attention to detail then Fagan and Becker approach the mark. Even though the book is not up to literary snuff it provides insight into the technique's and attention of which &quot;Dan&quot; songs are infused. The constant striving for new sounds and the exhausting &quot;takes&quot; from different artists suggests why intelligent fans remain a constant in the band's orbit. We continue to look forward to new revelations about the awkward duo, the posterboys for workaholic musicians anonymous."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"This book written by a man who publishes a UK-based fanzine about Steely Dan goes a long way in explaining the lives and times of the two men responsible for the band, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. While other reviewers of this book may complain that neither of them were interviewed for this book (not that Becker &amp; Fagen would have anyway, given their notorious dislike for interviews), Brian Sweet still does a fine job in detailing the band's history and the &quot;bios&quot; of both men.It's interesting to read about the things going on during the recording of the Dan's early albums, numerous stories and anecdotes are contained in the book; and also the personality &quot;quirks&quot; of Becker &amp; Fagen. Also interesting are the supposed meanings behind so many of the group's cryptic lyrics. While it's nice to have some sort of idea what a song is based on, too much interpretation will only drive you crazy in the long run (at least in my opinion). The book continues on through the &quot;breakup&quot; of Steely Dan in 1981, the &quot;drought&quot; that any 'Dan' fan suffered through the 80s as Becker &amp; Fagen found other creative projects to work on and the joy we all felt when we found out the &quot;band&quot; was back together in the early 1990s.While this updated edition of the 1994 release doesn't really tell too much about what the guys have been doing since '94, it does give a good history up to that point. I feel after having read this book that now I have some small sense of what Becker and Fagen are like. Any Steely Dan fan who wants to learn more about the band's history should go out and grab this book if they haven't done so already."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"I can not understand why everyone is complaining about the writing style of this book. I think it is presented quite well. I would like a little more information on certain songs. However, any reader can really get a good feel that Becker and Fagen are two quirky individuals who can really write great music. The reader gets a good background of the original band members without becomming overly detailed. Whereas the writing style is not down right exciting, it matter of factly presents Becker and Fagen as the two talented but oddball musicians that they are. Well done Mr. Sweet."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"If you're looking for information about Steely Dan, we can assume that you're either (1) a Baby Boomer or (2) a musically inclined teenager/twenty-something who is doing serious research about 1970's music. As a member of the \\"Boomers\\", Steelye Dan's music became hard-wired into my brain as a result of listening to their LP's for countless hours. Sweet's book is just about the only resource out there about this great group. Buy it.Walter Becker and Donald Fagen are pranksters who rarely gave interviews. When they did talk, they liked telling fibs, intentionally to mislead the interviewer. These guys are two slippery dudes to write about.I think that Brian Sweet did a great job referencing this book. Even though Sweet wasn't able to interview Becker and Fagen, he interviewed a whole lot of people who have known them and have worked with them. He has compiled information from many articles. And what if Sweet had obtained an interview with B&F;? No doubt they would have fed Sweet a scam of lies, laughing \\"sucker!\\" behind his back. It was probably best to write about B&F; as though they're dead, just to keep the facts straight.The only critism I have of Sweet's book is extremely minor: He says that the song \\"Through With Buzz\\" on \\"Pretzel Logic\\" was Steely Dan's worst. Give me a break! That was a very cool song, a lot like the Electric Light Orchestra's stuff. Somebody has to defend this song!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"A fascinating insight into the minds of two of America's finest songwriters. With tips and insights into how they created such marvelous music. You can visualise their studio techniques and tricks used in classic songs like Showbiz Kids and Babylon Sisters. Read the book then listen to their songs and you will hear them differently. Knowing the pain and hard work that went into creating make the songs even more special.If you are into steely dan you will love this. If you are not into them or have never heard them, you don't know what you are missing. This is the place to start. GET INTO SOME DAN NOW!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"When Brian Sweet approached Donald Fagen and Walter Becker about writing an Authorized Biography, they reportedly told him, \\"Write it as though we are dead.\\" They wanted nothing to do with it. Sweet's only alternative was then to interview people equipped with self-serving, flawed and, at worst, apocryphal tales. Interviewing Donald's family aside, Sweet was left with gaping holes and apparently filled in the blanks. The result barely rises to the level of elementary school term-paper fiction, for there are gaping holes in his writing style as well. Note how many times the writing style and tones shift. His lack of command of the fundamentals of writing makes this a laughably disastrous romp that is, ironically, in stark contrast to D&W's sterling polish. If you're an obsessive Dan fan and must read this, you'll learn a little bit about Donald from his mother and get a few cool pictures, but take the rest with a grain of salt. I hope there will someday be a memoir that gives an accurate account of the history of Steely Dan. This highly dubious, spurious and egregious farce, however, is NOT it."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"All the complaints - Hey...it's only one book.And face it...Fagen is the voice of Steely Dan ; he's gonna get a bit more attention than Becker.

I think one reviewer compared their music to a velvet glove wrapped around a brass-knuckled hand.Be that as it may, Dan fans will eat this stuff up (I did) It's mostly a compilation of published and bradcast interviews with a little heresay thown in for good measure.Ironically, Brian Sweet criticizes a 1979 or 1980 Time magazine article for not actually interviewing Becker or Fagen. He doesn't either!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"Do you want to know everything there is to know about Steely Dan short of kidnapping Becker and Fagen, putting a gun to their heads and forcing them to talk? Then get this book. As you might expect, Becker and Fagen (B&amp;F) refused to talk to the author, Brian Sweet. To put together this history of Steely Dan, he ransacked every published interview and magazine article, and interviewed many of the musicians and recording personnel that worked with B&amp;F. He then wrote everything out in chronological order in a prose style that is barely above \\"workmanlike.\\" This book seems to describe everything that is known about B&amp;F. He has little insight into the jealously guarded minds of B&amp;F and he does not speculate. The bottom line is that we are all forced by the consistent and long-term strategies of B&amp;F to confront the carefully crafted music they have recorded without insight into the motivations and personal lives that brought that music into existence. This focus on the art and not the artists must be seen as a positive by Steely Dan fans or else the frustrations become overwhelming. And for me, the tremendous music they recorded is enough, but I admit, I really enjoyed learning the history that Brian Sweet had to tell. Perhaps someday we will get an in-depth, authorized biography of B&amp;F. Until then, this book will have to do."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"I have been a huge Dan Fan since the early 70's; my adoration for these guys has always remained strong, so this is a great unauthorized book about what goes on behind the scenes,, and what these two great talents are really like.

I just wanted all of the Dan fans to know that there is a DVD out there which I bought (probably here) several years ago, which does interview Fagan and Becker, which probably contains similar information in this book.

The author admits not interviewing the principals during the course of writing this book, and has to rely on a lot of second hand information. For this reason, one can not take everything too seriously. There were a few grammatical errors in the text as well, but considering the author was based in the U.K., I don't really know what may be correct in their determination. I found it an informative and entertaining book, but it would have been better to hear from Donald and Walter in the first person."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"&quot;Steely Dan : Reelin' In The Years&quot; by Brian Sweet is absolutely PERFECT, regardless of what any critic has written. It provides an extremely detailed look into the many ups and downs the band has endured, including plenty of rare photos not seen anywhere before, and gives us an essential, behind the scenes look at the admirable, perfectionistic recording habits of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, unquestionably two of the most intelligent recording artists ever to survive into the new millenium. I can't believe that the author is being criticized for not interviewing Becker and Fagen for the book. He explains that he tried to get their input. HE HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE FACT THAT THEY WOULDN'T TALK, AND HE PUT TOGETHER A WONDERFUL BOOK REGARDLESS!! THAT IS WHAT I CALL A DEDICATED AUTHOR! Do yourself a favor and get this book while it is still available!!!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"Pretty interesting book. Good book for Dan fans.

Too much musical jargon without any translation for the common man."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"Not enough recording details for me. Several pages on the 1968-1972 period, but not enough detail to put the Becker-Fagen \\"demos\\" into chronological order.

I read it while I was on a beach vacation, listening to the music on my ipod as I was reading about it. It was about as close to being there with them as I could get. It was also great learning more about the reclusive duo and how they, like the true artists they are, were always so much more about the music than about the rock & roll lifestyle. I was also able to get a better sense of their personalities and how they were able to translate their amazing story-telling skills into music.I AM SO GLAD that Brian Sweet wrote this book, authorized or not. Being able to read an entire book devoted to my favorite musicians was, as I said before, a TRUE JOY!"},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"This book is a keeper for any Dan Fan. Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I would like to have learned even more personal information about the &quot;mystery men&quot; behind, in my humble opinion, the &quot;Coolest Group Ever.&quot; Their lives and personal relationships, when not involving their music, is glossed over, almost as an afterthought. It was interesting, however, to get a glimpse of what in the world some of their songs are really about and how my original interpretation differed. This book may be, in some respects, a lightweight. But for the true-blue Dan Fan, it's the only game in town."},{"Title":"Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years","review":"This book is compelling reading for the serious Steely Dan fan. However, one must take it with a grain of salt, as the dynamic duo weren't involved in the book project at all. The mystique of Becker and Fagen represent part of their attraction, after all, and their legendary reclusiveness permeates this book. This reader noted a few glaring errors in grammar, and perhaps typos, but considering it's British authoring, it may be correct as far as the King's English goes. A good read nonetheless...I am glad I read it, however, as it seems to answer some of the nagging questions all Dan fans ask. Buy it with confidenc, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"More than numbers","review":"I was asked to read this book (along with several others from this author), by a friend. I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the mark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head. This is another preacher trying to convince others that having large numbers of congregants equates to God's blessing. This is another lie that does not line up with the Bible or true Christianity. This is once again not a true picture of how Church is described in the Bible nor does it deliver a good explanation of the Gospel message."},{"Title":"Murder for Breakfast","review":"I found this book at an antique store for $2.00, and bought because of the very dramatic cover and because I like mysteries from the 30's. The story itself is well written and reflects the time and language of 1930's America. The descriptions and characters are exaggerated but fun to watch. The detective is not a superbrain. He is a regular person thrown into the position of solving the murder. If you like old time mysteries with strange characters living in a strange big house with secrets and plot twists- this book is for you. The book is best visualed in black and white."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Very different from all other James Patterson books I have read. I thoroughly enjoyed it, couldn't put it down once I started it. Would like more of this type from him."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer was a contemporary twist to a classic love story. This book gave me a mixture of emotions. It was suspenseful, romantic, adventurous and extremely inspirational and uplifting. What I loved the most about Sam's Letters to Jennifer was that it was written in first person. Throughout the book I felt as though I was witnessing this all right before my eyes; the book made it more relatable to me.Jennifer's life was filled with tragic events. She lost her parents at a young age, her husband, and she had a miscarriage. Jennifer began to shut love out of her life. Her grandmother Sam was her best friend. Sam and Jennifer were inseparable and very similar. When Sam abruptly went into coma, Jennifer believed her life was falling apart. Sam left letters to Jennifer to explain another mysterious side of her life and give Jennifer advice. While Jennifer was in Chicago hoping for Sam to recover, she also fell in love with her childhood friend, Brendan. Her life was moving at a fast pace, but with many obstacles. Brendan had a rare cancer that he could die from if his surgery was not successful, and Sam was still in coma. Sam's letter and Brendan taught Jennifer to live her life the fullest and never to shut out love from her life. The book had a very suspenseful ending that keeps the reader interested and wondering until the very end.Sam's Letters to JenniferJames Patterson conveyed the point that love can happen at anytime, even when life fails you. Love is something that no one can control. The last thing Sam said to Jennifer was love never dies.

Excellent, emotional!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I was very surprised to see that James Patterson is trying to earn a place in Nicholas Sparks' territory after reading all his gory crime novels. after books like Swimsuit, Alex Cross and Lindsay Boxer series, Sam's Letters to Jennifer is a breath of fresh air!So the story isn't anything new, and it supposedly follows the pattern of a previous romance novel he's written. I really don't care. This is a touching novel about the unbreakable bond between a young woman and her grandmother, and also the young woman striking up a romance with an old friend who happens to be terminally ill. I didn't cry, but was moved by the story's testimony to bending without breaking in the face of adversity. Best of all, you can get through it quickly--four or five hours, I'd say--and not come away completely disappointed.Patterson needs to put a bit more polish to his work in this genre, because it's obvious that he is rather new to romantic fiction. In the meantime, I am looking forward to him writing some more of these books in the hopes that each one gets progressively better."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you buy this book, make sure you are well-stocked on tissues.

The wonderful story tells of love that is lost and found and how love can change your life forever. One main asset that i recived is that if you loose a love you can move on and still find happiness. This book is now my favorite book to just sit down and get lost in it. I love how Mr.Patterson makes you feel as if you are a part of the story. I hope to have a love like this book gives."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Jennifer was summoned back to her hometown where she was raised by her grandmother.

So in the end he has to make a difficult decision; die, or maybe live a little longer.A wonderful novel, and one you don't lay down until the end."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"A romance written by James Patterson? Yes, this is his second, in fact. Quite a divergence from his usual suspense/mystery type, but I think he did a good job his second try at bat. I enjoyed the story. Yes, it was only surface deep and fanciful, but hey, who says every book has to be deep and dark? Once in a while, it is great to read a book with a happy ending and a nice story. Yes, this book did jerk a few tears from my eyes, which books don't usually have the tendancy to do. Would be great airplane or beach reading on a day when your mind wants a vacation."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book was given to me to read by my daughter and she warned me I would cry. It was the first time I've read this author's books.Cry I did, in the beginning, the middle and the end of this wonderful story. I cried because this could have been my own mother's story, she was Sam and my own daughter was her Jennifer.This was a beautiful story of the love between a grandmother and her granddaughter and how the two women learn to love again.A great read to take to the beach this summer, that is, if you don't mind having people see you crying over a book!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Just by chance I happen to come across this book one day and it soon became a favorite. An easy to read, relaxing book that kept you wanting to turn the page. I read this book in a matter of 2 days but could have finished it in 1. The character of Jennifer has been through so much and was an extremely strong character who could become a role model in a way. It is a fairy tale story in it's own way. Can't wait to read another of Pattersons' books!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Heard SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER by James Patterson . . . be forewarned: this is definitely not your \\"typical\\" Patterson thriller . . . rather, it is a love story that reminded me of another one he wrote a few years back (SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS) . . . this one isequally as good, if not more so . . . it is about a woman who comes across a series of letters that her grandmother left her . . . they tell of the older woman's life and loves . . . at the same time, theyounger woman's life is revealed--and then the two lives become entwined . . . although I don't usually enjoy seeing a movie after I've read (or heard) a book, I'm willing to make an exception forthis one and am hopeful that there is a film version . . . the background music and production values were excellent, as was the narration done by both Anne Heche and Jane Alexander."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I am a big Patterson fan, especially his short chapters which give the reader the ability to put the book down and not be in the middle of a huge chapter which never ends. It makes for a quick, easy read. And though this book drew me in, the plot soon became obvious and the writing became one big cliche of this genre. The ending was nice and neat at the expense of thoughtful writing. It is a book you can pick up and read quickly, but you might forget about the characters just as quickly when you are done."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book by James Patterson. He really gets into the characters, writing from the women's perspective and really making the reader feel they know the people in the story as well as ache for the protagonist.The only issue I have with this book is, even though there are multiple facets or stories entwined here, is how one is ended with just one line in regards to what happens to Sam. Since a large part of the book centered around Sam and Jennifer, and their relationship, I felt that that parqagraph should have been more than one line.Just one reader's thought."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"When I saw the commercial for this book I knew it was a must have. I read it in 2 days. It was the most heartfelt romantic story I have ever read. Not sappy, but truly romantic and gets to the core of true love - what it means to love and be loved and the sacrifices that sometimes must be made. Have the tissues ready because this is one story that pulls on the heartstrings over and over and over again. If you believe in true love and finding your soulmate you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters To Jennifer was a quick read and a tearful read. Towards the end of the book I had to go get a kleenex. This book is just as good as Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas. It has romance and suspense and keeps you interested."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I really loved this one! I listened to the audio version which has excellent narration. While the story is at times a bit &quot;sappy&quot; (not my usual genre- I'm not typically a romance reader), I thought it was well plotted out and filled with surprises. I couldn't get through it fast enough. I thought it was better than Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and I look forward to more books like these from Patterson."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Patterson has tapped into the broken heart of America and modern life. The only good thing to come out of the stinking holy war is it has people searching for meaning and signs of connection outside themselves. Or, as the Blackeyed Peas sang it: WHERE IS THE LOVE? Modern love sprouts between tragedy and hope and that is what Patterson writes about in this book. He does a pretty job but he lays on the syrup too thick, which is to be expected from so commercial a writer. Most big selling writers go sugary when writing about the emotional life and I'm not sure it's helping. Anyway, a book with stark psychological insights that I recommend is IN THE GHOST COUNTRY a reflective and sometimes shocking examination of the dead in one man's life."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I have to admit, I am not really a true fan of James Patterson, altho I did read SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am not a fan of mysteries/crime novels, so I have therefore, never even read another one of Patterson's novels (altho I have seen a few of the movies based on his novels). My favorite author is Nicholas Sparks, followed very closely by Debbie Macomber and Luanne Rice. I usually like to read women's fiction and/or love stories (not romance). After I read SUZANNE'S DIARY, I sincerely hoped that Patterson would put aside the crime novels and write another story along the same subject. I was thrilled when I heard that SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER was being released and I couldn't wait for the day it went on sale. I made sure I got to the bookstore that day, and was one of the first to purchase it.Once I began reading it, I got a little excited seeing that the story opened in Chicago, being from the suburbs of Chicago myself and working in the city for several years. After the third chapter, however, the rest of the story takes place in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and I slowly began loosing interest.The story follows the same kind of idea that SUZANNE'S DIARY did, and I was hopeful, but it never seemed to get going. It was very predictable, and even though I appreciate short chapters (making it easy to read in between work breaks, and on the train), it seemed almost TOO simple, and reminded me of the beginner books given to grade school children! Even the language and the plotline seemed a little too simple.It could have been a beautiful, wonderful story, but it just seemed like the author kept holding back and never displayed any real emotion. The storyline was predictable, and the characters weren't even fully likable. I embraced Suzanne and Nicholas - but I never felt connected to Jennifer or Sam, and the only character I remotely liked (or cared for) was Brendon.Without giving away too much of the storyline, it all seemed a little \\"fairytale\\" like. Everything seemed to wrap up nicely, and the characters all lived \\"happily ever after.\\" The \\"dilemmas\\" the characters faced seemed forced, and there was never any question whether or not it will all work out in the end.I hope that SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS wasn't a one-time thing that Patterson won't ever be able to duplicate. His mysteries and crime novels are huge best sellers, and he has a loyal fan base that never seems to be disappointed. SAM'S LETTERS FOR JENNIFER could have been just as good, if not better, than SUZANNE'S DIARY, but it almost seemed like Patterson rushed through the writing, and never allowed himself to be fully invested in his characters. They weren't fully developed, and therefore, I as a reader, couldn't connect with them.If you are a fan of Patterson's crime novels and don't usually like a good love story and/or piece of women's fiction, I recommend you skip this one, as you will most likely be disappointed and feel as if you wasted your time. If you read SUZANNE'S DIARY, and were looking forward to this novel as much as I was, I recommend you check it out of the library or borrow a copy and save your money for the next novel by Nicholas Sparks, Debbie Macomber and/or Luanne Rice. It just isn't up to par, and is nowhere as good as anything written by the aforementioned authors.I do hope Patterson gives it another try, however, and writes another novel along the same subject line - but if he does, I recommend he take the time to fully develop his characters, and give readers something to attach themselves to - SAM'S LETTERS FOR JENNIFER just felt empty to me, and I honestly didn't care about them once I reached the end (whereas, I'm usually wishing for another hundred pages, or looking for a sequel!!!)"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"A book doesn't have to decipher Chaos Theory to be good. Everyone needs an \\"easy read\\" now and then. It's nice to slice through some sappy little tear-jerker on a plane or during a long car ride. And I love all books.....I think it's because I have some need to please an author I'll never meet by liking their book. My co-dependency aside, this book is poorly written; bloated with clich&eacute;s; and full of such unrealistic conversation that you'll actually read lines out loud to people for a good laugh. Being me, I have to think of something positive so here it is: This book is a great story. I've summarized the story to several people, all of whom thought it was a great idea. So, if you're like me and want to give James Patterson some kind of due, just tell the story from your rocking chair to wide-eyed children....don't recommend that people actually read it. This book exudes a poor perspective on the female character; required no research; contains no believable characters; and will insult the reader with its dumbed-down, detailed explanations of every emotion. As if that isn't enough, there's a purely predictable plot.....jeez....I could write this book and that's not a compliment."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book, which tries to act like a full sized book, but is so full of larger print...larger spacing....huge margins...empty pages or nearly empty pages....chapters cut into 10 or 15 pieces, so that they can then insert MORE blank pages....is a big, fat, waste of time. It pretty much reads like a 13 year old girl's diary...sappy, and not in touch with reality. I love a good tear jerker...this one was neither good OR a tear jerker. The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Patterson's short chapters usually propel the storyline along and keep readers interested in his simple prose and captivating characters, but this time, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, merely keeps the reader asking why am I reading onward? A fan of his thrillers, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas took me by surprise with its depth and honesty, and at times, tear-producing prose. In this book, the short chapters merely made me wonder where the depth and subplots had gone.There was very little action, and Sam remained in a coma for most of the book while Jennifer read letters and rarely agonized about her column for the Chicago Tribune. Her editor rarely called, the column was never discussed in detail, and it was unclear whether she received letters from readers or whether the column meant anything more than a paycheck to her. I wanted more from this novel than I received: more frustration from Jennifer about her inability to focus on work, more sadness and care toward her grandmother, more emotion from Brendan regarding his illness. It was hard for me to believe that he was dying; he showed little if any emotion other than love/lust for Jennifer. There was too much here to explore in the short breadth of pages Patterson gave.There were too many gaps in this book for me to recommend reading it. It was a fast read, something to pass my time, but I am glad that I borrowed my mother's copy and did not purchase my own. My advice, read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas a second time, and Patterson, try to remember that memorable and loveable characters have depth."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"The good news is the book was so short, I could finish it and be done with it. This book was about 5 people with absolutely no personality flaws, except the self-absorbed narrator, which, low and behold is a writer! (Note to future novelists - you aren't that interesting, stop making every character in every book be a writer. Pick one of the other million professions out there.)Did anyone else notice the timing error? Grams started the affair when she was like 40-ish, but couldn't marry the guy until his kids were grown, which happened to be about 35 years later. Did his wife give birth 10 years after she died?"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This was a great book, I read it in one day.

Sam leaves letters to Jennifer telling stories of her life, which reveals to Jennifer things about her grandmother and grandfather she never would've guessed.

This story is also about the importance of telling your life's stories to those who love you."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer was written very beautifully with a special touch of love, faith and destiny. It is two great loves interwined in each other, that make this even more passionate. The novel is very touching, and it made me laugh, weep and smile throughout the great works of James Patterson's imagination.

As she struggles with her own pain and the uncertainty of her grandmother's condition, Jennifer discovers letters written to her by Sam, that tell of Sam's life and a love story very unexpected. The story weaves in and out of two lives, Jennifer's and Sam's, with strong emotion, a few surprises and terrific characterization.It's written in 1st person and I'm not normally one to read those. I had to get past that initially in this book...but found it easy to do so. The book is best told in first person, and I often felt that Jennifer was telling ME the story of her summer on Lake Geneva. The book easily kept my attention throughout and and there were a few surprises along the way.If you liked Suzanne's Diary, you'll also enjoy this."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I loved &quot;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas&quot; and was hoping that Mr. Patterson would again engage me in a really good story, even if it brought me to tears. That didn't happen here. Instead, I found this book filled with every possible cliche and circumstance, as tho he'd created a list of every imaginable sad scenario, and checked them off as he worked them into this novel. Young, beautiful woman widowed....then a miscarriage...now a beloved grandmother in a coma, with her own life's story to tell via letters....and then a new boyfriend dying of cancer. C'mon! It is so far beneath his talents for a good story, that I can't imagine why he would take the time to write it......unless he simply enjoys laughing all the way to the bank. I read it in less than 2 hours...hoping that he would redeem himself and make it worth my while. Didn't happen."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"My first time choosing an audio book to listen to and first time hearing a James Patterson story. The story went by fast and was easy to keep up with. I enjoyed Anne Heche's voice as Jennifer, and the it was a great and powerful dual love story. I am very picky when it comes to trying new (to me) stories, and I was not let down. In 3 days of listening the story was finished, and I only listened while waiting for my child to get out of school 30 min before class was out. GREAT story, lovable characters, and easy to keep up with. I highly recommend this story and especially the audio tape!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I loved this book. I have read James Patterson's other two books (Sundays at Tiffany's and Suzanna's letters to Nicholas) but this one is my fav. The chapters are short but you find yourself reading half the book in one sitting because you want to find out what is going to happen next. I would suggest this book to anyone. It is a beautiful love story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Worth the $2 I spent on it at the used book sale. (They lost me when the hero brings an electrocuted kitty back to life - oy!)"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"My mom passed this book on to me with the words, \\"it's a quick read.\\" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This was an amazing read. I started it at about two in the afternoon and did not put it down until I was finished. It is a nice reminder that the love we all crave is still out there, in some form. Whether it be in the heart of the author writing it or on the pages of a truly outstanding book. I would recommend this to anyone. It is not like any other James Patterson book I have read but he has proved to me that he can capture his audience with both suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you read a lot of Patterson's work, and I do, then be prepared... this is not Alex Cross finding the bad guy or anything even close. It's a story about learning. I loved this book - but I think Diary for Nicholas was the best!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"After reading SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS, I let this book sit on my shelf for a while. While Suzanne's Diary left me very sad, Sam's Letters gave me a completely different feeling at the end.SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER is the story of a grandmother who gives her granddaughter, Jennifer, a wonderful gift - letters explaining her life. Jennifer is a newspaper columnist who is unexpectedly called to her grandmother's hospital bed. Sam is in a coma and the doctors don't know if she'll survive. Jennifer has had so much sadness recently she can't stand the thought of losing her best friend also. Sam has always been there for Jennifer and she's not ready to let her go.Jennifer lost her husband in a freak accident less than two years before this story takes place. As she was grieving for his loss, she also miscarried her unborn child. Now she can't seem to move on with her life even though Sam continued to tell her that love never ends. With that in mind Jennifer just wants to hear her grandmother's voice one more time.As Jennifer leaves the hospital and goes to her grandmother's home on Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, she finds packets of letters left for her on her bed. Sam has written to her telling the story of her life, a precious gift that is exactly what Jennifer needs. Jennifer reads them a few at a time while trying to cope with the curves life has thrown her. She's awakened the next morning by Brendan, an old friend, who is also staying at Lake Geneva. A romance soon ensues and Jennifer runs the gamut of emotions.This book is very predictable, except for the identity of Sam's lover. Seems Sam has had a discreet affair for many years and her soul mate remains a mystery until Sam comes out of her coma. Jennifer reads about Sam's affair, her weekend getaways, her grandfather's abuse toward her grandmother, and takes it all in stride. Seems to me that a little more emotion would seem appropriate when told some of these stories, but Jennifer appears drained of emotion.Brendan does a bit better bringing out emotions with Jennifer, but again it's predictable. When Patterson revealed that Brendan has a terminal disease, I thought it would be the same tear-jerker as Suzanne's Diary. I was wrong, as this has a few more twists and a much better ending.Characters are not as developed as I had hoped. We get to understand Sam through her letters. We get to understand Jennifer though her flashbacks and the way she handles life. We get to see a small part of Brendan. And the sub-characters are almost non-existent. Even Sam's lover is underdeveloped and when he's revealed, it's not as exciting as it could be.A few things happen that are superfluous and could have been left out completely. Jennifer quitting her job had no reasoning behind it. But then again, maybe it filled a page or two and since this only has 272 pages, Patterson could have been looking for something to keep this from being a novella.This is a quick read and enjoyable. It's a book that will have you thinking about your own grandmother and the stories of her life."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I was introduced to James Patterson by my mother. After I read Suzanne's Diary to Nicholas, I knew I had to read this one. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was a super amazing book. It was definately a tear jerker. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves sad, love stories. James Patterson really has a way with his words and his plot. The characters all tie together very nicely. He also puts some natural suspense into his book so it matches all of his other novels. Definately read this book!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I think Patterson's attempts at romance/drama (not relative to mystery, of course) resemble Nicholas Sparks' books: decent story line, but sort of Lifetime-ish. They are too dramatic, have a few plot holes, have tons of one in a million happenings, and don't go deep into character development. And the ending always has a shocking twist: boy killed woman's husband in a freak accident but they're in love so what do we do, boy meets girl and they fall in love but boy has fatal illness unbeknownst to girl etc. They're fun to read, but not very realistic.All in all, it's a quick, lighthearted read. Like Sparks' books, this book has a huge margin on not-so-wide pages with larger than average print. If you're looking for depth, I wouldn't reccommend this."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I agree the book is quick and easy read. But I disagree that it was a romantic tearjerker. It is obvious that Patterson is a man writing about a woman. Before I even started it I figured out the plot, the ending and everything in between. One that really annoyed me was the fact that only one man was in the story with Jennifer and of course they must fall in love. I was surprised in myself, I cry easily over anything romantic and loveydovey - but this did not touch me. He used stories or sayings that are quite trite and disappointed me in lack of imagination. (The jar of sand and rocks - come on how many times have we heard it before) I was hoping for more from such an acclaimed author, but he left me with nothing. I am sure by next week I will have forgotten all about it. If he writes another I am going to pass it by, like I would recommend to others about this book."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"James Patterson's new book, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, was definitely high on my list of books to be read. However, I was very disappointed by this book. It still followed the easy to read format; in fact, I finished the book within a day. James Patterson leaves his suspense behind with this book. It was very easily predictable and not well constructed. Usually with his books, you become engrossed with the characters and yearn to know more about them. With this book, you realized you were reading a book rather than actually being transported to the characters' worlds. I must say that this book was NOT one of his best!!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK - I READ A LOT OF MURDER MYSTERIES, AND I LOVE PATTERSON, BUT NOW AND THEN I LOVE A GOOD ROMANCE NOVEL, AND I LOVED THE WAY THE STORY UNFOLDED WITH THE LETTERS FROM THE GRANDMOTHER - MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU KNEW ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND WERE PULLING FOR THEM IN EACH OF THEIR OWN STORIES. THANKS JAMES PATTERSON - I LOVE THE WAY YOU WRITE."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Just finsihed Sam's Letters to Jennifer.

I adored this. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Patterson should stick to romance! His last two have been wonderful and I have managed to read both of them in one sitting. I love the idea of writing letters-to tell a story. This story manages two love stories in one book AND throws in a little mystery at the same time. I can't imagine a tougher life than the one Jennifer is leading. So many different obstacles to overcome. She is very lucky to have Sam in her life. I won't spoil any of the book I'll just say it's an amazing read and I will cherish this as much as I do Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Okay, this is a tough one. I didn't like or dislike this story. It just didn't touch me on an emotional level the way \\"Suzanne's Diary\\" did. What it did do was leave me with some questions, however. What exactly was the purpose of these letters anyway? And why were they written in letter form? Why not as a diary? Why write them and never mail them. And wasn't Brenden just a little to good to be true? I'm not much of a \\"romance\\" reader, but it seems that whenever I have read a romance, it almost always takes place at a lake or in a remote cabin near some body of water. Quite the clich&eacute; and a bit boring. By the time I got to the end I felt nothing. A bit disappointing, since I normally like Patterson's books. But if you looking for a quick way to waste an afternoon, this might be for you."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I thought this was a really nice story. I read it in one sitting, but it was sooo sad. Make sure you have a box of tissues! The setting (Lake Geneva) sounded beautiful. The only problem I had with this book was that it seemed a little rushed. I felt there could have been so much more as far as the actual letters to Jennifer. I figured that'd be the majority of the book, but Sam's story was only a small part.Regardless, it was sweet, and it definitely has been drilled into my head that Jennifer is &quot;the most beautiful girl in the world&quot;...(it got a bit old after a while). Anyway, aside from the few small downfalls this book has, I do recommend it. It's a great summer story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I literally did not put this book down, but read it straight through. The love stories in this book were amazing and full of life. This book is a great read, especially for anyone who has turned against the hope of a better love or a better life, because this book is all about second chances. I borrowed it from the library but just might have to go out and buy it to add to my collection. Powerful, emotional, a perfect example of talented writing."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I and a number of other authors have written tear-jerking-cry until-there-are-no-more-tears-left, types of novels just like this one and couldn't get it passed the editorial assistant's assistant, let alone an agent.First let me say this, I thoroughly agree with reviewer (publishers weekly?) who said it did not translate well to audio.Although Jane Alexander was exceptional, for the first time I found Anne Heche to be weepy and droll with a tear in every single word making it even more tedious.As for the novel itself, could he get anymore death, dying and near death in one 272 page novel? And what's with eighty-three chapters in that length? That's like 3.2 pages per. Editors I know would look at me like I grew two heads. (but then I am NOT James Patterson).In a nutshell its girl lost husband, girl losing/lost grandmother who wrote a series of letters to her telling her about a secret indiscretion(I liked that part the best), girl finds new man, but the new man is dying. New man lives? Dies? I'll let you read it for yourself. Hate to give away a plot no matter how succinct it is.The story is not bad if you want to spend your Sunday afternoon sucking up tissue fibers or re-applying your makeup for the forty-fifth time.A few readers and writers I know agree that if this book had been written by a woman it would never have gotten the review and kudos it did. ALA Bridges of Madison county.Maybe its because I can't get passed ALEX CROSS that I don't see this as a Patterson genre, but it seemed to work for most of his following, but I'm afraid, this time it wasn't for me and I like his novels."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I read this book in one day.

It was not the story I was expecting. It was so much better. Fabulously read by Anne Heche and Jane Alexander, the story unfolds of Jennifer who has recently suffered great loss and now her beloved Grandmother Sam is in the hospital close to death.Returning to the house of her youth, she discovers a packet of letters addressed to her from Sam. These letters are about to change her life. They are Sam's story... and Jennifer's story. And many surprises are in store for her.A moving story and I loved this book. I have since given it to two of my very good friends. This is a story to be shared.JMHO //(*_*)\\\\\\\\"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an \\"upside-down ponytail\\" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I don't know anyone who didn't love this book. We passed this one around at work.

I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I'm a huge James Patterson fan and could not put this book down. All of his books are a quick read, but always a great plot and original. I've read all of his suspense books and was happy to add this to my collection.

Nicely written...not too over-the-top."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I read all the books put out by Patterson...and love the Alex Cross character. This one was over the top. I don't know, it was just too simple. Now granted it was nice to read it in one night after a busy day at work, but it just left me saying , &quot;huh&quot;. Lots of holes, but I guess there were some feel good moments. Like another reviewer wrote, way too many &quot;you are gorgeous&quot; moments over and over.Agent Cross, we are ready for your return!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book is engaging and grips your heart with it's stirring plotline. A fantastic story that reminds us that everyone has an amazing tale to be told and reinforces the need to tell and show those around us how deeply we need and love them."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I'm not usually big on reading love stories, but from start to finish I found \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" to be a heartwarming, page-turning read. It starts off with the \\"lead\\" character Jennifer, who had recently lost her amazing husband to a swimming accident, learning that her best friend/Grandmother was in a coma - and it didn't look good.As the story moves on, Jennifer is staying at her Grandmother's lake-front home so that she can visit her in the hospital each day - and, while there, she finds a stack of letters written to her by her Grandmother. While reading these letters Jen learns the shocking \\"truth\\" about her Grandmother's life with her Grandfather & someone else. These letters wind up detailing a love story - just one of the beautiful (and sad) love stories involved in this book.Also while there, Jen runs into a young man (named Brendan) that she had been friendly with as a child. Over time, this relationship grows - this is the heart of the second love story. However, at the point when they realize that they've truly fallen in love, Brendan shares with her that he has a terminal disease, and likely has only months to live... Can he be cured? Can their love endure this? You'll find out as you turn the pages of this amazing book.Overall, I would highly recommend \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\"! Although you may need a box of tissues handy, it really winds up to be a wonderful story about the power of love."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you don't like to cry in front of people, Read this Alone!! A friend gave me a James Patterson Book about a year ago to read and it was awesome. I have read a couple more of his books and loved those too. This one is probably one of my favorites. I am not a crying person, but I was up late reading this book at about 2 am and I cried so bad I had to take a shower to calm down. It is just wonderful. I really hope there are more books like this to follow. James Patterson is my number one author. I was never a book lover until a year ago because books didn't seem to hold my attention, but his books sort of lock me down for hours on end."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you're looking for an incredible, tear jerking love story, this is your book! And an easy read for that matter. I buzzed through this book in about a day and a half and felt sad when I finished the last page. I have given it to a girlfriend to read, but I am anticipating its return so I can read it again! What a story! You feel like you know, or maybe even that you ARE part of this love story... you can feel every mention of pain or love and relate to your own lives ups and downs. It's hard to praise this book anymore... you'll never know how wonderful this book is until you get hooked after the very first sentence!! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh, you cry, you make a fool of yourself. Jennifer is probably one of Patterson's most likable characters. Even though, there were times when the book kind of reminded me of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (very few), I was pleasantly suprised. It has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending. Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end. All in all it is very vintage Patterson. Fast paced and great story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I am a huge Alex Cross fan and have avoided any other of Patterson's books. This CD was loaned to me so I felt obligated to listen and what a surprise. I am not normally affected by books, tapes or movies, but this one was so well written and read that I found myself deeply caring about the characters involved. This book might not be very original - but well worth your time."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I spent a few hours on a Sunday reading this book. When I first heard about it, I immediately put my name on the waiting list at my library. Overall I thought it was good. I had high hopes bcuz 1) it's written by James Patterson, one of favorite authors; 2) I thought it would be similar to Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. I wasn't disappointed. It was nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. But I have to admit, I'm anxiously waiting for the next Alex Cross!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"The book was good. It was just a quick read. It's not Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but I think still worth reading on a lazy Sunday afternoon. You wiz right through and HEY it entertains you for a couple of hours. That's really all I ask of a book. I 've read almost all James Patterson's books. Not that I don't enjoy the mysteries, but I'm fully in favor of him continuing on this path. OH AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE &quot;WHEN THE WIND BLOWS&quot;. A total MUST read. I find any of his books that does not involve a cop and a murder I enjoy more."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"For those of us that have read Suzanne's diary for Nicholas and loved to cry, Sam's letters for Jennifer is another in this type of series for Patterson. Although unrelated in content,both of these novels are very moving and emotionally riveting. Sam's Letters is a story about living life to it's fullest from dawn to dusk. My only regret is that it was not alittle longer because the characters took on a life I was sad to see end at the conclusion of the book. This is one of Pattersons more moving books in light of his usual murder mystery stuff."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I picked up a copy of this book last Wednesday before boarding a plane to Mexico, where I would meet my husband for a romantic weekend after a few weeks of seperation (graduate school). After having sobbed through &quot;Suzanne's Diary to Nicholas&quot; last year, I knew this would be a good choice for my &quot;travel time.&quot;After sipping a rum &amp; Diet in the airport lounge, I turned the first page. Before getting off the plane in Houston I had finished the entire book, worn off all my mascara and even had the guy in the aisle seat next to me interested in reading the book (he had also read &quot;Suzanne&quot; but wasn't as quick to admit it...) This was all in the span of about 3.5 hours.As Mr. Patterson has said, &quot;have you ever read a letter that changed your life....&quot; Well, Mr. Patterson, this book changed mine. While this is not &quot;Suzanne&quot;, your beautiful look into the painful journeys of life, relationships and love coupled with storytelling as only you can, is quite simply amazing.You will not go wrong with this book -in fact, you will want to make everything in your life right! Love never dies and thank heaven James Patterson posses the ability to make us see this. A great choice which will have a profound affect on the reader -and if it doesn't, you might want to go see your Doc and make sure your ticker is still working....."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Yes, I'm a very big James Patterson fan, and he didn't let me down. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was great! I couldn't put it down. I love all of Patterson's books but the romantic ones are right up there with my other favorite author, Nicholas Sparks. A must read for any true romantic. Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but it will go on my shelf as one of my very favorites!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Being a big fan of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, I didn't think there was any way that it could be outdone. James Patterson has, however, outdone himself with this one. The characters are so realistic that you feel as if you know them, and still want to continue knowing them throughout their lives and yours. This story is heartwarming, and both love stories intertwine in such a way that leaves you with a feeling of hope and love long after you finish the book. My favorite quality about the book is that it wasnt PREDICTABLE in ANY WAY....I can usually guess mysteries right away in novels but this one kept my guessing...extremely good book and a quick read, and very deserving of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Wonderful story with charming characters. A lovely beach read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I enjoyed reading Sam's Letters to Jennifer by James Patterson. The reader gets a terrific mystery and a romance novel all for the price of one. This was my first James Patterson novel and I really enjoyed it. I can hardly wait to read more of his fine stories."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Thank goodness this was a short book because it was a complete waste of my time. The story was boring and predictable but the worst thing is how VERY POORLY WRITTEN it is. It's like some high school kid wrote it. This Patterson guy needs some writing classes. There is no way I would go near another one of his books again. And I read constantly. Save your time and money on this one. It was terrible!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"First off, I love James Patterson anyway, but I really liked this book. It wasn't as good as Suzannes Diary for Nicholas, but it was definitely worth reading. This book moves really quickly and doesn't take long to read at all. I read it in 2 short nights. Sometimes it's nice to have a quick read after you've finished a long book. I thought the characters in this book were great and people you truly felt comfortable with. It was a sad book, but had a good ending that I was very happy with. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book is for those sappy at heart. Those who enjoy love in its my simplistic form. A very easy read; or maybe it was just the fact that I couldn't put the book down. I would never have read James Patterson if it was not for Suzanne Diary; and this the second book I have read by him- could possible leave a spot on my soul forever. If your looking for mystery, murder and intrege, your reading the wrong book. If you are looking for &quot;my life isn't all that bad&quot; and something to make you live life a little more &quot;from sunset until you can't keep your eyes open.&quot; this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I bought this book intending to read it after a hard day at work. I couldn't put it down. It has it all... a bit of mystery, love.... This is my new favorite by James Patterson. A great read for a lazy summer day!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every 1-star reviewer of this book is right on, so I won't repeat their critiques. Every 4- and 5-star reviewer must have read a different book! I am angry that Mr. Patterson holds his loyal fans in such low esteem that he'd allow so shallow and boring a book to come to market. I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it! Like so many other bestselling authors, Patterson seems to have lost his touch, even in his mystery series. A smart author should know when to say when, and if he doesn't, then I do - WHEN! If he continues to write this kind of garbage, I will no longer read it."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you're a lonely housewife, romantic at heart, and like harlequins, wait for Patterson's book to come out in paperback. It's an easy sugary read, tugging at your heartstrings, but not worth the hardcover price. It also seems to me that Patterson is jumping on a new genre style of writing and &quot;literally&quot; losing his fans of Alex Cross. He is trying to capitalize on sappy, romantic, tragic, love stories after his success of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and picking a touristy, profitable town like Lake Geneva, which he may not even have visited for more than a day, just to sell his books and make more money. I admit I like easy, romantics once in a great while, but a classic writer like Patterson should leave the romantic books to R.W.A (Romance Writers of America). And lastly, he should fire his editor and take writing classes again with all his money. This is not literature; it's choppy, full of basic writing errors, and clich&eacute;."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"James Patterson lost his touch in this book. The romance seemed too forced and the plot didn't flow as smoothly as you would expect it would from a Patterson novel. The fact the the reverend is shacking up with a married women is never discussed. Jennifer becomes romantically involved with a man she knew when she was too young to remember him and the apprehensions about becoming involved so recently after her first husband's death are only lightly discussed. The story seems too forced and Patterson should stick to mystery thrillers."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This is by far the worst book I've ever read. To think that trees had to be sacrificed to make this! I'll be brief. It was the most cliched plot I've ever encountered, there was practically no character development, the dialogue was extremely cheesy/poorly written and there was no substance to anything that happened in it. At some point, it reached its apogee of absurdity when the heroine's beau gave her electrocuted cat CPR, after which she fell more deeply in love with him. Utter garbage."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"After some confusion about who Sam was in the beginning, \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" drew me in and I didn't stop reading until I had finished the book. Such tender wording brought tears to my eyes and there were many laugh-out-loud moments...the kind of moments an ordinary person can relate to.Sam had fallen at her home and was in the ICU at the hospital. Sam and Jennifer have always been close and best friends ever since Jennifer was a little girl and spent summers at Lake Geneva with Sam and Charles, her grandparents. Charles had died long ago, and now Sam lay in a coma and the doctors weren't sure she would come out of it. Jennifer had already lost her soul mate, Danny, in an accident and didn't think she could stand to lose her grandmother so soon afterwards.Sam had left Jennifer a series of letters telling about her life and the secrets she kept. The first letter ended with \\"The Truth is...I never really loved Charles.\\"One morning Jennifer is awakened by a war-whoop and to the sight of a naked man racing toward the lake to jump off the dock and into the freezing lake water. His name was Brendan Keller, and she would love him, and he had a secret too.Between Sam's letters and Brendan, Jennifer learns to live from the crack of dawn until she can't keep her eyes open any longer. She learns that if you're going to look back on something and laugh about it, you might as well laugh about it now. She learns happy endings are hard to come by and that we are our stories - make them happy ones. Most of all...be alive every moment of the day."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book was an easy, fast read, but the story line was very melodramatic and predictable. There was no depth to the story. The romance was a little too sappy."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"True lovely - if predictable - book. It is a one sitting read, but have a kleenex in hand! I enjoyed the easy reading, honest characters, and change of pace for Patterson. I give it 4 out of 5 sniffles."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"The name James Patterson is synnonymous with some of the greatest thrillers written in the 1990s. Along Came A Spider, Kiss The Girls, and 1st To Die are three of the finest examples of mystery writing that have been offered to readers in years. It was novels like these that rocketed Patterson to international fame. Too bad he can't just rest on his laurels, because with novels such as Sam's Letters To Jennifer, Patterson is robbing his readers of time and money.The story of this 250 page wonder starts out with journalist Jennifer being called to watch over her grandmother, Sam, who has recently suffered a fall and is in a coma. Naturally, grams is Jennifer's last surviving relative, and her one link to her past. Yada yada yada, Sam has a story to tell Jennifer, and she does it through a series of letters that Jennifer reads throughout the course of the book(always with tears welling in her eyes, as Patterson puts it). Enter the tall, dark, handsome neighbor whom Jennifer was friends with as a child. As luck would have it, he too has a dark secret to tell. Not surprisingly, he and Jennifer fall for one another in a matter of a few days, as is typical in this sort of tawdry romance book. In the end, everything is tied together with a nice bow, with the possibility of a sequel, which Patterson will no doubt release if this one sells well.Seriously, complete a book of Mad Libs rather than reading this garbage. Sam's Letters to Jennifer joins the ranks of Suzannes Diary for Nicholas, The Jester, and The Lake House as one of the worst books Patterson has ever written. With any luck, November's new Alex Cross novel, London Bridges, will put Patterson back on track to the path of accomplished writing he is capable of."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This was a wonderful book ,it showed a perspective of love from a young love to an aged love . It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside ... like I was there with them , talking to Sam and reading the letters and trying to figure out who Doc was , learning a whole nother life that I never knew my grandmother lead. I don't want to give out to many details cause it is a must read ."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer is truly vintage James Patterson. This novel is an extremely fast (2 hour) read and grossly satisfying. I strongly recommend just creating a short block of time for this book and read it through as a short story. In typical Patterson form, the chapters are short, yet telling with plenty of surprises to keep you turning the pages.The premise of the story surrounds heart-broken Jennifer and her grandmother Sam who starts the story in a coma. Jennifer rushes to see Sam (really her onlly family left) and stays in Lake Geneva at Sam's home visiting her every day at the hospital. Sam and Jennifer have always been very close and turns out Sam had left Jennifer a series of letters detailing her life and making relevent comparisons to much of the feelings Jennifer had recently experienced. This novel is about second chances, learning who you are, and who your loved ones have been. Expect another hit for Patterson."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Jennifer is a young woman desperately trying to put the pieces of her life back together after being struck by two tragedies, but news of her grandmother being ill will force her to push her own problems aside and turn her attention to the one person that has always been there for her...her grandmother Sam (short for Samantha.)Jennifer returns to her childhood home and in the house she finds letters written by her grandmother, letters that tell a mysterious love story of two people, one of those people being Sam, the other a man named \`Doc.' Intrigued by these letters, Jennifer continues to read, only to find out that her grandmother was in love a someone other than her grandfather.After deciding to remain on Lake Geneva while her grandmother lies in a coma, Jennifer runs into Brandon, a childhood friend, sparking a passion she hasn't felt in a long time. But, this new found love comes with a high price as Jennifer learns Brandon has a secret that may destroy their love.\`Sam's Letters to Jennifer' is a moving and sad love story. As with any James Patterson novel the writing is first-rate and the pace is super-fast. The intertwining of two separate love stories will keep readers turning the pages until they reach the surprising and sad ending. This powerful novel, that is similar to the novels of Nicholas Sparks, should be a huge beach book.Major thriller writer James Patterson has written a love story...not once, but twice (Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas) and he does it with style to spare. Patterson's new novel, while a bit sappy in spots, does contain all the trademark plot twists that he is famous for, including an ending you'll never see coming.Expect this quick summer read to fly up the bestseller lists!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer is another wonderful love story from James Patterson. Be forewarned though, you WILL need a box of Kleenex standing by.Departing from his infamous Alex Cross murder mystery genre, Patterson has written a very loving book on relationships. Sam is Jennifer's grandmother and the bond that they share is incredibly special. Through a series of letters left to Jennifer by Sam, Jennifer finds out that the grandmother that she has known throughout her life has secrets of her own. Jennifer reads these letters at her grandmother's house, while not knowing if her grandmother will be pulling out the coma after her unexpected fall.Jennifer not only learns about herself in these letters, but also finds the \\"real\\" woman her grandmother is and has been and Jennifer is drawn even closer to her grandmother. Not believing in love after the loss of her soul-mate husband, Jennifer learns to open up the door to the possibility of love and finds that magic still does exist for her.This was a very quick read and the reader is totally absorbed into the secret of the letters and what Jennifer will do with her new awareness of her grandmother.This book is wonderful, with several surprises along the way, keeping the reader guessing on just what will happen. Full of love and caring on each of the character's parts, this story will stay with you for awhile, as well as bring tears and smiles along with the knowledge that the power of love is indeed strong and eternal.I absolutely \\"loved\\" this book and wish that Patterson would write more books like this. His sensitivity and insight are remarkable. If you have not read his previous book, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, I would also highly recommend that incredible love story, which is an actual true story.This book is special and I am sure that a little of its' magic will spill into your life!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"The only reason this book was enjoyable was because you could read it in one sitting. The chapters were short, unchallenging, and the storyline didn't require much thought.The story felt rushed, and I didn't feel like I got to know the characters very well. I thought there were too many different dramatic things happening at the same time which kept shifting the focus of the story. Throughout the book I was wondering why Jennifer wasn't spending more time with Sam. I also wondered why we weren't told more about Brendan and Jennifer's childhood together.I don't read many James Patterson's books and this one didn't inspire me to pick up another one anytime soon."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I also read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and enjoyed it very much. It seemed fresh compared to other stuff out there. So, I like others had to read Sam's Letters. Patterson is now knocking out these love stories in a formula - medical tragedy, heartbreak and dramtic loss of loved one - finding true love again. His characters say and do the same things....dancing barefoot to old music and can't live without each other.I spent $15 in airport book store...read it in less than 4 hours (before the plane landed) and wasn't worth the $$$."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book was sappy and awful. Patterson fails at capturing the female voice and presents us with unrealistic, bordering on ridiculous dialogue. Who talks, or even thinks, like this? Jennifer varies between sounding like a teenager with all the italics and exclamation points, and sounding like a Hallmark card. \\"Thank you for sharing the letters with me\\"??? And what a stupid premise. Yay, let's all cheer grandma's fling with the town preacher. Woohoo? Patterson needs to stick with suspense. Both this novel and \\"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas\\" show that he has no talent for writing romance. He obviously thinks that women think like sentimental morons."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I could hardly believe that the master of mystery himself penned such a poorly written novel. The story line was so utterly predicable and awful that I am quite certain the only reason it sold any copies was due to the author's name. This ladies and gentleman is clear cut example of why authors should stick to what they are good at and not go venturing into unfamiliar territory.The main character Jennifer is a workaholic widow who lost the love of her life in a freak surfing accident. She turns to her grandmother Sam to get her through that particularly tough time in her life and when Sam falls into a coma, Jennifer returns to the town where she spent her childhood summers. While staying in Sam's house Jennifer comes across some letters that are addressed to her but were sealed and never sent. When I say come across I don't mean she just stumbled upon them -- they just \\"happened to be\\" lying on the kitchen table and that begins a series of one too many coincidences for this reader to take. Jennifer \\"happens\\" to hook up with an old neighbor (Brendan) who just \\"happens\\" to be dying of some rare form of cancer. Of course, Brendan has experimental surgery and miraculously ends up fine. Over the course of the novel Jennifer reads the letters that her grandmother wrote to her and she learns that her grandmother had an affair (oh the horror!!!). Sam tells her granddaughter of the romantic interludes she and her lover shared and all the while refuses to divulge her lover's identity in her letters. Sam eventually comes out of her coma (shocker) and her lover's identity is finally revealed in time. The revelation is nothing exciting though Patterson seems to think it is. The whole book was relatively predictable, use of the feminine voice was awful, and overall this book is not worth reading. Patterson should stick to mystery and intrigue. Leave the mushy stuff to Nicholas Sparks......"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"&quot;What are we but our stories?&quot; asks Jennifer, a widow and newspaper columnist who is summoned to a Lake Geneva Wisconsin hospital where her beloved grandmother Sam lies in a coma. Jennifer spends the rest of the summer at Sam's home on the lake, reliving her memories of time she spent at the lake as a child and waiting for Sam to awaken from her coma. She discovers a bundle of letters that her grandmother wrote to her which uncover secrets about Sam's unhappy marriage and a mysterious lover simply called &quot;Doc.&quot; She renews the acquaintance of an old friend, Brendan, and falls in love with him.Similar in tone to Patterson's &quot;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,&quot; this short novel tells two entwined stories: that of Sam through her letters to Jennifer and that of Jennifer herself as she deals with her grandmother's illness and lets love back into her life. This is a tale of love, loss, and making the most of the precious time we have on earth. Both sentimental and suspenseful, this is a quick and enjoyable read.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer, written by James Patterson, one of the best-known and bestselling writers in the world! I love the mysteries, thrills and suspense in his detective series, but this book was also a fascinating read, about the fourth chapter, it pulled me in, I really couldn't put it down.Jennifer's memory chute opened up while visiting her grandmother at Lakeland Medical, also on Lake Geneva at her grandmother's home where she spent so much time there as a child. At the lake house, Jennifer finds a huge stack of letters that Samantha has written, with instructions to read only a few at a time.

Overall a great read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"You know, just when you think Patterson can only write one kind of book, he writes a sweet book like this one. I was pleasantly surprised with this story.It took me a few pages to really get into the plot. I had no idea that there was going to be a slight suspense aspect to it at all. Patterson works his magic that got me hooked on any of his other books. The chapters are a little longer than his books normally have, but we get to read a little bit of Sam's letters every few chapters or so. The letters always end on an interesting cliffhanger.While Sam remains in a coma in the majority of the book, you fall in love with her. Probably even more than you actually like Jennifer. It's hard to like her with all of the emotions that she is going through. The subject matter is pretty sad and there are some tear jerking moments, but the story is overall enjoyable and entertaining. Oh, and addictive, like Lifetime movies."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I Could not stop reading this book!

I was deeply moved and greatly surprised at the profoundly unique, intimate insights of James Patterson, as he played upon all the strings within this story. Since my wife teaches Violin, Viola and Cello students, I could identify with Patterson's creatively harmonized overtones of these varied string sensations. I only thought his forte was in the thrilling mystery of nursery rhythm titles!\\"For a long time it seemed to me that Life was surely about to begin...real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be got through first, un-finished business, time to be served, a debt to be paid!...Always my priorities are getting my health better!\\" Danny Kaye used to say, \\"Life is a big canvass; throw all the paint you can at it.\\" Jennifer writes her weekly column for the Chicago Tribune! Some of her 'oft read response was advice, \\"Loosen-up Friend! You always seem in too big a hurry to be funny.\\" Someone had read that act of laughter releases nice chemicals in the brain. \\"You feel Good and it's Free!\\"In Jennifer's slow-dancing romance with Brendan, she hears him repeating, \\"Live everyday from the crack of dawn until I can't keep my eyes open a second longer.\\" That was his reasoning for taking an ice-cold swim early every morning in the nearby lake!Author Patterson employs his creative gift of recording intimate conversations between Jenny and Brendan which reveal their most privately profound, uniquely shaped character traits. My take on Patterson's writing skills is that of one neatly diverse, well-controlled, composed, cohesive personality! Even looking at his portrait on the back cover, I see a man who appears to be comfortable with, \\"Who He Is!\\" Chaplain Fred W Hood"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"With all the publicity surrounding this book, I was hoping for a great summer romance--'a woman conquers her greatest fears and overcomes her tentative inclinations in order to love again!'

And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This is only the second Patterson novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading (My first was The Lakehouse.) and I can already see the amazing talent that is possessed by this author. The emotions that are drawn out in Letters are truly touching and I feel that it takes an amazing depth of talent for anyone to go from writing biological thriller to something so family- and love-oriented.Through the letters she shares, Sam is painted as a strong-willed, compassionate woman who is eager to pass on advice to her granddaughter, Jennifer, so that she may avoid making the same mistakes in her future that Sam made as a young, impressionable woman. Interspersed with these letters, we are privileged to see a relationship grow between Jennifer and her childhood playmate, Brendan, which only becomes successful because of the powerful advice that Jennifer is taking in through her grandmother's writing. This novel will make you cry, but it will also give you a feeling of warmth when you stop to contemplate how important love really is."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This is such a bittersweet love story reading this book brought me through each emotion a human can experience!!!!

The plot is simple, the word choice adolescent and the characters are flat and similar; Jennifer is the same as Sam and Brendan is the same as Daniel. I don't take lightly to slamming another writer, yet it is difficult not to when coming across sentences such as these:\\"I was soooo glad to see Brendan's smiling face.\\"\\"...less than three weeks later, something really terrible happened.\\"\\"...my eyes were swollen and very, very red.\\"To use some of Mr. Patterson's own jargon, let me just say: This book is very, very bad. Soooo bad and really terrible."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"In the novel titled, Sam's Letter's to Jennifer, by James Patterson we witness a woman by the name of Jennifer cooping with the lost of her finance Daniel who she loved and was going to have a child with. As Jennifer continues to mourn her finance's death she receives a phone call from her hometown where she spent all of her summer's visiting her grandmother, Sam, stating that her grandmother is in the hospital and in coma. Jennifer rushes back to her hometown to remain near her grandmother. As she is trying to coop with the thought of losing her grandmother, she goes back to Sam's house where she plans to stay meanwhile her grandmother, Sam, is in the hospital.

Jennifer still hurt by the tragedy of her finance allows herself to be befriended, never knowing she would fall in love, with this man who is dying of terminal cancer.The novel titled, Sam's Letter's to Jennifer, by James Patterson is a novel I would recommend. The reason I would recommend this novel is because it talks about how life at times can be cruel and at others giving. Many times we lose people who we truly love whether it is physically or emotionally and we feel we will never be given a second chance to love once more. This novel is an eye opener that states, \\"Love never dies.\\"(pg258) For example, Sam Jennifer's grandmother married a man who she thought would love her just as much as she loved him. However, Sam's husband did not want to love or be showed love. Out of luck in her marriage Sam meets a man who she calls Doc, to keep his identity a secret and starts a love affair with him because he does know how to love. As Sam sees Jennifer hurting over the lost of Danny, Jennifer's finance, she tells her that she should never close the doors to love. Jennifer has no one left in this world but Sam. Sam is Jennifer guider and mentor. Jennifer lost her mother at a very young age. Throughout her life she has had love given and taken away all at the same time. However, Sam continues to push Jennifer to never give up on love. As Sam goes into a coma Jennifer stays at Sam's house to keep near. Jennifer comes across Brendan a man she grew up with and they befriend one another. As Jennifer starts to get to know Brendan she begins to fall in love, and so does he. However, Brendan is dying of terminal cancer and decides to tell Jennifer much too late. Jennifer has fallen in love and feels all out of luck. But, that doesn't stop her from trying to get Brendan to go into recession. Eventually, Brendan goes into recession and cures his cancer. Sam, also gets out of her coma is back at her own house. Jennifer at this moment couldn't be any happier. All of her loved ones are with her. However, Sam dies three weeks later. Jennifer is greatly sadden about Sam's death, and then she finds out she is pregnant. Jennifer and Brendan have a baby girl who has Sam's features and eyes, who they name Sam after Jennifer's grandmother. With this taking place at the end of the novel you come to realize that are loved ones never truly abandon us. With the birth of little Sam, Sam Jennifer's grandmother continued to give her love to Jennifer. \\"Love never dies\\" because there is always someone ready and willing to love us."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Not the best of Patterson.

Apropos to the title, Patterson used the cover flap to address a letter to me. Well it said \\"Dear Reader.\\" He wrote that he once received a letter which made him \\"hungry\\" to read it because he felt his \\"entire life hung\\" within that letter. Okay, so I was compelled to read the art that he offered as an embodiment of such feelings.When I mentioned writing a review of this book, I was asked \\"Who is Sam and why is he writing letters to Jennifer?\\" The answers are part of the mystery which starts seducing you as you read chapter one. I suggest reading the book free of any preview or discussion that spoils the mysteries of even the most innocent questions. Dive in and experience the relationships within the relationships. After all you are reading a Patterson novel. He stays true to his trademark by mixing in some questions which become heightened by the anticipation of the answers. Every detail, gesture, word, and expression revolve around true love. Sam's letters begin to teach Jennifer as secrets and details are revealed.This quaint romance reminds me of a black and white film, modernly colorized. Why an old black and white film? Patterson salutes the beauty of living. History is retold through mature characters who have idiosyncrasies. Why colorized? Because of the abundance of nature, array of clothing patterns, leather, smells, beloved pets, and baseball caps.Of course the majority of the book is written in the form of Sam's dramatic honest letters. There are many levels of romance inside and outside of these letters. Most episodes take place in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin which is no accident, I'm sure. Lakes and love go together like chocolate and Valentine's Day. I am grateful that Sam wrote the letters to Jennifer and kudos to the muse who sent Patterson his special letter. My heart was full by the last sentence. I felt as though I had completed a course on true love. My education will be long remembered.Reviewed by Janet \\"Jaize\\" Brownof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer is definitly towards the top of my list of favorite books. This quick and easy read novel shares the heart warming stories of a grandmother's love life with her beloved granddaughter. Once I opened the book, it was impossible for me to put it down. I found myself reading nearly over a hundred pages a night. This book isn't only a romance but also had some suspense; James Patterson never leaves the mystery out.

Notice I said liked. I had high hopes for this book. I have read every book he has ever written and was surprised by this one. Hoping it was along the calibur of Suzannes Diary for Nicholas I rushed out to buy it on day one. Now I wish I had borrowed it from a friend. It was not realistic to me. I realize it is a book of fiction but this book to me was over the top on some points. For instance, when you read it, count how many times they use the name of the person they are talking to in conversations. When I am sitting talking to my husband, I dont use his name in every other sentence. Another thing was how repetitive the compliments were. How many times in a day can you tell someone they are the most beautiful girl in the world. GAG! If you want real romance and to shed some tears give the book I named earlier by Patterson a try. Or, better yet, read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. Come back soon Alex Cross!

I've never read a James Patterson book before so I don't know how his other works are. Personally, I have a love/hate relationship with this book.Like the main character, I also have a lot of happy memories about Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I live on the west coast now and find myself missing it a lot. So sharing those warm memories and talking about all the places that I remember makes me a little home sick, just like Jennifer (though it's technically not her home).It's also a very sad story, which makes me dislike it. I hate to hear how in such a place that carries warm memories for her that things can change and take a turn for the worse. This is definitly not the typical go to the happy place to feel happy again type of book.Bring your tissues."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"When on hears the name James Patterson, mystery novels come to mind. However, this novel is at the other end of the spectrum. It shows the remarkable writing versatility of this author. Sam's Letters to Jennifer is a well-written book that includes \\"come to life\\" characters, and a poignant ending. It is extremely hard to put down, and anyone who reads it will find it hard not to finish in one sitting. It is compelling and intriguing because it pulls the reader in and doesn't let go. From beginning to end, Sam's Letters to Jennifer will have the person who reads it enthralled and wanting more when the novel has concluded.Having suffered a double tragedy recently in her life (loosing her husband and unborn child in two unfortunate accidents), Jennifer, a newspaper columnist, returns to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin when faced with the probability of losing the most significant person left in her life - her grandmother, Samantha. As she battles with her own pain and the ambiguity of her grandmother's condition, Jennifer discovers letters written to her by Samantha, that tell of her grandmother's life and her incredibly unexpected love story.In these letter's, Sam discloses several deep secrets and her concealed love nicknamed \\"Doc\\". By example, Samantha also encourages Jennifer to give life and love a second chance. Opportunely, Jennifer reunites with an old childhood friend from Lake Geneva, Brendan Keller, and things eventually begin to escalate between the two. They spend the majority of their time together- taking long walks, swimming, having dinners together on a daily basis, and of course visiting Grandma Sam in the hospital frequently. Jennifer and Brendan seem to fit together perfectly and everything seems too good to be true once they fall deeply in love. But when Brendan reveals his shocking secret to Jennifer, her world becomes rapidly dire once more and it seems unbearable. Bolstered by her Grandmother's touching story, Jennifer begins to feel again that love will find a way.Throughout this book, Thomas Patterson uses well-written descriptions to depict each character's personality and character traits very clearly. For example, Jennifer's friends describe her as being \\"married to her job, a basket case, a hopeless workaholic, and romantically challenged\\" (9). The characters physical appearances are portrayed as being laid back and casual. Brendan is described, as \\"His hair was light brown, with a soft tousled wave and...he had very blue eyes\\". Also he was \\" wearing khaki shorts, a Notre Dame t-shirt, and the strangest old man sandals\\" (60-61). Even though the author describes the characters well both physically and emotionally, the reader can allow their imaginations to envision each characters manifestation in addition, because he does not describe each character with an extreme amount of detail physically (which is a refreshing twist to this book).Patterson uses simple, yet effective, detailed, and comprehensive language to paint a picture of the setting. \\"...The lawn flowed downhill to the shoreline. I could see the long white dock jutting out onto the moonlit and glassy surface of Lake Geneva. The water was a mirror for the star-pricked sky\\" (20). Sam's Letters to Jennifer is filled with figurative language such a similes, metaphors and personification, and also is detailed and described well. An example of a simile when Patterson describes Sam's garden is: \\" Irises fluttered like flights of bluebirds on their stems\\" (71). When he describes Jennifer's emotional stress he writes: \\" I felt a curtain of sadness drop\\" (85). These are just a few examples of Patterson's many figurative language uses throughout the book.This romance-themed novel is set in a couple of different locations, the main one being Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Since there is reference to former president Bill Clinton in the story, one could conclude safely that this book is set in a fairly recent time. An educated guess would be the late 1990's to the early 21st century.The main characters in this novel are vividly brought to life as they nestle their way into your hearts. Jennifer is a beautiful young columnist from Chicago, Illinois. She was married to a man named Danny but a tragic accident sadly took him away from Jennifer. She is very devoted to her work and is \\"romantically challenged\\" (9). Samantha is Jen's grandmother who lived in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The two were best friends and were very close to each other. She is described as a good listener, caring, and holds good eye contact. Sam was still lovely in her older age and had a loving soul to match. Danny, Jennifer's deceased husband, was sweet, caring, paternal, and a good person. He tragically died in a surfing accident in Hawaii. Brendan Keller is a handsome, tall man of 6 feet 1 inches tall. He is an excellent swimmer and is also intelligent, kind-hearted, sweet, romantic, fun, and young-at-heart. He and Jennifer fell deeply in love when they met up at Lake Geneva during the summer when her grandmother fell ill. They used to be childhood friends during the summers on the lake. Once they fell in love, they realized that they were meant for each other.Simply put, this book is touching and compelling. I enjoyed this novel immensely. I enjoyed it because it was a heart-warming romance novel that was well written and purely an exceptional book. It is a powerful story of love and second chances. The story of love lost and found is universal in its appeal. The novel progresses in simple, short chapters, which keep the flow of the book moving and attention grabbing, and the scenes are continuously changing so the reader never gets uninterested. Patterson manages to cleverly include several heart-tugging plot lines in a single manuscript. They only flaw in my opinion is the ending. While the conclusion is a bit too buoyant for belief, otherwise this tearjerker story is an overall success. James Patterson's concise style of writing brings out the great emotionality of the story.By: Shelly JohnsonWork CitedPatterson, James. Sam's Letters to Jennifer.

I am a huge James Patterson fan, and Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas was one of my all-time favorite books. However, this book was about as poorly written as a book could be.I'm shocked to see so many good reviews. Did they even read it? What are their educational levels if they did? This book could easily be read by a third grader. Maybe even a second grader. The sentences were choppy and extremely cliched.The plot itself was interesting, but not exactly original. I had a hard time getting past the poor writing and the obviousness of it all. He even makes beginner writer errors at the beginning of the novel like having two characters with the same name; one of which is character at the heart of the novel.The other reviewer who said this book was like a first effort from a young writer was correct. If you could even give JP that much credit with this one. I'm beginning to wonder if he isn't overworking himself with too many different series or if he switched editors or something.I was extremely disappointed with this book.

The description of the lake, and the people don't evoke feelings in the reader. As Jennifer reads her grandmother's letter (interspersed with her own developing romance), one learns of Sam's secret affair. Again the people seem less than real and the reader cares little about discovering who the mysterious lover was.The chapters are skimpy, the reading level suitable for an 8th grader, and the overall development of the story seems sluggish.

In the process, Jennifer re-meets an old friend, Brendan, and a passion of her own is awakened for him. But he's in the fight of his life against cancer. How will that end?

This is a tear-jerker, love story which has the obligatory love, death and illness scenes as part of the plot. When I was reading it, I felt that as if I'd \\"been there and done that\\" in other books I'd read. Patterson attempts to write the kind of love story that Nicholas Sparks and Charles Martin write, but it doesn't turn out nearly as well."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This was an o.k. book, something to read that isn't to deep or involved. It's a sweet story probably something \\"Lifetime\\" would make a movie out of."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I picked up a copy of Women's Day (or some magazine like that) a couple of years ago with an excerpt from this book. After I read it, I couldn't wait to get the book! I was not disapointed. I was surprised though, it's not every day that you pick up a great romance novel written by a man (and a man who is a very popular thriller author to boot)Anyone who enjoys a great romance novel, will definately enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I first read James Patterson with his book Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and just LOVED that book (shedding tears and all)! I recently picked up Sam's Letters on a clearance table at a book store...don't know HOW I missed it when if first came out! Both of these books are written somewhat similarly (the letter, diary style) and are really enjoyable to read. I found myself not being able to wait until Jennifer read the next letter from Sam to see what it entailed! I've not read any other JP books; none of the titles, covers, etc. have caught my eye. I suppose I'll check the reviews and see if I can pick up another one that equals these two!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"A unique storyline, but a little too predictable. Some of the scenes did not make sense (author eluded that Jennifer can guess the mystery person in Sam's life, but she never did). Otherwise, a good book to read on a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Mind you, this was my first James Patterson novel and compared to all the other reviews I have read I am sure there are other great books by him. I am now reading \\"The Lifegaurd\\" and so far it's great.Sam's letters to Jennifer was a good read. I read it in two sittings and it kept my attention the whole time. I thought it had a good story line and I enjoyed to two love stories.I believe the story could have been played out more. But you can tell it was a get to the point story. I wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Patterson wrote it over the weekend.I recommend this book to someone who is taking a long flight or isn't a avid reader - because it is such a good short read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Devastated after the tragic death of her husband, Jennifer has buried herself in working as a columnist for the Chicago Tribune. But when her beloved Grandmother, Samantha, has a bad fall and is in a coma, Jennifer drops everything to travel to Lake Geneva, an hour and a half away. Jennifer spent many wonderful summers at Lake Geneva as a child and despite the circumstances she's happy to be in one of her favorite places. While at the cottage, Jennifer discovers her grandmother has left her a packet of letters that will reveal some secrets from her grandmother's past. As Jennifer is slowly finding out the secrets about her grandparents, she is also discovering her feelings for Brendan, who is also staying at Lake Geneva. But Brendan has a secret of his own, a secret that threatens to keep him and Jennifer apart forever.\\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" is what I call a perfect beach book. It's not too deep, has a touch of tragedy, yet it's a good love story (two love stories actually) and doesn't require a lot of thought. None of the characters are particularly deep - Jennifer is supposed to be a workaholic but outside of one column, we never see her working and she soon ditches her job without a qualm. Same with Brendan, while he had a compelling reason to quit his job, neither he nor Jennifer seems to worry about money. Since we mostly see Sam through her letters, it's hard to sympathize with her as a character and her romance left me a bit cold. However, Jennifer and Brendan's love story was much more engaging. There are some plot holes; I was never quite sure if Jennifer's father was dead or alive, her mother is mentioned but he never is. Brendan's secret is a bit too melodramatic and the outcome a bit unbelievable, but sweet. But again, this isn't the kind of book you want to think too much about, instead just read and enjoy.\\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" is a light, fluffy read - perfect for the beach or a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I could not put this book down! i seriously could not wait to see what would happen next! love it and highly recommend"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I listened to the CD version in my car. I really enjoyed it. If you like a good love story or romance, you will enjoy this book. I have read most of Patterson's suspense novels and this is the exact opposite.

I've read five of Patterson's stories, but didn't know that he had written anything like this! I've enjoyed his famous novels, filled with suspense and action, but in my mind, this is his best book!SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER touched me in a way that I didn't expect. It's the story of Samantha, a grandmother who wants to share the very personal story of her life with her favorite granddaughter and she does so in the old fashion epistolary style of letters! Called Sam by her many friends, and family, she is a caring and warm person.Jennifer, is living a successful life as a newspaper columnist when she is called back home because her grandmother, Sam has experienced a stroke and is in a coma. The prognosis is not good. Jennifer spends hours at the hospital talking to Sam, but not knowing whether or not Sam hears her. Jennifer, herself, is still mourning the death of her husband and now she's faced with losing the only other person who she loves.For the last few years, Sam has written many letters to her beloved granddaughter, never posted, but waiting to be found in her home. When Jennifer finds the letters she learns some family history that is very unexpected and a little shocking.Jennifer also finds someone else while staying at Sam's cottage. She meets a man who she knew as a child and they form a warm friendship, but life is never easy.This was a very enjoyable read with many interesting characters."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"OK i seriously belive PAtterson should seriously shift gears to Love Stories....i mean PUT more energy and time and give us a GREAT romantic book............I am a HUGE PAtterson FAN...his books are ever so Enjoyable...i loved Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas....and Sam's letters for JEnnifer was also intersting and really a Lovely Read...and What a SHORT book it is...finished it on my way to YONKERS from QUEENS...........3.5/5Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If you like romance..

His love stories are as good as any of his mystery novels I've read; and I've read a fair share of them. He is completely versatile, yet still maintains his writing style. Contrary to some of the critiques written about Patterson's ability to write love stories are *#@$@#@!! I read this in one sitting, and despite it being a love story, Patterson still adds mystery to it; right after reading this book, I received \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\"! It's for sure, a five star book! KUDOS to James Patterson!!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I recently read an interview with Mr. Patterson wherein it was disclosed that he writes outlines for his novels, and then collaborators (which is a fancy word for anonymous authors) create the actual stories. That colored my reading of this entertaining, light novel about a woman and the advice shared by her grandmother via a series of letters.The premise is a familiar one, and there will be very few surprises. Getting there, however, is the main part of the interest. Jennifer has recently suffered a loss, and Sam is trying to help her allow herself happiness again. I won't include a bunch of spoilers here as so many others have done, but if you've read more than a couple of these sorts of novels, you'll know how it will end.I quite enjoyed the story, and look forward to reading the other novel that has been written in this vein, \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas.\\" All my best to the faceless author who put this together on the basis of Mr. Patterson's outline."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I read Suzanne's Diary to Nicholas in one sitting and enjoyed it. I hadn't read any other book that used that sort of style (diary interspersed with present day happenings). It was a nice change from reading 'regular' stories or ones written solely as a diary or series of emails, letters, etc. It was a sad, bittersweet story. But I liked it.In Sam's Letters to Jennifer (the gender-ambiguous name is intentional), I thought I would find a similar type story, which I did but I didn't really like it. It reminded me too much of Nicholas Sparks (who is a much better author than this) and at the same time the always-tragedy-stricken characters in the Lurlene McDaniel stories I read as a teen. It's still a sweet story. I did enjoy reading Sam's letters and wished there were more of those thrown in. But the book was very short and rushed feeling. Patterson could've bulked it up without too much effort and would've had a better book as a result. Instead we're left with the sappy story of Jennifer, who has lost her husband, baby, and now her beloved grandmother has suffered a stroke. There is way too much tragedy going on in her life;- it almost doesn't feel realistic- does anyone really have such bad luck?Overall a fast-paced read good for a boring afternoon but I'd recommend checking it out from the library before paying anything for this mediocre story. After reading this book and a couple other pretty blah Patterson books, I'm not that interested anymore. Too bad- there were a lot of things I liked about his stories- the suspense, quick pace, intrigue, romance- but there's becoming too much that I can't stand (i.e. predictable, mediocre writing)."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This is far from even being a &quot;fair read&quot;.

Patterson tells a good with lots of scenic descriptions and makes the characters seem real"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"The Sam in this book isn't a man. It's Jennifer's grandmother. When Jenny is called to Sam's deathbed, she begins reading a series of letters that are essentially her grandmother's life story. While she's already a hero of sorts to Jenny, the letters reveal a secret sadness that was kept hidden from the family all these years. What Jenny reads raises her esteem of Sam even more, and encourages Jenny to overcome her own personal losses and find love again.In the spirit of full disclosure, I'll readily admit that I'm not a real big fan of James Patterson. I've read about half a dozen of his novels now - mostly the thrillers that are part of the Alex Cross series - and have been distinctly unimpressed. His thrillers are just sloppy in a lot of ways, and I thought I'd try this book as a departure.I will say that I liked this book better than his thrillers. It isn't a great book, but since it is really more of a love story, it doesn't require tremendous attention to detail with politics, world events, crime procedures, complex plot twists, and the other stuff that usually populates a thriller . Instead, it just focuses on people. Think of this as bascially a made-for-TV movie. A love story with generous helpings of tear-jerking moments. It is very much in the style of Nicholas Sparks' novels which are usually of the variety love found, love lost, and maybe love found again.Personally, I think Patterson should stick to books like these because it is clear from his thrillers that he thinks family and love are very important, and one would think he'd prefer to write about such topics. Instead, he feels compelled to crank out 5-6 mediocre thrillers per year that I've officially given up reading because they are so hokey. But, his thrillers are what seem to have made him a gazillionaire, so I doubt he'll take my advice.This book isn't without its sappy moments, but was overall an enjoyable story. It's even a little mystery of sorts, which adds to the enjoyment.As already mentioned, I can't call this a great book, but it still made for an nice read. It's short, and most people should be able to get through it in a single rainy afternoon or a day at the beach.And, if you liked this one, be sure to check out another one from Patterson that is quite similar, even down to the title: \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas.\\""},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I wanted to care about Jennifer's grandmother, Sam, unconcious in the hospital. I wanted to like Jennifer, to want her to overcome the sadness from her husband's death, to find new love. I hoped Sam's letters would be moving and vital.Unfortunately the story just did not catch fire.The conversations are banal, the soon-to-die new boyfriend and other characters just never seem real. The description of the lake, and the people don't evoke feelings in the reader. As Jennifer reads her grandmother's letter (interspersed with her own developing romance), one learns of Sam's secret affair. Again the people seem less than real and the reader cares little about discovering who the mysterious lover was.The chapters are skimpy, the reading level suitable for an 8th grader, and the overall development of the story seems sluggish. Needless to say, it was disappointing.I've read Harlequin romances that had more engaging characters than these."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I was so excited when i saw this book because i loved Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas but this book was a bit of a dissappointment.

The story held my interest, but only just. I thought the characters weren't particularly well developed but they were likeable and I cared what happened to them. Just not enough. Certainly, I didn't have to reach for the Kleenex.I did start to wonder, however, if James Patterson gets product placement fees for naming brands in his novels. Hmmm - food for thought."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I rarely get swept up in a book the way that I did while reading this vivid and touching love story.

I highly encourage anyone looking for a book for a long flight or even a rainy day, this is a great story to get into to!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Rebeccasreads recommends SAM'S LETTERS FOR JENNIFER for an evening's read not because it's a mystery, which it really isn't...because it's a fine old-fashioned love story within a modern love story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"That's what Patterson fans will receive when they purchase this novel....two love stories encompassed in one great book. The main character in the book, Jennifer, races to the side of her grandmother Sam, who has fallen ill. Sam's home in Lake Geneva is full of nothing but wonderful childhood memories for Jennifer, who settles in to wait for her grandmother to regain consciousness. Newly widowed, Jennifer has had enough tragedy in her life as of late and cannot grasp the possibility of losing her beloved grandmother. Spending her days at the hospital, Jennifer begins spending her evenings reading letters that her grandmother has written to her over the years, and discovers a life and love Sam had that until now she was unaware. While reading of her grandmother's true love, Jennifer begins spending time with and old childhood friend--Brendan--and soon discovers a new love of her own.Although not as well-told as Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas, Patterson fans will love this one also and will once again have a renewed appreciation for this author's ability to write novels of any genre.DYB"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer, who miscarried her dead husband's child, has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke. She meets someone who could be \\"the one\\" for her, but -- oops! -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die. The writing is amateurish, full of telling instead of showing. The only reason I finished it was because I was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"When I first set eyes on \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\", it was being offered as an audio book in Barnes and Noble's discounted book section. There seemed to be alot of copies too. I made an assumption that perhaps, this book didn't sell well; which seemed to be confirmed when I went to the public library and noticed that most of Patterson's other books were checked out, but 3 copies of this novel were waiting patiently on the shelf to be taken home by some reader. When I cracked open the book, I had anticipated reading a juicy romance between a man named Sam and a woman named Jennifer; but was stymied when I realized \\"Sam\\" was a woman! And she was Jennifer's grandmother no doubt. At that point, I was going to abandon the novel, but Patterson' reputation as a great novelist spurred me to read a bit further. I was glad I did. The story opens with Sam in the hospital in a comatose state. Jennifer is crushed to see her grandmother so vulnerable and enervated by this frightening moment in both their lives. You see, since Jennifer was 2 years old, her grandmother and her always shared a special bond; one closer and more loving than most grandparent/grandchild relationships. Sam's letters to Jennifer were written with the intent that someday, Jennifer would get to read them and would learn some of the dark and not so dark secrets that filled her grandmother's life as a younger woman. Well, her grandmother had set the bundles of letters on a table, perhaps sensing for some reason, that it was simply time for Jennifer to hear her grandmother's stories; stories that Jennifer had begged her time after time to share with her. And during Jennifer's journey through her grandmother's letters, she learns of a different side of Sam. A side that was never shared with Jennifer; although, there were many opportunities to do so during their annual summers on the lake. I hope you will read this book. It is a true love story from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Although it is not a sequel to Patterson's masterpiece Suzan's Diary for Nicholas, it is obviously a hastily put together piece trying to cash in on the success of that novel. It fails miserably in its ability to keep you turning the pages, the main character Jennifer is just not that interesting and you really couldn't care less if she makes it with old childhood friend Brendan who like all bad 'chick flick' type books is dying of a disease, in this case a brain tumour. The other main part of the story revolves around Jennifer discovering who the secret mystery lover was of her grandma Sam, who is lying in a coma whose letters Jennifer is now reading. The book is boring and predictable is a severe understatement. It is just not worth spending even one cent on. If you haven't read Suzan's Diary for Nicholas defiantly do so, but forget this rush job."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Once I read more than the first three chapters I was hooked. I didn't pick up on the whole \\"Michigan U\\" thing, someone else wrote in a past review. I didn't know of all the different colleges of Michigan, partly because I'm a University of Virginia fan. Anyway, the CPR given to the cat was a bit far fetched to a point. Although, CPR can be preformed on animals it is highly unlikely that anybody could resuscitate a cat that has electrocuted itself. You would need to use an AED to restart it's heart, at least for a human. I am making an assumption here, I don't know that veterinarians even preform that procedure on animals. Anyway, this book was a fairly good read, I enjoyed it and I ordered another book by James Patterson. We'll see how that goes, it could be just a rarity that I picked up one of his better novels. Especially since most of them seem to be title with some sort of hokie nursery rhyme."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I enjoyed this book- it was a very easy read, however there were some areas that I wish were more detailed.My favorite part was the letters from Sam- I would have been happy for that to be the whole book- the secondary love story got a bit to sappy for me- but still a nice read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"When I sat down to read \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" by James Patterson I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I had recently finished another James Patterson novel, \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\", which was a great love story and one of my favorite books. In a way I expected this book to be very similar to \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" but to my surprise it wasn't, and in some ways I enjoyed this book better!Jennifer is a journalist working in Chicago with unhappy past. Jennifer had intended to go on vacation but when she needed to finish a story for the newspaper her husband went earlier and she was supposed to meet up with him later. But she was too late her husband had been killed. To stand by her side was her grandmother, Samantha.Jennifer had always been very close to her grandmother since she was younger. Her grandmother lives at Lake Geneva where Jennifer often paid visits to her. Jennifer had always thought of herself as knowing her grandmother very well. When Samantha has a sudden fall. After receiving a call about her grandmother Jennifer rushes to Lake Geneva to be with her grandmother.After arriving the hospital Jennifer decides to head back to her grandmother's home on the lake. When she gets there she finds a stack of letters for her from her grandmother. She begins to read the letters only a few at a time, each revealing secrets of her grandmothers past. While at the lake Jennifer meets a nice young man, Brendan.Brendan's uncle also lives at the lake next to Samantha's house. Throughout the story Jennifer and Brendan get to know each other more and more. They begin to spend more and more time together, but then comes the biggest surprise of the book.Even though I went in expecting this book to be close to Patterson's \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" I soon realized how wrong I had been. Neither was bad, in fact they are two of my favorite books. And even though this is a love story it isn't too mushy and it is filled with many surprises.I love the way Patterson made me feel like I was standing there with the characters through all of the scenes. This book is filled with joy and sadness. In this novel Jennifer, a journalist with an upsetting past, gets a call about her grandmother in Lake Geneva. Jennifer returns to Lake Geneva to see her grandmother and finds secrets about her grandmothers past. And while in Lake Geneva Jennifer finds something she didn't even know she was looking for. Overall I give this book five stars drenched in tears!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I picked this book up almost a year after I finished Inherit the Tide. I just wanted to read some of Patterson's work after not following his stuff in a while. I have never been a fan of mystery writing although others in my family are and they like Patterson. We had not discussed \\"Letters\\", so I thought I could get fresh insight to the man, and maybe some pointers on how his communication of pace is used to drive the reader.In \\"Letters\\", PAtterson has successfully developed two marvelous women so effectively that I felt like I was with them both as the story pulled me along. I was amazed at how he was able to do this by developing them more by dragging me into what they were doing rather than telling me who they were. Anybody who does this so effortlessly and economically is a real master of story telling.The chapters are short. There are no long conversations. The story is simple. It would seem such a book would be juvenile nonsense but this is a serious, brilliant, book complex in the author's deliberate simplicity. Yes, it could be easily read in a day. But the reader (if she is interested in studying the writer) really needs to stop and ask herself - How did he do that?I am familiar with the challenge of trying to present a strong female character. Patterson is amazing in his bridge to presentation of real people. He is equally amazing in his ability to cross generations without crippling the pace or distorting the characters. \\"Letters\\" deserves 5 stars, no question about it."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"My wifey begged me to read this one. I guess she wanted to draw some emotionalism out of me. It didn't work.

At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary, this novel was probably more like 150 real pages long. It also seemed to be written for, oh, I don't know - a ten year old maybe. The writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level. All I can hope for now is that it doesn't get made into a load-of-crap TV movie."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"Like a few others, I can't say that I didn't like the book, but I wouldn't necessarily say that I liked it either.

It is a very quick and easy read. I didn't find Jennifer's character all that real; mostly because she didn't really spend a lot of time with her sick grandmother in the hospital who supposedly was the world to her. I don't think it took away from the overall story, but it did keep playing on my mind. Why was she having so much fun while her grandmother lay in the hospital; hence the 3 stars.If you enjoy love stories it's worth reading.

I enjoyed Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas so much that I had to purchase JP's latest go at the romance genre. I thought the story was a quick and tender tale of life's sad experiences for Jennifer. Deep inside Mr. Patterson, I think there's a mystery writer wanting to break out and write romance, however, I just happen to think he's a better mystery writer. The plot and characters were okay, but pretty much a repeat of his last attempt at writing romance. When an exceptional writer like Patterson puts out a small book that is a quick and easy read, and with a predictable plot, then I have to wonder if he isn't being pushed to get something published. I'm a Patterson fan, so I'll buy another one of his books, but not if the cover indicates a romance genre."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book was a very quick read, I enjoyed the love story.

Contrary to the initial impression that the letters are love letters from a man to a woman, Patterson's correspondence is from Jennifer's grandmother, Samantha Stanford. Reeling from her husband Danny's accidental death a year and a half before, Jennifer responds to a call from the family's minister in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.&quot;It's Sam,&quot; he said. &quot;...she's in a coma.&quot;Her childhood memories of summers spent at the lake with her grandparents are treasures. Jennifer grabs her laptop computer, a must for a newspaper columnist, and heads for Lake Geneva. Sam would not be alone. After her first hospital visit, Jennifer realizes that Sam might die. Despondent, Jennifer returns to the lake house to remain between trips to the hospital. There, she discovers a pile of letters, addressed to her, written in her grandmother's hand.In response to Jennifer's tragic loss, the first page concludes with a bombshell. Sam says, &quot;The truth is, I never really loved Charles.&quot; Love, and how to find it, is the primary theme throughout the stack of papers that Jennifer gradually opens during her stay at the lake.She is distracted with the renewal of a childhood friendship with Brendan Keller, who is spending the summer at the lake, next door at his uncle's house. Patterson weaves their history in the story through easy bits of conversation, a relief from cumbersome background narrative. Jennifer's preoccupation with her job gives way to her responsibility to her grandmother. In addition, she opens her heart to a new relationship with an old friend.Patterson uses the letters to his advantage, divulging sparse bits, one at a time, about Sam's disastrous marriage to Charles until his death. Her long-kept secret reveals that the power of love can be enduring. SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER is a feel-good book that reads easily and fast. It is two love stories conjoined by the letters. A prologue introduces Jennifer's dilemma, and an epilogue ties the loose ends together.James Patterson has writing credits in numerous genres, from mysteries to moving love stories. He'll even release a book for the juvenile market later this year. If he can continue to touch the heart by his words, he'll succeed in any genre. SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER is a box-of-tissues winner.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I loved this book. I haven't read any other James Patterson books, but I will. This was very touching and very well put together. The author has a knack for moving the reader to tears. Bring the kleenex for this one! Also liked The Wedding by Sparks, The Notebook, and The Bark of the dogwood---all really good books."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I have been a fan of James Patterson since Along Came a Spider...However, I have to agree with the few reviews I read that he has gone downhill. This book was a little over 260 pages, big type, with his usual short chapters that makes for an impossible to put down book. Needless to say, I was able to finish the book in less than 2 hrs!!! He could have gone into so much more depth on everything, including the letters that were written by Sam, which were an integral part of the book. I was extremely disappointed by the lenth and lack of substance for this book. That being said, if you want a quick read and happen to borrow someone else's copy or find it used, it's worth it, I guess. But it does not even begin to compare to Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. Someone else mentioned not even bothering with Sam's and just rereading Suzanne's...I may have to agree."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"In Chicago, her boyfriend Chris locked Jennifer out of their apartment on a freezing night when jogger Danny saw her crying. He brought her a hot coffee and not long afterward, they fell in love, married, and had child. However, this is not happily ever after, as Danny and the baby die in an accident.A year and a half after the tragedy that has left Jennifer struggling to live, Reverend John Farley calls to tell her that her best friend, Grandmother Sam, is in a coma. Jennifer heads to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to be with her beloved grandma. In Sam's lakefront house, Jennifer finds letters written to her by her grandma. In the letters, Sam writes that her late husband Charles was not the love of her life, but that she lived a wonderful existence as she found her soulmate. Meanwhile, at Lakeland Medical where Sam lies comatose, Jennifer meets Brendan, who she knew as an older \\"brother\\" when she was a child. He begins to bring her back to life even as she continues to read the gift of love that her grandmother has given her.SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER is an uplifting tale with a deep inspirational message that one must overcome the inevitability of the mortality of loved ones as life is too precious not to live it to the fullest even at its darkest moments. Jennifer is a terrific angst character struggling with tragedy. The letters and Brendan provide her with solace. Mystery and thriller guru James Patterson displays his vast talent with this wonderfully insightful look at the heart and soul of a human warrior.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"did anyone notice the masculine pronoun \\"he\\" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a \\"he\\" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I loved this novel and would like to see the world read it. I think it told the well known, though not often practiced, secret of living a fulfilled life. Dream big, laugh often and never let a day go by without loving with all your heart. Life is a journey and we make of it what we will, but love for self and others is the key to true peace. Life hands us hard choices and bad luck but we can and will thrive if we just believe. Every new day is the beginning of the rest of your life. Its all about perspective and I for one am happy that I was reminded of the simple things that make life a grand adventure and can't wait to embrace it..with all of my heart."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This wasn't a tear-jerker for me. Mebbe I'm a cold-hearted fish. But I dug it. I read the book in 3 or 4 hours. I think it could have been longer.I thought there would be more letters from Sam (Grandmother) to her granddaughter, Jennifer. If there are about 170 of them, how come we only read about 20 of them?The book moves fast. It is easy to read. I think if the book had been longer, the author would have laid down more for me to become more emotionally invested in the characters.But it's love triumphs over the hardships in life. Short & sweet."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I did not love Sam, and I did not love her letters, but I loved Jennifer and her romance with Brendan. This book is worth reading for them alone. And it's short enough that you can endure reading Sam's letters without wasting too much of your life.Warning: SPOILER!When Brendan went into surgery, I was CRYING! And I loved it!"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I loved this book! It was an excellent read. My co-workers and I have been passing books around at work and this was the best one I've read in a long time. Highly suggested."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"It still amazes me that the James Patterson can write such graphic stories as the Alex Cross series and also romance stories. I have read all of his books and couldn't put them down. &quot;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas&quot; was the first book to make me cry in years. Because of this I was excited to read this book. &quot;Sam's Letters to Jennifer&quot; is a great book, but it was predictable. If you like romantic quick reads than this is the book for you. All of Pattersons books are fast paced and hard to put down. A word of caution however to those who haven't read any of his other stuff and want to now.His other books like the Alex Cross series are very graphic and gory detailed. I enjoyed them, but they are totally different than his romance novels."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I found this \\"novel\\" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"A co-worker loaned me this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it is . . . a romantic tear jerker, with all that the genre entails. Laughter. Tears. Tragic hero and wounded heroine. Wise role model with secrets of her own. Love lost. Love found. Love almost lost again, due to tragic circumstances.This book is, at its core, the love story between a girl and her wonderfully brave grandmother.Well worth a night's read.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I don't know why I bother with James Patterson-all the melodrama and cliches. This book typifies his style. I correctly quessed the ending after reading just 20 pages of this book. It's sappy and silly. I promise not to do this to myself again..."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"If I could return a book just because it is lame, I would have returned this one the minute I finished it. It was not worth the money I spent or the time I invested reading it. I loved &quot;Suzanne's Diary&quot; and hoped this book would bring me as much as that one did...but alas it didn't. It was sappy and stupid and there were just too many obvious shortfalls. For instance, Jennifer supposedly loved her grandmother (Sam) more than anything, but yet once Sam is hospitalized, Jen visits her only twice a day, and spends the rest of her time swimming, flirting and making love to the neighbor so it's not believeable that Sam is anything other than an after thought... As well, the ending was predictable from a mile away (and probably even further for fans of &quot;Suzanne's Diary.&quot;) Of course, Sam's coma doesn't last, of course, no great harm comes to Jen's new beau, of course, a baby ties it all up in a happy bow...Gag! I wish James Patterson would just send me my money back along with a promise not to write any more bad books trying to recapture the magic of &quot;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas!&quot;"},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"when I first picked this book up, I noticed that it was very similar in title to Suzanne's letters to Nicholas, but I thought ok- well, if this book was candy and I was a diabetic, I would be DEAD.Sam is Jennifer's grandmother who is in a coma. Jennifer comes to Lake Geneva and stays in the Grandmother's house, while she is visiting the hospital.Jennifer has had some terrible things happen in her life. Her love of her life died in Hawaii and she is unable to let go of the pain and the guilt that she feels because she wasn't there for him when he passed.As Jennifer is staying in her Grandmother's house, she reads letters that her Grandmother has written to her over the course of some years explaining HER life and how she was in a unhappy marriage with Jennifer's grandfather and how she finally found love after so many years being miserable. Jennifer then meets her grandmother's neighbor Brendan. They were childhood friends and haven't seen each other for a very long time. They spend wonderful days and night reliving all the things the did when they were growing up. Unbeknowst to Jennifer, Brendan who is a Doctor, has a unoperable brain tumor ( this is where it gets sappy) but he is skeptical about a new treatment for this condition. He one day disappears and Jennifer finally finds him in New York, receiving a new proceedure for his brain tumor. During the time that they are in New York, Samantha wakes up and is looking for Jennifer.Jennifer flies home or back to the Grandmother and talks to her and wants to know more about her life.the end of this book definately gets WEAK and flat. The end is so sickening that I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This book was a complete waste of paper, ink and my time. Here's the premise. Sam (short for Samantha) decides to write letters to her granddaughter Jennifer explaining her life and giving the young girl words of wisdom. The characters never seemed real and I had no connection with or compassion for any of them. Sam appeared to be a selfish woman who needed to rationalize her extra marital affair through her letters. Jennifer was a weak woman who had only been widowed a short while but was apparently able to move on with her life in an amazingly short time. Her purpose in going to and remaining at her Grandmother's house supposedly was to be available to go the hospital and be by her Grandmothers side to help encourage her recovery. This apparently only required about 8 minutes of her time per day. The rest was spent reading her grandmother's letters, and wasn't it perfect timing Grandma was able to finish these letters approximately 11 seconds before falling into her coma, and in break neck speed developing an amazingly deep love affair with a man she'd known in her youth but hadn't seen since childhood. For someone who so deeply loved her first husband this new relationship just didn't ring true. Of course, none of the story was particularly plausible or even interesting for that matter.Save your time and money and run, don't walk past this book and on to something far more worthwhile and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This was a case of being seduced by the title and cover only to be horribly disappointed by the content. Even now I can't believe how bad this book was. Reading the prologue, I found myself wondering if he'd just put no effort into writing that particular part at all- it was that bad. I had high hopes for this book-a bestselling author, fabulous title and it's a love story. But the writing, not to mention the plot, is very very bad-rough, childlike, and has the stamp of an amateur all over it. The language is so simplistic and collooquial that it's full of such gems of literary phrase as \\"Now that I please myself, my priorities are better\\" or \\"I was so happy, and I remember every moment of that night in Lake Geneva\\" and \\"Because less than three weeks later, something really terrible happened\\". Slang is used instead of expression-words such as \\"totally\\" and \\"really nice\\" abound, and overall it's just a horrible book. The dialogue between the lovers is trite and unbelievable, and so is the pacing and plot events of the book. I skimmed through the whole book to make sure that the prologue wasn't a fluke-that the whole book continued in the same vein. It did-and just half-skimming/half-reading I was bored. The main character apparently has the mind of teenager, or at least that means of expression. Completely lacking in elegance, polish, talent, or believability, this is similar in style and content to Nicholas Spark's books, but unlike his books displays no maturity whatsoever-Nicholas Spark at least has some writing ability. It's a shame, because about the only thing the book has going for it is that the overall plot and characters do have a lot of potential-it's just completely unrealized."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of \\"what will make women cry\\" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a 14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"This is not good! I resent authors who formulate a story based on another writer's success. Just for the record--we all can spot the Nicholas Sparks, Danielle Steele and Mary Higgins Clark's of the world ... They do not respect their readers only their pocketbooks. (Same story over and over, new characters.) Mr. Patterson, you are too good for this. I am mad. I bought this book a while back and forgot I had read it, so I did it again. By the time I realized I had already read it I was well into it, I figured, well, I have already read it, but it's a Patterson, so it will be a good read. Well I am throwing it out so I don't do this again!! Don't write from a woman's perspective. You don't HAVE a woman's perspective, i.e. \\"voice\\"! I love the Women's Murder series and it translated beautifully to tv. We miss it a lot. I've pre-ordered #8. You rock at what you do.

It's not really a complex book or anything, but it did manage to keep me up reading way past my bedtime. I found that I couldn't sleep without seeing what happened in this excellent little story of two women and the loves and loss they experienced in their lives.Pretty much right away, within the first few pages, you can tell that 'Sam's Letters' is going to give you a healthy tug to the heartstrings. It starts out on a sad note, and be warned, it doesn't really let up. Certainly, the story has its sweet moments, its funny moments, and its romantic moments, but there is an overall tone of tragedy here that breaks your heart every few chapters.The story is told from multiple character viewpoints -- mainly from the perspective of Jennifer, but also in the form of letters written by her grandmother (Samantha, the 'Sam' of the title) to her, talking about her life. Patterson manages the two different voices well, and makes the story present itself as though the reader is going through someone's diary or correspondence. The way he has written it, it just feels that personal and intimate and unguarded.'Sam's Letters' is a touching and warm story about how love can grow in unexpected places, how loss can affect our ability to recognize love, how life can surprise us even when we think it has no surprises left in store, and how past and present can intertwine. It is a simple story, one which I suspect many people can understand and feel for. I know I did."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"I was initially surprised to see a romance story written by James Patterson, and likewise apprehensive about reading it. However, I couldn't be happier that I did! This book is not only a definite tear jerker, but a really good lesson is involved. I've reccomended it to several friends, and none of them were dissapointed! This is currently on my list of books to re-read."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"James Patterson has proven himself many times in his writings, but in Sam's Letters to Jennifer he reaches a feminine base I didn't think possible for a man. Sam is actually \\"Samantha\\", Jennifer's Grandmother and the story is rich with insight, tears and laughter. Mr. Patterson's ability to tap into female fears and desires on the personal level of family relationships and those fears of beginning again really touched me. I read this book in just a few hours. It didn't change my life... but it did make my day."},{"Title":"Sams Letters To Jennifer","review":"A different book style from Patterson's normal genre of Detectives solving murders.

Will he die?I found it very sweet and I can't wait to loan it out."},{"Title":"The Modern Woman's Guide to Life","review":"I cannot imagine why this book went out of print and why there have been no more editions. With its diversity of topics (plumbing repair, dressing for success, ditching a beau) and its diversity of authors (hundreds of Modern Women, just like me!), this book has kept me entertained and informed for years. Some of the fashion advice is a bit old and the sexual health information could definately use an update, but the book has held up remarkably well over time. I guess plumbing technology and beau ditching just hasn't changed that much over the decade."},{"Title":"The Modern Woman's Guide to Life","review":"I am appalled that such a wonderful,helpful and amusing book isn't available.I'm going to have to give MY well preserved copy to a family friend who's graduating from college.Except for a few sections,the advice is timeless."},{"Title":"The Modern Woman's Guide to Life","review":"My mother gave me this book when I left home for college, almost 20 years ago. My niece is about to start college, and I thought this would be the perfect gift. I was very surprised that it is out of print! With the exception of a couple of sections that could use an update, this book is still very much appropriate to women of every age. Occasionally I still read through it and find something useful.I am looking for a similar book, but haven't found anything that is remotely as good. I think I'll need to pass on my copy to my niece! It is too bad that this book didn't continue with updated additions.As a side note, I'm a big reader.

All the advice and info holds true to today. Please make this as a kindle version, and I'd love to see a new version as well!"},{"Title":"The Modern Woman's Guide to Life","review":"Like the other reviews above, I echo the same sentiment. Why hasn't this book been given a new edition? Except for some outdated references to celebrities (oh how quickly they fade), the advice, the illustrations, the general philosophy of this book is not only timeless, but presented in a way that is as deeply engaging as it is instructional. Everything from repairing a car to two recipes no one can do without, to how to win at poker, to preparing a will, to picking out lingerie, to dating, to nutrition, to how to treat a gunshot wound, and believe it or not - there's more! This book has it all. I plan on giving my copy to a niece when she graduates college. Young girls needed this book back in 1988, and they need it now."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"This (i am soory to say) was definently NOT the best book I have read. There is almost zero percent of a wait before the romance starts. There is so much of it that it is overwhelming. I had to force myself to finish it. Sorry Ms. Hendrickson. Better Luck next time!"},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"The Reader from Boston is, of course, entitled to her opinion, with which I heartily disagree, but she should be aware that Ms. Hendrickson is probably the premier expert today on the Regency. Her reference book is a veritable bible for authors of Regency romance. For Ms. Boston's information, btw, a woman could, indeed, be a baronness in her own right, although it was rare. They could hold other titles as well, on occasion. At least one of the Duchesses of Marlborough held that title in her own right. I, personally find Ms. Hendrickson's books a delight, and her research is impeccable."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Regardless of Ms. Hendrickson's background in Regency research, this book is poorly written. The character developments are extremely weak and almost non-existent. I am a great fan of Regency romances and usually devour them in one sitting, however I've had Ms. Hendrickson's book for more than a week and haven't gotten past chapter six, it just isn't interesting. The plot is simply uninteresting and the character conversations are boring and so convoluted they are impossible to follow.I read Regency romance as a light-hearted escape into another time and place. I like Regency's specifically, because the heroine's have pluck and know their own minds. They always end up involved in intriguing situations with wonderfully dashing men who always arrive in the nick of time. Reading a Regency is like having a wonderful dessert after a hard day at work.However reading this book is like eating baker's chocolate, very unappetizing. I have to admit I've never read a Regency by Ms. Hendrickson before, and probably never will read her again. I wish her lots of luck on her next romance. Maybe she'll actually have time to take the reader into consideration and write a reasonably interesting book, instead of cranking one out for the money."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I have never been BLOWN away by Hendrickson's novels but usually found them sweet if nothing else. This novel was so excruciating I had to force myself to finish it. While her facts on the Regency are right, her portrayal of manners was completely and totally off. I could only assume that everyone at the house party featured in the book was mildly retarded because sane members on the Ton in the Regency would never have behaved or spoken as they did in this book. Furthermore, the characters had little to no depth and even less consistency in their motivations and emotions. The dialog was stilted and the events most contrived. For such a well-publicized Regency author, very poor show! Frankly, and I'm sorry to sound so dramatic, I'm simply stunned that her editor/publishing house allowed this to pass."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Having read this book, I've now read the reviews here for the first time, and I have to say that I agree with the majority of them. This is an incredibly boring book, riddled with errors and inaccuracies, and which shows no concern at all for the manners of the period. I'm well aware that Hendrickson is considered an expert on the Regency period, and another book of hers I've read is considerably better than this. All I can suggest is that she clearly had an off-day when she wrote this book - or her publisher has put her name on something written by someone else!The romance, first. Lady Jocelyn meets Peter, Lord Leigh again five years after rejecting his proposal on the apparent grounds that, as a mere baronet at the time, he wasn't good enough for the daughter of a marquess. Now he's a baron and wealthy. Instead of shunning her, though, he is openly affectionate and attentive towards her. Leigh was so particular in his attentions that I actually wondered if he was attempting to get revenge by compromising Jocelyn. Apparently not. Apparently Hendrickson thinks that it was perfectly acceptable behaviour for a gentleman to: call a lady by her first name at all times; wander in and out of her private apartments without permission and without any servant or fellow (female) guest in attendance; wander off alone with said lady for hours and hours at a time, even returning late for dinner on one occasion; kiss said lady in a passionate manner normally reserved for a courtesan, and to do so on some occasions in full view of other guests. These are just some examples of Leigh's very unlikely behaviour towards Jocelyn. Her reputation would have been ruined in a matter of hours, let alone days - and the consequence wouldn't have been a wedding, but the assumption that Jocelyn was already ruined.There is another unmarried woman who is a minor character in this book. I actually had to go back to the beginning of the book to check her marital status, because she behaved as if she was a daring widow, frequently sneaking off alone with men, practically propositioning the hero and other men, and in the end declaring her intention to go and live on the Continent since her relatives had been disgraced. A single woman? With whom would she propose to live?Which brings me to another point: the complete lack of any chaperonage in this book. Unmarried female characters, of whom there were several, were left to do whatever they liked, and were left alone with gentlemen on many occasions, even being kissed in view of other people from time to time. Several reputations would have been ruined in this book, were the other characters not apparently all blind.And there are secondary characters to extremes: far too many to keep track of, and none of whom aroused even the remotest interest for me. Quite simply, the characters were either cardboard cut-outs, or ridiculously exaggerated caricatures as in the case of the French cousins Henri and Pierre, and Suzanne.And then there was the mystery plot: the theft of a necklace. Now, several times Jocelyn and Leigh discuss who would have a motive to steal it; who would benefit most from the proceeds of its sale. And yet earlier in the book we are told that the necklace is unique, so much so that it could not be sold in one piece - it would be recognised. So why do the characters assume that it would be sold? And the eventual thieves seem completely inconsistent in their motives, saying in one minute that it was stolen to allow another woman the right to wear it (how? Would it not be recognised instantly?) and the next that they needed the proceeds of its sale.I was tempted to throw this book away after only one chapter, but persevered in the hope that it would get better. It didn't, and it represents three hours of my life that I won't get back! It is one of the most boring so-called romances I have ever read, and the anachronisms, together with errors in word usage (what on earth is a 'roughish' look??) and the grammatical mistakes with which this book is riddled, made it almost impossible to concentrate on the story. Despite earlier, better experience with Hendrickson's work, I don't think I'll be reading anything by her ever again. I'm very surprised to see an author of Anne Barbour's calibre writing here in support of a book as bad as this."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"If you are a true lover of the Regency genre, buy this book. I have no idea what the other readers are talking about. I was positively delighted with The Dangerous Baron Leigh. True, the book moved quickly into the romance, but isn't that what we want? Cuddle up with this book by the fire and you won't be disappointed. As always, Ms. Hendrickson delivers a wonderfully satisfying Regency romance."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Well, I read all the reviews here, and then I went and bought the book. Lesson Number One of buying a Regency: If there are more than two copies on the shelf, chances are it is an inferior romance. I ignored this hard-earned lesson and bought it anyway, trusting in the positive reviews. I shouldn't have. The character's motivations are absolutely inexplicable. Why does this hero, in complete violation of every moral of the day, persist in kissing a woman to whom he is not engaged? Why does she continue to allow him to treat her in such a fashion when she's not sure of her future with him? This could have been explained in the story's narrative, but wasn't. And I couldn't agree more with the reader from Boston's quibbles with word misusage. Whatever happened to copyeditors! (By the way, she uses &quot;diffidence&quot; when she means &quot;indifference.&quot; Just in case it drove you crazy too.) The conversation is stilted; the mystery is boring, and since any tension in the romance was completely gone by page 185, I found it difficult to motivate myself to read the remaining 33 pages. If you are looking for a good Regency romance, I recommend Emma Lange, Judith A. Lansdowne, or the fantastic Patricia Veryan, but I don't recommend Ms. Hendrickson's attempt at fiction."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I certainly agree with this book's second reviewr. I urge other readers to completely disregard Ms. Boston's appraisal...She is overly critical in addition to being ignorant of regency vocabulary. English is an ever-evolving language, and there will, of course, be words that were once used that have fallen out of common usage. Pitty for her that she can't appreciate the author's success in reserecting a regency &quot;feel&quot; for her book."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Emily Hendrickson is one of the few Regency authors I collect because of her outstanding work. Her books are light-hearted and entertaining, historically accurate and detailed, as well as being a wonderful escape. The series of books that this particular one follows (Ms. Timothy Perserveres, etc.) is particularly fun to read, and I eagerly searched out a copy of this book. I was a little disappointed, as the book is somewhat stilted. My first impression is that she was fulfilling a contract and her heart wasn't in this one. With one other exception, my experience with Ms. Hendrickson has been wonderful! I would highly recommend that disappointed readers browse another of her books before writing her off."},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Well truth be told I'm not really sure what to say about this book. It wasn't quite bad enough to be BAD, but it wasn't quite good enogh to be GREAT either. The mystery itself is a great mystery. Jocelyn Robards (main Character)has been invited to her dear cousin's house to help her cousin (Lora) plan a costume ball to honor the new heir but when she arrives there (soaking wet and saved by our hansome hero Lord Peter Leigh whom she refused suit 5 years past) she learns that her cousin's family heirloom has been stolen and must be found within two weeks because Lora plans to wear it the night of the costume ball. OK so basicly that's the entire plot right there. The mystery is told perfectly. It kept my attention throughout the entire book. It was always once you felt certain that it was one person the author brough up good reasons why it could have been another which then made you start to think of another person... So that was the good about the book and here's the bad...It drove me absolutly insane that our hero, even though he had been refused 5 years ago because he had no title or fortune which he now has, everytime he speaks to Jocelyn he will call her &quot;My Love&quot;, &quot;Dearest&quot;, and all of the other things that would never had been stood for back then by anybody unless the people were married! It just seemed silly to hear this over and over and over! And the way Peter would just walk right into Jocelyn's sitting room without even knocking seemed just a little unbelievable to me. These are not the ONLY things that were wrong but I really don't think it fair to point out all of them because like I said before, the story itself was good. I hope the editor looks a little closer next time!!"},{"Title":"The Dangerous Baron Leigh (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"The most terrifying thing about this book is Ms. Hendrickson's boast in her biography that she is the author of a reference book about the regency. I presume that it is a very short book. Of course, it could have been worse. She might have written a reference book about English usage and grammar, or about how to write a novel, or about how real people think, speak and behave. These are all subjects about which she knows even less than she does about the regency. For starters, if the hero was his grandmother's heir, then he was not penniless, he was a young man with expectations, which is a different thing altogether. Of course, he might have been her heir, but she could under no circumstances have been a baroness in her own right. Women never were. Then there is the matter of human motivation and action. The hero hasn't seen the heroine for five years, yet he is certain that she is still in love with him. Why would a man think so? Would he not have at least some doubt, or some resentment? As to English usage, we are given implicated where implicit is meant, opportune for importune, partake for participate, and diffidence for I don't know what. If you were so misguided as to buy this book, turn to page 95 and try to guess what Ms. Hendrickson was trying to say. I could not."},{"Title":"The Secret of Red Gate Farm (Nancy Drew, Book 6)","review":"This review concerns the original 1931 edition and the revised 1961 edition, which tells a story similar to the original, but it is shorter. While on a shopping trip, Nancy, Bess and George meet a young girl named Millie (Joanne in the revised edition) who lives at Red Gate Farm with her grandmother. Millie/Joanne and her grandmother may be forced to sell their farm because they don't have enough money, so they decide to take in boarders. Nancy, George and Bess go to the farm to spend some time with their new friend and she tells them about a weird nature cult that rents part of their land and performs strange rituals at night. Nancy; however, suspects that the cult is not quite what it seems. To find out if she is right you'll have to read the book. I really enjoyed this book. I found the mystery intriguing and the writing was very good (at least with the original edition, which was the one I read). I'd recommend reading the original edition, if possible, but either way, this is a very good story that fans of the series would enjoy."},{"Title":"The Secret of Red Gate Farm (Nancy Drew, Book 6)","review":"Nancy Drew and the Mystery at the Red Gate Farm is a very good book. It all started when Nancy and her friends, Bess and George (who were cousins) were out shopping. They came to a perfume shop and Bess found a bottle of perfume she wanted. When she went to buy it, the clerk acted very strange and almost insisted that Bess shouldn't buy it. She bought it anyway and they continued their journey home. On the metro link, Nancy and the two cousins befriended a very nice girl. She was about their age and her name was Joanne. She lives on Red Gate Farm with her grandma, but they are planning to sell it soon. \\"Grams put an ad in the paper saying that we will allow boarders to come live with us, but no one answered it yet. I was out looking for a job today, but I haven't had much luck.\\"During the way home, Bess was opening up her perfume to show Joanne and the bottle slipped out of her hands. It spilt everywhere and got on Nancy. Later on, Nancy left to go to the bathroom. On her way, a mysterious looking man was staring at her and smelt her perfume. He asked her in a whisper, \\"Any word from the chief?\\" The man realized his mistake and walked away. Could this have been some kind of clue to a mystery?The next morning Nancy drove Joanne to her interview. When they got there, a rude man confronted them. He told Joanne to go to another room and wait for him. Nancy sat in a chair in the front office where she saw the man writing and talking on the phone. When he went to Joanne, Nancy got up and wrote down what he had written. Joanne finished soon afterwards and they left.Nancy called up Jo and told her that Bess, George, and she could come be their paying boarders at the farm so that Grams could get more money to keep the farm. So the next day Nancy picked everyone up and they were on their way to the farm. It took several hours for them to get to the countryside. After traveling for such a long time, they decided to go eat. When Nancy drove up, she noticed that the man that she had seen on the train, the woman from the perfume shop, and the rude guy in the office were in a car filling up gas. The girls quickly ate and continued towards Red Gate Farm.When they got home, everyone was introduced to each other. Joanne told the girls that there was a cult that lived on the hill right next to Red Gate Farm. They're called The Black Snake Colony and perform rituals on the nights when there are full moons. Jo told them that everyone in town is afraid of them. A couple of days later they decided to make cloaks like the ones the Black Snake Colony wear so that one night they could sneak up and start the rituals with them and find out what was going on in the colony. After going to buying the material for the cloaks, they had a bite to eat at the same restaurant they had eaten at a couple days before. They sat down at a table and heard loud voices. They walked into the room with secret service agents. They were talking about counterfeited money. All of a sudden the restaurant owner said, \\"That's her! That's the girl who gave me the fake $20 bill!\\" She was pointing at Nancy. When the girls found out what happened, they cleared everything up with the manager. Evidently, someone snuck into Nancy's wallet and traded her real money for counterfeit money.That night the girls finished making their cloaks and decided that they were going to join the rituals that night. So when they saw the Black Snake members doing their dances, they ran out to the hill. Joanne stayed behind some bushes as the girls' look out. Bess, George, and Nancy ran out to the hill in their cloaks and masks and started dancing and chanting. A few minutes later, everyone went into a hidden cave. Once everyone was seated on the ground, their leader said, \\"Ok, let's get to business!\\" Everyone stood up and walked into a secret room where there were machinery, paper, and money everywhere. \\"So they're the counterfeiters!\\" Nancy thought to herself. \\"Before you start working,\\" their leader said, \\"let's have everyone take off their masks to make sure no one's missing.\\" The three girls whispered to each other, \\"We're doomed!\\" Nancy told them calmly to try and run for it, but a man was guarding the door.When it came to the three girls' turn to take their masks off, Bess accidentally shouted, \\"Nooo!\\" The Colony surrounded the girls and forced them to take off their masks to reveal themselves. The girls were very scared but one by one they took off their masks. The leader was outraged when he found out that the girls had snuck inside the cave and were snooping around. He told his people to tie them up and take the girls out to a nearby shack.While the girls got tied up, they saw Joanne being dragged inside by another man. Joanne had been caught! When they reached the mouth of the cave, the police were there. I wonder what happens next! You will have to read the book to find out what happens in the end.

THE SECRET OF RED GATE FARM was the sixth book in the series, and like the earlier books it presented its heroine as a rich, headstrong, and distinctly reckless teenager who sometimes carried a pistol and who wasn't above breaking the law when it suited her purposes.As the series progressed and other writers began to generate Nancy Drew novels, the character changed and Nancy was \\"toned down;\\" instead of flatly rich, she became reasonably affluent; recklessness was replaced by commonsense caution; and while she might be willing to bend the law a bit she would never knowingly break it. In the 1950s and 1960s the earlier novels were re-written to reflect this change in character.Originally published in 1931, RED GATE FARM was re-written in 1961--but unlike several other re-written titles the story remains much the same. In this instance, Nancy and her friends Bess and George visit Red Gate Farm, where owner Mrs. Byrd is in financial difficulty and has rented a portion of the land to a religious cult. When Nancy becomes curious, she and her friends are threatened by the cult members--and they decide to infiltrate the group's strange gatherings.It is worth noting that the cult, which is called The Black Snake Cult, dresses in white robes with odd, peaked hoods, and Nancy and the girls consider disguising themselves with sheets and pillowcases the better to spy upon their activities. Given the era of the book's first publication and later re-write, this would seem to be a subconcious reference to the Klu Klux Klan on the author's part! As always in the original series, the story is very much of its era: there are no cell phones, computers, or modern gadgets, and Nancy is very much an ideal of the time: she can sew, herd a cow, treat a snakebite, and still seem to dress appropriately for all social occasions.The Nancy Drew books are not great literature by any stretch of the imagination--they are too distinctly formula for that--but they are competently written, literate, and never talk down to their target audience. They are also good \\"comfort reading\\" for grown-ups who recall their childhood reading fondly. RED GATE FARM is an amusing read for old fans and newcomers alike.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Secret of Red Gate Farm (Nancy Drew, Book 6)","review":"I have just read an enticing book, The Secret of Red Gate Farm by Carolyn Keene.

The girls get on a train to go back to River Heights when Bess tries on the perfume but drops the perfume and it spills all over Nancy.

They met a girl on a train name Joanne (joe) who was getting of the same place. Joe was trying to get a job so Nancy went with Joe for the application when they went there a man came and asked Joe to seat in the room and the phone rang and the man wrote down some numbers then went to ask Joe some questions. Nancy went and saw what numbers he wrote and copied down the numbers when the man came back but Nancy did not copy all the numbers (1653 112 129 1562 16 882 091 5618 ).

So Nancy thought she and her friends could stay with Joe for a little while and Joe was happy to invite them to come to Red Gate Farm. So the next day Nancy and her friends went to Red Gate Farm.

Written by Harrison k."},{"Title":"The Secret of Red Gate Farm (Nancy Drew, Book 6)","review":"In \\"The Red Gate Farm\\" I thought that the setting was a perfect place to have the plot. I thought it was a good place because it was a perfect place to have counterfeit money making place where nobody ever goes to and where people would never think of a cave and a farm to do all the making of fake money.\\"The Red Gate Farm\\" was a very good book I thought. The events that I liked were the beginning when the man comes up to Nancy in the train because that's when the first start of the mystery begins to show up. Also I liked how nice and kind Nancy was to Joanne because she was having such a rough time with her grandma's farm. I thought Nancy was nice because she helped Joanne when she fainted from the perfume, and when Joanne needed to find a job and a place to stay for the night. A third thing I liked was how each character acted, like it just gave them character. Like Mr. Kent, Maurice Hale, Mrs. Hale, Nancy, Yvonne, Joanna, and others, but those were the ones I thought were good because how they acted I thought just gave them a lot of a variety in each character. Another thing I liked was when finally they got all their costumes ready to go and sneak into the Black Snake Colony Cult. I thought it was very brave of them all to do this very risky thing to do. When they snuck in and found a lot of information of what the Cult was doing and who a lot of the people were. I guess I just liked how exciting and sometimes suspenseful it was to see what was going on and what was going to happen. Lastly I loved when at the end when Nancy and her friends were caught, and you thought it was the end for them, suddenly you read that the secret service was there to arrest the criminals and then when the mystery was finally solved. I liked the book, but those were the few events in the \\"Red Gate Farm\\" I really like.I really liked \\"The Red Gate Farm\\" but there were some thing's I didn't like that much. Some things were that I thought the snake biting George part didn't really matter all that much. Also I thought some things could have been cut out and get right to the point, but I guess the author was just making it a little suspenseful. The things that could have been cut out a little bit were the parts of them making the costumes; to me they weren't that all important. Also I thought that some of the spying on the Cult wasn't as important because no real significant events happened, and sometimes the Cult wouldn't even gather, so sometimes I thought it was kind of pointless. Other than those couple of events I thought the book was really good!"},{"Title":"Postmodernism, Reason and Religion","review":"In this brief but scintillating essay, Ernest Gellner describes the current intellectual situation faced by humankind, lays out his own allegiances, and offers his hopes for the future.Gellner argues that there are three basic options of belief available today: he describes these as &quot;Religious fundamentalism,&quot; &quot;Relativism, as exemplified by the recent fashion of 'postmodernism',&quot; and &quot;Enlightenment rationalism or rationalist fundamentalism.&quot;As an example of fundamentalism, Gellner focuses not on the long-maligned Christian fundamentalism of the West but rather on the Islamic fundamentalism which has recently captured the world's attention (Gellner's essay was published in 1992, nearly a decade before the 9/11 catastrophe).Gellner credibly argues, contrary to the views propagated by Muslim-haters in the West, that in many ways Islamic fundamentalism is a modernizing and rationalizing force. For example, he explains, &quot;Contrary to what outsiders generally suppose, the typical Muslim woman in a Muslim city doesn't wear the veil because her grandmother did so, but because her grandmother did _not_: her grandmother was far too busy in the fields, and she frequented the shrine without a veil, and left the veil to her betters. The granddaughter is celebrating the fact that she has joined her grandmother's betters...&quot;Gellner further argues that &quot;a certain kind of separation of powers was built into Muslim society from the very start...It subordinates the executive [i.e., the government] to the (divine) legislature and, in actual practice, turns the theologians/lawyers into the monitors of political rectitude...&quot;This may seem an odd point to make given the contempt and derision which Western media have heaped on, for example, the &quot;mullahs&quot; of Iran. And yet, for all its shortcomings, the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown more capacity for self-criticism, more actual democracy, than most secular regimes in the Islamic world (e.g., Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in Iraq). And the atrocities committed by the mullahs are almost insignificant compared to the tens of millions of innocent persons murdered by the anti-religious socialist regimes which dominated Asia during the twentieth century (in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Communist Cambodia, etc.).While Gellner is not an uncritical admirer of fundamentalism, Islamic or otherwise, he turns his main guns on his fellow academics, especially those who espouse &quot;postmodernism&quot; and other allied forms of relativism.Gellner explains that the universities are dominated by the research model provided by the natural sciences in which scholars are expected to constantly churn out genuinely new knowledge. But, he adds, &quot;in fields such as the humanities, not only is it not clear that there is any cumulative development, any real 'progress', it is not always altogether clear what 'research' should or could aim it.&quot; So, in lieu of true scholarship, the humanities are seduced into &quot;a setting up of artificial obsolescence and rotation of fashion, characteristic of the consumer goods industry...&quot; Postmodernism, and its predecessors and successors, are academic fads.Gellner demonstrates this in great detail in a case study of his own profession of anthropology.He further argues that postmodernism and other forms of intellectual relativism are not merely harmless academic fads; they also distract us from understanding the most important historical development of the last thousand years.That development, Gellner maintains, consists of the fact that, for the first time in human history, one civilization has discovered a method to reveal objective, practically indisputable, and culturally-independent knowledge about the natural world, knowledge that offers incomparable power in controlling nature and doing good or harm to our fellow humans.That method is generally called the &quot;scientific method&quot; and every civilization on this planet is frantic to reap its fruits.&quot;Enlightenment Rationalist Fundamentalism&quot; is the label Gellner uses for the belief system which underlies the natural sciences and which neither swears allegiance to any religious or ideological Revelation nor succumbs to the superficial tolerance of all-ideas-are-equal relativism as is preached by postmodernism.Enlightenment rationalism preaches initial tolerance for any idea or hypothesis but only on condition that this hypothesis be subjected to the ruthlessly severe test of the scientific method. Of course, very few ideas survive the test.In some ultimate sense, Enlightenment rationalism is the least tolerant belief system of all.Coyly, Gellner offers as a model for the future an uneasy but mutually tolerant coexistence among these three competing belief systems. Yet, in his final two pages he makes clear whom he envisions as ultimately triumphing from such a system of mutual coexistence.He scathingly dismisses postmodernists as historically irrelevant: &quot;The relativists, in whatever guise -- the 'postmodernists' are but an extravagant, undisciplined and transient mode of this attitude -- seem to me to offer an accurate and acceptable account of how we do, and probably of how we should, order our gastronomy (at any rate on any one evening), our wallpaper, and even, for lack of a better alternative, our daily self-image. (Though most evenings, I'd prefer a traditional rather than postmodernist menu.) Their insights apply to the decorative rather than to the real structural and functional aspects of our life...As an account of the realities of our world and a guide to conduct, [their] position is laughable.&quot;He also dismisses serious religious belief as, perhaps, once having served a historically necessary purpose but now supplanted by the true knowledge offered by science: &quot;The fundamentalists deserve our respect, both as fellow recognizers of the uniqueness of truth, who avoid the facile self-deception of universal relativism, and as our intellectual ancestors. Without indulging in excessive ancestor-worship, we do owe them a measure of reverence. Without serious, not to say obsessional monotheism and unitarianism, the rationalist naturalism of the Enlightenment might well never have seen the light of day...It was a jealous Jehovah who really taught mankind the Law of the Excluded Middle.&quot;In the end, the only belief system which can survive long-term is, Gellner believes, the empiricist rationalism created in the Western-European Enlightenment.To put it bluntly, the future belongs to John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Thomas Jefferson.I think, and hope, that Gellner is right."},{"Title":"Postmodernism, Reason and Religion","review":"By far the best part of this book is its droll, ironic, facetious demolition of the cultural relativists turned deconstructionists. As Gellner observes, relativism is good for allowing people their choice of wallpaper, little more.I was disappointed that there was not more in this brief book on fundamentalist Islam, since it was advertised as having been written as half of a duplex along with an Islamic historian.My main critique of Postmodernism ... is that Gellner presents the reader with a kind of intellectual 3 card monte. Postmodernism on the left is 'bad,' fundamentalist religion on the right is 'bad,' ergo, the only card left standing, in the middle, his brand of Englightenment Fundamentalist Secularism (as he candidly calls it) must by the process of elimination be 'good.'But those 3 categories are numerically incomparable. There might be 50 thousand committed postmodernists in the world--insignificant. There might be 400 million EFS's in the world, western europe plus bicoastal university USA. There are probably 2-3 billion committed religious believers in the world. But folks in Gellner's and the postmodern microcosms snobbishly condescend to those poor beknighted refugees from the 13th century.Gellner's big mistake here is to equate all sincere religious belief with fundamentalism, a bad gaffe for a sociologist, who should at least be able to correctly report what a given community thinks, believes, etc., even if he doesn't agree. But most Christians I know, and I believe most Muslims, and Hindus, are post rationalist, not pre-rationalist. That is, we take the best of the enlightenment, dredge its many infirmities, and add the good to the already very good religious faith. Two superb examples of this would be Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both of whom were highly degreed and intellectually acclaimed in the maw of the enlightenment, saw its positives, rejected its weaknesses, and blended the one with the other, to create a superior development (not change) to 21st century Catholicism.Gellner is to be praised for admitting that the 2 attempts at putting 100% pure enlightenment-ism into political action were train wrecks, the french and russian revolutions. He also admits that his enlightenment fundamentalist rationalist secularist religion probably could have only grown up on Judaeo-Christian soil. But the problem is, is that the EFRS religion has been living off the fumes of Christendom for centuries, cutting the limb on which it is sitting, and soon the cultural vacuum which is europe (and bicoastal USA) will be ripe for plucking by immigrants with a more muscular response than 'whatever.'"},{"Title":"Effective Handling of Manipulative Persons","review":"A concise in-depth presentation of manipulative persons in the prison system.

It's written very simply and helps us to imagine the inner turmoil of being an outsider in a judgemental society.Born to an abusive father in Kansas, Arbuckle turned to theatre as an escape from a bitter life. He rose to fame in the cinema and at one point was more popular than Chaplin. He was the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year.But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. He was slandered by the press and not even his acquittal could save his career. He eventually lost everything.Stahl emphasizes the mental anguish of being fat, impotent, and presumed guilty. He also shows the role that heroin played in Fatty Arbuckle's life. Heroin was readily available and legal at the time, and he became addicted using it as a pain killer after a botched medical procedure. Towards the end of his years, his servant used heroine as a tool to get Arbuckle to divulge all of his secrets.I had the pleasure of hearing Stahl read from the book and it was quite entertaining. He joked that it is obligatory for him to include heroin in every one of his novels. He emphasizes the public outcry against Fatty as being led by a conservative anti-Hollywood element. I would agree, but would also like to point out that in the 1920s journalists had more leeway to embelish the truth and print it as fact. Even today, the press chooses to emphasize some facts over others and often slanders people in the process.If you are interested in the life of one of Hollywood's first stars, and if you like dark humor, &quot;I, Fatty&quot; is for you. It's a good read that will make you think and give you a laugh or two."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"'A little tramp stops being a tramp when the camerastops rolling.

The firstMovie-star in history, ruined by the accusation thathe raped and murdered a young starlet with the help ofa Coca-Cola bottle. Stahl crawls into the mind of abattered, dirt-poor little boy, hated by his father.After ditching school to watch vaudeville shows, hesoon stumbles on the stage himself. But he becomesfamous for what he loathes himself most for: for beingfat. He stuffs himself in baby-clothes and drag andsoon matches Charlie Chaplin's and Buster Keaton'spopularity and public adulation. But he becomesfamous for what he loathes himself most for: for beingfat.It is well known that he drank too much. But hisHeroin-addiction was something that is not that wellknown. Even though he was acquitted after three trials,he never recovered. Stahl draws a brilliant parallelto the first victim of the media driven Hollywoodscandal. No matter what's the truth; the public hasdecided that this fat and disgustingly funny troll didit.Stahl makes you feel the anguish and the self-hatredlike nobody else, but he also makes us love Fatty Arbuckle."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Roscoe Arbuckle was a fat man who lived a tragic life. He was born in Kansas to an abusive father and invalid mother. The father taunted him for his considerable girth while beating him with a strap. Roscoe ran away after a year or so of grammer school to hit the boards in vaudeville.Underneath the all too too sullied flesh there was a good brain and warm heart. Fatty became famous as a star comedian along with opium addicted Mabel Normand in the Keystone Cop flicks. Fatty knew them all-Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. He was the first Hollywood star to make a million dollars a year and was loved by the vast American public who enjoyed a night at the flickers.Along the way he engaged in many bad habits such as heroin and opium usage, excessive eating and drinking enough to drown several grown men. He was known as \\"The Prince of Whales.\\" Arbuckle was always well dressed, knew his lines and was eager to help newcomers in the business.Fatty's life went down the spout when he was accused of the rape and murder of the floozy Virginia Rappe in a St. Francis Hotel Room in San Francisco. Fatty endured three trials and terrible publicity. He was finally acquitted but his career was in shambles. He went on to direct a few movies under an assumed name and opened a nightclub but the damage had been done to his career. Fatty married three times, endured several physical afflictions and was the first big star whose scandal gave Hollywood a bad reputation in middle America.Jerry Stahl has done his research on the Arbuckle life and career. Arbuckle (1887-1933) was an important figure in early film comedy who deserves to be studied."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"\`I love this book,' reads Johnny Depp's comment on the front dust jacket of I, FATTY. \`I like it,' is mine. It's a great title for a book and a tremendous tale of early Hollywood, told with a verve and flair reminiscent of that which E L Doctorow's RAGTIME applied to the eastern seaboard of the US of A.I, FATTY is a first-person narrative fictional reconstruction of the life and times of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, the first Hollywood star to earn $1M a year, only to find his fame turn to infamy and fortune slip from his grasp after a party resulting in the death of a female partygoer in Room 1221 of San Francisco's St Francis Hotel.Revisionist in the sense that this is Arbuckle's personal take on his career and eventual disgrace, there is still no way the fat boy wasn't \\"at it\\" - whatever \\"at it\\" may mean, of course. He was not a rapist (for reasons revealed in the book), and he was certainly no murderer. But the precise details of Virginia Rappe's demise remain as unclear as they ever were. Fact: Fatty Arbuckle - a definite dipso and occasional drug addict - is caught in flagrante with a damsel in dire distress who subsequently dies.So what is Fatty Arbuckle exactly? A voyeur? Maybe. A raver? Well, yes: he's no angel, that's for sure. But neither is Virginia (-in-name-only) Rappe, the professional lady who expires subsequent to Fatty's alleged ministrations with a Coke bottle. And neither are the press and public any more angelic than they.Thanks to the concentrated attention of the Hearst press in the main (Buster Keaton apart, Fatty's friends are the kind best described as \\"fair weather\\") Fatty Arbuckle is a condemned man from the start, and his world caves in completely until, exonerated at last (after a trial and retrials), he makes a lacklustre, partial, almost hand-to-mouth comeback as William Goodrich.On the minus side, Jerry Stahl's narrative is a bit too magazine-speak smooth for my liking. Personal pronouns appear to be anathema to him: a hostile witness instantly becomes \\"madcap Mabel\\", Fatty's car is christened \\"Big man-mobile\\", and an ill-favoured acquaintance attracts the soubriquet \\"Old Onion-Breath\\". Nor is the odd anachronism outside the author's remit: Fatty (dead by 1933) bewails the lack of the GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS 20-odd years before its time. But on the plus side, though Chaplin is somewhat neglected due to Fatty's dislike of the man, there are wonderful characterisations here of Mack Sennett and Buster Keaton - in addition to which a young Bob Hope is glimpsed on stage with Fatty in Cleveland, Ohio - and Bogart on Broadway.As I say, I like I, FATTY: it's a good read about interesting people in an exciting time and place. Still, I'd draw the line at love. Accordingly, I hereby draw that line unhesitatingly under Ted Heller's FUNNYMEN. Now there's a book I love: a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis-type showbiz scenario that romps entertainingly, mellifluously, and quite unstoppably from front cover to back. I rate it a real tour-de-force! A true American masterpiece! Read it, please read it - and read I, FATTY too."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Let me begin by stressing that Jerry Stahl is, by all means, a good writer. I, FATTY is an enjoyable read in some ways; but also a distressful one, particularly to fans of silent film comedian Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle. Johnny Depp is quoted as describing the novel as \\"the true skinny\\" on the comedian. With all due respect to this very talented actor, I am somewhat puzzled by his statement. Having read the novel twice, I found the Roscoe of Stahl's novel to be pretty much a bitter, rudely-spoken and generally depressing incarnation, which is hardly synonymous with how Roscoe's friends and associates remembered him. Though I cannot be certain, of course, it seems to me that Stahl's main motive for writing this novel stems from a fascination in a life which, certainly, was plagued by much pain and injustice. Roscoe had a very sad childhood, left alone to his violent, alcoholic father after his mother's early death, and constantly teased at school for his overweight; and while he admirably managed to outwin much of the traumas of his early years, going on to become one of the most celebrated film comedians of his time, his career was ruined after he was wrongly accused of rape and manslaughter in 1921. Roscoe played the sidekick of Charlie Chaplin early on in the latter's film career, and was the one who directly introduced Buster Keaton to the world of celluloid.A fascinating subject for a novel, no doubt. However, the fact that all persons directly involved in Roscoe's life have, in all probability, deceased by now, should not mean that ehtical deference can be ignored altogether. The events described does not require that far a dive into the past, after all; the scandal which ruined Roscoe's life happened less than a hundred years ago. In my opinion, Stahl far too seldom seems to take into consideration that his characters are based on real human beings. Perhaps this is a matter of necessity from an author's point of view; in order to make a character come alive on the page, focus on plain facts may indeed be a hindrance. A character based solely on facts and authentic observations would possibly turn out too realistic to be believable in the context of a novel. Yet, what troubles me most with I, FATTY is that it recalls Roscoe's entire story, seemingly first-hand from his perspective, and I'm not convinced that the book's admission of being a \\"novel\\" on the cover will prevent people less acquainted with Arbuckle's life to interpret too much of this as the truth or close to it (Charles Nordhoff and James N. Hall's novel \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" and its arguably inaccurate portrayal of Captain Bligh comes to mind).A few distressing examples: in the novel, Roscoe suffers a severe drug addiction right up to the end. In actuality, there is no proof whatsoever of this having been the case. Roscoe was prescribed morphine by his doctors at one point in 1917, following an infection which developed into a painful carbuncle on his leg, and this may have led to an addiction for a while; but all reports I know imply that he overcame it within some months. Perhaps most provocative is the depiction of the fatal event which ruined Roscoe's career; here the comedian's \\"thoughts,\\" as projected through Stahl, make him into a less than noble character, to say the least, despite his innocence and the fact that he, by all reliable accounts, tried to help the girl he was later accused of having abused. Granted, Stahl may have wanted to make the event more interesting by attributing Roscoe with an apparently conflicting state of mind even under such desperate circumstances, but I just wonder: was it necessary to depict this horrible event at all?It may not have been Stahl's intention to make his portrayal of Roscoe truthful in the first place, but rather to use his story as the basis for a novel he wanted to share, but also in that case, Roscoe deserved better. That said, I did actually enjoy the novel, if for other reasons than to witness \\"the true skinny on Fatty\\" brought to light. Stahl is a gifted writer, who seasons his work with highly quotable lines. I very much enjoyed the chapter on the making of the Keystone films, which nearly brought that bygone era back to life to me. I don't know if it was the moment when Chaplin placed his boots on the wrong feet that Roscoe realized that the young newcomer was a \\"genius,\\" but he does make this amusing observation in I, FATTY and it has stuck with me. In the end, I do recommend I, FATTY to anyone seeking an entertaining, well-written read; but please keep in mind that the narrator is not the actual Roscoe Arbuckle. Far from it, I would believe.

Jerry Stahl has thoughtfully included an impressive bibliography for us to mull over.But a lot of this is known to be untrue. So I had to drop a couple of stars off what otherwise is a pretty readable biography of Roscoe. He didn't like the sobriquet 'Fatty' you know.Stahl has a breezy pitter-patter style that keeps you turning pages even though it wears thin occasionally.But the real problem I have with the book is it seems apparent to me he just doesn't like Arbuckle very much. He gives the misfortune of the great fat man too much credence, as if Roscoe deserved what he got.In the mid 70s I was in Hollywood trying to break into acting. For amusement my girlfriend and I chased down infamous old Tinsel Town addresses as we boned up on the angst their former owners had experienced. Arbuckle's house on West Adams is still there but by then no one believed any of the stories about Roscoe's 'parties'. He had become a tragic figure, an example of Moviedom overreaction to what should have been page 6 minor news.I respect Stahl for researching and writing this book. I just wish he'd stuck closer to the truth."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"i polished this book off in two days. It is an entertaining book. Based on the provenance acknowledged by the author, it is really not possible to determine whether the personality is Arbuckle, the original interviewer or this author. Regardless, it is an entertaining read that generally agrees with the chronology of events presented elsewhere and adds a great deal of background. Obviously some recollections are not accurate in terms to times, dates or order, but may represent actual events. This is a sad story that ultimately shows what happens when the truth becomes secondary to an agenda. It also makes one appreciate constitutional protections of the rights of the accused."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"This is a novel is remarkable considering the amazing job that Stahl does in climbing inside the mind of Roscoe Arbuckle to lay out this \\"memoir\\". What makes the book as compelling and entertaining is the fact that is the structured around very real events. The book is laid out in short little bursts of story (1-5 pages each) as Arbuckle recounts his entire life in brief anecdotes. Many of the characters are real; you run into Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and other famous Hollywood types both onscreen and off. You also get to go on the roller coaster that was the scandal that took everything away from him at the height of his career. I've read some of Stahl's other works and this is certainly his best. This may be my favorite book I read all summer."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"An acerbic, harsh, funny and moving novel of silent comedic actor Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle. I have not read author Jerry Stahl before and was unfamiliar with his penchant for the degenerative dark side of humanity and the humour he can pull from that. This unique caustic wit allowed Stahl to raise Arbuckle up from the dusty past and let his voice finally be heard. Stahl did extensive research, as the bibliography shows, and places Arbuckle back up among the great comic pioneers where he belongs. But Stahl seems to get heavy handed with Abuckle's alleged drug addictions, to heroin (legal at the time and marketed by Bayer) and morphine, even using it as a device to force Fatty to tell his life story. There is no doubt he was an alcoholic and did use drugs to control pain after a horrifically botched job on a leg injury but no indication of this level of abuse. Since this is historical fiction, the author can take artistic license and include his required use of heroin that he jokes at his readings has to be included in all of his books. This never holds up the story just muddies it a bit.Now that the questionable drug use issue is out of the way, I can get to the meat of this review. If you want a time capsule of the turn of the century and early Hollywood, then hold on for a wow of a ride. Starting with Roscoe's birth at a hefty 16 pounds, he is ostracized for his size from then on and suffers harsh abuse by his alcoholic father. Finding himself abandoned by his father as a boy, he finagles his way onto the vaudeville stage as boy singer of illustrated songs. Along the way from singer to comedian, he does an act with the pitcher Cy Young about the benefits of health, gets caught in the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 (the only time \\"he and the great John Barrymore played the same roll\\") and has a pie fight across the Rio Grande with Pancho Villa. His Mack Sennett years, where he helps in the fledgling careers of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, teams up with Mable Normand and introduces pie fights to the world are like being included into an exclusive club. These times are written with a captivating, naive innocence that I didn't want to end. How much fun is it learn while filming in New York Arbuckle meets and dines with Enrico Caruso who compliments him on his singing. All these tidbits from the times added to the realism and enjoyment for this history and old movie junkie.The touch of harshness and foreboding that Stahl layered in during Fatty's rise, added to the pull of the narrative although I admit I found myself not ever wanting to get to the night of the infamous party and his inevitable fall. Stahl does not shy away from explicit descriptions on what Arbuckle did try to do to revive Virginia Rappe. From here the reader is then pulled through the ensuing three trials in a horrified daze, shaking their head at the injustice of it all. Instances like Arbuckle walking up the steps of the court house for the second trial, where around 50 members of the Women's Vigilante Commission encircle him and, upon a signal and in unison, they all spit on him are dizzying yet mesmerizing. William Randolph Hearst's paper, which leads the relentless libelous pursuit against him, reported \\"Fatty made a most impressive centerpiece in the fountain.\\" All of this culminates with the acquittal, along with the accompanying statement, after the third trial but sadly Arbuckle knows it doesn't matter. He valiantly tries to put his life back together, with support and help from Charlie Chaplin, Joe Schenck and his true friend Buster Keaton, but as a New York Times editorial said the day after his acquittal; \\"Arbuckle was a scapegoat, and the only thing to do... is to chase him off...\\" and they did. His response, \\"What do you do when the world thinks your a monster, and you know it's the world that's monstrous?\\", he did the best he could with the slices of pie he was given.It is the ending that fell flat and prevented this from being five stars. It just felt rushed and a bit confused. Despite that, it is a powerful read that will have you looking up other players involved in Fatty's story or wanting to rent one or more of his movies to see this giant (no pun intended) of the silver screen. In other words you won't be ready to shut this book and forget Roscoe Arbuckle anytime soon!"},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"I just finished this engaging book. Actually, I had trouble putting it down and doing other things.I had just read Ace Atkins, \\"Devil's Garden\\" (which I highly recommend to anyone) and found this book to be a great addition to learning about Roscoe as young boy who finds his way to true financial and Hollywood success only to be \\"hounded\\" by inner demons of child hood memories.But put the demons aside, the book really develops the character into a full blown man with little education and a fine mind. He never loses touch his \\"inner child\\" and finds fun and amusement along the way.Totally enjoyable."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"\\"What do you do when the world thinks you're a monster, and you know it's the world that's monstrous?\\" This question is posed by Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle in Jerry Stahl's heart-eating, fictionalized portrait of the turn of the century's original star of Hollywood meltdown.Meltdown (or becoming the \\"monster\\") has been mastered by contemporary fallen stars Michael Jackson, Robert Blake, and Courtney Love. The difference between this dreaded threesome and the dearly departed Fatty is that Arbuckle was incinerated by courtroom media scandal at the zenith of his sparkling vaudeville-to-screen career, not as a post-fame footnote. This fact is what gives I, FATTY, a Kafkaesque masterpiece, its flavorful rum punch in the face. In proving that fat is far stranger than fiction, Stahl's Fatty is clearly guilty of a crime he did not commit.As a writer for the pre-millennium hit TV show \\"Alf,\\" Stahl has publicly lived the chaotic celluloid life of success, breakdown and redemption. He was even nabbed by the Keystones on Fatty's old front lawn. In Fatty's smelly old clown shoes, Stahl romances, chills, thrills, revolts, and delivers the sweat drenched goods in this impossible to put down imagination of the mind controlling the plump though flaccid funny man who made Hollywood's first million dollars as a contract actor and lost everything after being accused of a brutal \\"Coke bottle rape\\" that killed young actress Virginia Rappe.From the days of Fatty's unusual arrest and three-trial prosecution, America has not reconciled its fear of fat. Thanks to this blood curdling imbroglio of 1921, even the success of charming, Bowflex-bucking Teletubbies John Goodman, Kirstie Alley and James Gandolfini are highly suspect. But I, FATTY is more than a mouthful of lunchmeat versus morality.Like O.J. Simpson, Fatty lived to see his own character assassination at the hands of the district attorney, the lawyers, families and \\"friends,\\" on both sides of the case, and the Hearst-controlled tabloid media --- a \\"crusifiction\\" --- can I get a witness for this fact ladies and germs? --- at the hands of a court, press and public that assumed Fatty was guilty before hearing any of the facts and, of course, before hearing one word from Fatty himself.But Fatty didn't do it. Sure, he was psychologically abused by his father and downed enough Prohibition-era bathtub gin and morphine to stagger Jumbo the elephant, but he didn't kill the \\"virgin\\" Vi Rappe --- her abortion doctor did. For starring in too many lead roles as the pie-faced man, eating a few too many cream buns and washing them down with fire water, Fatty got set up by a producer with a grudge, a whore with an attitude, a bad lawyer, a DA with gubernatorial dreams, and a whole bunch of other phonies who used Fatty's big butt to cover their own.Post-World War I America, and Hollywood, needed a fall guy to show the commies and the liberals that women belonged at home, barefoot and pregnant --- not in the factories or in the voting booths --- and that Tinsel Town was not the arbiter of porn. Short skirts, bobbed hair and feminism be damned! As a modern-day Job, Fatty was, as Stahl relates, the first Hollywood fall guy, but no one at the studios told Fatty until it was too late. See, they made a killing themselves at the box office when Fatty was the hero and made themselves look Holier than Thou in the conservative social circles when Fatty was the devil. So, Fatty found, either the box of donuts (whiskey, fatty foods, sex, sinful thoughts, racy movies, bad actor behavior) went, or he went. And Hollywood still writes these types of scripts, for movies and for reality; quick, name the high and low points in the career of Paris Hilton.Best supporting roles and comic relief are offered --- as well as a hipster education in 1920s Broadway and Hollywood culture --- by Buster Keaton, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, William Randolph Hearst, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Fatty's three wives, and others in this fiction that will make you, Miss or Mr. American film star wannabe, think twice about going on a reality show.The reality is ... drum roll please ... there is no such thing as reality, only perception, which, as Fatty and so many others learned, is a fatal dose of remembrance and imagination.

We all know more people than we realize.Overall, it was a good read.

You'll relive the glory days of early cinema, before income taxes, before world war, when actors, although considered lowly, were still gods and goddesses of their universe. As a reader, you will become entranced by Roscoe's story, even fictionalized - - this big man, so full of talent and yet lacking self-esteem, giving so much to the industry and becoming their censorship scapegoat.But at the same time, it is clear this is a work of fiction. Roscoe Arbuckle was never a heroin addict. And this one creative license puts a slight taint on the whole tale, lest Mr. Arbuckle be remembered as a poor heroin addict. At least Mr. Stahl makes it clear that Mr. Arbuckle was an innocent victim in Virginia Rappe's death.Overall, this book was a pleasure to read, despite the heroin allegations. Real gems from the silent era, such as Mabel Normand, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Joseph Schenck, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson and even Bob Hope come alive in the pages. It's a quick and easy read and worth every moment spent turning the pages. Even knowing the sad outcome of Mr. Arbuckle's career and life after that Labor Day of 1921, the book will still keep you anxious to turn the page and read on.Hopefully this book will help to shed light on the previously untapped genius of Roscoe Arbuckle, and give him some well deserved new fans.Recommended."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"It's a fictional autobiography (although apparently exhaustingly researched - there's a lengthy list of source material in the back) of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, one of the silent film era's biggest stars. He was also one of the era's most infamous men, having been falsely accused of the rape of a woman which lead to her death. Honestly, I got the book more because I have read Stahl's other books and loved them. I didn't know much about Arbuckle other than that Chris Farley wanted to play Arbuckle in a movie around the time that Farley died. In any case, this was a great book, and a little out of character for Stahl. His other books are somewhere in between James Ellroy and Chuck Palahniuk, which is to say completely debauched and thoroughly offensive. In this one, the debauchery remains, but there's a kind of sweetness and naivety to Arbuckle's voice that I didn't at all expect. Even if, like me, you don't know much about Arbuckle, like me, you might find it to be an engaging and quick read."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Arbuckle wasn't the greatest but he was the first comic superstar. He was just a great clown and a really nice guy who went from a tragic childhood to stardom and back to tragedy. There is some tremendous writing here, such as \\"What do you do when the world thinks you're a monster and you know it's the world that is monstrous.\\" Stahl also scores with, \\"Everything he lost came back except the delusion that it was really his and the belief that it mattered.\\" Much of this portrait of Arbuckle is conjecture but it is a very believable and sympathetic portrait.If this book becomes a movie then I suggest that Roscoe can be played by Oliver Platt or Kevin James with John Goodman as his psychotic Dad."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Reading I, Fatty is like hopping onto a broken carnival ride. It's sadistic, perverse and sad as hell. And colorful. Stahl dares you to feel sorry for Arbuckle, than gives you every reason not to. Ultimately, this is a novel, and should be read as fiction. Very entertaining fiction that both haunts and teases.One question...Why is the praise of Johnny Depp above that of Nick Tosches on the jacket cover? (Well, at least it isn't Ethan Hawke.)"},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"This book is as, stated in reviews, a \\"faux-memoir\\" and as such should not be treated like a precious historical artifact--it's \\"faction\\" and damn good faction at that.The author has a great take on what really happened that Labor Day weekend in San Francisco, Fatty's fall from grace, and his ability to eventually rise up again. Plus his version of Fatty's hideous childhood and horrid father gives a great insight into the man's psyche and physique--And it doesn't matter that this isn't a blow by blow rehash and meticulous recitation of articles in a dry fashion like so many lifeless biographies. I FATTY is a vivd version of a super star's life, told by one of country's most entertaining and original writers."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"It's not a bad book, really. It just drags a bit. I never felt like I was in the head of Fatty Arbuckle telling his story. I felt, instead, like I was reading someone trying a bit too hard to speak like him. It comes off as stilted and, after a while, makes the book a chore.There's an interesting story here, especially since the subject matter is so tragic. The man was railroaded and ruined because of it. His fall from grace was an awful thing, and you really feel for the guy when you learn about his story.Unfortunately, this isn't the best telling of that story. He doesn't even make the character that likable and gets some of the historical facts completely wrong.Stahl is a great writer, so I wanted something better than this. It's slow and, frankly, just not that interesting."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. Written as a quasi-memoir, Stahl gives us a sympathetic portrait of an early comic genius brought down by his own inner demons and perhaps the first media-circus celebrity scandal. Except for students of early film history, Arbuckle is all but gone and forgotten by most folks. I found it fascinating to read about the Wild West atmosphere of early Hollywood - I'd recent finished Budd Schulberg's \\"Moving Pictures,\\" his autobiography about growing up in Los Angeles when Hollywood was literally a couple of barns and orange groves - which made \\"I, Fatty\\" that much more interesting. I'm not sure how accurate all of the information in here is, but I liked how Stahl peeled away the sheen and examined just how instant celebrity and fame warped not only Arbuckle but Mabel Normand and others as well. His prose is often very funny, in the 20's slangy vernacular, and it was a quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"I, Fatty is a truly wonderful read. Loving silent film and partial to historical novels, I expected to enjoy this novel; not only did I thoroughly enjoy it, but as I read the final page I felt happy in the knowledge that Stahl - more than 80 years after the fact - had given Roscoe Arbuckle a voice with which to comment on the horror show that passed for a fair trial.Vibrant writing is enhanced by thorough research of the silent film era and its star, with Stahl recreating the era, vividly capturing both the naivete and decadence of early Hollywood. You don't have to be a silent film fan to enjoy and appreciate this well-written, fast paced novel; I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Fantastic book; brilliantly written and researched. what a travesty of justice. highly recommended."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"This is a great book written in an engaging style. It speaks of the Hollywood of the silent film era and today. Jerry Stahlshows us the highs and lows of the Hollywood stars' world, and holds up a mirror to examine the attitudes we see even today."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Stahl has done a fine job with this book--It sizzles. It's unforgettable. And it represents a step toward helping Roscoe Arbuckle claim his rightful place alongside movie pioneers like Chaplin and Keaton (whom Arbuckle discovered, by the way, as Stahl makes clear).However, it's such a shame that Stahl saw fit to perpetuate the unproven and likely untrue notion that Arbuckle was unable to kick drugs. In doing so, Stahl has done a real disservice to his muse. After all he's been through, I would argue that Arbuckle deserves better.Arbuckle was in fact briefly addicted to a kind of heroin in 1916, when an intern irresponsibly prescribed morphine as a pain-reliever due to a carbuncle on his leg. To the actor's enormous credit, however, he voluntarily subjected himself to an agonizing period of complete withdrawal-and by all biographical accounts came out clean.Mr. Stahl's book is a work of fiction. It's his prerogative to shape Mr. Arbuckle's story into a product that might be more dramatically interesting or commercially viable, but readers should know that his version of the facts does not represent the truth."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"The concept of I Fatty is a good one--a novel written as if it is the autobiography a controversial historical figure. I can't quite pinpoint it, but somehow I just could not consistently feel like I was \\"in the head\\" of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle. Some chapters feel \\"real\\" but others are wooden. Some parts of the book just did not feel like first person narratives."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Once up their with screen greats Chaplin and Keaton, Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle had everything going for him; fame, a fortune, and a promising career. Which makes his downfall all the more tragic, which is chronicled in this book of fiction, \\"I, Fatty\\" by Jerry Stahl.The Roscoe in this book is one driven by demons of youth. Beaten ferociously both mentally and physcially by a father, Roscoe is driven from his home as a means of survival. The death of his mother, and abandonment by his father cause Roscoe to find his life in theater and making people laugh. He meets people, which soon facilities his rise in vaudeville, then to movies. Around the age of 21, he has a career and a wife, and everything is set. But, as it must happen in this country, America just loves a big downfall, and Roscoe's occurs during a party one night in San Francisco.Told from Roscoe's first person narrative, naturally this tale would be one of exoneration. Throughout the trial, Roscoe maintained his innocence, and therefore, it seems natural that the book present his view of things, rather than a more rounded look at the trial. One thing Stahl does brilliantly is describe the public's reaction to the Arbuckle trial, and the horrible things that happened to him as a result of these people's actions. Another brilliant thing in this book is Stahl's description of Roscoe's drug addiction and the hell it played in his life.As Roscoe finds himself haunted through his life by the memories of his father, you find yourself equally as haunted. However, towards the end, there is no payoff for this journey, and very little resolution with his childhood. Perhaps it doesn't need to be there, for perhaps we never truly come to terms with our childhood memories, but still, as a literary device, the readers wants it to happen.Still, I, Fatty recounts a time in our cinematic history where it was all new and exciting, and works to restore the reputation of one of America's finest comedians. Whatever you may believe about Rocoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, he is a still a brilliant comedian who deserves all the recognition warranted."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"LoveLy! Jerry Stahl captures the voice and time of a man and world turned upside down. Stahl knows...if you have read Permanenet Midnight - you already know he is a brilliant writer. Beautifully written, In I, Fatty, Stahl re-invents a man who has was slandered by the 3 H's - Hearst, Hayes and Hollywood. Fatty was blacklisted!! Fatty was FRAMED!! Ever since reading Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon (some 20 years ago)... I was so happy..to at long last... find a writer who looked DEEPER into the life of a man who brought so much joy to so many people. It is so right at this time of bible thumping consevativism - to read a different take on the life of a man betrayed by the repressed world. Buster keaton Rules, okay? Thank you Mister Stahl, for validating what I always hoped and suspected. I LOVE FATTY. And your words made me happy beyond belief. Read this book now! If you have any interest in the beginnings of Hollywood, freedom of speech and knock-out writing...I think Jerry Stahl is one of the best writers of our times....read this and laugh and weep. It is Grand!"},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Wow - I have just finished this book and am in absolute awe of it!!! What a terrific recreation of the life and times of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, silent screen comic legend extraordinaire. Stahl does a wondrously good job taking the reader from Fatty's heartbreaking childhood in impoverished Smith Center, Kansas; his love-hate relationship with his alcoholic, abusive father; his years as a struggling vaudevillian; his accidental and amazing triumph as comic master of the silver screen and his ultimate downfall, framed for the rape and murder of \\"B\\" movie starlet, Virginia Rappe. Jerry Stahl is a marvellous writer and he gives fine, sympathetic voice to Fatty and makes him come alive for the reader. While it is a wonderful account of Fatty's life, it also gives an invaluable insight into the fledgling movie industry, with many anecdotes about Mack Sennett and the Keystone Studio, industry titans like Adolph Zukor and Joe Schenck and his fellow thespians like Mabel Normand, Wallace Reid, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Fatty's treatment by the press and the American public is incomprehensible when viewed over 80 years after his trial and I am amazed that he came through the trauma of it as well as he did. All in all, this is a fabulous book, beautifully written. A skilful blend of fact, pathos and humour and sure to please almost all who read it. It richly deserves the raves it has received."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Written as a first person narrative, \\"I, Fatty\\" tells the story of Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle. Those familiar with early Hollywood know of Arbuckle's rise to become the top movie comedian only to be charged with rape and murder. Three trials later he is exonerated but his career and fortune are in ruins.You see his life through his eyes including an abusive childhood, abandonment by his father and a start in vaudeville that eventually leads to bit parts in Mack Sennett films. Most interesting is Arbuckle's rise as actor and director and the compelling descriptions of the characters he associated with including Mabel Normand, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton. Keaton stands out because of his personal loyalty through \\"thick and thin\\". A number of factors start the downfall including his leaving Sennett's Keystone Films for the studio system and his personal problems with alcohol and drugs. After the fall and with the help of his few remaining friends he begins a period of penance and a degree of redemption, unfortunately his best years are behind him.Author Jerry Stahl puts the reader into Arbuckle's head as he deals with life's fickleness, his alcoholism and drug addiction, as well as just being very fat; it is a novel and not a biography. Stahl does list source material at the end of the book for those interested in a fuller portrait.The book is engaging, informative and a quick read."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Jerry Stahl has written an absorbing faux memoir of the rags-to-riches-and-back-to-rags silent film comic Fatty Arbuckle whose career and life were tanked by FALSE/trumped up charges (he was a scapegoat for the ills & decadence of motion pictures) of the rape and murder of party girl Virginia Rappe in 1921. Stahl brings the era and the man to life in this creative, evocative, and (YES!) sometimes funny book. I FATTY is also a commentary on the fleeting and fickle nature of fame and public opinion. All Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle wanted was to be loved which makes the vicious turning of his once adorning public all the more tragic. This book is also a great treat for silent film fans with \\"guest appearances\\" by Mack Sennett, Buster Keaton, Mabel Normand, Adolph Zukor, Charlie Chaplin, etc. It all makes for a very engaging read."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"Literature remains vital often by expanding into non-literature. Sadly, one of America's most gifted reflectionist, Jerry Stahl, is saddled by his own dexterity. One is unable to read about Mr. Stahl's literary output without words such as, HEROIN, JUNKY, ALF , HOLLYWOOD, quickly finding residence to offer an occasionally sympathetic, however, mostly derisive qualification of his art. And yet, I, FATTY perceived outside it's place of origin is a welcome new guest to Mr Stahl's unique literary carnival."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"You'll need to wipe the slime off of your hands when you are dunked head-first into the cesspit of Hollywood! A brilliantly told tale, with lots of Roscoe's wit channeled from the grave to spice up the prose. I really loved this book! It's amazing how one can still become angry about the railroading of Arbuckle, even after all this time! And angry too that we were robbed of all the wacky funny movies that Roscoe never got to make."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"In capturing the torment of an abused child and the horrific anguish of a falsely-accused adult, Jerry Stahl's brilliant faux memoir of the storied Hollywood silent movie star Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle compels us to confront our desire to create celebrities and rejoice in their demise. \\"I, Fatty\\" gives Arbuckle a humanity his oversized body precluded his fans and detractors from understanding. Told in the actor's own voice, the novel contains two parts. The second is the detailed recounting of Arbuckle's three trials for his alleged rape and murder of Virginia Rappe. It is this aspect of the actor's life that topples him from the pinnacle of artistic and financial success and drives him to the depths of pariah status. More compelling, however, is the first half of \\"I, Fatty,\\" which painfully details Arbuckle's childhood, once scarred by an abusive father, family disintegration and subsequent abandonment. Roscoe's victimization has a cumulative impact on his forming image of his character, one eventually incorporating self-blame and self-destructive behaviors.Delivered as a breech birth, Arbuckle's size may have contributed to his mother's demise. Regardless, his alcoholic and anger-crazed father blamed him for every conceivable misfortune and focused on ridiculing his son's size. Arbuckle recalls his father's \\"whiskey-stench breath singeing\\" his nostrils, and his father's \\"fist waggling in my face like a cobra's head in a snake-charmer act.\\" Unable to defend himself in this unceasing onslaught on his very personhood, it comes as no shock to hear the adult Arbuckle matter-of-factly admit his inability to perform sexually. As a child, Roscoe would pinch himself \\"to create an outside pain big enough to blank out the pain inside.\\"From this maelstrom of neglect and abuse, the Kansas-born Arbuckle eventually finds work on stage in California, where through comedic instinct and a willingness to work hard at any task given him, he becomes a successful self-made man. Overcoming an initial reluctance to perform in the movies (where no self-respecting actor would ever seek employment), Arbuckle slowly understands the basis of his popularity. Despite considerable physical agility, by the age of 26, Arbuckle \\"didn't like what it was people liked about me.\\" He spends time whispering to himself: \\"I am so tired of being the Fat Guy. But, of course, a diet would have ruined me.\\" The basis of this overweight actor's popularity was \\"that no matter how poorly any of \`em felt, they could all wake up glad they weren't me.\\"Through Arbuckle's confessions, Stahl spares no punches in describing the cynicism, hype and hypocrisy of the early Hollywood studio system. In the midst of the post-World War I reaction -- a time of the Red Scare, a fixed World Series and an open renewal of racist, nativist prejudice -- the same publicity machine that raved about Arbuckle's innocent, cherubic qualities turned on him with absolute venom once the San Francisco authorities charged him with murder and rape. Stahl spends a great deal of time exposing the \\"show trials\\" that forever stripped Arbuckle's dignity and ability to make a living from him. His eventual ringing exoneration made him even more detestable in the eyes of his accusers.Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle is no saint. A drug addict, an alcoholic, a failed husband, Arbuckle made and wasted a fortune. He had few friends, though those who remained close to him, like Buster Keaton, emerge as moral pillars at a time when vicious rumor-mongers like William Randolph Hearst cast vile shadows over the country. Through Jerry Stahl's imagined voice, Arbuckle achieves something he never was able to manage during his life: a legacy of a complicated, vulnerable, conflicted but honorable man."},{"Title":"I, Fatty: A Novel","review":"A tight, compelling read from start to finish.

A gem."},{"Title":"Cordon of Steel: The US Navy and the Cuban Missile Crisis","review":"This book, really more of a booklet at 56 pages is the most complete that I've seen that describes the Navy's contribution to the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was originally written in 1993 and just reprinted after being very hard to get.The Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest the major powers came to actual combat during the Cold War. While all of the services played their part (I can remember nuclear armed bombers parked at the end of Boston's Logan Airport's runways.) the main tasks fell on the Navy.The pictures on this book show just how ready the Navy was. Pictures of planes in the air and on carriers show them fully armed with rockets and bombs.Only at the end of the crisis did the tensions go down. And in one point a Navy helicopter lowered a Navy tie clasp to the Russian freighter 'Alapayevsk.' The Russians returned with a gift of a bottle of vodka.I also remember discussions that we should invade Cuba. Only since the end of the Cold War have we learned that the Russian military forces on the island had short range nuclear weapons and were prepared to use them. Phew! That was close. Closer than we got again."},{"Title":"Cordon of Steel: The US Navy and the Cuban Missile Crisis","review":"A major international conference on this subject was convened in 1993.

This gathering lasted for several days and was covered in separate 2 or 3 hour long broadcasts by every major television network in the United States.

It would be interesting to see it translated into another language, because much of the humor has to do with English/Australian cultural idiosyncracies and rhythms. But the anthropomorphic deployment of humanoid bush animals has a global and trans-generational appeal, which could carry over in translation.The greatest value in this boisterous tale is its cantankerous edge, in contrast to the more typical sugar-and-spice companions-on-a-journey story. The manly Magic Pudding is close in spirit to the more sophisticated Wizard of Oz journey (with its female protagonist). Barnacle Bill, Sawnoff Sam and antagonists underscore the close-to-macho cultural ethic of Britain's Southern Hemispheric provincial penal colony. The spice is provided by a tweedy, unity-minded koala, who although he doesn't fit in carries intense Good Will along in his satchel; a force that the rougher characters rally around when missing their just dessert.Read it to your grown-up children and friends, around a crackling fire.

Over 80 years old, \\"The Magic Pudding\\" describes the adventures of a koala bear, named Bunyip Bluegum - the kind of koala who wears a high collar and spats - who falls in with a crazy cowboy sort of fellow named Bill Barnacle and a penguin named Sam Sawnoff.Bill and Sam are possessed of a magic pudding (named Albert, if you can believe this), who regenerates every time you take a bite of him and changes into whatever flavor you like. Albert the pudding is much coveted by two evil villains who are constantly tricking our Heroes into giving up the Pudding, whereupon they must go and re-re-re-rescue it.The characters and style are very reminiscent of \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" with Bunyip seeming a little White-rabbitish to me, and Bill and Sam sort of Mad Hatter and Dormouse-y. The effect is somewhere in between \\"Alice\\" and an old Loony Tunes in which Bugs Bunny constantly bewilders Elmer Fudd.The whole narrative is punctuated with many whimsical song lyrics, like the poetry in Carroll's book.

You will have to be in good voice since many of the characters often burst into song. Can a Broadway musical be far away?The illustrations are also by the book's author Norman Lindsay, one of Australia's greatest artists of the early 20th century. Each page is graced with his masterful charcoal drawings humorously depicting the action. The pictures perfectly depict the quirky and amusing antics of the &quot;Magic Pudding&quot; characters.Some young readers may find the language a little difficult. It's a combination of high Edwardian with sometimes archaic (but very colorful) slang. However it's the hilarious imagery, both written and pictorial, which will captivate children's attention.Some of the language is almost Shakespearian but it's worth persisting. Take for example Bunyip Bluegum's burst of oratory..... &quot; Base, indeed, must be the scoundrels, who, lost to all sense of decency and honour, boldly assume the outward semblance of worthy citizens&quot;.Lindsay's writing includes some beautiful political social satire with observations like ... &quot;you only have to wear a top hat to be a respected pillar of society&quot;.No doubt the animated movie version of &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; will introduce a new generation to this classic story. Hopefully many of the children (and their parents) will be encouraged to read and enjoy Norman Lindsay's original.."},{"Title":"THE MAGIC PUDDING - Being the Adventures of Bunyip Bluegum and his friends Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff","review":"A book bought by my grandmother on a trip to Australia when I was 6 years old (30 years ago).

Ms. Flanner beguiles, charms, interests, evokes--all without being tedious, all withoutSarton-like repetitionShe has long been a favorite poet of mine because of her ability to bring me into her world, seeing things her way. She does that again and again in this lovely little book, inviting me to walk with her, talk with those she talks with, laugh with her, even comfort her now and then.I love this book. May I describe it in her own words?&quot;...And in this radiant small thing apppear the grand intentions of the western earth.&quot;Buy this &quot;radiant small thing&quot;. You'll read it a thousand times, just for imagery...no, just for the language...no, for the rhythm...no, not the rhythm, the...Never mind, just buy it."},{"Title":"Brief Cherishing: A Napa Valley Harvest","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer (msem), I am unimpressed with this book. Unlike many of the older women writing their lives in some sense, Flanner has neither the wisdom nor the sense of humor at her own foibles that make such writing interesting to me.The second piece, Jacinto, is a humorous escapade of Flanner and a billy goat. There is some delightful self-deprecation: &quot;In this case guardian means goatherd and that was beyond my capability. 'Counselor to a smart goat,' that gave me a better position&quot;. But while the story is humorous, the message that shines through the prose is one of tiredness and frustration not humor and learning. I also questioned the classical references &quot;or waiting with Philotues for Odysseus to return&quot; as the author no where ties such references into the building of character, plot or atmosphere.The first piece, Miguel, provides a wonderful sketch of the gardener but I was uncomfortable with the author's willingness to paint large groups of people with very broad swipes. My objection is not the lack of current political correctness but rather the lack of providing a story of universality depicted in the particular. There results some wonderful abuse of facts - &quot;they (Mexicans) were often owners, especially the Guatemalans, of quite beautiful hats.&quot; When did Guatemala become a part of Mexico?Unless you have an active interest in the history of the Napa Valley or are a fan of Hildegarde Flanner, pass on this book. I will, however, grant that the book has some excellent poetic writing and provides insight into the mind set of Flanner's generation."},{"Title":"Discovery of the elements","review":"Some of the scanned pages are hard to read but still readable.

Each essay studies a common theme or element of traditional stories.Travers has the ability to combine an absolutely astounding amount of information on myths and folktales from all over the world into insightful and fascinating text. Throughout weaves the story of her own life, told in snatches, reminding the reader again and again how story reflects aspects of our own lives. &quot;Only Connect&quot;, the phrase borrowed from E.M.

Ms. Papazian's book is beyond examplary! She shares with the reader not only her personal experiences in the raising of her son with special needs but also the impact that this has on her other children and her marriage. She candidly expresses her experiences with various sub-specialties of Medicine and Developmental Psychology as well as her own personal experiences of what she and her family shared and witnessed first hand at various Hospital Emergency Rooms; sharing most honestly her own interactions with the various staff members who came into contact with her son. This book is a MUST for every parent and professional who ever has any interaction with any 'helping' professional. I highly recommend it to everyone; parents of all children as well as professionals who work with children and their parents. Excellent fund of information that is most valuable to all of us!"},{"Title":"Growing Up with Joey: A Mother's Story of Her Son's Disability and Her Family's Triumph","review":"Sandy Papazian has written a book that truly is a MUST HAVE in everyone's library! The book clearly documents the various physical as well as psychological stages and coping mechanisms that each member of a famly of the identified patient: Joey goes through...everyone 'grows up with Joey.' The encounters, impediments , frustrations that each of the family members faces are so intricately detailed that the reader often feels that he or she is right there in the Emergency Room with Joey and his doctors. A family's coping mechanisms for effectively interacting with the members of the 'health care' community are clearly documented. Whatever 'disability' a child may have, whether it be emotional/psychological or physical/organic; the resulting impact on his family is one that is so powerful. How this impact can effect a primary family, even the extended family dynamic is beautifully detailed with anectodes that allow readers to develop their own effective coping mechanisms for not only 'growing up with ...' but growing up HEALTHY with their special needs youngster. Once again, I urge you to read this book and share it with all your friends, whether they have a special needs member of their family or not, this is a MUST reading for all families!"},{"Title":"Growing Up with Joey: A Mother's Story of Her Son's Disability and Her Family's Triumph","review":"Sandy Papazian has achieved what most writers can only dream of.

Joey's story may seem, at first, only relatable to those who have family members wth handicaps...but in reading her book, we soon learn that we all have handicaps of one sort or another...and it is how we learn to deal with them that determines the fabric of our lives. In \\"Growing Up with Joey\\", Sandy has found a way to define and extract the most beautiful qualities on earth from the most tragic and terrifying of circumstances....If you are not transformed into a better person by reading this book, then there is little hope for you to begin with.

Those that not only touch you in profound ways, but that stay with you long after the read. \\"Growing Up With Joey,\\" does just that. Ms. Papazian's account of bringing up her handicapped son, amidst the pain and confusion of parenthood, is as mind boggling as it is inspiring. Having worked on projects that involve the mentally handicapped, I have done extensive research in the field. Until now, I had yet to come across a story filled with so much honesty. Honesty that transcends marriage, family, the work place and social consciousness. Ms. Papazian's attention to detail, not only in the day to day struggle of bringing up her son, but in the myriad of ways that struggle impacted every facet of her life, is something at which to marvel and, more importantly, something from which we can learn. The path is as long as it is difficult. It's filled with frustration, uncertainty and despair. But it's paved with love.

I found it tremendously helpful in understanding many topics in condensed matter physics on a deeper, more conceptual level. The chapters on second quantization, superconductivity and superfluidity are especially illuminating, and the latter is far surperior in clarity than anything I have come across (which is perhaps not surprising considering Feymnman developed much of the theory himself). I highly recommend this book as a supplimentary text for any graduate-level Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics or Solid State course you may be taking."},{"Title":"Statistical Mechanics","review":"Richard Feynman said:\\"What I cannot create, I do not understand!\\".

I can bet that this is an unique S.M book.but i don't think it's for beginner, I suggest you should finish a standard statistical mechanics course before you read this one.I can not find suitable words to admire this great book, so I quit here, but in the end, I strongly recommend this book to all physicists, physics-major students!"},{"Title":"Statistical Mechanics","review":"The Feynman Lectures on Statistical Mechanics contain a great deal of very useful information, and each page is full of solid work without bothering too much with unnecessary details. The book also covers all the bases very well, hitting plenty of good examples, such as spin waves, and the obligatory superconductivity chapter is a solid introduction.My only complaint is that the ordering of the book is a little haphazard. I understand that it is difficult to include quantum and classical statistical mechanics in one continuous run, but the book seems to jump around a bit.All this considered, the book is probably a must-buy for people interested in statistical physics, as it is one of the better general overview books available (I despise the Reif; it needs to be updated and completely rearranged), and, as an added bonus, you get to see the Onsager solution to the 2-D Ising model.

His publications speak for themselves. However, as represented in this set of lecture notes, I do not find him as a pedagogue more enlightening than others. I bought and read this book in grad school, and found it to be a nice quick intro to several topics (spin waves and such). I did not, and still don't find the exposition physically exceptionally profound. One difference though, is the fact that Feynman, with his fame, could afford to be rather informal in his presentation. Any unsatisfactory aspects would be accepted as the mysterious ways of a 'genius'. If you are a student and would like to learn to solve problems on your own, forget this one. What this book gives you is a little 'attitude', aside from a quick intro, which most of us haven't earned the right to put on, of doing physics. Try it.

The author deals with the not-so-easy aspects of the spiritual journey with a direct 21st century awareness, using her own life as example. Anyone on a genuine spiritual journey of their own will understand what she means when she writes: &quot;Create a gap in your story and sit within the gap, sit in the emptiness of not knowing who or what you are until an awareness of your essential nature fills you.&quot; This is one more book to add to my library of hundreds of volumes of spiritual literature, many of which I gathered while in seminary working towards a master's degree in Spritual Direction. Along with The Cloud of Unknowing, works by the Desert Fathers, Teresa of Avila, Julian of Norwich, Evelyn Underhill, Joseph Campbell and others I add Oriah Mountain Dreamer for speaking bravely to our time and, more specifically, to my life."},{"Title":"The Call: Discovering Why You Are Here","review":"I have read two of Oriah's earlier books, the invitation and the dance, and the third in the trilogy i like even better than the other two. Oriah speaks to the reader with absolute honesty - on her relationships, her family, work, fears and hopes of everyday life - and how she deals with it. I particularly liked what she said about finding your 'word' or the one word around which inner dynamics evolve. And her clarity/differentiation between ego and essence is incredible, a noteworthy approach to practical spirituality needed for modern times.This is definitely not for the average self help person or someone who just wants to 'make it work' with ten points on how-to- it is more for those of us who struggle with finding inner peace and authenticity in all that we do. Also the author has a very verbose style of writing that may not appeal to many - particularly those who are not very word-oriented and that might be something to watch for."},{"Title":"The Call: Discovering Why You Are Here","review":"Even more than its two excellent predecessors (&quot;The Invitation&quot; and &quot;The Dance&quot;) the third book of Oriah's trilogy is a handbook on how to live. While influences of both the Sufis and Lao-Tze (Taoist) are present, the voice is clearly unique and powerfully original. Grounding her teachings in stories from her life, Oriah marshalls a persuasive argument that the core issue in our lives and our relation to Spirit is not that we need to do more, but that we need to accept who we are. The meditations offer clear and practical steps towards accomplishing that.This is a practical book, that can be enjoyed whatever the reader's religious views are.

This is a book that opens a window into your heart and which delves down into the very depths of ones soul, exploring what we know of ourselves through the eyes of other people thus handing us a mirror to look into. It helps the reader to explore who they are as an individual by understanding ultimately what it means to be human, by what makes us unique, distinctive and most singular as human beings. By letting go you are able to be honest with yourself and through courage find out much more than you would have thought possible, which will shock you, surprise you and touch your heart. This by far has to be one of the most truth-drawing books that I have ever encountered, where the author reaches out to you with her brave humanity as a poet and lover with such skin-and-bone honesty, that I found to be most personal. You are nourished by all the wisdom that she carries as you begin to learn so much about life and yourself in it, with such vision that gives light to the darkness. I found myself re-evaluating my actions and thoughts on life and on myself, which led to the most life changing consequences that all took place because of a decision that I had made since reading this remarkable book, hence I now certainly hope to be as proactive as I possibly can be. I was touched by how much of herself the author puts within her work, so as to give it more meaning and depth of feeling. Even the reader who feels most contented within their minds and who are sure of themselves and their futures, I do strongly urge that they read this book as it would certainly have an impact on any reader's life. Self discovery is the most challenging subject matter to discuss as an author and writer but also to read, and to those who take the first few steps to reading this will undoubtedly be greatly rewarded and will find much enjoyment as well from such breathtaking writing.

There is no real insight into what exactly 'the Call' might be, just a lot of mystical mumbo-jumbo of the vaguest kind.For example:&quot;What comes and goes is our ability to hear it [the 'Call'], our willingness to let go of what we think we are so we can open ourselves to hearing that which calls us back to what we always have been. When we open to this constant call, we remember why we are here and allow this knowledge to create a new and fluid story colored with that knowledge and never mistaken for all of who we are&quot;.Got that?

I have seen three reprints of the book, by East River Press (ISBN 0891720022), by Dover (ISBN 0486238423), and by Delano Greenidge Editions (this book, ISBN 0929445074). So that you can decide whether or not to buy this book, let me describe the original and the 3 reprints, all of which are paperback and about 24 cm wide by 31 cm high.The original is titled \\"MAN RAY / PHOTOGRAPHIES / 1920-1934 PARIS\\" on one side the title page and \\"MAN RAY / PHOTOGRAPHS / 1920-1934 PARIS\\" on the other side. It has a white plastic comb binding. Its cover, in color, shows the words \\"Man Ray\\" in the middle, a bust of Man Ray at right, a woman's head toward the bottom, etc. After the Contents/Sommaire is a portrait of Man Ray by Picasso and a brief essay \\"The Age of Light\\" by Man Ray in English and French. Plates 1-24 cover still lifes, interiors, landscapes, flowers, etc. A poem in French and English by Paul &Eacute;luard entitled \\"Man Ray\\" follows; after that are photos 25-42 primarily of nude women. An essay \\"THE visages of THE woman\\" in French and English by Andr&eacute; Breton is followed by #43-#66 of women (none naked); only the last woman (Gertrude Stein) is named. Rrose S&eacute;lavy (who was actually Marcel Duchamp) contributed \\"Men before the mirror\\" in German and English, and photos 67-84 of men ensue*. \\"When things dream\\" in French and English by Tristan Tzara precedes the final section of 20 \\"Rayographs 1921-1928\\" (photograms) numbered 85-104. The photos, printed by gravure (not offset printing as in the reprints), have a smooth tonal range.The East River 1975 signature-bound paperback has the full title \\"Man Ray Photographs 1920-1934,\\" but its black-and-white front cover says only \\"MAN RAY / PHOTOGRAPHS\\" at the top. At the bottom of the front cover is a solarized photo of a woman with arms cradling her head (#35). The 6-page introduction is by A.D. Coleman. The major differences from the original are: (1) there is no reproduction of the original front cover; (2) there is no portrait by Picasso; (3) only the English versions of the texts are given (not the French or German); and (4) the texts are in different fonts than the original (i.e., they have been re-typeset). However, the photos are well-reproduced compared with the other two reprints (i.e., not too contrasty and without much spotting), the placements and sizes of the photos on the pages are similar to those in the original, and the paper is sturdy.The Dover 1979 signature-bound paperback has the title \\"PHOTOGRAPHS BY / MAN RAY / 105 WORKS, 1920-1934.\\" (Note that there are only 104 B&W; photos; work \\"105\\" is the original front cover.) The front cover shows a solarized portrait of Man Ray and a camera (#67); the back cover reproduces the original 1934 front cover in color. Between the Contents/Sommaire and photo 104, the Dover edition closely follows the original. The major differences are: (1) the placements and sizes of the photos on the pages sometimes diverge from those in the original**; (2) there are a lot of white spots on the photos (e.g., on page 61); (3) generally, the photos are more contrasty; and (4) the paper is somewhat less sturdy. However, unlike the East River edition, the portrait by Picasso and the texts in all three languages are facsimile reproductions.This Delano Greenidge 2000 (not 2001 as Amazon indicates) signature-bound paperback has a title of \\"Man Ray: Paris Photographs 1920-34.\\" The cover photo is #44, also known elsewhere as \\"Black and White\\" (\\"Noire et Blanche\\"), on a mostly black background. It comes with an introduction by D. Greenidge in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. It has sturdy paper, little spotting of the photos, and a one-page bibliography at the end. Unfortunately: (1) there are no texts by Man Ray et al.; (2) it doesn't show you the color cover or the portrait by Picasso; (3) generally, the photos are slightly darker and more contrasty; (4) the placements of the photos on the pages sometimes diverge from those in the original; and (5) the photograph on page 55 (of a woman behind mesh) is reversed (as though the negative had been flipped) and is much more contrasty.Since both the lack of texts and the mediocre reproduction of the photos are problematic, I am giving this book only two stars. If you're interested in Man Ray and don't have access to the original 1934 book, choose one of the other two reprints. If you want to appreciate the B&W; photographs, get hold of the East River edition. If you want to appreciate the original cover, the portrait by Picasso, and the texts as originally printed, obtain the Dover edition.

In the book Man Ray: Paris Photographs 1920-34 he pushed the formal boundaries to create his own imaginative style. The photos as well as the layout of book have been carefully executed through his knowledge of design.This book features objects, nudes, portraits and Rayographs. The space between truth and fiction is bridged through the elements of design and his images are visually pleasing. His nudes define femininity. They are ideal for the male gaze which captures the essence of the female form through erotic eyes. It is evident that Man Ray knew the rules therefore he could break them. Rayographs were made by placing objects directly on film.

He concluded his scholarly work saying, \\"This music which has been handed down since untold generations within the Coptic Church should be a bridge between the East and the West and place a new idiom at the disposal of Western musicians.

The bulk of them are written in Coptic but few are preserved in Greek, while many of them have been lost. Historical evidence suggests that Coptic hymns were chanted since early church in the second century and remained almost unchanged. Coptic hymns and liturgical chants written in various geographical dialects, as early as the second century, were inscribed on separate sheets, in rolls, or codices. These were discovered in ancient Coptic sites in Oxyrhynchus, Hermopolis, and Arsinoe (Fayum). An evidence of the early development of the Coptic hymns during the first two centuries, was confirmed by the discovery near Bahnassa in Upper Egypt of \`xorinex,' an ancient hymn recorded with usical notes that dates back to the third century. Acrostic hymn on redemption with Coptic translation, and in petition to Mary Theotokos for intercession. Hymns on the Paschal Vigil that may have been written by Melito of Sardis were discovered in Coptic liturgical Codices.

The publication of thirteen acrostic hymns from a Coptic manuscript in the Sahidic dialect, was written for the Monastery of the Archangel Michael at Hamouli (in the Fayyum, Egypt). Translated by K.

The hymns are in praise of the Virgin Mary, the apostles, and a number of saints particularly popular in the Coptic Church, and were no doubt used on the appropriate saint's day, while other hymns have for their subject the resurrection and the ascension, and baptism, and may have been appointed for the relevant seasons in the ecclesiastical year.Kuhn/Tait Edition:This edition has the English translation opposite to the Coptic text.

It is a subject of which I am very fond. And yet, even though we call the subject Euclidean geometry, very few people, even those of us who teach it, have a clear idea of what exactly it was that Euclid did. We might use the compass and straightedge occasionally but not with Euclid's methodology. I think that this is too bad.Over the course of the past year or so, I have made it a quest to prove the propositions of The Elements in Euclid's style. Thus far (and at a leisurely pace), I have made it through the first two books outlined in this volume. It has been a wonderful experience that has deepened my knowledge of this subject and, hopefully, has made me a better teacher of it to my students. I am looking forward to going through the remaining eleven books of the last two volumes.Some things of which a reader should be aware: this volume only contains Euclid's first two books which, in and of themselves, are not very long; however, this volume also contains 150 pages of introduction and significant commentary on nearly every definition, postulate and proposition by Sir Thomas L. Heath. I found much of this very enlightening and was glad to have it included. Still, this material could easily be a stumbling block for weaker students and people interested in Euclid alone. Heath's notes are very detailed and assume a knowledge of certain things (such as classical languages) that are not a common part of the modern curriculum. But, remember, this commentary was written nearly 100 years ago. Don't let it stand in your way. It can be a bonus but, if you have trouble connecting with it, skip it. The notes and commentary should be considered gravy for the prime component here: Euclid's text.There has never been a writer of mathematics as successful as Euclid. For well over 2000 years the work that Euclid did in compiling The Elements has been the crowning achievement of geometry and it has only been in the twentieth century that his book has been replaced by other texts. There are good reasons for this but, on another level, it is sad that his genius is being diluted. Anyone with a decent handle on high school geometry could get a lot from Euclid himself. The propositions would be familiar and anyone truly interested in understanding how mathematics has become the powerful tool it is today would be remiss in not reading Euclid."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"At the time of this writing, the sales summary points out &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, but it does not point out that it is &quot;Volume 1 of 3&quot;. Volume 1 provides a historical summary of work that followed _Elements_, along with a detailed translation of Book I and Book II. Heath includes bracketed references to justify each critical step of each proof. The text surrounding each Euclidean statement is detailed, but often very lengthy; at times, this detracts from the reading of the _Elements_ itself. This set is for the scholar of the history of _Elements_, and not the best source for a first-time reading of Euclid. Even with these minor quibbles, however, my copy of Volume I is a well-worn, beloved volume with frequently-annotated margins. All of the major &quot;players&quot; in the development of Geometry are detailed within, as well as their contributions.I recommend it highly for any scholar that wishes to understand _Elements_ thoroughly, through a close reading of a detailed text."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"It is difficult to argue with the fact that Euclid stands as one of the founding figures of mathematics. The ability of the ancient Greeks to perform complex mathematical calculations using only logic, a compass and a straight edge is profoundly humbling. Euclid's 13 books cover an enormous swath of math, from planar geometry to trignometry to irrational numbers and root finding to 3D geometry. At one point you feel he is on the cusp of discovering the Calculus. Considering these pages were written more than two thousand years ago I stand in awe.That said, I have some serious problems with the way Euclid's materials are presented in this Dover Mathematics book. The book itself (a three volume set actually) is a reproduction of Sir Thomas Heath's famous Elements of 1908. This is the second Dover edition and it is unabridged. Usually I'm not a fan of abridgements but this book could certainly use it. At the very least some modernization of the notes and introductory essays would seem to be in order. Of course, if you approach this book as a mathematician, you will likely skip over the first hundred or so pages and be spared some pain. If you are a student of philosophy you aren't so lucky. Heath's notes are dense, tangential, and require the mastery of at least four languages, two of which are now dead. Latin and Greek quotes of considerable length are left untranslated as an exercise for the reader, and French and German receive similar treatment. At times the footnotes threaten to overwhelm the text and for every page of Euclid there must be at least 3 pages of commentary. References to obscure mathematical theory and little known Greek manuscripts abound. I understand that this is Victorian Age scholarly writing at its height but it makes it a tough read - and I say this as someone with a background in Latin, Greek and French as well as considerable mathematical (never got much past partial differential equations) background. Heath was a polymath of the highest order.If you are brave enough to tackle this book you may want to grab just the volume that interests you. The first volume contains introductory remarks by Heath and most of the well known postulates related to geometry. Book I, postulate 5 (I.5) is the well know triangle inequality while I.47 is the geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem - a thing of rare beauty. In the second volume, Books III and IV deal with circles and arcs while Book V deals with ratios. I found the proofs with respect to ratios difficult to follow owing partially to the language in which they are couched. Book VI applies the theory of ratios to geometric figures while books VII and VIII deal with factorization, multiples and primes. Book IX deals with prime numbers, perfect numbers and odd and even numbers. The third volume begins with Book X which deals at length with rational and irrational numbers. It is here that the Greek methods seem to be a little weak, requiring rather clumsy proofs which would be much simpler in modern notation. Still, it is amazing to see the math they did with what they had. Books XI and XII deal with solids - spheres, prisms, parallelpipeds and pyramids - while Book XIII deals with the platonic solids. It is here that Euclid approaches calculus with his method of proof by exhaustion. The persistent reader will, by this point, also be quite exhausted but, as a bonus, Heath throws in the sometimes attributed Books XIV and XV, both of which are brief and neither of which are by Euclid.If you are planning on buying this book I would recommend you consider the reason carefully. If you are looking for a math text there must surely be something more modern with a more concise commentary available. If you are a student of Greek philosophy you may find the first volume useful for its introductory notes but the last two volumes are likely unhelpful. If you are fluent in Latin, Greek, French, German and English, have a background in ancient greek literature, Renaissance and 19th century mathematical theory, and love geometric proofs then this is the book for you"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Euclid hardly needs reviews after two millennia of endorsements. Until the advent of mass-produced texts, endorsements came by way of large sums of money or time, or both. Therefore, if we do not understand what Euclid is writing about, there is overwhelming evidence that this failure is ours, not Euclid's. If we decry the unfamiliarity of Euclid's way of reasoning and his manner of writing his mathematics as being less clear or efficient than our own, we are simply expressing our faith--perhaps misplaced--in our own mathematical culture. Clearly, if one's purpose is to learn geometric techniques and results, other books may serve as well or better; if one's purpose is to understand mathematics, the thirteen books of the Elements are without equal.The Heath edition of Euclid's Elements actually consists of three volumes: volume 1 has Euclid's Books I and II; Heath's volume 2 contains Euclid's Books III - IX; and his volume 3 encompasses Euclid's remaining Books X - XIII. Books VII, VIII, and IX are about \\"arithmetic,\\" not \\"geometry\\"--a feature of the Elements often left unstated. Throughout, Heath intersperses his notes and comments, so the three volumes actually consist of as much Heath as Euclid. (Just Heath's translation, alone, is reproduced in the Great Books of the Western World, published in 1952 by University of Chicago.) Up until recently, maybe as late as the nineteenth century, a typical reader of Euclid would be quite familiar with Plato and therefore know that arithmetic and geometry are the philosophical branches of mathematics; music and astronomy are the remaining branches of mathematics, although somewhat contaminated since--in the Greek understanding as expressed by Plato--music and astronomy introduce motion, which is not strictly a mathematical topic.Niceties such as these, and there are many others, would be lost to us if Euclid were transformed by using modern symbolism. Consider proposition 47 of Book I, the so-called Pythagorean theorem: Euclid talks about constructing squares on the sides of a triangle and never even hints at the possibility of the sides being \\"numbers.\\" In fact, Euclid and all of his notable contemporaries and successors up to about the 15th century would consider the term \\"irrational number\\" as utter nonesensical babble--something more dangerous than an oxymoron such as a \\"square circle\\" because \\"square\\" and \\"circle\\" are not fundamental ideas. These comments may raise more questions than they purport to answer, but they give background to reviewing Heath, rather than Euclid.Heath's edition, taken in toto, would have been very difficult to improve. His notes and collecting together of earlier commentaries represent a remarkable achievement in scholarship. He certainly made errors, but he provided nearly the best edition of Euclid possible at the opening of the last century. Heath made several efforts to explain the contents of Euclid by appealing to contemporary ideas and notations and, at least for me, these explanations simply reinforced the view that Euclid dealt with profound unanswerable questions that remain unanswered in contemporary mathematics.Heath translated and edited several Greek primary sources, including Archimedes and Apollonius. Comparing his earlier translations with his later (in his career) Euclid, one immediately sees that Heath tried to preserve more faithfully Euclid's manner of speaking than he did Apollonius's or Archimedes'. This historigraphic point is important: if we are to respect the ancient Greeks by trying to understand or know their culture and values on their terms, we must have access to their culture with as few filters as possible. This line of arguing suggests that we should first study ancient Greek and then read Euclid, perhaps an ideal approach. Very few readers of Euclid take this approach. Hence, for an English reader (which includes readers of many other languages), a more faithful rendering of the Greek into English has greater importance because it does not filter the implicit culture as much as a less faithful rendering.These views are my historian views. As a mathematician, I think of mathematics as timeless and critique any mathematical work on the basis of whether it represents good (read this as \\"my\\") mathematics. Heath knew his mathematics; he frequently calls on ideas from Cantor, who at this time is in the middle of his seminal publications. I would take the same critical approach if I were a philosopher--is Euclid good philosophy in that he provides answers to philosophical questions, regardless of whether many refinements have been formulated since Euclid? (By the way, there is no explicit philosophy in Euclid, but a lot of implicit philosophy.) In terms of editing a crucial historical document, Heath's work has withstood the test of about one century, and rightly so in my judgment. His Euclid is likely found among the personal books of people with a high regard for education."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"There are two aspects that must be reviewed: Euclid's text itself and Heath's commentaries. I shall begin with the first.The Elements can be understood by anyone, although appears to have been written for adults. It begins with a system of definitions, postulates and axioms (if you do not know then difference between a postulate and an axiom, Heath's commentary explains it), and proceeds to a logical development of the ideas that appear in connection with our intuition of space. The first book treats lines (intersections, parallels), triangles and paralelograms and most of it is contained in the elementary school curriculum. The second book is also taught at elementary level, but with algebraic symbols. It is interesting to see how the ancients, that didn't have such a good notation as ours, treated problems in general with the methods used in this second book. The third book contains the geometry of the circle; the fourth treats polygons inscribed and circunscribed in circles; again, both are taught at school. The fifth is not taught at elementary level and contains one of the most precious gems of the Greek thought: the theory of Eudoxus, that has many analogies with Dedekind theory of irrationals. Indeed, it has served as a general inspiration for nineteenth century mathematics because of its clear presentation of the meaning of a magnitude. So it's not surprising that, in its endeavours to understand what is a number, the mathematicians looked for light in this beautiful book. The sixth contains the theory of similar polygons and has a lot of features taught at school, but not all. The seventh, eight and ninth treats arithmetic, again without our notation, but are interesting for the same reasons as the second book. The tenth book aplies the theory of the fifth book to geometry and contains the theory of the incomensurables. The last three books contains the Greek version of Spatial Geometry, called by them Stereometry (there are some things that you learn in high school that were not treated by Euclid because they were not known yet, but not very much). Summing all up, you learn a lot of Euclid in school and high school, but probably not with the precision and beauty that he endeavours to treat in this monumental work. Few scientists and mathematicians after Euclid can be said not to have used his work. The beauty of all is that the work still can be classified as one of the most precise, elegant and understandable book of mathematics, even after two thousand years. You can only understand the why reading it. No reviewer can catch in words the essence of the Elements.Heath's commentary is very important because he explains in detail things that would appear difficult for us to understand. For example, why Euclid chooses the order of topics he chooses in his treatment, what is the meaning of every proposition to the whole of the thirteen books, the deficiencies of the work (in today's point of view) and how to correct them, and the history behind it all. It is possible to understand the Elements without his commentaries, but you will perhaps not appreciate all the subtle nuances (and there are many) that make us sometimes think difficult to accept that someone could write such monument to the human industry.Lastly, I can only say that eternity is little to this work."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Heath does a better job than most in his notes-almost all commentary written in modern editions of great scientific works is hilarious-usually some half brite clown trys to find a million faults in the writing of someone who is obviously one hell of a lot more intelligent. Heath just gives the likely facts surrounding Euclid's life, works, and the evolution of the math contained in The Elements.This is math that is accesible if you're willing to put in the time, because it starts with principles we're all familiar with and can agree on (such as the whole being greater than the part), and slowly and methodically works it's way to comparisons of the 5 Platonic solids. Along the way he covers number theory, plane and solid geometry, and provides an early basis for calculus and even certain branches of physics, although the terminology is obscure if you're familiar with more modern methods. Approach this work as a puzzle book, and try to solve the proofs yourself, or even try to disprove them; proceed slowly, it will take more than a year to work through all 13 books, but you will understand these things much better than the average math teacher when you're done. It's also more fun to try to understand the work of one of the greats than it is to study from one of those overpriced college calculus books-don't worry. The principles of Math and Physics don't change, this book is as valid now as ever!"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"There are at least 3 good reasons to read this book:* Even though it's 2300 years old, it's still a great way to learn geometry!

If you want to get all of Euclid's Elements in one volume, the recent Green Lion edition is superb choice. So why buy this edition? For the wonderful introduction and notes by Thomas L. Heath. If these thorough and scholarly additions will bore you, then go for the Green Lion. But if you're interested in the history and influence of Euclid's Elements, this is the edition to read.What we consider to be basic plane geometry is contained in Books 1, 3, 4 and 6 of Euclid's Elements. (So if you want to cover that material, you'll need to buy this volume and volume 2 of the same edition.) Along the way, Euclid covers the Theory of Proportions in Book 5 and \\"Geometric Algebra\\" in Book 2. While the material in Books 1, 3, 4 and 6 is still taught today, with slightly different notation and terminology, those other two books are out of step with modern mathematical practice.This volume contains a very long introduction, plus Books 1 and 2. Book 1 covers triangles and parallelograms in 48 propositions. Book 2 involves 14 geometrical propositions that have approximately equivalent algebraic versions. The greatest hits are: The Pythagorean Theorem (Book 1, Proposition 47) and the construction of the geometric mean (Book 2, Proposition 14)."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Euclid teaches us step-by-step how to prove the most fundamental and complex concepts of geometry in such a systematic and understandable way. By learning Euclid's propositions, we also find ourselves thinking and speaking in a more ordered fashion. I recommend these books to anyone interested in math as well as those who want to improve their debating and reasoning skills."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"This is a review of the Dover edition with Heath's commentary. The review combines Vol. 1 (Books I-II) and Vol. 2 (Books III-IX) because I don't think many people besides possibly historians will only buy Vol.I.I think this is the definitive edition, the best choice for scholars, the mathematically mature, and beginners alike. The main competition seems to be the Green Lion edition, which is also Heath's translation but without the commentary. It's been a while since I've looked at the GL edition so if anything I write is incorrect please let me know and I'll edit appropriately. I believe it has some commentary in the difficult Book V, but nothing as detailed as Dover. Most people will need a good amount of help in Book IX as well, which the Dover edition provides. I'll attempt a short comparison between the editions. You'll notice that GL gets short shrift. This isn't because I prefer the Dover edition, but rather the other way around. I prefer the Dover edition because there are so many good things to say about it.IN FAVOR OF GREEN LION:**Cheaper. The three Dover books will cost about 13 dollars more. If you don't plan to read past, say, Book VI, like many people, then vol.1 and 2 of the Dover editions are only about 3 more dollars. Although if you really want the best price, the entire Elements is free online (Google D.E Joyce).**Figures are redrawn on the next page in case a proof carries over. This seems like a minor thing, but I think it's a really nice touch.**Slightly easier to find a proposition. Ok, I'll give this to them, but their preface exaggerates quite a bit when it says that in the Dover edition it's \\"difficult to find propositions.\\" How one encounters this difficulty when at the top of each left hand page is the book number and on the right the proposition number is unclear to me. But like I said, it is slightly easier in GL so they win this one.IN FAVOR OF DOVER:**If your goal is to learn even a tiny bit about Greek mathematics or math history in general, then read no further. This is the edition for you.**This is the best edition for beginners. This directly contradicts some previous reviewers, so some explanation is in order. The main argument against the use of this edition for beginners more or less asserts that Heath's commentary is only for the scholar- just dense, esoteric filler material to be skipped by the \\"real\\" mathematicians. Maybe that's a little harsh to those other reviewers and slightly exaggerated, but I put myself in the shoes of someone who has never seen this edition and that's essentially the feeling I got. This isn't the full truth. The first two thirds or so of volume 1, before he even gets to Euclid's text, might fit this description, as do some of the in-depth comments following Euclid's definitions, but then again a lot of those comments are necessary to know what Euclid is trying to say. This is the case with quite a few theorems as well. Now, it could be the case that I can't understand them because I'm stupid; that's still a conjecture at this point, although most people believe it's true. But to appeal to authority, De Morgan called some of the propositions in Book V \\"unintelligible to modern ears\\", and this description is definitely not limited to that book. Sure, some beginners will be ok with no help, but just like that one friend we all have who always claims to win at the casino, most people who claim to be ok on their own are probably lying. Heath also, especially in Book IX, goes through difficultly-worded proofs in the same style as Euclid but with modern notation, which is a tremendous help. Another thing to keep in mind is that one can understand something at only a superficial level. If not for Heath's commentary, I wouldn't have really understood Proposition VI.27. When I saw \\"The importance of VI.27-29 from a historical point of view cannot be overrated\\", I knew I wasn't getting it. I would never have noticed the connection to quadratic equations without the commentary. As far as GL is concerned, you're on your own with all this stuff. Good luck with that.Still keeping the beginner in mind, Euclid's habit of only proving one case and leaving any others to the reader could be confusing. Take I.24, for instance. Readers with some mathematical maturity will immediately wonder why F is drawn outside of triangle DGE, realize that this is just one case, and prove the others. A beginner might either not notice it at all, which is a bad habit to get into, or become frustrated at not understanding why (they think) F has to be outside the triangle. Heath always explicitly mentions and proves all but the most obvious missing cases. On a related note, Heath explains why lines that Euclid claims will meet, actually do meet, usually invoking the parallel postulate. I think this is important for the beginner because while they \\"obviously\\" meet from the diagrams, it gets them into the habit of thinking axiomatically for when diagrams can be misleading or are simply impossible to draw.**In addition, there's plenty of MATH in the commentary, which not many people have mentioned. There are alternate proofs of several theorems, some of which are arguably superior to Euclid's. There are also extensions that will be new to many readers. In particular, there's a nice extension to the Pythagorean Theorem credited to Pappus, and in Book VI Heath proves, surprisingly easily, that the locus of a point such that its distances from two given points are in a given ratio (not equal to 1) is a circle. I guess this wouldn't be extremely difficult to do algebraically, but it would probably be tedious and nowhere near as pretty as a geometric proof. These are just two I recall at the moment. There are many more.I think that's reason enough to get the Dover edition."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"If you like long, tedious introductions and the need to sort through endless words to find what you're looking for, then you might want this version of Euclid's work. On the other hand, if you want to get to the point and prefer a clear resource for study, the version published by Green Lion is FAR superior to this one."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Euclid's \\"Elements\\" may very well be the most influential mathematical text in all of history. This fact alone justifies purchasing this book, which is the first of three volumes of Thomas L. Heath's English translation of this classic. This volume contains a lengthy introduction, and the actual mathematics covers plane geometry. Highlights include the construction of the regular 15-gon using straightedge and compass.The actual text of Euclid's work is not particularly long, but this book contains extensive commentary about the history of the Elements, as well as commentary on the relevance of each of the propositions, definitions, and axioms in the book. As such, this book is a good scholarly reference for English readers interested in the historical evolution of Euclidean geometry. For example, there is considerable discussion on the well-known fifth postulate about parallel lines.All this being said, do not try to learn geometry from this book. The content is more suited for readers who already know geometry and want to learn about the historical origins of the subject of geometry. There are many modern books written for readers new to geometry (some good, some bad). It's probably true that Abraham Lincoln studied the Elements as a young lawyer, but there are easier (if not better) ways to learn geometry nowadays. The Elements will be much more enlightening if the reader has a good grasp of the actual mathematics in the book prior to reading it."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"I'm not sure that Euclid itself needs another review; its place in mathematics history is well established and other reviewers have done a good job explaining the Elements. I finished working through the \\"propositions\\" in the first two books (the contents of this volume) -- I recommend that if you are considering exploring the Elements, that you get out pen and paper and actually work through the steps. You don't necessarily need to draw every single line out using only a straightedge and compass, but without doing the work yourself it can be hard to appreciate how the proofs work.What I mainly want to talk about is this edition specifically. Editions of the Elements are available online for free, and there are other printed editions that contain only the proofs and diagrams, without all the introduction and commentary. So the primary question should be whether the contents of this edition are worth it. In short, I think that if you are interested in Greek philosophy and the history of mathematics, this edition contains a great deal of useful information. If you are mainly interested in the Elements itself, you may do better to go with another edition.Thomas Heath was writing in the early 20th century, and he may have expected his reading audience to be more familiar with Aristotelian philosophy and geometry in general than we are today. His 152-page introduction is divided into 9 chapters. The first chapter is a fairly accessible introduction to Euclid's life and the legends we have about him. Chapters 2-4 are about the work of previous Greek mathematicians and later commentators on Euclid; these chapters are more dense and probably not of interest to the general reader. Chapters 5-8 are a fairly tedious listing of various manuscripts, editions, translations, and adaptations of Euclid -- it's hard to imagine many people being interested in the content of these chapters unless they were specialist researchers. Chapter 9 is worth reading if you are interested in Greek philosophy, and especially if you have some understanding of Aristotle. In ancient Greece, philosophy often dealt with mathematics, and this chapter is a nicely detailed discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of Euclid's techniques, and explanations of terms such as \\"definition\\" and \\"axiom\\" (in terms of Greek philosophy).The next 90 or so pages is about the definitions, postulates, and \\"common notions\\". Once again, these notes deal extensively with Greek philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics in general. For instance, the commentary on definition 1 (the point) discusses Aristotelian and pre-Euclidean definitions, criticism of Euclid's definition by later commentators, and \\"modern\\" (i.e. late 19th century) definitions. A lot of this content may not be accessible to someone without philosophy or geometry. Some of this may make more sense if you come back to it later -- for instance, the 20 pages of commentary on the infamous Postulate 5 are a lot easier to appreciate once you've worked through Propositions 29-32 (which use the Postulate).This more or less applies to the commentary on the Propositions as well. A lot of the commentary is devoted to (a) Pre-Euclidean mathematics, (b) criticism of later commentators, and (c) modern treatments of the subject.I suppose that anyone considering The Elements probably has some interest in the history of mathematics, and Heath's information is incredibly detailed and informative. But as I said earlier, unless you have some prior background in Aristotle and geometry in general, it may be difficult to digest."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Sure, there is no royal road to geometry, the master said. But this edition, from Heath, bring to our days the pleasure and intellectual enlightment of admiring Euclid's master work, the geometry textbook for the centuries, in our own language.

It is important to know that this is more of a commentary on the Elements, rather than The Elements itself. For those who want just The Elements, the copy you want isEuclid's Elements.If this is the first time you are reading The Elements, this is probably not the copy for you. However, if you are pondering about the translations, or are curious about who might have influenced a certain proposition, this edition would be perfect."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Grab a protractor and a compass and go to work.

I am, in fact, enthusiastic, and enthusiastic people usually do have strange habits regarding their subjects of enthusiasm. I, for one, like to buy all of the geometry books I can lay my hand on regardless of its relevance to my studies or usefulness for reading.And this book, being a classic, was on top of my demanded books list until I bought it around 1998. As usual with these books, I postponed its reading until the new millennium. But when I read it I was very disappointed.The material of this book is one of the most beautiful afforded by a mathematics book. It is very interesting, but, alas, it is written in a forbidding notation. I can understand high level math books in Algebra and Analysis, but this book confused me with words. Frankly, I do not see why a math book is supposed to explained in words after all this development of mathematics.Unfortunately, most historian mathematicians disagree with my view. They see that writing the elements of Euclid (The first rigorous set of axioms and lemmas) in the modern notation is unfaithful to the original manuscript. Well, I have got no problem with that, but at least try to make it up to date so that people could go through it.You see that I gave it 4 stars. Yes the material of the book was excellent, and it rather deserved 5 stars, but for this tedious presentation.One other thing I hated a bout this volume was the introduction. It had taken about one third of the book, and after the definitions of the first book, there are notes on the definitions and postulates that take another third of the book. These notes are not all that easy and at a higher level than the postulates of Euclid, and I found them irrelevant. I do not understand here why did not the author, who made notes on the definitions, make a section explaining all the postulates in modern notation.As for the material, the volume covers Books I and II of Euclid's 13 books of the elements. The first book introduces a set of definitions and goes on characterizing triangles. It, even, proves the Pythagorean theorem. This proof was a bit difficult, a simpler proof can be found else where, but, after all, it is amazing how mathematicians could have solved such a problem thousands of years ago.He introduced the famous constructions of straight edge and a compass, he would construct an isosceles triangle starting from a given segment by merely using a straight edge and a compass. Later on, Galois studied this construction in his famous Galois theory (try Artin's Galois theory, although I do not guarantee it).The second books deals with areas of triangles and rectangles, and Euclid's notation shows it incompetence when he uses the same name for two different things. For in the first book he used to say that two triangles are equal if all their angles and sides are equal, but in the second book he would define two triangles to be equal if they had the same area!All in all, I enjoyed the book, and would have enjoyed it more if not for the drawbacks."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"Excellent book, although somewhat specific for whoever is interested in geometry and its history"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 1: Books 1-2","review":"There is no better way begin your journey to freedom of the mind then by studying the books of Euclid. \\"None may inter who have not studied the works of Euclid\\"-unknown.Heath's notes are very helpful in understanding the history and problems of various propositions."},{"Title":"The White Peacock (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D.

My husband came from a home where you were told you can't cry and if you did you were a wimp. At age 35, he still struggles with his emotions.

For instance, how we might respond to a boy when he says \\"oh look, that kid over there is crying\\" vs. our response to a girl. Studies show that we'd steer the boy away, distract him, move on to something different. But to a girl, we encourage her to help, to be sympathetic, and engage in a discussion about what happened.Towards the end, the authors offer some suggestions on how to tap into the emotional side of our boys, how to develop modes of communication that can last through adolescent years and into adult hood.

I feel all the insight I can get on how a young boys mind \\"works\\" is going to be a great advantage when trying to help my child enter a new chapter in his life. I feel this book helped me and will help him.If you are a parent of a boy, a caregiver to a boy, someone that interacts with a boy, or just a guy that wants to know why you react the way you do to situations, get this book. I think it is well worth the cost to be able to help make a boy feel like it is ok to have emotions. To help a boy become a more emotionally literate man could be the greatest thing you can teach a boy. This book can you give you insight on how to do that and some understanding on how to recognize when a boy needs the support and emotional literacy to express his feelings. To just hear, \\"It is ok to have feelings\\" means a great deal to a boy."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"The title of this book says a monumental truth.In virtually all societies, throughout time, BOYS are raised to be strong, and any variance of that is \\"A Problem\\". The Problem, however, is strongly rooted in the society a boy is raised. There is no common factor other than the basic issue that BOYS become MEN, and MEN RULE THE WORLD.Thustly boys are, in virtually all societies, ethnic and religious, economic and existential, boys are generally drained of their \\"emotional body\\" as they grow, and by the age which their social realm dictates, are honed into the male image of the culture they are raised.Far too many boys, over all the world, in all situations, are neglected EMOTIONALLY as they grow up, resulting in strong men who make up the warriors, regardless of their eventual position and place in life.It is all too common that the basic emotional needs of young boys are neglected, even refused, often brutally, in an effort to \\"make them strong\\". It's been going on since the dawn of time.As society fragments into far more complex expressions for both male and female role-models, something that has been changing since the Rennaissance, boys, despite their diversification in potential, have generally been either brutalized into uniformity, or segmented, eventually compartementalized into roles dictated by local moral, religious or financial revenues.\\"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys\\" tackles an age-old problem with great insight, and while there are no common solutions, there are ways of thinking that can help raise boys in a way that is \\"Complete\\"."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As the mother of two young boys, but also as a wife, daughter and sister, this book was extremely enlightening in revealing the complicated emotional workings of boys and men, and in looking at the struggles they face as they try to conform to this cultures' expectations about how they should or should not express their feelings. It challenges the cultural 'norms' of encouraging the suppression in the male gender of any feelings other than anger and joy and in this culture's fascination with promoting the 'tough guy' (read: emotionally unexpressive, physically aggressive) persona as a male role model. It also talks candidly about the very real differences in verbal development of boys and girls, and how this often leads boys to feel inadequate in the early school years. While any woman can easily recognize the differences in communication styles between the sexes, it was refreshing to be given some insight as to the developmental and cultural influences that contribute to these differences."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I am amazed. As a mother, I am so happy to be currently reading this book. My husband will read it soon. Almost all of my friends are teachers and constantly complain about the boys in their classrooms. I want to buy them this book as it gives such great insight into the lives of boys. Every father should read this book, it should be required reading. If all of our parents and teachers could read this book, we could change our society for the better..

Read it and then remember it.(And do something about it to make a difference to your son/nephew/student). Great book!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I had high, high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I wound up not liking it at all. I give it two stars for talking about a difficult subject, but the stars are for the attempt, not for the execution.The premise of this book - that boys get emotionally shut down during childhood, until many adult males just don't have the basic emotional tools you need to cope as a human being - seems like a very worthwhile public conversation to have. But unfortunately, I felt like this book was really light on exactly how you could protect the emotional lives of boys, but very heavy on vague, often contradictory statements (often kind of mom-blamey) about how you shouldn't let boys think they are the best, but you should also not criticize boys, because men are more sensitive than women. That kind of thing.While thinking about why I disliked this so much, it occurred to me that maybe I am just not the target audience for this book. If responding to your child's \\"Why is that boy crying?\\" query with \\"Maybe he's sad. Sometimes all of us feel sad, but I bet his mom and dad are going to help him feel better soon.\\" is an idea so radical that it literally blows your mind, maybe you will find the stuff in here useful. If you are coming from a place where you tell your sobbing toddler to toughen up because boys don't cry, maybe this book will help you be a better parent.If you already know that boys are just plain old human beings who have feelings just like girls do, skip it."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I feel like the message of the book is good and useful... but this could have been an essay instead of a 250 page book. Boys aren't encouraged to explore their emotions, which leads to feelings being bottled up and ignored. This can lead to emotional problems in some boys. I didn't find their case studies to be very compelling or their conclusions to be particularly helpful or actionable."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"While I think men and the parents of daughters would also benefit from reading this book, I want to emphasize that as a woman and the parent of sons this book has become an invaluable resource for me. The authors made many important points about the male experience that were new to me, or vague, and also gave practical ideas and examples for achieving goals or avoiding conceptual traps.Kindlon and Thompson begin with the story of Cain, which is immediately disorienting. In a good way. I've always been puzzled about why God was so mad? I believe the fruit Cain offered was beautiful, so why was it of lesser value? I never thought God was fair to Cain, though admittedly Cain did react badly. So immediately you're in the state of mind to question perceptions about males as well as male perception (and reaction).I didn't find any intellectual oneupsmanship over which gender's got it worse. Instead, I saw: Boys are different, and here's what some of the differences are and why that's so, and how you can deal with that. I feel much better prepared for the many talks I hope I'll have with my children over the years. Important talks that I want to be transformative rather than reactionary or alienating.This isn't just a book for the parents of adolescent boys, either. The authors make the point many times that giving boys an emotional education is imperative -- teaching them to recognize various emotions as physical cues and with emotional consequences. More importantly, the authors then cite cases from their clinical backgrounds and make down-to-earth suggestions about what to do to catch these problems and help our children. Young boys will benefit from your early introduction of these principles, including: giving a boy an emotional education and letting him have an inner life; recognizing that boys have a higher activity level (amen!) -- and accepting it; communicating with boys in a direct and respectful way, and enlisting them as problem solvers; using discipline that is instructive and fair rather than harsh and crushing; teaching a boy that there are many ways to be a man.This is a plausible theory informed by clinical experience, but most of all it is a catalog of simple actions that may make a huge difference in your sons' lives. Andrew Vachss' Another Chance to Get It Right, says these things so eloquently. Every day the collective experience of the world is the sum of the choices each of us makes individually. We decide whether to be lazy parents and raise mediocre adults, or do we try to make a golden age, populated by mature, happy adults who have the knowledge and the will to make the world a better place in their turn? Every day you decide whether to spank or to reason, to pressure or to embrace, to train or to teach, to saddle them with our baggage or let them be. Let Vachss' book motivate you and this book instruct you. You and your children will be the better for it.Well-written, insightful, transformative."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"A few months ago, I read Reviving Ophelia on the recommendation of my wife (a psychologist) and a friend (a social worker). I was frankly stunned at the insight I gained in reading it. I immediately ordered a copy of my own, and in the process discovered Raising Cain. And just like Reviving Ophelia, I read it completely through. As a man, with strong memories of my adolescence, the book resonates with me. The stories it presents of the adolescent indoctrination into male culture (the &quot;Big Impossible&quot; as it's referred to throughout the book) ring true in a personal way. I &quot;knew&quot; many of the boys that they're referring to and who tell their stories. These were my associates, my classmates, my friends. And the more I read, the more I recalled of that period. Kindlon and Thompson present their story in the same basic structure as Pipher in Reviving Ophelia; as a series of topics that can greatly influence a young man, using vignettes of particular children and their stories to develop understanding and insight. And again, these are powerful vehicles for communication; presenting stories of strength and power in the face of unbelievable adversity. Just as powerful, is the understanding it brings as to how and why a child who's been continually disenfranchised can lash out against others (I find I'm in particular agreement with the authors after having been on the minority end of discussions about school killings such as Colombine). The most important contribution of this book; however, is to those who don't (and can't) understand what male culture can do to shape a child. I'm continually at the receiving end (and mostly the participating end) of jokes about the inability of a man to express a real emotion or feeling. While most of it is joking, it's clear that for two close female friends (one an only child and one with the closest siblings 15 years their senior) and my spouse (with three brothers, the youngest 16 years older than she) there really isn't any understanding of what it's like growing up to be indoctrinated as a man. Hopefully this book can provide some measure of understanding to those who haven't experienced this first-hand. And what of those of us who have experienced it? Hopefully this book provides both some reminder of what it was like growing up in that environment as well as providing some hope that it's possible to grow beyond the expectations of that environment. For while strength is important, it must be tempered with compassion. And it's up to us to make sure it happens."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys, by Dan Kindlon, Ph.D. and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., is a book that captures the emotional struggles of adolescent boys in this day and age. It was fascinating in many regards to learn of the issues that boys deal with throughout the second decade of their lives, and how they deal with them. Raising Cain describes how boys desperately need a &quot;clan&quot; throughout their adolescence to help them grow and mature into emotionally healthy men. The book greatly emphasizes the importance of both a boy's father and mother, why these relationships are so extremely significant, and how parents can and should go about maintaining the strongest possible relationships with their sons. The book also explains boys' tendencies to keep things bottled up inside instead of talking about them, this being due to a lack of emotional vocabulary and the inability to express feelings. Boys, therefore, tend to suffer in silence or release negative feelings through anger or violence. Raising Cain does a great job of explaining how and why such behaviors exist in adolescent boys and how parents, educators, and mentors can help them through these challenging times in their lives. Although the book is very insightful, Raising Cain tends to over-emphasize the differences between the struggles and obstacles of adolescent boys and girls, and at many times, seems to pit them against one another in terms of which gender has it harder. This implicit competition makes the book frustrating to read at times. Overall, though, Raising Cain is a tremendously educational book, both from a professional perspective and a personal perspective."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As the mother of a twelve, soon to be thirteen- year-old boy, I've been pleased that publishers have finally taken an interest in boys. Figuring I need all the help I can get as my son enters adolescence, I read every new book as soon as it comes out. I've found merit in recent books by Michael Gurrian and William Pollack, but Raising Cain, is, hands down, the best of the bunch. It has touched me and changed the way I understand my son.Pollack, an expert on men, bases Real Boys on a small study he did of boys--or so we gather from his introduction. His approach is psychoanalytical, and can be interesting. But frankly, Real Boys did not sustain my interest; I put it down about half way through and didn't pick it up. Many of Pollack's ideas don't quite ring true for me. Raising Cain, on the other hand, hits the bulls eye, again and again. The revelatory chapter on social cruelty, written long before events in Littleton, is alone worth the price of the book. I scarcely knew a &quot;culture of cruelty&quot; among boys existed, let alone how horrific it can be--until my son changed schools and experienced it first hand.Finally, Raising Cain confirmed for me what I believe as a mother--that the loving, caring, sensitive, affectionate part of boys is something to preserve. When my son was born, I knew I could never try to &quot;toughen him up&quot;. I would show him plenty of affection, allow him to cry, encourage him to express his feelings. So many men I knew became fathers and couldn't give their sons the love they never got from their own fathers. For me, showing love and affection is like putting money in the bank--it will be there to draw on when he needs it. Raising Cain shows me that this is the right thing to do.Compare what Kindlon and Thompson say about mothers and sons to the psychobabble in Real Boys. Pollack seems so old school when he says that all a boy's problems begin at the &quot;separation stage&quot;, when his mother &quot;pushes him away&quot; to start him on the path to manhood. This wasn't true for me--nor is it true for any other mother of my generation I know. Push our sons away!?! No way! We love and care about our sons, and want to stay connected to them. Raising Cain has an emotional truthfulness the other books just don't have. The world would be a better place if all parents and educators read it. It's transformative."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As a colleague of Michael Thompson, co-author with Dan Kindlon of the forthcoming book Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys, I had the chance to read a pre-publication copy of the manuscript, and I recommend it highly. The book is well-written, engaging, informative, and thought-provoking. It is unusual for two pyschologists to write so well for the general public, without talking down to them and without being too academic. Raising Cain reviews the latest research about boys, gives rich and poignant anecdotes, offers a profound understanding of the depth of situation for boys in our society, and makes helpful suggestions for parents and teachers. Raising Cain covers a wide range of topics, from boys' emotional lives (the way they are untrained in reading and expressing emotions) to their early school years (which the authors refer to as &quot;thorns among roses,&quot; referring to the way boys often fail to fit in or thrive in early elementary school) to the role of mothers (who try hard to stay connected to their sons in the face of overwhelming pressures on boys to separate) and the role of fathers (too often absent, at least emotionally, from the lives of sons). Another chapter discusses the fact that boys are more likely to be subjected to harsh discipline, and offers a variety of alternatives. There are also chapters on boys and romance, alcohol and drug use, depression and withdrawal. My favorite chapter, and the one that distinguishes this book from other recent books about boys, is on 'the culture of cruelty,' about what boys do to each other, espcially in early adolescence. Despite many efforts by paretns and educators, boys attack each other physically and emotionally, enforcing narrow definitions of masculinity and sexuality, leaving many boys scarred guarded, and lonely. The unique perspective of Raising Cain is that boys, for many reasons, impose these conditions on each other--it doesn't all come from the media or the broader culture. Several recent books have covered roughly similar territory, with a shared concern for the welfare of boys. Unlike Michael Gurian's book, Raising Cain rejects the idea that the 'boy-brain' is somehow ill-equipped to handle emotions. Though boys' biology does play a role, its contribution to boys clipped, withdrawn style is small compared to the role of socialization--boys are systematically pressured to shut down and shut others out. Unlike William Pollack's book, Raising Cain does not argue that mothers abandon their sons prematurely--rather, Kindlon and Thompson argue that the culture drives them apart, while most mothers strive mightily to stay connected, and keep trying even when they are confused and bewildered. Meanwhile, they describe boys having a 'hole in their soul' from their lack of a close emotional connection with men, starting with their fathers. I understand that Raising Cain will be available in early April--it is worth the wait."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"After reading this book, I came to the conclusion that every hospital in the country ought to have a supply on hand to give out to new parents/caregivers upon the birth of a son, much like car dealers give you an owner's manual when you buy a car.Continuing on with the metaphor, after reading this book, I came to the conclusion that we know more about cars than we do about children! This book should be read by...*Anyone who has a son, regardless of whether your relationship with him is good or bad. This book will help you understand the dynamics of father/son, and mother/son relationships; insight that will be vital during the turbulent adolescent years.*Teachers, and administrators. Our educational system is so female dominated, that many of the well-intentioned ladies who come in contact with boys on a daily basis, have no clue what they are all about, and consequently, you see a disproportionate number of boys who are identified as having learning disabilities, get suspended, and/or otherwise in trouble at school.*Every father, since fathers typically and traditionally, yet tragically, leave all &quot;emotional issues&quot; for mom to address. No more slacking dads! It is time to start pulling your weight!!My heart ached after reading this book. It ached because with a little understanding, we would not see so many boys messed up. The authors of this book have made a wonderful contribution to the literature on child development and child rearing. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that if we do not start doing better as parents, teachers, coaches, etc. etc. in helping our boys attain emotional literacy, the price in human terms will be incalculable.I can honestly say that after reading this book, I will never be able to look at boys the same way again. A truly outstanding book."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"In this day and age, I would recommend reading any book that helped parents and educators in the way they taught boys. But I have to say that this book felt like a rehash of the old philosophy that if we just made boys more in-touch with their emotions, then they would grow up healthier (which is better argued in Pollack's book Real Boys). The book seems to say that a boy's biology plays little to no effect on their life, which is just a bizarre argument. Any parent who has boys and girls knows that boys and girls have different biological elements. It's easy to see, and instead of saying that biological differences that result in behavioral differences is a misogynistic argument, I think we need to see that it is both a matter of emotional and biological components that are going to help us help our boys (which is very well covered in The Wonder of Boys and A Fine Young Man by Gurian). I recommend we all read all of these books so that we can get as educated as possible, but this one just wasn't that compelling compared to the work of Gurian and Pollack."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I am the mother of 3 boys - when my six year old began Kindergarten this year, he started to act different. I didn't understand what he was feeling. Afterall, arts and crafts in Kindergarten sounded great to me. Why couldn't he sit still for the activity? I desperately searched for some reading material that would help me to understand what he was going through. And I found it in this book. An easy read. A lot of great information for understanding boys and their behaviors and feelings. My son doesn't act different anymore - instead I act differently toward him and it's helped all of us."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I am a father of two boys and I came across this book by searching on Amazon for books that could help me improve my parenting skills. I love my boys and I consider my parenting as a full time job. I read other readers comments and I did some research before I purchased a couple of books, Raising Cain being one of them. My main motivation in buying these books is derived from the frustration that I experience when I know I fail to understand my son on some issues and also from my worry that I do not understand what is going on in a life of a young man in today's world.Raising Cain opened my eyes in many aspects. It is written well and it makes no assumptions about the level of knowledge of the reader. It talks about the relationship between the boy and the father and between the boy and the mather, then it talks about general attitude of society on boys with short comparisons with the girls world. The books continues in discussing boys' psychology explaining how their inner world is built, what factors influence it most and consequences of their influence. It talks about drinking, drugs, sex and violence.There are some very good positive points that I took with me and there are some points that are missing from the book despite the fact that they are quite important.I can summarise the book by saying that it does a very good job explaining the need of talking to our sons and helping them to see their feelings as a way of diffusing tension, but it fails (in my view) in providing the tools that parent can use in implementing this concept.The books showed clearly that the lack of fathers' positive involvment in sons education causes a lot of damage in the long term. The boys have an anger that is internalised over the years and it vents, for some, through violent and aggressive behavior. That is why most of the violent crimes are committed by males. I liked the chapter that talks about relationship between fathers and sons (I am a father and I was interested in that). However, the books stops there, by limitting this part to a description that is most of the time negative, without much practical outcome. Although the book observes the fact that the studies show how critical this interaction is, and that the education system lacks male teachers and that all this compounded with the huge impact of high rate of divorce that leaves sons without male models, puts the boys at an enormous disadvantage at the start of their adult life, the book offers only 20 pages dedicated to this subject (father-son relationship). Mothers get 37 pages and the rest is dedicated to drinking, drugs, violence and sex. The authors talk almost as much about masturbation as they talk about father-son relationship.It is good that the authors talk about the big problems the boys have; I felt however they insist too much on the negatives by using stories, their personal recount of sessions they conducted as school psychologists (consultants). I was looking for some advice that I could use as a tool for parenting, but I haven't found much support from that point of view. For instance, the book has a chapter called Anger and Violence that dedicates 21 pages to describe various experiences and discuss some general observations on this topic. At the end, it concludes with Strategies and Circuit Breakers: Teaching Boys do Defuse Anger. That section spreads across one page (!) and it has no strategy. The last sentence says it all, and I have the impression that it is representative for the entire book in showing how advice is provided by the authors: \\"If you can get a boy to figure out what it is he's mad about, then he's in a position to begin to change the destructive pattern of responses in his life\\". It sounds logical, I agree with that, but I feel it would have been helpful to get more concrete advise about how you do it.Overall, the book is very good, I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand their sons. It does a very good job in showing that their education is more than instilling discipline and it is very important to handle their pride with care. I followed this book with reading \\"The Good Son: Shaping the Moral Development of Our Boys and Young Men\\" by Michael Gurian. I found this book extremely useful and complementing Rasing Cain very well. I gave me what I was missing from the first book: more practical parenting advice and uptodate information from research in neurology and psychology. I would strongly recommend the purchase of both books. For me it was a very good investment."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As I read this book about boys, much of it became more about the boy who becomes the man that he is today. This IS an amazing book, well written, and better yet, written by the very professional people who deal with boys and their troubles as counsellors, and in their practices. Each man can read about his own childhood in any one of the case studies.My favourites are:The Culture of Cruelty or as another book said it, our Toxic Culture; We live in a modern culture where our heroes and role models are vague and fleeting. Our sports figures commit drug abuse, or adultery. The Media confronts us with disturbing images of war, sex, and banality. The Media drives us to consume all material goods. Against this backdrop, we must raise our sons. This is where a parents guidance throughout a boys life is necessary.Seeking the Big Impossible; Boys are groomed early to seek the perfect car, the perfect job, the perfect family, the Big Impossible. And when they fall short, the result is often withdrawal or depression. Boys are trained to seek and accumulate the impossible dream.Fathers and Sons, A Legacy of Distance and Desire; this chapter alone is worth it. Sons are always seeking an emotional connection with their fathers. Unfortunately, most fathers were and still are raised by fathers whom themselves are emotionally illiterate. Thus the great gulf of distance between fathers and sons.Romancing the Stone, from heartfelt to heartless relations with girls; This chapter so clearly explains why some boys can't love, you know anyone like that? As the author suggests, it's because boys who are raised emotionally illiterate, have trouble learning to love when they become men, thus moving from a heartfelt boy to heartless relationships with women. Give your son a break, teach him to be emotional literate, so when he grows up, he can have heartfelt relationships with other people.Read this book and you gain a better understanding about boys ... better yet, read this book and you'll gain a better understanding of the boy who became a man."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"&quot;The emotional life of boys&quot; might seem like an oxymoron, but as these two authors ably demonstrate, young boys start out MORE emotionally expressive than girls. But by the time they're six years old, we've convinced them that being &quot;a man&quot; means being strong, silent, and &quot;strong&quot; -- -- and that feelings are for girls. The authors make a strong case that genes, hormones and brain development count for less in a boy's development than emotional education. Boys CAN be as empathetic, compassionate and expressive as girls -- if we give them the tools, and if we (fathers) give them models of emotionally whole men.

This book really changed the way I look at the world. While we are quick to criticize the media for portraying women as sex objects, we rarely condemn the media for its stock depictions of men as either power-hungry politicians, sex-crazed and irresponsible athletes, or violent sociopaths.

Kindlon and Thompson have provided an eloquent and readable discussion of the challenges facing boys in our society and our schools. I am a father of two boys and received my doctorate in Education a few years ago. As both a parent and educator for more than twenty years, I enjoyed reading each chapter of this book. I have also read Pollack and Gurian's books. I find Pollack pompous and arrogant in his opinions and advice. Frankly, I have not seen the separation anxieties that he describes in the boys that I have taught and counseled. Gurian draws extensive, simplistic conclusions from a select set of research findings - he seems to have predated the recent research regarding testosterone. Thompson and Kindlon, on the other hand, provide a balanced, quiet voice that relies on their years of experience with boys. Their descriptions matched my experiences and understanding of child psychology perfectly. Their advice is invaluable."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I am a Ph.D. student in child psychology at UCLA, and have done most of my research on the parent-child relationship. The primary focus of Raising Cain, the need to help boys develop greater connection with their own emotions and those of others, is laudable. However, a few of the recommendations made to parents seem quite counter-productive.In the chapter on Mothers and Sons, the authors point out that many mothers become uncomfortable with physical touch with their sons sometime in pre-adolescence or soon thereafter. To the authors, this is unfortunate, and they recommend that mothers emphasize physical affection with sons at all age-periods. The authors reason that it is better to learn about good touch from mothers in a 'non-sexual' context than from other people, like coaches or &quot;casual sex&quot; partners.This advice seems lacking in research and clinical grounding. A crucial hurdle for boys is the development of emotional independence from their parents-- indeed, many consider this to be the fundamental goal of the second decade of life. A critical part of the development of an independent identity is a transition from a physical communication of needs and emotions in infancy and early childhood, to a verbal, non-physical means of communication of emotions later on that nurtures boys' emerging maturity. A transition from physical to verbal affection shows respect for boys' developing autonomy, which is closely connected with changing and maturity physical development. The misgivings of mothers about physical affection with pre-teen and early-teen boys is entirely understandable. They appear to have recognized that a lot of physical affection with mothers can be very confusing and potentially problematic for boys in middle childhood and later.The importance placed on helping boys get in touch with their emotions is a very positive message to be sending in the current era. Many of the methods advocated by the authors seem helpful and appropriate. However, the recommendation that parents and boys should increase physical affection does not take into account fundamental needs of boys to be given room to grow by turning more towards mature, verbal forms of affection. There is no research supporting the notion that an increase of physical affection is helpful to boys. Parents can help best by talking about emotions with boys and giving a lot of positive feedback about boys' activities and interests. Theres nothing to be gained in treating school-age boys like younger children and expressing affection in infantile ways."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book by Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson raises some important and disturbing issues. In the decade since it first came out, too little has changed in society's concerns about the emotional lives of men and women, and how to deal with the problems they face. We are greatly concerned about the ravages of breast cancer, as we should be, but we hardly ever hear about comparable death rates for prostate and other deadly forms of cancer. Some implications of that disparity are troubling, or should be. We still are aware of unfair pay practices for women employees, but the Supreme Court may deal with Wal-Mart over that issue by this summer.For far too long, social norms have denied or belittled men who expressed or dealt with emotions other than rage and anger--anxiety, fear, jealousy, envy, and all the rest. To previous generations, one of the worst things a boy could be called was a \\"sissy,\\" because he might be afraid, for example, to confront a bully. While we still do not reward women in the marketplace equally with men, as studies continue to show, the emotional and supportive networks that exist for women give them strength and support far beyond what is available for men.Men in support groups continue to show that they hunger for connection with other men. Most men and adolescent boys appreciate and need the safety and permission to deal with the issues that pain them deeply--for most men their troubled relationships with their fathers (ala the writing of Robert Bly). In this book the authors deal with the roots of these problems in the lives of boys. They deal with boys' relationships with their fathers and mothers, their struggles with depression and suicide, and their battles against addiction as a coping mechanism.The jury is still out on how successful this small body of literature designed to help boys and men has been. Men are still too slow to go to physicians when symptoms appear. Increasingly we have proscribed even anger as an expression of men's struggles and emotional pain. What else is left them?We must not turn our backs on the medical, social, and economic problems that still confront too many women in this country. But neither must we ignore the struggles and problems in the lives of men, which these authors show in this excellent study, begin in the dilemmas that confront boys growing up in America."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"\\"Raising Cain\\" by the psychologists Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson is very controversial because it's very right or it's very wrong. Its main contention is precise and powerful: the family structure of competitive career-oriented fathers and obsessive fastidious mothers, a school system that is too happily ready to harshly discipline boys without providing them emotional support, and a society which has a narrow mindset of what manliness entails and thus imprisons boys in a \\"culture of cruelty\\" are conspiring to wreck the emotional lives of boys. The hell-raising and risk-taking testosterone-driven stereotype of boys has some basis in nature, but it's mainly created by nurture.To understand the inner world of boys today consider what they read and what they're exposed to in popular culture. Frank Miller's graphic novels -- \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\" -- are extremely popular among boys, and these novels are brimming with violence, fear, hatred, disgust, and contempt. Or how about sports such as football where sports commentators don't emphasize intelligence and teamwork but raw instinctive brutality and violence? Then there is the hip hop music of black gangsters that resonate so powerfully with white middle-class boys.There's a striking anecdote that the authors use to illustrate this \\"culture of cruelty\\" : a school's lacrosse team gathers two young ninth-graders after school, and forces them to fight. That really is a metaphor for how society develops boys, and to counterbalance this the authors propose another metaphor. In a park, a mother sits on a bench and watches her young three-year old ward learn to explore the world around him. He takes a few steps before scattering back to his mother's embrace, and confident that she will be his anchor he musters the courage to explore the world a bit further. The mother knows that the world will only offer dangers and challenges for her young son, and deep inside is afraid of losing him to the world -- but strengthened and armored by her love she lets him go so that he may become a man.This is an affecting and effective metaphor for how we should raise boys. Some boys are shackled in their mother's strong embrace, and that only forces them to rebel in anger and frustration. Many more boys are simply abandoned emotionally -- they're forced to defend for themselves, and confused and alone they often turn to anger and violence, because that's the socially acceptable path.\\"Raising Cain\\" implores parents and teachers to equip young boys with an emotional language that they can use to be more aware of themselves and to confront their mixed feelings. Teachers should be just as nurturing and as sensitive towards boys as they are towards girls, and parents ought to give each boy room to discover his own individuality while always setting strong guidelines to ensure that he also develops socially. Above all, boys should be encouraged to communicate, and while it's true that boys aren't as verbally gifted as girls it's even more true that adults don't make any effort to see the world from the perspective of boys.\\"Raising Cain\\" is an extremely liberal tract in an increasingly conservative America, and will provoke parents and educators into questioning the status quo of a sports-dominated culture, test-oriented schools, and a very competitive goal-oriented workplace."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Reading about my \\"species\\" emotional development was a wonderful experience. I identified with almost every issue, particularly the commentary about drinking as a substitute for emotional fulfillment. This book is an eye opener.

In addition, I recommend Emotional Intelligence to understand the neurological basis of emotions."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I found this book at the perfect time, as our son is almost 10 years old, and we are just beginning to see the changes occuring in his relationships and emotions. Reading this book has been extremely helpful in my understanding of what in going on in his world, so I can react in a more sensible way. It has also given me a better understanding of my husband. I generally turn away from psychology books. But I found this one very true to life, and applicable in many ways. I would love to see it circulated throughout PTO's of middle schools across the country."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"My husband and I love this book. In the beginning, it was only I who would take the time to read it. However, when we went in to see teachers during parent/teacher conferences, each one recommended this book for our three boys. Finally, my husband decided to take their opinions to heart and read the book. I was amazed that he finished and actually showed great respect for the work and in-depth details.It has helped us a great deal, not only with each son, but with each other as well. In fact, my husband pointed out that he felt the same way as some of the kids in the examples.I am very much a supporter of this incredible book and cannot say enough reasons why parents of boys should buy it and read it. If you are a mom, or a dad, who can't seem to understand why your boys are doing or saying what they do, buy this book.We also have two daughters and to be perfectly blunt, this book is not just for boys. There's often times when things will click for on the behavior of our daughters -- maybe it's because they get so much behavior habits from their brothers, two of which are step-brothers. One of the things we have enjoyed is finding out how important it is for father's to be involved the right way. This means interacting with the kids on levels that are effective for them. Also recommended: Mommy CEO. This book shares levels of importance in treating kids as individuals and fitting into their lives for a positive experience with each one. Both books are extremely reader friendly and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"An excellent reference book for situations and problems that arise.

Recently divorced with 12 and 15 year old sons, I wanted to take inventory of their emotional well being after the seperation. This book has completely changed some of the views that I had about the way I should deal with my boys. It also opened my eyes to the effect that everyday life challenges has on young boys and teens.

My homeschool group is reading/discussing it right now and it has been eye opening to say the least.

If your a man or mother, you must take the time to read this book it will hep you raise better boys or understand the male culture better."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This extraordinarily insightful, easy to read book will benefit any parent or teacher of boys. As I read it the first time, I was amazed by how honestly, truthfully and succinctly it described the challenges boys face. As the father of two boys, this is my bible. It is a reminder to celebrate the spirit of young boys and watch out for ways in which that exuberance can be stifled by parents, schools and other children. Armed with the knowledge contained in this essential guide to raising boys, parents will have greatly improved their chances of having a close connection with their developing boy and ending up with a man who is emotionally whole.This book may be of most value to women because it gives them insight into the lives of boys (and men) that are not otherwise available to women. For all the love my wife feels for our sons, she -- like all women -- has no first-hand knowledge of what it is like to be a boy. Instead, she (mis)interpreted our sons' behavior in light of her experience growing up as a girl, and by comparing it to stereotypes about boy behavior. This remarkable book gives women a unique opportunity to stand in their son's shoes and see the world from their perspective.Raising Cain merits the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Being the mother of 2 boys, I could relate to the situations presented and saw alot of the characteristics in my own teenagers.

Michael Thompson and Daniel Kindlon have done their research and work with boys. This book is timely, informative, and vitally important.

I find I am looking at my own sons in a different way and thinking more carefully about some of the attitudes and values they are receiving from me and the culture at large.

The premise of this book, that we should pay more attention to the emotional lives of boys, isn't exactly a trailblazer, considering the degree to which we've re-evaluated sex roles in recent decades. I can't help thinking that the book was devised to fill an available market niche left open by &quot;Reviving Ophelia.&quot; The &quot;product&quot; is a rambling series of pop psych anecdotes (I sometimes ask, is there any other kind of psych?)and patronizing sermons from the all too male authors.

I was somewhat disappointed in the content."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Raising Cain is an excellent book that will provide much insight for parents, especially women, into the painful world of boyhood. The authors both worked at boys' schools for a period of time and developed the book out of their practices'.The book depicts the emotionally stunting messages that boys receive about being told to 'grow up' 'toughen up' 'get over it' and 'don't be a sissy'. The authors provide real evidence and example about how caustic these messages are to the souls of boys.One of my favorite parts of the books deals with the tough time that boys have in school, just for being little boys. The authors speak about the fact that boys do not develop an attention span as early as girls, and that they should not be punished for it. Also mentioned is that little boys are high energy creatures who need to have more effort placed into directing their energies, rather than being punished for fidgeting. I especially like the depictions of classes that start with recess, allowing boys to work off some energy so they can sit and concentrate.One thing that I did miss in this book was a full discussion of the fact that so many boys are suffering with no father in their home, many with no father in their life, leaving only what they see around them and on television to be their male role models. Because research has proven that the most important influence in a child's life is the same-sex parent, I think this was a bit of a strong omission. Perhaps, though, the authors felt that the subject was too complicated or intense to fit into the whole of the book. At any rate, what the book does contain is excellent and should be read by everyone, because everyone (even those who are single and/or childless) will be affected by the way that boys are brought up in our culture, whether you like it or not."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"After the birth of my first son I came upon this book when looking for \\"How To...\\" parenting books. I discovered a book that had much more depth than the average parenting manual. The authors weave their years of experience in the psychology of boys with true stories from years of counseling them. The most striking impression I had about Raising Cain was how well written it was. All the usual tedium that can accompany self-help books is lost with both form and content."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys co-authored by Teresa Barker. Two of the country's leading child psychologists share their experiences of working with boys &amp; their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting - sad, afraid, angry &amp; silent. Statistics point to an alarming number of boys at risk for suicide, alcohol &amp; drug abuse, violence &amp; loneliness.Kindlon &amp; Thompson set out to answer this crucial question: What do boys need that they're not getting? Through moving case studies &amp; up-to-date research, Raising Cain portrays generations of boys systematically herded away from their emotional life by adults &amp; the peer &quot;culture of cruelty&quot;; receiving little encouragement to examine their emotions &amp; develop qualities like compassion, sensitivity &amp; affection.In Fathers and Sons: A Legacy of Desire and Distance, Kindlon &amp; Thompson open up the sad, sad wound of unrequited love. When a grown man cries in therapy, it is almost always about his father &amp; his yearning for his father's love. Into that yearning has been fed decades of anger, sadness &amp; shame.Why is it that fathers describe their sons as never listening, not understanding while their sons describe their fathers in similar terms of discontent? Why do sons rub their fathers the wrong way? Can fathers &amp; sons have a close, loving relationship? How can they close the emotional gulf? Kindlon &amp; Thompson have some good ideas, read'em &amp; weep!Kindlon &amp; Thompson identify the social &amp; emotional challenges boys must encounter in school &amp; the streets &amp; show us how we can help boys cultivate emotional awareness, empathy &amp; health. They offer us seven foundations of parenting, teaching &amp; creating communities that respect &amp; cultivate the inner life of boys. Read'em &amp; weep, then practise them!Raising Cain is aptly titled for it is one tough book to read! There were portions I dreaded! I do, however, recommend it heartily even if you have no boys in your life - you must have brothers, husbands, co-workers, employees &amp; bosses &amp; this book goes a long, long way to explaining why modern people of the male gender behave the way they do.

After witnessing the impatience and lack of understanding some teachers have shown to my son and his friends, I can definitely see the difference between those who have raised their own boys and those who have not This book could really help to open their eyes and, hopefully, touch their hearts to be a little bit more understanding ."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I found this book very helpful.The author sometimes oversimplifies some concepts, such as how aggression can have subconscious reasons that need to be teased out and that parents are sometimes not strong enough or don't have healthy enough self-concepts to have that discussion with a boy, since there may be a role the parent(s) have played in developing that aggression that he/she needs to be open to hearing. But as a basic introduction to how our society often neglects how emotional intelligence and relational skills are an important aspect of male development and in providing suggestions for correcting this, the book is great.Getting boys access to their emotional lives and teaching them relational skills promises to give them much happier, more successful lives and relationships with wives and children. I suspect they will have more successful careers, and their children of both sexes will be more successful as well.I feel so sad for boys who don't get this kind of reinforcement and respect; I suspect that these are the \\"boys left behind\\" who are having trouble in school, the boys who are now alone and childless as adults, the boys who as adults are now causing a lot of polarization and intense conflict in our political system. They deserved better. I sure wish they'd take responsibility for their emotional health, however; these things can be improved in adulthood."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"There is a great deal of helpful information for understanding boys. I am an only child and had very little experience with boys growing up, finding them almost entirely annoying. But with two sons, I am forced to try and figure these creatures out in order to care for them. The authors have such genuine affection for boys and sincere desire to see boys grow into good men, that despite all the scary risks they discuss for boys in our society, you leave the book feeling positive about boys yourself and understanding at least a little about what makes them tick.The book doesn't focus on early years and I highly recommend The Little Boy Book for some sympathy and insight regarding raising young boys.Some other things this book doesn't cover include how not to go crazy with a house full of boys breaking everything in sight and screaming all day long. It also doesn't talk at all about brothers and focuses on dealing with one boy alone. Trouble is, one boy alone is pretty easy to handle. When boys have a playmate/conspirator/brother, things very quickly turn into Lord of the Flies. I've seen this behavior in grown up males too, so I think that this represents a serious lack in the book (and all of the other boy books I've been able to find) and wish the authors would write about Raising Cain AND Able so that they don't murder each other or send their mother to the looney bin."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book was such a great asset and I totally agree with the comment on the cover that it is a must read for anyone that interacts with boys. Actually, I felt that it really gave me a better understanding of men in general too! Not so much a \\"parenting book\\" as a look inside boys heads to see why they are the way they are and how to deal. Great for people who are trying to figure out what's going on with an already \\"troubled\\" boy or for people (like me) with a younger boy who want be proactive before they fall into making the common mistakes. A little slow and \\"text book\\" like at times, but the case studies break it up and keep it interesting overall."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I obtained the book as a result of watching the PBS special with the same name.http://www.pbs.org/opb/raisingcain/Frankly the documentary bothered and worried me, are things really that bad out in the world with boys growing up?The book is, gratefully, not nearly as dark and foreboding at the TV. But it is worrysome, has this culture made it nearly impossible for a boy to grow into a mature responsible man?The book doesn't answer this question for me, but has a level of hopefulness and optimism that i can respect and even grasp onto.About 1/2 the book, paragraph wise, are interviews with people, partly boys in therapy, partly men looking back on their childhood/boyhood/young adult years and seeing how the current man is a product of those years and how understanding what happened to him can heal and grow his personality. The book is mostly descriptive with the last chapter prescriptive, although there are lots of good \\"how-to-do\\" ideas spread throughout. However it does not strive to tell people what to do, but is cautiously trying to lead the reader into the authors' understandings without being preaching or pushy. Much like the way they handle their interviews.KIds don't come with instruction manuals, unfortunately. I joke that the first kid is a throw away, we messed up so many times with him that it is a wonder that he turned out so well. I suspect most parents would appreciate reading this book BEFORE they raise sons, not long afterwards as i am doing. Sadly, i could have used both his insights and his gentle attitude of respect for boys' emotional growth as we raised our sons. Maybe giving this to a friend of yours who just had a first son is the best recommendation i can make.Now i am not trained in this, nor related fields of psychology. I do not have the reference points to tell you that this is the best book, just an idea that it is a good book. I can't tell you that he is right on everything, but he is on the right track. The emotional problems with boys are serious, our culture both in the schools, small young male groups, and the general society is pushing boys and men towards holding their emotions inside and not expressing them and using the experiences to mature and grow. But the book doesn't offer big solutions to these problems, but pretty much sticks to one boy at a time, one small victory after another approach. The amazing thing is that these two men are still so positive, so energetic after seeing these things up close for more than 15 years a piece. Little burnout detected here, a challenge to continue and to justify their optimism to us as well as a kudos to each, puts them into the best of their field, i'm sure.It's an easy, fun, quick read, i usually read pretty dense difficult stuff and appreciate the opportunity to practice my speed reading. I don't see that any chapter is better example than any other, although the last chapter is a must read for recommendations for how to approach raising your own kids. So my recommendation is just to open the book and read 10 pages or so for flavor then turn to the last chapter \\"Raising Cain\\" and read it entirely, then decide whether or not the book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"When we talk about boys going through their childhood; we think of things like baseball, football, Power Rangers, and action figures. Boys seem as though you just wind them up and they go. When they fall over; you pick them up, dust them off and they go again. Although we wish that boys were deciphered this easily we all know that it is untrue. In actuality, boys are extremely complex. Boys have huge caverns of emotions within their chests, and for the most part, these caverns go untapped. Without delving into these untapped emotions of boys, we leave the boys very vulnerable. The book, Raising Cain, by Dan Kindlon Ph.D. and Michael Thompson Ph.D. raises many questions and reaches significant conclusions pertaining to the protection of the emotional lives of boys. Raising Cain, attacks many issues that face boys. It helps us realize that in order to begin comprehension of boys, you must see inside the emotions those boys contain. Through scenarios in early education, discipline, father and son connection, mother and son connection, depression, suicide, addictions, love, anger and even violence Raising Cain, opens some of these supposedly forbidden chambers of a boy to caring eyes. All this in hopes to create healthier, more stable boys in the future. Through depictions of their own vast experiences with school-aged boys, Kindlon and Thompson have done a superb job in unraveling the internal thoughts and emotions boys hold. In conclusion, Raising Cain, not only helps us better understand boys, also being a young man myself, helped me question and affirm certain things pertaining to emotions that I have in my life. I would implore anyone who has concerns for boys to read this book. The lives of boys are intricate and fragile, and unless their emotions are handled with care they will break!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"When I got engaged last year I became an uncle to two small boys, now ages 4 1/2 and 2. I thought this book would be useful to better understand them as they grow older. Raising Cain presents thoughtful, often moving, guidance (anecdotal and theoretical) on a dozen or so topics that I think can help caregivers on a number of levels.Many of the somewhat negative reviews here compare this book to similar ones. This was my first book on the topic and I thought it a great overview, both educational and entertaining.The stories about boys in Raising Cain often end abruptly, leaving you wondering if or how a particular situation was resolved. At first this annoyed me, but I came to think it was a good approach since the challenges of raising a boy are rarely solved with a quick fix. The authors suggest that the effort to raise a boy is ongoing, frought with uncertainty and requiring ongoing love and persistence.Finally, many of the anecdotes in Raising Cain reminded me of some of the challenges of my own boyhood, which gave me many useful starting points for reflection."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As much as the media, advertisers, movies, schools, and society in general has been relentlessly beating down males over the past few decades, I highly recommend this book if you have a young boy in your home.

In truth, it was a difficult read and as both a father and a son many of the insights in the book brought me to tears. It does not give you the answers but rather astutely articulates many of the problems of raising a boy in our modern society. The answers come in recognizing the errors we make in raising them and in that awareness we are able to self correct. I recently read a copy of this I checked out from the library and am now purchasing one to keep with me, and read briefly from, every day to inspire me to demand more from myself as a father."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I am lucky to have 2 wonderful boys 4 and 1 they are the age right know where they pick up everything good, bad.

This book was highly recommended and I highly recommend it not only if you have boys but if you are having issues in your marriage understanding the male perspective."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"A must read... anyone who has boys should read this, it gives you a better understanding \\"emotionally\\" and Amazon is the place to buy! Thanks..."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book has been a tremendous help, even when I had no idea I needed any help. I am so grateful I have this book in my home to refer to as I embrace the jouurney of raising my three sons!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Not only did I learn about some of the things that my son will go through as he grows up, I learned a lot about his dad and other boys in my life. I think this had to be one of the most informative books about boys and young men I have ever read."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"My son is 9 months old and I am so happy I read this book before he started school or started having friends. I don't know anyone that doesn't want to be the best parent they can be and I think this book is a great tool. I will keep this book to re-read and refer back to for many years to come. I honestly think this book helped me evaluate alot of my thoughts and plans in my future parenting."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Several of the positive commenters below have summarized the book very well so I won't repeat. I have read some other books on raising boys (I have twin sons), good ones by Michael Gurian,The Wonder of Boysand others. This one ranks up there as among the best, if not the best, for it's wealth of supportive and relevant experiences detailed by the authors who are clearly experts in this field."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I read this book after reading \\"Reviving Ophelia\\", \\"Real Boys\\", and \\"Trouble with Boys\\". \\"Raising Cain\\" is well written and based on hands-on experience as well as an admirable amount of research. I would say it's the best of the four books I just mentioned. I had wanted information about this topic because I'm a former teacher who would consistently be assigned what were considered \\"difficult students\\" altough I was not a special education teacher. I wish someone had recommended this book to me back then.Happily, I stumbled on some of the methods of handling boys' active behavior from trial and error. Also,I admired the fact that neither author put down any other texts about raising children and adolescents(as did two of the other authors). The tone was very professional but highly readable."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book is fantastic and written by 2 men who really know what they are talking about. It is written with clarity and in depth knowledge about boys regarding every aspect of their life. This is something that we all need to be aware of when raising boys and dealing with boys. Emotional illiteracy is widespread in our culture because of the way we socialise boys, as we don't allow them to get in touch with their feelings. This disconnection from the inner world causes much pain to him, and people who are close to him, as they often are unable to connect deeply with others, or to be truly empathetic. I applaud the men who wrote this book and I am at present working with a male client who is getting a great deal from the concepts discussed therein. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"When we talk about boys going through their childhood; we think of things like baseball, football, Power Rangers, and action figures. Boys seem as though you just wind them up and they go. When they fall over; you pick them up, dust them off and they go again. Although we wish that boys were deciphered this easily we all know that it is untrue. In actuality, boys are extremely complex. Boys have huge caverns of emotions within their chests, and for the most part, these caverns go untapped. Without delving into these untapped emotions of boys, we leave the boys very vulnerable. The book, Raising Cain, by Dan Kindlon Ph.D. and Michael Thompson Ph.D. raises many questions and reaches significant conclusions pertaining to the protection of the emotional lives of boys. Raising Cain, attacks many issues that face boys. It helps us realize that in order to begin comprehension of boys, you must see inside the emotions those boys contain. Through scenarios in early education, discipline, father and son connection, mother and son connection, depression, suicide, addictions, love, anger and even violence Raising Cain, opens some of these supposedly forbidden chambers of a boy to caring eyes. All this in hopes to create healthier, more stable boys in the future. Through depictions of their own vast experiences with school-aged boys, Kindlon and Thompson have done a superb job in unraveling the internal thoughts and emotions boys hold. In conclusion, Raising Cain, not only helps us better understand boys, also being a young man myself, helped me question and affirm certain things pertaining to emotions that I have in my life. I would implore anyone who has concerns for boys to read this book. The lives of boys are intricate and fragile, and unless their emotions are handled with care they will break!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I must say this book really shook me up. As a mother of 2 boys, I was upset to read about how cruel boys can be to each other as teens, and by how closed off they become from their emotions. The book did a wonderful job of pointing out the scary parts of raising boys, but in my opinion anyway did not do enough to answer the question they raise---how can we prevent all this awful stuff from happening? The advice given is what most parents would try to do anyway---keep the lines of communication open, be there but don't be smothering, etc. I would like to know more about how specifically I can help my sons weather childhood and grow into happy adults. After reading this book, I think one could get the impulse the only good way to do this is keep them home at all times away from all the cruelty!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"There has never been a book that has given me so much insight to a little boys world...how they think and how the world around them encourages them to be and think. I look back at my 14 year old son and wish that I had this book 10 years ago which would allow me to better deal with his emotional well-being. I had read Reviving Ophelia to help deal with my 15 year daughter but it did not have the dramatic effect this book had on dealing with my son. It has even helped me understand my husband better and how some of the men in my life were not emotionally healthy which could have saved me lots of time and tears. This book might even help women recognize emotionally healthy men. The examples in this book are so very real and helped me realize that boys are really never given a chance to experience feelings but rather forced to find a solution. I have recommended this to all my friends raising sons, teaching boys or anyone that interacts with children. This is the best self-help book I have ever picked up and will probably refer back to it millions of times before my son leaves for college and on to healthy relationships. Thanks to the authors for doing a beautiful job of tugging at my heart and helping me be a better mother!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book is a must-read for anyone raising a boy -- ESPECIALLY fathers. I'm so glad that I've read this book while my son is still an infant.Not only have I learned a lot about what it will be like for my son growing up, but it helped me connect to myself. So much of this book brought me back to events in my own childhood and helped me understand more about myself. There are so many things that I wouldn't have realized had I not read this book.Having read this book I feel much better prepared to be an understanding and emotionally nurturing father to my son. This will be a gift that I will give to any of my friends who are currently raising a young boy or are about to have a boy."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I had finished reading it! It contains great case studies that are helpful in understanding the impact that teasing has on young boys, for example. As a mom, the material also helped me to better understand some things that are considered &quot;normal&quot; for boys and not be so quick to overreact. It covers the development of boys from age 5 through the teenage years. I cannot say enough about this book and I would STRONGLY recommend it to all parents."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"It's a pretty good book, but nothing new is said. If you already knowthat ALL children (not just boys and not just girls) are at risk intoday's classrooms and schools; that physical punishment only inspires more bad behavior and, eventually, breeds violence; and that gender differences need only be respected not rigidly adhered to (i.e., respect a young man's tendency to &quot;hold back&quot; a little but don't adminish him for crying over the death of his goldfish, the frustration of learning a new subject, his failure to make the team, etc.), then you don't really &quot;need&quot; Raising Cain.If, on the other hand, your sons, nephews, male students, etc. seem indecipherable to you, strike you as requiring a &quot;good spanking&quot; to &quot;shape them up,&quot; or appear to be &quot;little crybabies,&quot; you need more than Raising Cain or any other book can give you.Do you see where I'm going with this? Parents on the &quot;right course&quot; with their kids already instinctively know much of what is presented in this book. They know because they've lived it. Anyone leading an examined life can see the potential &quot;hot issues&quot; in their parenting styles and will adapt them based on the individual needs of their children -- boys or girls.In short, savvy parents (teachers, relatives, etc.) will find a few gems in this book. They will be validated in methods they are already employing in their interactions with the kids they know. They will be reminded that all children are influenced by the adults in their lives. So, if you need gems, validation, or reminders, read Raising Cain. It is cleanly written, heartfelt, and laden with &quot;cases.&quot; If you're feeling pretty confident, though, pick up a good children's book -- like Holes, A Long Way from Chicago, or The Phantom Tollbooth -- and go read to the kids. They'll love it."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Raising Cain is a powerful and enlightening book co-authored by two prominent child psychologists who set out to comprehensively explore the way boys suffer and what causes them emotional pain. Not surprisingly, the book is written for parents of boys as well as teachers, but it also has overwhelming relevance for anyone who desires to understand why many boys act the way they do-and what we can do to help them with their emotional struggles.The salient issue interlaced throughout the book is the need for boys to obtain an emotional vocabulary and emotional literacy that affords them the capability to read and understand their own emotions, as well as others. Thompson and Kindlon repeatedly point out that not only are many boys never encouraged to be emotional, but also, they are taught to suppress such feelings by a culture that expects them to be \\"manly\\". It is difficult to argue with that observation. The \\"emotional miseducation\\" of boys begins early, at home and in the classroom, and there is a need to provide the proper \\"emotional steering\\" for boys so that they understand that expressing emotion is indeed normal and okay to do.Among the various solutions Thompson and Kindlon suggest to help boys develop strong, flexible, emotional lives is to give them permission to have an internal life, full of unbridled emotion. We need to help them to develop and to obtain an emotional vocabulary to better understand themselves and to communicate more effectively with others. Ultimately, we need to let boys know that there are numerous ways to \\"be a man\\".Raising Cain is an extremely rich work, full of poignant case studies and examples of boys today that evoked memories-some sad and regretful-of my own adolescence. As a parent of two young boys and an aspiring middle school teacher, this book will be referred to again and again as various developmental issues surface in the boys that I encounter. It is an invaluable reminder of the importance of cultivating emotional awareness in boys and what we can do as adults to help foster that growth. I would even suggest that it be required reading for any educator who has even one boy in his or her classroom. The insight presented within Raising Cain as well as the intervention suggestions posed by Thompson and Kindlon offers the reader with the tools to make a positive difference in a boy's life."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I wish this book had been available to me when my three sons were boys, when I was coaching them and other boys, interacting with their male friends in social situations; also when I was teaching and coaching in two New England boarding schools over a period of 13 years. I am grateful for the book now as I interact with my young grandsons. The authors suggest how to protect \\"the emotional life of boys\\" and their counsel is invaluable.Most parents are well-prepared to provide food, shelter, and clothing to their children. Most grandparents do all they can to provide material assistance to their sons and daughters who are parents. My guess (only a guess) is that many parents and grandparents do not adequately understand a child's psyche...especially that of a boy. Even if so inclined, who has the time to read all the books and articles on the subject? Who knows which to read?Please understand that I do not consider myself qualified to evaluate the expertise of this book's authors. I have no idea which other books are also worthy of your consideration. But I can recommend this book highly to those who have recurring contact with boys. They include parents and grandparents, of course, but also other relatives, school administrators, classroom teachers, coaches, members of the clergy, adult leaders in organizations for boys (eg Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts), and healthcare providers.The book is well-written. The material is effectively organized. The content is mercifully free of elaborate theories and medical jargon. For those interested in this important subject (ie &quot;protecting the emotional life of boys\\"), here is a single-volume source of useful information and practical advice."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Kindlon and Thompson have written an insightful study of what's going wrong (and right) with our boys. With middle-school shootings and spouse abuse headlining our newspapers, this is a must-read for every parent and teacher. Besides having academic credentials, the authors have much experience as fathers and as counselors in private practice and in schools. The book is peppered with lively anecdotes to illustrate their theories.Because I had no brothers and therefore not much experience with boy-psychology, this book taught me a great deal about the culture of cruelty practiced by adolescent boys and why boys often brag, misuse girls, drink, and tease. The authors are not mere alarmists, however. They encourage us to provide safe, nurturing homes and classrooms for our boys, to help them understand feelings other than anger, resulting in sensitive, strong, and caring men."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I don't know why I bought this book - I hate books filled with what I call \\"psycho-babble\\". But lucky for me, this book is not one of them, and I am very grateful I did buy it. I am the mother of a little boy, and I just wanted to be a good mother to my son, since I realize that boys really do think and react differently than girls. I hoped this book would provide insight into my sons thinking that I could use to relate to him and help him through the hurdles he would face as he grew up. It did that - and more. It was an easy, fast read. I really couldn't put it down once I started to read it. It is written in a very conversational tone, as if the authors were just chit-chatting about their experiences with boys, not lecturing me on how and what and when to do certain things. I really felt that I learned a LOT about the psyche of a boy, and better understand how boys think and why they react certain ways. But most surprisingly, I found myself learning a lot about my HUSBAND from this book. I finally got some real insight into some of his more mysterious (to me) behaviors and thinking processes. This book was a revelation. And when I was done, I made my husband read it, and he, too, was stunned and amazed at the insight shown in this book. I highly recommend this book if you have a son - or if you are married to one - or if you are a son yourself."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As a mother and a psychotherapist I am extremely critical of the mountains of books available to parents - This is one of the best out there...Every parent should read it.

The suggestions and practice ring true and have enriched our family life. The book is robust with academic insight. That said, I always recommend starting with the last chapter -- since it outlines the main points and tips. (Busy parents just want to get to the tutorial.) Then, if you need more, start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"There is no way a woman can know what it's like to be a boy. This book give us an inside look. It explains a lot about why boys act the way they do and how hard it is for some women to accept them for what they are. My grown son recommended it, saying he could relate to it. So, this book is for both the men (who were boys once) and the women who give birth to the boys and marry the men. I think it should be required reading for everyone who deals with boys."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I've read many books about raising boys.

I can't say I agree with all of it, but that's to be expected. I think it brings up some interesting topics, worth reading. I've also read \\"Reviving Ophelia, saving the adolescent selves of girls\\" which is often set as a companion to this book....But it is TERRIBLE. Very loopy and borderline absurd, nothing like Raising Cain."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I was hooked by the title and I didn't stop until I was finished. It broke my heart to read some of the case studies because I was reading about my son. I look at him and wonder how in the world I could have missed his signs for help. I have a much better understanding of where he is coming from and with the proper help, help him build his self-esteme back up and to teach stronger anger management skills and that it's O.K. to be who he is. He is a wonderful, beautiful and tender hearted young boy and he has so much to offer and I want to give him that chance. I think every teacher and parent should read this book."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As a woman who had no brothers and am the mother of a 5 year old boy, with another on the way, I read this to hopefully learn something about boys. And did I! I was horrified to see that I myself had already started miseducating my son. Thanks for giving me your insights into the minds of troubled boys, and your suggestions to help prevent it."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I cannot praise this film highly enough. I've rented it twice from Netflix and am now buying my own copy. The first time the boyfriend and I tried watching it, it took us about 4 hours because we kept hitting pause and having long discussions about different scenes. The next time, we invited his 16 year old son to join us, and got an entirely different perspective on everything we saw.The differences in the needs and learning styles of males and females are not a bad thing. Uniqueness is a wonderful thing to embrace and appreciate. Trying to force every person and every student to behave and react identically to every situation is causing a broad variety of problems in our society.In short, this documentary is illuminating, disturbing, and essential. Everyone, male and female, young and old, should watch and discuss."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"We've all been raised to assume that we're living in a patriarchy, but patriarchy only begins when childhood ends; Before that, every person on Earth lives in a matriarchy. The percentage of men in elementary school classrooms and in daycare centers is about the same as the percentage of women in senate chambers and in corporate board rooms (and the one will never change without the other). The first fifteen years or so of our lives are spent almost exclusively in a female world, and the affect on boys is disastrous.&quot;Raising Cain&quot; is nothing less than a plea to the matriarchal half of our society (and the men who relinquish to them) to discard the catastrophic dogma that boys should be dealt with as if they were substandard girls. If you read this as a woman, be prepared to discover that forty years of Feminism was only half the story. If you read this as a man, be prepared to cry for your father, for your brothers, for your sons, for yourself."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Raising Cain is about the emotional life of boys written by two psychologists with a background in counseling boys who appeared to be troubled, angry, etc. This book can be used by about everybody whether it's home, school, the playground, park, family gatherings, etc.But I was surprised when I was reading about a 48 year old man who had such terrible school memories that he didn't want to attend parents' school at his sons' school. He felt 8 and not 48. I was never a good student in school and I was bored most of the time by redundancy and the lack of creativity in the classroom. My mind dozed off most of the time out of sheer boredom.This book can also appeal to the emotional life of girls as well. As a child, I dreaded the school experience because it was repetitive, boring, and simply uninspiring. I was better at writing stories or using my imagination. My problem was that I was limited. The test scores placed me in average setting so I believed that I was just going to be only average. I didn't know that it didn't always have to be that way.But children are easily scarred, male or female, I know I was. This book makes me realize that yes the teachers may not have understood at the time about the effects of being scolded, lectured, or humiliated to a young child's mind. As somebody in education, I am a lot more aware of this and I am careful in the classroom regarding situations.I am thankful to the two authors who compiled a book about boys to help us educators understand and practice some sensitivity regarding their behavior. A teacher might not realize their power until it's too late.I wished that there was a book about the emotional life of girls. This book has helped explain the male gender better than I could have imagined about their ties to parents and other children. Now a book about the girls."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"i had to read this book for a psycho adolesences class and i really enjoyed reading it!"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Every parent, teacher, youth sports coach, and general public who interact with boys should read this book.

I had to read a book for a college psychology course and this was on the book list. The book is formatted in a very interesting way. The writers do not simply give you a buch of information about boys and their thoughts. They focuss on experiences and stories they have encountered with boys. They then use these experiences and interperet them and relate them to what they see as an area of concern for boys. Things they consider is emotions, violence, relationships, and boy sterotyping. Because it is almost a collection of stories the book continues to be very comelling. Like the cover states I would say that this is \\"...required reading for anyone raisin-or educating-a boy\\""},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"It's surprising how little we know of boys--even if you were one. This book can fix that.\\"If we teach our sons to honor and value their emotional lives, if we can give boys an emotional vocabulary and the encouragement to use it, they will unclench their hearts.\\" This seems to be the crux of Raising Cain.I work at a boys' home. As part of training, I read six youth-help books in one week. After a while, the genre all starts to sound the same, yet Raising Cain stands apart from the rest. It is the best I've read on the subject.The authors are two male psychologists, so their perspective is both academic and practical. The book is full of case examples. The writing style is academic yet smooth enough for the layman. (Smart, but not overly smart.)If you only read one chapter, the final \\"What Boys Need\\" is best. Yet fathers, teachers, youth leaders--anyone helping boys move into the \\"Big Impossible\\" (the authors' reference for manhood) will find the entire book valuable."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This is the best book I've seen about raising boys.

It helped me understand things I have always found baffling in both boys and men."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"My son is not yet two, but this book opened my eyes to the challenges he will have to face as he travels the journey to adulthood. I cannot recommend this book enough to parents of boys; for moms so they understand the psyche of boys, and for dads who struggled through the &quot;culture of cruelty&quot; and &quot;emotional isolation&quot; themselves. They can learn how to help their sons through it so that they can become strong, noble, empathetic men.

Being a feminist, I had to keep reminding myself that when we take care of our boys we also take care of our girls. It has transformed the ways I look at my son and also my husband and other men in my life.Along with Reviving Ophelia it should be mandatory reading for all parents!(...)"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As a mom who had no brothers to help me understand my son, the thing I love about this book is that it helps me understand what's so great about boys (and men).The authors have such a positive (and thoroughly realistic) view of the energy, vulnerability, risk-taking, and even mischief, of boys. They show how vast the impact of parents, teachers, and peers can be on boys who are wrestling with the contradictions of adolescence: Boys must not be \\"sissy,\\" but they still need love and support. Boys must not be \\"obnoxious\\" in the classroom, but they still need to stretch their limbs more than school recesses allow. Boys must not be \\"disrespectful\\" to authority, but they are driven to achieve autonomy.There are quite a few examples of teen boys who are getting in trouble of various kinds, and the authors offer poignant insight from the boys themselves about the feelings that drive the trouble-making. But the book also speaks to how we raise infant, preschool, and pre-teen boys.The authors also point out that many boys often receive very little emotional education from their parents or other authorities. One anecdote they tell is of a scary situation in which Michael, one of the authors, was tempted to follow the cultural \\"script\\" and say to his son, \\"You weren't scared, were you, buddy?\\" Instead he chose to say, \\"That was a little scary, wasn't it?\\" To which his son replied, \\"No, Dad, that was very scary.\\" Yes, boys have feelings - and that does not make them wimps. After all, courage is action in the face of fear!In the companion chapters on the roles of fathers and mothers, this book gently explores what parenting can achieve at its best. These chapters are exceptionally approachable, and they offer specific suggestions for parents who want to better relate to their boys. The authors talk about how mothers nurture children's sense of self, while fathers challenge their kids to try new things. Fathers face a unique challenge in trying to treat their sons as young men without dropping into the male pattern of competition or jockeying for power. But when fathers offer acceptance and challenge simultaneously, sons are free to explore and excel. And mothers, ideally, offer their sons a \\"home base\\" of security and love, bountiful in empathy and emotional insight.Most of all, the authors continually challenge parents and teachers to help boys figure things out. Boys need encouragement, emotional insight, and freedom to explore as they reach for maturity. Particularly in its anecdotes (some from school and some from home contexts), this book gives so many examples of great ways to help boys through their rites of passage.I feel better able to raise my son in a healthy manner after reading this insightful book.PS - If you have ever wondered whether talking about feelings is the \\"psychologist's answer\\" to problems, rather than a real man's answer to problems, read this book. The authors actually manage to strike a balance between the need to be \\"manly\\" and the need for boys to express a greater range of feelings. They express respect for the times that men choose to be silent. And they explain why sometimes men might like to be free to say more."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I cried when I read about the types of pain that boys and men feel, but don't usually express easily or as naturally as women do. This book gave me insight into why some of the adult males in my life have acted as they have and it helped me to want to help another generation NOT be stifled emotionally.The book also encouraged me as a former single parent, which I had been for most of my son's life. My son is 15 now and although I've remarried recently, my son and I are still close and he knows that I will ALWAYS be here for him to unload on. I'm eternally grateful to God that the authors helped me to know that despite the mistakes I've made with my son, I also have done some things right: he still loves me and still needs me in many ways. And he always will."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I bought this book because of the troubles I have with my 17 year old son. None of the counseling I have received could even compare with the information I gathered from this book! I have 3 sons, my youngest is 22 months. This book will change the way I raise all of them, and gave me much greater insight into my oldest's life. I only wish I had realized many of the things this book clearly points out many years back. I could have avoided the confrontational situation I am in today with my teenager. I could not put this book down. So much of my boys lives came clearly into view after reading the stories of so many boys, and their many situations. Many will hit home with you. I wish EVERYONE had to read this book, it would change the way society treats our boys. Many of the problems we see today with boys we bring on ourselves, by our lack of understanding of the differences between boys and girls. Reading this book will change the perception of &quot;it's a man's world&quot;. I am enlightened and saddened at the knowledge this book provides."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I could easily rate this book 6 stars or more and cannot say enough about all the helpful insights it has to offer. I'm the mom of an 8 year old boy who's life is about to improve because I read this book. I consider myself an okay mother, but I am always open-minded about improving my parenting skills. The information I've learned by reading &quot;Raising Cain&quot; is incredibly enlightening, and so valuable to me I feel like I hit the jackpot. Anyone wanting to parent their son(s) better needs to read this book. I want to buy copies of it to pass around to a number of friends of mine who are raising boys, as well as several teachers I know who would appreciate this insightful material to help them in their classrooms. I've gotten involved with my son's school as a Parent-Teacher Organization &quot;mom&quot; not only to touch base with my son more often but also to reach out to students who might not get as much attention as they need in over-crowded classrooms, and this book is proving to be a valuable tool filled with information to help me be more effective in understanding the boys whose lives I can hopefully influence for the better."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson have written a crucial book that is pivotal for the emotional well being for boys, especially teen age boys. Their prescription of emotional freedom over emotional tyranny and boys having to cover up their emotions which leads far too many into isolation and even suicide, makes this book beyond crucial.Anyone who is raising a male needs to really understand the emotions that males have, and they need to be taught how to un-do old stereotypical cultural views that trap boys in an isolated emotional prison. Males must receive equal value placed on how they feel, much more so than acting tough to prove that they are strong.Inner strength comes from honesty. When boys know they can be honest with their feelings, emotional and mental strength are the result.I avidly urge parents, grand parents, teachers and all caregivers of males to read this book. What you learn, and your approach to raising the boy in your life can very well wind up saving his life as a result. This book is THAT crucial!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence and Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book is valuable for everyone who has ever been or known a boy or man (okay, everyone). It addresses the needs and experiences of boys and men and how they relate to emotional literacy. It includes many real-life examples from the authors' practices. It discusses how societal stereotypes (and their enforcement in various social settings) hinder boys in their ability to be happy, humane members of society and their capacity for intimacy in all its forms. It also explains how this information relates to various topics, such as friends, mothers and sons, fathers and sons, drug and alcohol use, depression, violence, sexuality and relationships.I bought it a few months after my son was born and I have read it 3 times now. I plan on reading it every year, just to remind myself of the important principles outlined in it. Not only is it helping me understand and better respond to my son, it has helped me understand my husband, father, brothers, in-laws, etc. I find I can accept and respect male differences and needs better now that I understand what it means to grow up male in American society."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I was reading this book as a way to understand my boys, but found new personal insights. Then the killings at Littleton Colorado occurred. As a father, and trained as a pediatrician, I find the &quot;culture of cruelty&quot; to be a distirbing influence on our children. Kindlon and Thompson, demostrate the effects the &quot;culture of cruelty&quot; has on individual boys. It is not hard to imagine the effect it had on those two boys. Without the language to express their emotions they resorted to the language taught by computer games, television and destructive music. The development of &quot;emotional literacy&quot; is a lifelong process, in Raising Cain, the authors explore the roles of various influences. Mothers have a special role in the early years as well developed in the chapter on mothers and sons. In the adolscent years this changes. The effect of a mother on the issues of new interpersonal and physical relationships is not explored in the chapter on &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. As a son, I found reading the chapter on &quot;Fathers and Sons: A Legacy of Desire and Distance&quot; introspective. In reading I was looking at my relationships with my sons and with my father. Who should read this book? Educators, mental health professionals, politicians, parents and boys should all be encouraged to read and explore the issues brought up by &quot;Raising Cain&quot;. Perhaps if we took the issue of our son's emotional life as seriously as we take interscholastic sports events like Jonesboro and Littleton will not occur."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"My wife and I started reading several books on boys as we have 4 boys. This book had high rating so we bought it. I forced my way through just over 1/2 of the book and couldn't take any more.My issues are two fold.1) Almost ALL of the ideas presented are based on circumstantial evidence. Psychological research shows clearly that therapists subjective experiences are poorly suited for scientific conclusions. They cite all kinds of resources in the back of the book but never really show the statistics or how it supports their conclusions. They hope you will assume that their stories all conform to the sources they threw in the back.For example, they compare the \\"respect\\" of the John Wayne character with gang \\"respect\\" as one of their examples of male machismo and how it is bad. It is simply a circumstantial example and a poor one at that. Can you really say that John Wayne and a ruthless gang member have the same definition of \\"respect\\"? Even if you don't like John Wayne's style, the two are nothing alike!If they had stuck to statistics and research it would greatly help their writing. (That's even with psychological research being some of the least respected research in academia for it's serious lack of objectivity.)2) While they have some good ideas, there is no real order or progression to the book. They have compiled chapters of ideas that bounce around with no real end in mind. The chapters are the same. For example, the chapter on harsh discipline tells some sad stories but they NEVER explain how a person would know when they had crossed from firm to harsh. They never really outline exactly how harsh discipline is harmful. Worst of all, they don't explain what good discipline looks like. I can understand that harsh discipline is a bad idea, but I need more than just a couple of sad stories to tell me what I already knew!! Give me steps, ways to act, additional educational resources -- ANYTHING but a bunch of stories telling how you were a great therapist and then that's the end of the book.I needed more than this book could provide.My favorite book on boys so far is \\"Boys Adrift.\\" It has given me some concrete ideas supported by loads of research. In addition, there are practical suggestions as to how I can help my boys become \\"men\\" in good and healthy ways."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"As I am looking back into my not-yet-gender-aware early childhood, I remember having been both fascinated and weary of boys. On one hand, they always attracted me with their spirit and honesty, on the other they scared me because I perceived them as impulsive and aggressive, not understanding what motivates them to do things they do. This book helped me fill in those long-forgotten gaps of knowledge -- just in time to better understand my rapidly growing son :) Even though this book does concentrate almost exclusively on a 'stereotypical boy' (i.e., a jock or an angry dropout), it is an invaluable resource for everyone, especially teachers and parents."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"For anyone involved in their upbringing, boys present a number of peculiar challenges. They are disproportionally likely to inflict violence on themselves or others (for example, they account for over 80% of suicides and 95% of homicides in their age groups), they are more likely to use alcohol and drugs, they mature and develop some cognitive skills (such as reading and writing prowess) later than the girls their age, they are much more physical than girls (which cannot be truly accommodated by the educational environment in most schools today). To top it all, boys do not really know how to talk about their feelings, so they are unlikely to identify their emotional problems, let alone find a way of resolving them.The book's merit extends beyond pointing out that the problem exists. The authors suggest some practical ways of helping today's boys. It is respecting their feelings and approaching them more with questions rather than answers and suggestions to tough it out. It is trying to create a loving and safe atmosphere, where boys are more likely to risk opening up. It is helping them create emotive vocabulary, which would help them articulate how they feel. It is creating opportunities for safe failure, which would help boys get to know themselves. It is having some safe places where boys could spend their energy (such as a basement gym or a neighborhood basketball court). It is teaching them emotional courage and empathy, which could help them recognize who they are and build character.Insightful, well articulated and timely. A great book."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This was a fast and easy-to-read book and it made a lot of sense to me. I could even see some adult men I know in the teenage boys the authors discussed in the anecdotes. I do wish the book had more advice and specific strategies to try to help a boy grow up to be an emotionally healthy man.My son is still very young, so I will probably re-read this at least once as he gets older (maybe as he hits different &#34;phases&#34; in his emotional development), but it is a useful reminder even as a mom of a toddler that I should not hold my son to unfair standards even at his young age. I must respect his feelings and let him express them, and encourage other adults in his life to do the same."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book has given me insight into my own upbringing so as not to repeat the same missteps as the teachers and other adults did when I was growing up.

Self-Understanding and compassion leads to a richer and more enjoyable life. Based upon this, what's not to recommend?"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"A book that reveals the &quot;hidden meaning&quot; behind the often perplexing and frustrating behavior of boys. The social and emotional influences that impact the lives of modern boys are thoughtfully reviewed, with one area of exception. The chapter entitled &quot;Romancing the Stone, from heartfelt to heartless relations with girls&quot; resorts to contradictory statements that reflect the larger gender-relations confusion now present in our society.For example, the authors see the teenage boy's struggle with sexuality and intimacy as a struggle with &quot;fears, hopes, and longing.&quot; This recognition of deep emotional needs within boys is characteristic of the previous chapters. However, uncharacteristically, the authors developed a case of amnesia as they wrote this chapter. They attribute the fear to a fear of &quot;dependence on the girl.&quot; Later, they attribute it to fear of rejection, which (they don't explain how) leads to fantasies of the domination of women. The authors don't identify research that substantiates their claim; thus, I am left to believe that they are presenting their personal belief systems and not valid scientific knowledge. This is substantiated by their description of teenage girls as sometimes &quot;aggressive.&quot; They later minimize the aggressiveness of girls by characterizing it as &quot;perceived aggression&quot; (p. 209) and accuse boys of &quot;overpowering girls and women.&quot;The authors also take pains to state that girls mature earlier than boys, and are thus more sexually and emotionally mature. If girls are aggressive and also more mature, how do boys overpower them? The book fails to explain other than to provide the stereotypical offering of male &quot;performance anxiety&quot; (p. 209). It then states that when combined with the &quot;culture of cruelty&quot; that boys &quot;denigrate girls and women in order to control their anxiety about them&quot; (p. 210). And then &quot;girls become the enemy.&quot; This contradicts the presentation of how boys fantasize about girls day and night. It seems odd to present boys as sexually fantasizing about their enemy.The story changes throughout the chapter regarding boy's level of knowledge of relationships with girls. At first it is a compassionate interpretation of &quot;ignorance&quot; (p. 201). Then the explanation changes to a &quot;casual disregard&quot; (p. 202). Certainly a boy who is ignorant cannot be accused of &quot;casual disregard.&quot; This would require a knowledge of the elements of relationship before the offense.The section on date rape is also stereotypical of the political orientation of this chapter. It claims that girls can be &quot;exploited&quot; by less emotionally and physically mature boys. Are the authors stating that boys are more capable than girls are, even though they are less mature? Certainly this would contradict their feminist orientation. Or is the unstated possibility that the maturer girl took advantage of the boy and later regretted doing so? Perhaps in cases where an immature boy and girl are intoxicated (the stereotypical date-rape scenario), both the boy and girl feel badly about the sexual encounter. Unfortunately, this is never considered. The boy's feelings are not discussed other than in condemnatory language. Gone is the compassion of previous chapters that might have identified how a boy feels as a victim of date rape.I find it disappointing that our culture is so focussed on men as perpetrators and females as victims. The statement that &quot;you don't just rape girls&quot; is illustrative. It holds boys wholly responsible for unwanted sexual contact because after all, when a girl gets aroused and takes advantage of a boy, our culture does not consider that to be rape, it is said to be a &quot;rite of passage.&quot;There is no scientific evidence to support these claims. This is a philosophical orientation based on gender feminism. It is popular psychobabble and I was sorely disappointed to read this chapter. Perhaps the authors felt compelled to give a nod to the gender feminist influence in our society, but the outcome was a wholesale dismissal of the previous excellent work.As a whole, this is a welcome addition to my personal studies of men and boys. However, the chapter of boy and girl relationships will be a point of illustration in my discussions regarding issues of men and boys. A point that will illustrate how our world is confused and contradictory when it comes to gender relations. Perhaps a better overall treatment of boys with more real-world suggestions for interacting with boys, is &quot;Real Boys&quot;, by Pollack."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book is so very important for anyone raising boys, anyone with influence over them. Please parents--read this now."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book is more for those who believe in a liberal approach to raising their children. While I believed that this book was focusing on treating your child with respect and love...teaching your child in turn to respect and love...it was apparent from reading it that the focus was more on allowing your child to be free from criticism and discipline. I would not suggest this book for anyone who believes in more traditional approaches to raising their children. Also, I do have concern regarding the fact that the authors are the parents of daughters and have written this book by mere observation through a clinical setting."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"shipped fast and condition was as described. thanks."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I have mixed emotions about this book. In one sense it's antithetical to the thrust of my own research, which suggests that boys have actually been damaged in recent years (see in particular \\"The War Against Boys,\\" by Hoff-Sommers) as a result of a societal abandonment and rejection of such traditional \\"masculine\\" traits as aggression and--for want of a better phrase--\\"reckless initiative\\" (which is what it sometimes takes to get things done in daunting situations, a la Flight 93). This is particularly true in America's schools; there is considerable evidence that, by steering boys away from behaviors and attitudes that may well be hard-wired, the pop-psychology movement has created enormous levels of stress and detachment (and, ironically, greater aggression) in perfectly healthy kids whose only \\"crime\\" was being in touch with their masculine cores.Where I'll give Kindlon credit is that at least he's thinking about the topic, trying to mediate between the traditional stereotypes and some of the more \\"enlightened\\" views of what it means to be masculine, feminine, etc. This is an area where people will need to do a lot of reading and draw their own conclusions, as I'm not sure there's a \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\"--at least, not one that we can know for sure at this juncture."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"So I have had the book for only a few weeks but I'm very much enjoying it!

Now I plan to Minor in Psy.Chad"},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This fine book gives food for thought in raising boys. It reminds you of things you probably already know, such as that being yelled at hurts, and that even boys have rich inner emotional lives. Reading this book should make you more mindful of how your actions (or lack thereof) affect the boys in your life."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I do wish I'd read this book when my son was young. As a single mother, I was learning about boys at the same time I was raising him, and there were some things I had trouble understanding. I think the compassion for boys in this book really comes through, and I think that's important.However, there are two major areas where I felt the book was lacking. First of all, there was really no acknowledgment of the sad fact that for some boys, dad is just out of the picture from very early in the boy's life. This was the case in our family, and certainly the authors know that for boys in that situation, there is a tremendous need for guidance and help. This should have been addressed explicitly. There is discussion of what fathers can do, but nothing on what mothers can do when there is no father.Second, in the chapter on romance, the authors say this, \\"As therapists, we haven't had a lot of experience with issues of homosexuality. So our discussion of love, sexuality, and romance is limited to a heterosexual framework.\\" In the context of a book by therapists, I find this attitude inexcusable. Many boys are either gay or bisexual - and it is essential that those who care about boys learn about this issue. I found myself wondering if the authors had worked with gay boys, but just didn't know it, since young boys are especially likely to want to hide homosexual feelings and I'm not sure these therapists are the kind of people who would make a boy feel safe coming out to them. The sort of assumption of heterosexuality as seen in this book can really be harmful to boys who are gay. If the authors really don't have experience working with gay boys, they should have found work by therapists who could provide some insight. It's too important to just leave it out."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I wasn't sure if I should bother reading this book, since I saw the documentary based on it. I started reading though and found that it covered similar material, but not the same and of course, more in depth. The best part about reading \\"Raising Cain\\" is learning how you can support boys in their own way - helping them be true to themselves, not trying to make them into something they're not.I am a mom of a toddler, so I did find the chapter on young boys in early education especially informative. It has helped me deal with my expectations for my son and how to accommodate his high activity level. It's not a discipline book, but when you better understand children's capabilities at different ages, you can tailor expectations and responsibilities to be more effective. The subsequent chapters really helped me see what I will need to help him emotionally in the years to come, such as reading others' emotions and putting to words how he feels.It is obvious reading this book that the authors aren't just well-versed in research, but have spent careers working with boys on the exact issues addressed by \\"Raising Cain.\\" Although many of the schools and parents who are affluent enough to hire psychologists are the top, private institutions, Kindlon and Thompson have worked in public and at-risk populations as well."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"I liked this book a lot but I wish it would have had more concrete suggestions of how to protect the emotional life of boys interspersed throughout instead of waiting until the last chapter."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of BoysRaising Cain is one of a number of books that address the challenges of raising boys, but it stands out among them by eschewing both the glib Gender War rhetoric and the underlying political or theological agendas that often characterize other books on this topic. Instead, it is both deeply insightful and full of compassion for the emotional lives of boys and men. Rather than offering a point-by-point program, the authors focus on various goals for raising boys, and make some suggestions on how we can accomplish them. It devotes an entire chapter to the relationship between fathers and sons, and a recurrent theme of the book is finding ways to effectively close the emotional distance between ourselves and our sons.This book addresses issues for boys of all ages, and also discusses difficult topics such as depression, drug use and violence among boys. Finally, all fathers were sons at one time, and Raising Cain is a book that can help us better understand not only our sons but ourselves as well."},{"Title":"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys","review":"This book provides a fascinating insight into the emotional development of boys.

Part of the value of this book is the modeling of the authors; the anecdotes show us how to listen and hang out without judging or jumping to conclusions. As a boy/man, i felt that this book was a very clear description of my own experiences growing up.

So the average is two stars.This is NOT a book on playing Hawaiian ukulele music, which is what I thought it would be. It's a beginner's book on playing ukulele in general, the only thing Hawaiian about it is the cover and a few pictures of a Hawaiian woman holding a ukulele. I don't consider including Aloha Oe as one of the selections as making this a book on Hawaiian ukulele.As a beginner's book, it's not bad, but there are better ones out there today that include DVDs, as well as a lot of free online instruction that covers these same basics. I am an intermediate player and I'm disappointed that there wasn't enough information about this book in the description because that would help in clarifying that this is a beginner's book that covers just regular folk songs and basic strums. I thought there would be sections on Hawaiian music (other than just Aloha Oe) and on things like Hawaiian turnarounds, etc.I would only buy this if you are brand new to ukulele and have not played an instrument before.

This book will be especially meaningful to women who grew up in the 1950's and 60's, when women's dependence on men was no longer biological, i.e. due to physical strength or the need for a strong defender of the home, but was necessary for societal order. During this time in American society, it was the \\"natural\\" order of society to redirect women's gifts to the home, lady's social clubs and volunteer work. Underlying this societal necessity of the authority of men were culturally supportive messages not only from society, but also from churches in the way God was portrayed. Ms. Bondi heard these societal messages and tried to live them but never was at ease with them. This book investigates how one can take off society's and traditional Christianity's \\"lens\\" of what it means to be a woman in the late 20th century and find a healthy way to connect women's experiences and belief in God.Ms. Bondi explores sin, prayer, God as Father, the cross, sacrifice, and salvation and creates a paradigm shift in her faith life through theological reflection, by connecting her experiences with great Christine doctrines. Her courage in writing this memoir is evident considering her career as a professor in areas connected to religious thought. I am thankful for her courage and for what her book offers to all who have faced similar issues and have searched for healing."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"I tried to like this book but I just couldn't get past the number of accounts Bondi gave to her horrid upbringing. I realize this wasn't her intent but just when I thought she'd celebrate her success in working through her own theological beliefs- Boom! Back she went to retell the sources for her misguided theology from youth.It is truly remarkable that she had the will to seek answers; I was just hoping she'd give more attention to the life she now leads."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"I found this book boring and disappointingly wretched. Some of the good insights the author shared were overwhelmed by a drawn out book of what seemed like incurable self-pity. This mood unfortunately permeates the book, preventing the reader from seeing someone who is learning about herself and God through the hard knocks of life. As the book progresses, &quot;inner reflection&quot; turns into a continued wallowing in the quagmire of the past, leaving the reader annoyed rather than sympathetic. Furthermore, this is one of those books that needed an editor to prune it before it went to the publishers. The book is 205 pages long, but Bondi could have said everything she needed to say in 1/3 of that length. Her repetition is annoying. This book has potential that a good editor could make use of, but as it is, it isn't worth reading."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"I have read few books that touched me as strongly as this book did. Ms. Bondi is both a skillful storyteller and a courageous woman, willing to share her own deeply personal experiences with the public. I am very grateful for her willingness to take this kind of risk on behalf of others. I can't speak for the author's intent, but my reading of her book gave me a sense of God that enriched my life. In my opinion, these writings have the same feel to them that scripture does - at least, the kind of scripture that brings us closer to God."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"Roberta Bondi has obvious roots in the wisdom of the Early Church Fathers and Mothers. Yet, her engagement of Saints through the centuries is matched only by an equally deep engagement with her life story. She speaks of ordinary times with an extraordinary vision that uncovers the sacred. Her story invites the reader to look with respect at their own journey. Some authors use profound theoretical constructs, some use personal stories: Dr Bondi is one who does both seamlessly and conveys a conviction that we can do the same."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"Systematic theology or memoir? Yes. The organization and intent is theological leading us from our existence in God, our humanity, our desire for the good, crucifixion, resurrection, and beyond. The method is to use her own life to lead us through the topics. Bondi suffered from traumatic childhood experiences including bad revival preaching. She was maimed by an image of a wrathful God that demands our sacrifice. Through study, prayer, and revelation, she learns that God, as God and as a human being, came among us to bring us healing....Read Chapter 4 before going to hear any Good Friday or Easter sermons."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"I would recommend this book to others to read as an exploration into their own personal understanding of God and the impact that relationship has on their relationships with others. It was a very enjoyable and easy book to read but also one that prompted me into greater reflection on my own life.Bondi describes her own experiences growing up with a less than perfect family structure and how that affected her image of God, her understanding of Christianity, and her relationships. As a woman, I understood what she was saying and found her personal stories to touch deeply my heart and mind. I found that her experiences and growth helped me to explore my own past and to look at how those relationships have affected my own relationship with God, the Christian faith, and others.For men, I would recommend this book as a means of understanding more fully what it means to be a man of God, what women have suffered over the years in a patriarchical society, and to begin to gain a more full understanding of who God really is, containing both woman and man."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"Memories of God by Roberta Bondi is a rare book of personal honesty about religious experience. There are many people who talk about doing narrative theology, but she actually does it, mixing intimate stories of her personal life with clear and accessible theologial reflection. This book has changed my life, and the lives of many people I have given it to. It has given me words to talk about my own experiences in ways I never thought I'd be able to do. Beautifully written, it speaks from the heart. I appreciate the author's courage in sharing her story."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"Assigned to me to be read as before a spirituality seminar, I really enjoyed looking at the theological reflections of this past generation through the eyes of a theologian who is a woman. I was able to relate so much of what she said to experiences I have had with other women who have had a great influence on my own growth of thinking about God in these years."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"In Memories of God Theological Reflections on a Life, Roberta Bondi shares her life story relating her search for a relationship with God that was true to her life experience. Growing up with a harsh father, fire and brimstone southern Baptist preaching, and a male dominated culture, Bondi struggles to reconcile all the parts of who she is - being a female with an intellect, being up-happy and unable to truly please anyone, with what she perceives as people's and God's expectations of her. Through intense and painful prayer and reflection, and encountering a view of a loving and forgiving God through experiences of beauty, adult unconditional love, and in the writings of the early church, Bondi comes to see herself as beloved by God in who she is.Storytelling, questioning, and prayerful reflection are highlighted in Bondi's book as the means to truly understand self and our relationship with God. Without these processes our relationship remains at best, an intellectual impersonal assent. Opening ourselves through probing our deepest fears, feelings and beliefs brings the joy of self knowledge and of our belovedness before God."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"The book Memories of God, written by Roberta C. Bondi, is about a female professor who wrote a memoir to fully understand her own thoughts about her life and her faith. She faced many challenges of being a female in a male dominated home life, school life and work life. This memoir examines her relationships that she has and helps her to gain a better understanding of her relationship with God.This memoir is a great book to read to get a better understanding of how culture shapes are lives and our beliefs. Bondi referenced the early monastic father's articles which helped her see a different side of God that her own images she learned from her controlling father. Anyone who reads this book can grasp new images of God as our Father. This book has been helpful for my particular ministerial context in that it reminds me that not all people have the same view of God. I particularly have a great relationship with my father but can use this book to reference other relationships in view of my perception of God."},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"Roberta Bondi is well grounded in theology and church history and she blends wonderfully her personal stories with this knowledge of the faith. What is especially beautiful and moving is her realization of the true meaning of God's love she found in her Aunt Ree and in Mother Jane at the Anglican Benedictine Monastery. Her mother's sacrificial life and valuing of beauty were also ways she began to &quot;know God&quot;. The only man who fared well was Richard. What is lacking for me in this book is what we can learn about God from maleness. Her life experiences, especially with teachers, were so cruel. The book becomes bogged down in her depression, and I did too! The repetitiveness of her memories was confusing and unnecessary. Perhaps some editing would help, but then perhaps we do repeat those most memorable stories as we try to make meaning of them!"},{"Title":"Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life","review":"This book has changed my life and helped me to find myself and God.

Only after I received my order did I realize I'd been had (sort of) - the \\"disk\\" was there, but it is a 1980s-style FLOPPY disk! Personally, I haven't seen a computer you could use those type of disks in since about 1990, so I won't be getting much use out of it...Oh well.Still the text is interesting, and it does offer some insights into what fractals are, but to be honest since 3/4 of the book is about using the FRACTINT program on the disk, it is pretty much useless. Unless you have a very old computer or an external 5.25 inch floppy drive (would one work with Windows XP or a MAC??).

Its appeal is to ministers, teachers and students in colleges, theological seminaries, and church schools, thoughtful laymen, who are aware that Jeremiah is a great prophet and earnestly desire to know his personality, message, and abiding value.More is known about Jeremiah's life, ministry, and teachings than about any other Old Testament prophet. He lived under the reign of five Judean kings in one of the most strategic and important periods in world history as well as in the history of the Hebrew people. He stands at the peak of Old Testament prophecy both in his teaching and his person....Three things characterize this volume. First, I have made my own translation of the entire book of Jeremiah, utilizing the latest edition of Kittel's Biblia Hebraica. I have given careful and judicious attention to the critical notes in which are concentrated the scholarly insights of generations of skilled Hebraists, and have availed myself of their suggestions. Students of the Hebrew text will recognize this in the translation, although my eager desire to make the fruits of such study available to the nontechnical reader has necessitated the reduction of explanatory footnotes to the minimum. Jeremiah was a poet of unique power as well as a prophet, and in the poetic pasages the attempt has been made to retain in the translation the rhythmical stresses characteristic of the lines of Hebrew poetry as they came from his soul.Second, I have attempted the arrangement of the contents of the book on a chronological principle. Every careful student of this book is perplexed by the seeming lack of concern for chronological order on the part of the final editor by whose hand the book ultimatedly took shape. Yet of the period covered by the prophet's life we are unusually well informed, and the character and the reign of the five monarchs who ruled over Judah during his prophetic career is known in considerable detail. No prophet in Israel or Judah was so much a part of his times as was Jeremiah. By speech, by pen, or by both, he was active during the reign of each king. The nature of the evidence is such that certainty as to chronology of his prophetic messages cannot be achieved. But in so far as it is possible to sense in each case the approximate period and likely setting from which his individual utterances come, his message teems with timeliness and vital pertinancy. At this point I have at times found the insight of Volz paticularly judicious and helpful. Immediately following the table of contents is an index which will guide the reader quickly to the page in which each particular section of the book of Jeremiah is translated and discused.Third, the various portions of the words or the experiences of Jeremiah and their interpretation have been so interwoven that the living experience of the man unfolds before the readers eyes. The reader is prepared for the clear understanding of each portion of the book of Jeremiah in turn, then is led through it so that, portion by portion, he knows what he is reading, understands its allusions, and senses the relation it bears to the total experiences of the man. Thus he is kept face to face with the personality of Jeremiah, as well as with the persons who clashed with him or those who protected and assisted him.--- excepts from book's Preface"},{"Title":"Jeremiah","review":"The aim of this volume is to make the readings of the entire book of Jeremiah an intelligible, interesting, and inspiring experience.

The first volume (Part 1) is devoted to the sections from the Creation up to Noah, and this volume (Part 2) is devoted to the sections from Noah up to and including some of the sections on Abraham. The commentary is clearly set forth, and Cassuto writes very gracefully. Tragically, the commentary was not completed.Cassuto explains the original meaning of Genesis by exploring the literary and archaeological evidence from the ancient Near East. This evidence reveals the world and conceptions of its ancient audience in terms of which they would have interpreted the text.He compares and contrasts Genesis with the other literature of the ancient Near East. The creation and flood traditions belonging to Israel and her neighbours are both similar and significantly different; Genesis introduces profound and original theological concepts in a literary form and tradition with which the ancient audience would have been familiar.Cassuto shows the beauty and unity of Genesis by revealing its careful literary arrangement and patterns. His talent for recognising these patterns is very impressive and unique.Cassuto sensitively engages both with classical Jewish commentators and more modern biblical critics. He defends his interpretations with an acute analysis of the text and simple commonsense. His breadth of knowledge and depth of insight is breathtaking.Cassuto devastates the documentary hypothesis according to which the text is edited from four independent source documents. He explains the evidence that is supposed to support the documentary hypothesis in a far more plausible way than does the hypothesis. He also devastates the documentary hypothesis at book-length in his \\"The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch: Eight Lectures\\", which I strongly recommend.However, he does not adopt the traditional religious view of the composition of text, and while he is Jewish, his interpretations sometimes differ from the orthodox understanding of the text. But I think that Cassuto's commentaries give us a peak at a genius infinitely more sublime than what he suggest.Cassuto's commentaries were written some time ago, and there have since been archaeological discoveries that broaden the understanding of the text that Cassuto tried to develop. For a recent exploration of the archaeology and literature of the ancient Near East relevant to the Hebrew Bible generally, I strongly recommend Kenneth Kitchen's \\"On the Reliability of the Old Testament\\"."},{"Title":"A commentary on the book of Genesis: Part II, from Noah to Abraham, with an appendix: a fragment of part III (Publications of the Perry Foundation for ... in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem)","review":"This is a must read for theologians and laypersons alike. Cassuto is a master at applying his mastery of ancient Hebrew and its cognate languages to arrive at sound exegetical conclusions which firmly place the narrative within the realm of human history.

It's a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large-scale state censorship/'perception control' and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech. The net is not considered as a political forum, rather there is a heavy authoritarianism.I'm very disappointed with it."},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","review":"Gulf war, fraud, national security, Spam, traitors, and computer viruses. These are just a few of the topics covered by Dorothy Denning's book Information_Warfare_and_Security. This book gives a broad and informative view of information security, however it lacks specifics to make it more than an introductory work to this field.The book has a broad overview of subjects. The Introduction section encompasses around 75 pages and gives substantial theory to the how and why of information security. Part II discusses \\"Offensive Information Warfare\\" which brings the reader through techniques on obtaining information. \\"Defensive Information Warfare\\" in Part III naturally discusses how to repel the offenses discussed in Part II.Information_Warfare_and_Security is very informative on the problem areas which it discusses. Computers and phones are obvious places for intrusion and the book covers the facets of these areas in depth. The less obvious methodologies are also mentioned such as eavesdropping, traffic analysis, and sabotage. Denning does not leave out the human factor in her sections on social engineering, traitors, and even dumpster diving.Denning's book, however, lacks specific in-depth information. Any chapter subject could have a large book written on it. The book does not give the \\"how-to's\\" to create or block an attack; rather it merely discusses the possibilities. To Denning's credit, however, she does include a substantial bibliography and endnotes so the reader can find further information in the source material.Information_Warfare_and_Security would serve the purpose of an excellent introductory overview to the information security field. It is broad and informative, but lacks the specific information to execute any of the offenses or defenses. Denning's book is useful to heighten awareness of information security issues, but it is not sufficient to provide an education in this field."},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","review":"Dorothy Denning's book covers almost every aspect of a topic that is of increasing importance. It is written in an ENJOYABLE STYLE and is full of examples, stories and quotations that WELL ILLUSTRATE the points she wants to make. It is an EXCELLENT OVERVIEW of the topic, and for those who are interested in the details, an extensive list of references is included at the end.Whether you are responsible for information security at your enterprise or you are a citizen concerned about your data's privacy, you WILL NOT REGRET if you read this book.However, it could be improved in several areas:Even in an overview like this, more should be said about the controls that can help you protect your data (such as separation of duties, security audits etc.). The numbering of references is restarted in every chapter and so they are hard to find at the end of the book. Most importantly, it should show much less political and cultural bias. A book that is basically about information-related threats and defenses is NOT supposed to be used to protect Attorney General Janet Reno in connection with the Waco case (see Chapter 5) or vent the author's dislike of the Arab countries. For example, if Arab governments control information such as pornography, it is called \\"censorship\\", the same thing done by the US government is referred to as \\"restrictions - also in Chapter 5. (Don't get me wrong: it is NO accident that I lived in the US for years and never ever wished to live in an Arab country, so I am myself biased toward American culture. Even so, I often found Denning too openly manipulative.)"},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","review":"I am very reluctant to give much credit for this book to its author. This is primarily because nearly a third of the book is dedicated to bibliography. That, in my opinion, is not really writing; it is compilation.I was also disappointed at the caliber of anecdotes. I found them to be either totally irrelevant, or totally trite.I will give credit, however, for the organization and 'soup-to-nuts' primer approach. The chapter organization and flow are superb and I am certain this makes a decent text for non-technical graduate students trying to grasp the concepts of information warfare. The chapter on encryption technology is especially well explained.Unfortunately, the jacket and editorial reviews (and some of the Amazon reviews) would lead you to believe that this book is a MUST for all information security professionals. It isn't. It is probably, however, a good book for people who have to effectively communicate with information security professionals. Anyone with even a moderate background in information security will not be impressed."},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","review":"Dorothy Denning has produced one of the best 'easy read' reference books I have seen in years. The writing is one of the most striking aspects of this book; right from the introduction the reader is taken on a logical and structured route through the key aspects of Information Security, with numerous references to real life cases. You don't need a note pad, as the language is clear and concepts explained in simple English. This a excellent book to read on the train/plane: it is interesting, job related, informative but not dull or too intellectually challenging.That said the strength of argument and excellent references are worth the cost of the book alone!

It is divided into three sections, the introduction, offensive information warfare and finally defensive information warfare. Numerous topics are covered. The author is clearly an expert in security and manages to touch upon all the major information security topics.The main strength of the book is the breadth of topic selection. By the time you have reached the end of the book, you will have at least a passing acquaintance with all important information security topics. The book is very well referenced and is written in an easy to read style.The enormous topic selection means that no topic is treated in any particular depth. This means that you'll get to know something about everything, but unfortunately you won't develop an intimate understanding of any of the topics covered.At times I received the impression that the book was simply a collection of anecdotes. Some parts of the book resembled sensationalistic journalism and, four years after it was written, many parts of the book are out of date. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a broad overview of information security. Its scatter gun approach means that you'll hit all of the topics but won't develop a true understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved."},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","review":"Dorothy E. Denning is an authority not just for the books cited in the other reviews here, but also for her landmark paper to the IEEE which laid the formal foundation for intrusion detection systems. Given her background, one might assume her book would focus on the most technical aspects of security. This is not the case. Her book covers security and privacy issues ranging from classic spying through crypographic means, and is thoroughly footnoted to allow the reader to pursue the trails. One thing I have noted is that higher-ups may become fixated on specific technical fixes. (&quot;If we only had a firewall/intrusion detection system/XXX-bit encryption/YYY operating system, then we would be secure...&quot;) This book is something of an antidote to these tendencies.I would heartily recommend this book for anyone concerned with the need for all-round security and training.

The size can be justified for sake of portability. But this is a serious topic, so a slightly bigger font and book size and a \`lay-flat' binding would have made the reading much easier.Two features that add considerable value to the book are the extensive Bibliography and Endnotes sections.

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure.

Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works.

Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read. Additionally, it represents the transition between the more emotional, passion-centered Romantic era (Henchard) to the more mechanical Victorian Era (Farfrae), and that in itself is a pretty interesting concept."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.This is a masterpiece.I, like many reviewers above, had to study this text aged 16 for school exams.

Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!

In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom.

The story revolves around Michael Henchard who, under the influence of alcohol, sold his wife and child. This is enough to demonstrate that one mistake can lead to a life of utter misery. Although Henchard thrives and becomes mayor, his past comes to haunt him when his wife returns. Hardy's description of Henchard's downfall is unrealistic. However, what I found most unconvincing was the manner in which Donald Farfrae completely replaced him.

To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit.

The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line.

Depressed by his poverty, Henchard gets blind drunk. He'd get along so much better without the burden of a family, he declares to one and all - and he offers his wife for sale to the highest bidder.Am amiable sailor throws down five guineas, and Susan Henchard, babe in arms, goes off with him.Amazingly, such things did happen in nineteenth-century rural England. This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago.

Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child.

The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere.

Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior.

In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story. Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"a riveting read from the first shocking chapter. an amazing kindle read. thomas hardy has a profound grasp of human nature and sugarcoats nothing. this is a great novel."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Set in fictitious Casterbridge (Hardy's beloved Dorchester), the story evolves from the web of deceit spun by pride and drink--with serious consequences 20 years later. Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature. The main character, Michael Henchard gets drunk at a fair and sells his wife and child to a sailor.

If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This was an ok novel. It has many plots and twists and is a little hard to follow. The cliff notes make the book much easier to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This book was astounding. Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I loved the irony. I mean, how much worse could life get for the Mayor? After selling his wife, and swearing off drinking, what was left for him? When he meets his wife again, it becomes to turning point of his life once again, including his &quot;daughter&quot;."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"When one finishes \\"Casterbridge,\\" one is immediately struck by its place in the development of the novel. Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Mayor of Casterbridge is a tale about a man named Michael Henchard and the mistakes he makes in life.

It made me nervous and stressed, dreading the next awful event that would follow the painful scene I had just finished, and sure enough, another calamity would promptly occur. Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life.

The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different.

The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well.

Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love.

The story is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The book came in perfected condition as it said on the review of this book. It came just in time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected. And more Hardy, of course.Worse than: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyBetter than: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles DickensAlso better than: Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The story of a man who ruins his life by doing the right thing at the wrong time, both in business and in his relationships with his wife, a potential wife, and his stepdaughter.

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"I loved the book!

Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera.

Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope.

There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story.

Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Signet classics)","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph. He will never be heard from again. (The will is on the last few pages of the book.) Fading into nothing, it challenges the reader to find a term for death. Is death the physical end of life, or the emotional end of life. Readers will be challenged to determine their own answers to Henchard's damnation."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"Ms. Henley is one of my top 10 authors, but that wasn't enough to make me like this book. I don't think the publisher did her any favors by reprinting this story from the early eighties.Enticed is well written, I'll give Henley that much. But then again, she hasn't written a book yet that fails to intrigue me. The problem I had with this novel had nothing to do with it lacking in interest, it's just that I found myself disliking both the hero and the heroine immensely. What good is a romance if you can't stand the people its written about?The hero Patrick has many chances to make Kitty his wife, but doesn't realize his feelings until she's married to someone else. After that husband dies, he could marry her again, but sets sail for America instead. The heroine, idiot that she was through this entire ulcer-inducing epic, trots off to America to find him, only to be thought a mulatto and sold into slavery &lt;sigh&gt;.Kitty is rescued by Charles, the man who is to become her next husband. The sad part for the reader is that you actually WANT the heroine to stay with Charles and to forget about Patrick. Charles is good looking, treats Kitty like a queen, etc. But no, Henley is intent upon returning Kitty to Patrick, the sorriest excuse for a hero Ms. Virginia's ever written.To make a short story perhaps too long, this is the only book I've read by Henley that I've truly disliked.

Especially sence the rape took place when Kitty was just a child and Patrick was a grown man. It really turned my stomach. I have to agree completely with one of the other reviewers who said, it is really hard to like either one of these charaters. If you are thinking of starting to read some of Virginia Henley's work please do not start with this one. All of her other books that I have read have been wonderful."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"Dear readers,This is one of those books you either love or hate. With that in mind, I did not find this book as horrible as some people states. There are worst romance books out there then this... I guess it all depends on the person. For example I found Seduced by this author a lot worst than this because that book dragged on while this particular book had many twists to the story.Yes, the heroine ends up marrying 2 other men before actually ending up with the hero at the end, it actually had a plot! I found this book to be very emotional, the heroine more likable than some of VHs books...If you're looking for a romance novel with many twists that takes the H/H from one side of the earth to the other, with events that makes it seem like they'll never end up together.... you might like this romance novel. Its not one of those same old, same old fluffy books...Take heart, this book isn't as bad as people made it seem, I myself \\"dreaded\\" reading it, haha. Maybe this is why I didn't find it so awful.. *shrug*"},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"I did not feel this was Virginia Henley's best work. Perhaps the fact that is a reprint of an earlier book is the reason her characters aren't as easy to love and the writing is sometimes a bit disjointed? I suggest readers would prefer to read &quot;Seduced&quot; first - THAT is a truly sensational read."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"I usually love Virginia Henley's books (esp. \\"Enslaved\\"), but this book left me VERY disappointed. And though I never condemn lack of plot or so-forth for romance novels - after all this IS escapism - this story was terrible. There is not really anything to like about the hero, except that he's supposed to be handsome. There is never any REAL interaction between the heroine and the hero - nothing to give you a clue as to why she would fall for him in the first place (except that he's handsome). And for me his looks just weren't enough to build a relationship on. The poor girl goes through ordeal after ordeal throughout the entire book. The only person that truly saved her was Charles, and you really kind of start to root for poor dear old Charles. The ending was contrived. Ms. Henley needed to get Charles out of the way for Patrick and has him (Charles) kill himself. You know that Kitty has developed feelings for Charles, and yet she jumps at the chance to run back to Patrick. Kitty spends most of the book alone or with someone else. How are we to even half-way believe there is any real love between the two main characters? Save your money and read \\"Enslaved\\" instead, you'll end the book MUCH more satisfied."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"Enticed is a disappointing read, less a story of romance than a catalogue of sexual perversions. Kitty jumps from one to the next, beginning with her rape at the hands of the man Henley would have us believe is the hero of the piece, through two marriages to other men that make Patrick a sideline character for a significant portion of the book. By the time she finally finds her way back to Patrick again, the book has gone on too long, and neither of the romantic leads have built up enough charisma to make the ending believable or compelling. Skip it."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"\\"I'll agree with another review by saying I can't believe this author was actually published again after this one. I'm stupified of the amount of rape and attempted molesting of a fifteen year old that goes on in this book. I do realize however that teenagers were not considered children in the time period this novel took place, but the characters are cruel, indescent and flat out mean. And I really can't stand the fact that Kitty ended up with the one man who started it all. Love is never an excuse for the kind of things that went on in this novel... I finally quit reading it about halfway through and skimmed my way to the end.I'll not count this author out as of yet though, she's obviously writing something better than this because she's got pretty high ratings on goodreads and she's got a list of books a mile long, so we'll see."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"This one was my first book by VH and it has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I'll think twice before I buy other books written by her. I read the book till when Kitty marries Charles and finally, sleeps with him while she still had Patrick in her heart.I couldn't read another page after that. Throughout the book she's been saving herself for Patrick and at the end of it she gives into someone she's not even in love with. Kitty's character is a very sorry example for a heroine, especially when she's tempted to give into most men she meets at every turn, including the captain of the ship that transports her from United Kingdom to United States...Skip this book, you're not missing anything."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"This is the second book of Virginia Henley's that Ive read, and I was disappointed in it after reading &quot;A Year and a Day&quot;. It was no where near the quality of story as a Year. Don't get me wrong I did not hate the book, but I found the characters totally stupid at times, and unintelligable. Im taking my book to the used book store tomorrow to trade for something else. I guess I will have to try another one of Virginia Henley's books to see how they fare."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"I'm one of those readers who likes romance novels with extensive character development that explain the motivation behind the hero's and heroine's actions. Virginia Henley is one of my favorite writers and she usually delivers in spades, but the characters in this novel lack heart. Of all her books, I've felt unconnected and dissatisfied with only two, Enticed and Desired. The publisher should have released this book as a novel and left it out of the romance genre, where it lacks romantic composition. Henley is a very detailed writer who weaves a historically accurate tale for a heroine whom I could not, as hard as I tried, sympathize with or care enough about. Kitty became aggravating as one life changing crisis after another befall her, only to sigh as she makes one bad decision after another. It's like watching a horror film where the character is about to open the door to a room with the monster inside, and you're yelling,\\"Don't open that door!\\" Kitty is that type of character, only she keeps opening the same door over and over and over.....till you just have to close the book and put it aside for a few months to rid yourself of the headache. Patrick was no hero. Except for the fact that he was her first sexual experience, he should have been forgotten about and left in her past, as he was for the majority of this novel. I could not understand why Kitty cared for him or why she accepted him entering her life at various times gifting him with her love only to be disappointed. Kitty's love for Patrick stunted the growth of her character, which explains my dislike of this story since she practically falls for him from the start. It's the first time I've ever read a romance novel and NOT wanted the hero and heroine to get together. Go figure!?!"},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"this was my first time reading any of virginia henley books and i have to say i enjoy it very much i loved the way it went back and forth between the two lovers i readed it twice i would like to read more of her books"},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"The book started with promised, and I thought that the lead female character Kitty would overcome her poor circumstances.....she did but not in a way that endeared you to her.Patrick, the male lead character, lost favour in my eyes as the book progressed......but so did Kitty, you did not &quot;feel&quot; the love between them.Why you may ask. I can understand problems arising between the two lead characters but there was no romance.Kitty marries twice before she gets her man. This then made Patrick a secondary character for the large portion of the story. And by then by the time they did get together you did not really care id they did or didn't.The other rewiews mention Virgina's previous book Enslaved. If you have read that book before Enticed you will understand our disappointment with Enticed.I wanted the book to get better but it was not to be.Ms Henley is a gifted writer but her books become outstanding if you can feel the passion between her lead charaters and that's why this book is not one of her best.Sorry Virgina......I'll still be buying your books but please keep the love and passion as you did in Enslaved."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"This is the first book from Henley's that I read and there's no turning back !!!

After reading The Pirate and The Pagan, I had high expectations. This booked lacked substance and I still can't figure out why Patrick and Kitty ended up together.

I will definatley check other reviews of V.H. books before I commit to reading the next novel."},{"Title":"Enticed","review":"Of the Henley books I've read thus far, this one was by far the worst!

And by his/her rude statement insults not only the author but those people that enjoys a romance novel. Was that really appropriate? I may not prefer romance novels myself, but I think that we should respect that everyone has different preference.

Jewitt's descriptions of the Nootka native life 200 years ago, couched in the rather flowery descriptive language common to the time is both entertaining and exciting reading. His unruly companion in slavery, Thompson, the unusual dietary habits of the Nootka, and the adventures they had fixing themselves in Nootka society all add up to a tale that would be an excellent work of fiction. The fact that his tale is true makes the book that much better-a &quot;must read&quot; for all interested in the record of early frontier history as well as literary entertainment alone."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"This was the first Kinky Friedman book I read, having known of him by reputation for many years. It lived up to all I've heard of his books: fast-paced, quirky humor, a wild cast of characters, a touch hard-boiled. But Dashiel Hammett he's not. As in many mystery novels, the writing in this book, although fun, breaks no new literary ground and is typical for the genre. If you're looking for a good, easy read, you'll certanly enjoy this!"},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"I picked up \\"Greenwich Killing Time\\" on a whim...partly because of the cover art and partly because it was in the $... sale table at the local bookstore. Thus I became addicted to Kinky's tales of his Village Irregulars, his family, and especially his cat. I can sing along with all his tunes. I own, personally, a guitar pick with \\"Kinky\\" emblazoned across it, a gift from the man himself. You know...in rereading this, I realize that I sound like a really sad, pathetic person. Hmm. Maybe he'll put me in one of his books."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"This is a very enjoyable page-turner mystery. It is hip, literary and chock fullof one-liners that made me laugh out loud. I ran out and bought his otherbook after reading this.The author is a folk singer in real life who places himself as the protagonistprivate eye in this novel. Lots of fun."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"Not bad for a first try. In many ways Kinky reminds me of Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar, in that he is always read with a \\"smarta**\\" commment, whether it's called for or not. Besides the woman and drugs, people snort cocaine like it's being delivered by girl scouts and everyone has to do their part to help them make their cookie quota. But then this book was written in the eighties, so you have to give some here and there.What is interesting, is the period comments about how dirty and down in the mouth 'The City' was at this time. He even mentions the old 'squeegee' guys washing windows for quarters. All this was pre-G (for Guiliani) and of the Disney Company taking over Times Square. Kinky's place down on VanDam in a warehouse, would be worth millions today. The area around Sheridan Square is so wholesome, even the bi-sexuals wear black and grey and carry faux-Guchi bags.As to the story, well it would have made a good western, with Kinky as Marshall Dillon, Ratso as the deputy, and his upstairs lesbian neighbor as Miss Kitty (or KittyCat). Typical of a book written by any New Yorker, the Cops act like civil servants who are one week from retirement and never have to worry about a review board, or getting fired. In other words they are in no hurry to do anything that might keep them out of the 'House' when the donut-man comes around.Considering that there are like twelve more novels in the series, I've got lots of time to get used to his style; and he's got lots of time to get into character development and such."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"&quot;Greenwich Killing Time&quot; is Kinky Friedman's first novel, written in 1984 and first published in 1986. His books had been recommended to me by a number of people - and his first novel seemed like the best place to start.The Kinkster certainly doesn't take the normal approach. He has cast himself as the PI-hero in his books and has used the names of several friends in his stories. As with real life, the book's Kinky is a cat-loving retired country and western performer. In his defence (!!), it seems he also likes dogs, Jameson's, Guinness and cigars.Set in the Greenwich Village area of New York, the book sees Kinky sharing his loft with a cat who refuses to answer the phone. It starts at a high pace, with Kinky's friend Mike McGovern informing him of a neighbour's murder. Not long afterwards, McGovern contacts Kinky again with a little background information on the victim - and with the news that he's just been arrested and charged with the murder himself. As a sleuth with a successful record, Kinky takes it upon himself to clear his friend's name and find the real murderer.Fast-moving, easily read and packed with superbly delivered one-liners, &quot;Greenwich Killing Time&quot; is not what I would call an entirely serious 'whodunnit'. As an author, Kinky was described to me as irreverant - that's probably how I would best describe this book."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"The flow of the book is a little strange. It starts out in short, sometimes incomplete sentences which bothered me a little. However, once I got into the book and used to the flow, I thouroughly enjoyed it! Kinky Friedman is the main character who is a country singer turned private sleuth. The crime and clues are as puzzling as the strange array of friends and suspects. I thought I had the mystery figured out about 6 times, but did not know the truth until the end. Puzzling, Funny, and Bizarre are the best words to describe the Kinkster. A very entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"I was kind of disappointed in Greenwich Killing Time. But wait, I gave it 5 stars? Yep. It truly is a great book. Kinky has done it again in one of his earlier works. Kinky is embroiled in a wicked plot of murder and mayhem. Ratso, McGovern, and the beautiful Stephanie DuPont are all trying to figure what Kinky has figured out behind the cigar smoke in this intelligent thriller."},{"Title":"Greenwich Killing Time","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I read 50 pages and found myself completely unmoved by the story and the pursuit of the killer. The writing is good: sharp, clear, fast paced. Kinky's view of the world is original with plenty of good oneliners. My main problem is the genre rather than the book - if you're into crime you will probably dig it. Most crime books are entirely plot based with not much characterisation. This is the inherent problem for me with this one. Without finding out about the characters you simply don't care if they live, die or get caught. A nice cup of tea becomes a more interesting option than trawling through another 200 pages to find the killer. I did find the killer by going straight to the end. Sam Cooke would have been proud."},{"Title":"My Secret Protector","review":"William MacAlpin prefers working as an emergency rescuer jumping into dangerous scenarios to rescue trapped firefighters than serving as a Protector. However, the Council, through his Uncle Gavin, orders William to make a critical leap in time to stop escapee Bartholomew from changing history. He says no until he learns that the Renegade time traveler plans to go back to the sixteenth century to kill William's parents.William journeys back to 1558 where Isabel de Pinze sees him miraculously step out of the water. However, thugs immediately accost him. With Isabel's help he wins the battle, but is badly wounded. She manages to take him to her home where her guardian calls Dr. John Campbell to look at William. John is actually Bartholomew who recognizes the tattoo of a Protector who is most likely coming for him. As William and Isabel fall in love, he must stop Bartholomew from changing history by protecting his mother, a little girl living with Isabel's guardians.MY SECRET PROTECTOR is a fine historical romantic fantasy that readers of the two sub-genres will enjoy. Though the audience will need to accept the Protectors and their species living among mortals, the author binds her audience through the plight of the hero willing to die to protect his loved ones. This solid tale will lead to the audience wanting to learn more about this nearly immortal race watching the time stream.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"My Secret Protector","review":"William could be a superhero easily with his good looks and bravery. His work as a smoke jumper takes him into danger almost daily. He is a rule breaker and risk taker, but even more than that, he is Immortal. He is one of an ancient race descended from the Atlanteans and charged with watching over humanity. For the most part, he lives life with little contact with his people.That all changes when his irratating uncle shows up on his doorstep. Gavin has an assignment that William would refuse, but when his uncle explains the odds at stake, he can not refuse. It is his mission to go back in time and keep a renegade Immortal from seeking revenge on those who killed his brother by making sure that Bloody Mary remains alive and Elizabeth never becomes queen. While the historical implications are frightening enough, no Shakespeare, none of the advances of the Elizabethan era, the end of the Reformation, for William, it is even more so. The first targets of the revenge will be his own parents.In the past, William immediately continues his heroics by rescuing a young woman, though at first it appears to have cost his life. The maiden takes him home, hoping to cure him, and is blown away when he appears to rise from death. Her parents are not stunned, however. She is the adopted half breed child of an Immortal and his human lover. Bringing William home draws her into the line of danger involved in the war between good and bad Immortals and also risks bringing her own secret past to light.All of that is secondary though, for Isobel and William immediately fall in love, even though that is breaking every rule that William has not already broken.***** Spanning centuries, this is a well balanced time travel romance that makes sense. So often, such books, while fun, still stretch credibility, but not this one. The characters are dynamic and likeable, unless you are supposed to hate them. Then, they are thoroughly despicable. The best part? The threads for several sequels are apparent, promising readers the hope of even more Immortal stories in the future. *****"},{"Title":"The Case of the Fugitive Nurse","review":"Steffanie Malden, the client, is a greedy Widow. She is much eager to snatch her late husband's hidden money rather than to mourn for him, and she want to use Mason as a tool. And did she kill her husband cold-bloodedly? Mason fights for the unpleasant client at the risk of being disbarred and/or imprisoned. Lawyer is a hard business.The most charming point of Perry Mason mysteries is how to reveal the real murderer and/or the real facts convincingly. Also in this book, the thrilling and dramatic revelation of what really happened is splendid! And the the murderer's identity is completely unpredictable and surprising.I also enjoy quite a few spectacular scenes; D.A. Burger launches his fist at Mason, Mason is sentenced for contempt of court and so on."},{"Title":"The Case of the Fugitive Nurse","review":"The Case of the Fugitive NurseThe 'Foreword' is dedicated to Dr. Samuel R. Gerber, the coroner of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. He is a pioneer in the field of public disaster, where there is a need to quickly identify many bodies to solve legal problems, such as insurance, wills, marital relationships, etc. Dr. Gerber studied traffic deaths, accident prevention, and the effects of alcohol. His percentages on alcohol in the blood have become the accepted standard.Perry Mason receives a visit from Mrs. Stefanie Malden, the newly widowed spouse of Dr. Summerfield Malden (a plane crash). This very young widow says Dr. Malden was being investigated by the IRS as to income tax. Gladys Foss, his head nurse and office manager, has disappeared - it may not be a coincidence. Stefanie found strange keys, hired a private detective, and learned where her husband spent time. Stefanie is concerned that her husband could have outwitted her! The IRS investigation was over cash income that was lower than expected. Stefanie wants Perry to take care of settling the estate for her. But complications arise from Perry's investigation. Did Perry walk into a cunningly baited trap?Gladys Foss explains the strains for a medical man. The patients vary as to symptoms and condition, but a doctor must be able to handle any complication. Bookkeeping is an unneeded complication that is usually handled by a nurse. There is a cash shortage due to a lack of records. Could Gladys have taken some of the funds to play the horses? Could Dr. Malden's mechanic been involved in the plane crash? Was Dr. Malden's young wife seeing this mechanic? Then Perry learns that Mrs. Malden and the mechanic Ramon Castella were arrested by the Narcotics squad. When Perry arrives at the Hall of Justice a photographer takes him aside to take a posed photograph. There is quite a dramatic scene (Chapter 6)!One important fact is that a car windshield was spattered with bugs, so the driver didn't stop for gas where the attendant would have washed them off (Chapter 7). A gasoline credit card can be used to track a person's purchases. Perry gets information on Gladys Foss' losses from the horse's mouth. Perry visits Stefanie in prison to get the truth (Chapter 9). Is there a commodity that Stefanie doesn't recognize? Perry explains his strategy for the preliminary examination (Chapter 10). Testimony from a criminalist tells how they could trace narcotics sold to a doctor, and the contents of a whisky flask. The preliminary hearing covers the main points, and is the longest chapter. [Did you begin to suspect the solution?] Since the prosecution can't meet Perry's objection, the case is dismissed and Stefanie is released from custody. Perry tells her how to leave, what to do, and where to go. Perry summarizes the case for Della [and the reader]. New evidence is found and Stefanie is re-arrested. Perry continues his investigation (Chapter 15).District Attorney Burger returns to Los Angeles, but loses the publicity to Perry (Chapter 16). Darwin Kirby drank from that flask and soon fell asleep (Chapter 17). The dentist who last worked on Dr. Malden could not positively identify the body. Dr. Malden had been using fluorides to prevent dental caries (Chapter 18). Perry's subpoena of a witness backfires and leads to a contempt citation; but Perry explains how \\"nothing\\" would be proved by this witness! Perry surmises the truthful identity of this witness. In Chapter 19 Perry explains this case.There may have been some humor in Gardner's dedication of this book to Dr. Gerber. Coroner Gerber accused Dr. Sam Sheppard of murdering his wife and ruined Dr. Sam's life."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T.

Even if you do not collect Chick Tracts, you should purchase this book to find out just what Chick is all about by examining the fair and unbiased account the book gives of him and by looking at the reviews of the tracts and comics. Then make up your own mind about Jack based on the evidence and not on what you hear from those who violently oppose him (and even hate him).

Chick: Chick Tracts, Crusader Comics, And Battle Cry Newspapers (Schiffer Books)","review":"This is one book I picked up just to see where it was coming from. Chick Tracts are famous for evoking an ANGRY reaction in folks, and even those who enjoy them tend to hold them out at arm's length and condemn their content, insisting they are chucking &quot;at&quot; them rather than &quot;with&quot; them. But this author bypasses judging Chick's views and just goes straight to the humor of it all. And believe me, there's a lot to laugh at here. In fact, it has a disclaimer/warning in the front advising the more politically correct among us to skip it altogether.The result is a fun romp through the demon-filled world of one of America's biggest conspiracy theorists: Jack Chick, a cartoonist who is said to be the most published author alive (though I wonder how one proves such a thing. Couldn't he just lie about how many he's printed? Then again, I guess that would send him down the grease pole to the lake of fire.)I was surprised how much info was dug up on this otherwise obscure artist, but instead of spoiling the mystery of it all, it really made Chick's story all the more incredible. I mean, here's a guy who practically made a career out of pissing people off, yet the more his enemies tighten their grip on him, the more he slips through their fingers. It's nothing short of amazing.My only gripe is that by including a price guide, it's going to be a lot harder for those of us who have put off finishing our collections to afford to do so. I even found several titles I never even heard of.If you don't &quot;get&quot; check, you shouldn't get this book. But most find his tracts a guilty pleasure. They know they aren't supposed to like them because he's so uncool, but then again, part of being a rebel is rebelling against what soceity tells you shouldn't do... and that includes enjoying Chick tracts!

Chick: Chick Tracts, Crusader Comics, And Battle Cry Newspapers (Schiffer Books)","review":"I write down anything about Jack Chick with some trepedation because as a Christian I have never been quite sure how to take him. The most christian lady I ever knew described these booklets as \\"satanic\\", other Christians have described them as \\"a bit extreme at times\\", and still others have described them as \\"the right message, but brutal\\". No one has ever completely agreed with them, whether they are Christians or not. Non-Christians are usually amused or repulsed or even infuriated by them.Yes, it is true - they show everything in black-and-white terms. Unbelievers are usually loud-mouthed brutes, guffawing, cursing, and snarling their way through life. Believers are angelic and innocent-faced. I suspect he is an ex-Catholic (I have known ex-Catholics as angry, or angrier at the Church as he is) since he seems to feel that every evil in the western world was committed by the Catholic Church, and that the King James Bible is the only valid translation apart from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Koine Greek. he has a lot of opinions, some a little far-out, but some of them are brutally close to the Truth. But they are also very blunt, and sometimes bluntness is not a bad thing, especially in a world that is often too nuanced, too politically correct, and too concerned about giving offense. The Christian message is too important and too precious to not be delivered directly.I first read some of these books in college, decades ago, back when I didn't even know what it meant to even be a Christian. No, these books did not lead to my conversion, but they did present some things I had never heard before, and they made me think about things which had never before crossed my mind.Some of these books are a little crackpot, no doubt. They are a lot more about hellfire and brimstone than what many Christians are comfortable with, and yet in spite of the finger-pointing, I do not really see hatred in them. Any hatred Chick projects is towards Satan, and towards various institutions that he feels have lost their way, or those which never had it in the first place. I don't think he hates individual people at all, but he doesn't hesitate to show that people living apart from God are sinners.Part of me is turned off by these books, yet another part of me enjoys them. You cannot dismiss or ignore them, and that may be their greatest strength. You cannot be unaffected by them.And now you can collect them."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T.

These tracts take on Mormons, Catholics, homosexuals, Muslims, liberals, Satanists... you name it! This books provides \\"reviews\\" of the tracts, some example illustrations, talks about variations in various booklets, some of which have been in print for 40 years.

Also, the book is well illustrated with artwork from Chick Publications tracts and comics. For instance, the author has an excellent overview of the crusaders comic books put out by Chick in the mid to late 1970's. (Amazingly they are still in print. Now however they are showing their age with their 70's styles and communist threat/satanic panic fear mongering.) Also, the book has many rare and early Chick tracts of which I have never even heard. Interestingly he includes textural varients of well known tracts to bring them up to date with current events such as the one called \\"The Last Generation.\\" In short, if you are a collector of Chick tracts this book is a must have."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T. Chick: Chick Tracts, Crusader Comics, And Battle Cry Newspapers (Schiffer Books)","review":"THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO THE ART OF JACK T. CHICK, CHICK TRACTS, CRUSADER COMICS AND BATTLE CRY NEWSPAPERS, Published by SHIFFER BOOKS, is full of the art --and religious philosphy of Jack T. Chick. For those few who have not been exposed to Mr. Chick's works, they can be summed up as follows: 1) VERY good and VERY realistic art, in comic book style 2) A good story teller 3) VERY strong Protestant Christian beliefs.There are many who wish that Mr. Chick had stuck to art -- he draws very well, and also tells stories showing a vivid imagination, with stories one wants to read to their conclusions, (at least, I do.) There are many, I suppose, who wish that Mr. Chick had stuck to writing books on subjects other than religion, and illustrating his own works, or those of others. Because Mr. Chick's religious convictions are VERY strong. VERY Protestant. He takes NO prisoners, and does not for a moment let go of ultra-rightest Protestant thought. This may lead many of his readers to....em...protest. However, everyone is entitled to their opinions -- including religious ones, and Mr. Chick's way of prumulgating his views -- through books and illustrations, is certainly better, (and more plesant to experience), than radio and TV haranguing, or, (as in centuries past), burning and hanging, (which, I realize, nicely rhymes with \\"haranging\\" -- though it wasn't planned that way.)This book -- and any of Mr. Chick's works -- are NOT for the impressionable, whether they are children or adults. The ultra-strong philosophy of Mr. Chick, plus his extra-realistic illustrations, and involving stories -- do make a lasting impression. If you are of a strong Protestant faith, and WANT to pass this on to your children, I would still advise caution here. Unless, that is, your vision of your Protestantism is as uncompromising and total as is Mr. Chick's. For those of other faiths -- and even moderately moderate Protestants -- I would advise caution, as well. Interesting to see another viewpoint, but -- as the co-incidentally-occuring \\"Day of Rapture\\", (which was, as I write these words, just yesterday), didn't take that many people away, (if any at all), sometimes even the strongest of convictions, done with the utmost faith and sincerity, still do NOT always come to pass!For lovers of realistic art, for art students who want to learn to draw, for those curious about what ultra-Protestantism is all about, (yet who are also steadfast enough in their own faiths not to be \\"taken in\\" by involving, well-written stories -- unless they really DO want to convert, and have decided to do so BEFORE reading anything written by Mr. Chick) -- this book can be highly recommended.For -- and very, very strangely, indeed -- books by Mr. Chick, just like books purported to be written about Black Magic and by, or for the Devil, (which, of course, is the Enemy Mr. Chick tirelessly warns and works against), this book, and others by the same author, can truly change one's viewpoint. If, that is, one reads and studies them them long enough, and is not prepared, beforehand, to be have a healthy amount of skepticism in one's mind before opening them."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T. Chick: Chick Tracts, Crusader Comics, And Battle Cry Newspapers (Schiffer Books)","review":"Kurt Kuersteiner did an excellent job of putting this book together and he does a great job of analyzing Jack Chick, even though he doesn't go into depth about whether or not Jack Chick is right or wrong in his theological wars, (as I have done in my own work of Chick). Kuersteiner aimed to look specifically at the artwork and the story telling that have come out of Chick's publications in order to discuss Jack Chick more as a cultural phenomenon, which Kuersteiner did with great success. Kurt also adds his own humor and sarcasm throughout the work which in most cases I found to be spot on.A quick aesthetic note: The artwork in Kuersteiner's book is also quite professional. Kurt was able to reproduce Chick Publications and keep their original feeling, while at the same time meld it together with his own written text. I thought the layout was quite good as well. It was a top notch job.I originally bought this book and interviewed Kurt when I was writing my own book refuting some of Jack Chick's wilder claims and slanders which he produced based on the false testimony the the religious fraudster Alberto Rivera. (My book is calledThou Shalt Not Bear False Witness: The Truth about the Vatican and the Birth of Islam). Kurt Kuersteiner is one hell of a knowledgeable source of information about Jack Chick and his book is definitely the ultimate in depth resource spanning the entire career of Jack Chick and his Chick Publications.

D. McGowan, for example, expected the wrong things from this book while simultaneously purporting the tired arguments of an overtly biased humanist (see his other reviews for further evidence of this). His review isn't entirely without merit--his writing was clear, and hopefully his opinions will help us all in one way or another--but his arguments come across as a little narrow-minded and intolerant.The vast majority of the other reviews, however, help prove that Bierle's research has been deftly presented with a helpful dose of reality.

It is filled with incredibly helpful insights. I have found there are 2 kinds of books on autism --the \\"clinical\\" type which gives descriptions and teaches interventions, as if we're all merely onlookers. The second type is the (auto)biographical. This book is finally a new and much needed genre. Mr. Stillman takes you right into the world of a person with an autistic way of being. It's not an ailment to be \\"fixed\\". He explains how ASD is a way of being. He draws from his experience with many children and adults, filtered through his own Asperger's experience.For example there is the story about a little girl who laughs inappropriately. Rather than lecture us on how to teach her when it is ok to laugh, he explains WHY SHE LAUGHED. (It's hilarious.)I took this story to my (adult)ASD brother. He identified immediately, telling me a few of his own stories. We laughed and laughed!I am the sister, mom, and aunt of people with an autistic way of being. Mr. Stillman's insights have helped me immeasurably in my relationships with them and others. You need to read this."},{"Title":"Demystifying Autistic Experien","review":"Bill Stillman writes with exquisite sensitivity and calls the reader to share that respectful approach. This helps the reader learn how to support the person(s) whom they love who happen to have autistic experiences. Further, this approach leads readers to examine their interactions with all other people.Bill writes about his own experiences as well as the lives of others. These vignettes were wonderful illustrations of how those with autistic experiences live. One of the greatest gifts of this book, however, is its tacit invitation to all readers to examine our own lives. This is especially poignant for those who are \\"typical.\\"I found myself asking if we wouldn't all be better off by recognizing and embracing the autistic features that lay dormant in each one of us. Being sensitive, saying what we mean (and meaning what we say), and recognizing our own difficulties in communication (especially when frustrated) could make life more pleasant for everyone.Those with an autistic experience have much to teach; we all have a responsibility to learn."},{"Title":"Demystifying Autistic Experien","review":"This is a must-read.

Much of the books I have read were redundant in their information and many just didn't apply to my child or our situation. I found myself able to relate possibly to a chapter or two at the most, before I would get discouraged and begin to look for another answer. This is not the case with this book. Bill Stillman is a gifted writer. His intention is to teach those who love someone with autism, how to accept, understand and embrace these precious children. His affection toward children on the spectrum is so evident. His information and explanations are refreshing. Bill has put together a book that is a MAJOR piece of the autism puzzle. His insights and intuitions, as well as his personal experiences and the loving and candid way he shares them are priceless. I am happy to have him on \\"our\\" side.

Our Lives were strange and different but yet we came out well.His event per event account of his autisitc life is true science and a lot of luck in action. His old time account of autism before it was a well 'known' condition is like a fine wine, getting better with time. He proves autism is not this wild unmanagle condition that requires massve intervention. His book is also another (unknowingly) report on Splinter Skills and Obessions and how well they serve the autisic person. They are our Learning Hallway and link to the world. Autisitc obessions have given the world the computer, (Alan Turing 1912-1954) and even Bill's own Wizzard of OZ obession has given the world a perfect Oz experience, in another book he co authored.Bills' inside information and common sense experience from working in the field are 'just what the doctor ordered' and better yet is is based in reality and struggle of an era gone by.

His description of the London poker scene of the 1960s is particularly vivid, as are his tales of the games at Washington's National Press Club, and his ten-year participation in a London \\"Tuesday Night Game.\\" And his account of a Caribbean poker cruise, on which he was a poker instructor, is a gem of a snapshot of the rituals and mores of the poker subculture.Spanier's career as a journalist brought him around the world, and he recounts many of his experiences, both as a correspondent and as a player. This along makes The Hand I Played an interesting book. But Spanier is also able to make the mind of the gambler intelligible to the non-gambler. For example, when talking about the meaning of \\"action\\" on page 51, Spanier notes that it means, \\"playing with chance, taking a challenge, the excitement of living in top gear. In gambling, this is the pay-off. In our routine urban lives, most of us are cogs in the wheel.... Gambling offers a fast way out...the player can give self-indulgence a whirl, briefly cast responsibility aside, and fantasize about a brighter, richer, easier life.\\" Of course, Spanier knows that these fantasies are usually illusory, but they still give gamblers, \\" a little spoonful of hope, which, like honey, is pleasing while it lasts.\\" This general sentiment has been voiced countless times, but rarely this articulately-or with such self-knowledge.The chapter on \\"Net Poker\\" is also valuable, not because it teaches the reader how to win at online poker or because it offers strong arguments for or against online gambling, but because it provides an account of the online poker industry in its earliest years from someone who knows poker intimately. Online gambling may be a short-lived phenomenon or it may mature into a lasting industry, but future social scientists will be grateful for Spanier's thoughtful survey of the virtual poker world of the late 1990s.Spanier also runs a quick historiographical romp through books on Las Vegas and gambling, giving his opinions on several books in the canon. Spanier's refined literary sensibilities temper his enthusiasm for gambling, so he is able to recognize that \\"it is easy to write about Las Vegas, as an abundance of bad journalism proves,\\" (p. 209) but knows that it is difficult to catch the lightning of gambling excitement in a bottle. That Spanier is an arbiter of good and bad writings about Las Vegas may touch a nerve with some Southern Nevadans who resent literary \\"carpetbaggers\\" who, after a weekend in town, claim to interpret Las Vegas to the rest of the world. This is not a point without merit; many of the misleading books about Las Vegas have been by \\"outsiders.\\" But Spanier is no outsider to gambling; he enjoyed a lifelong passion for it that qualifies him as an expert on the subject. But should his writings about Las Vegas be discounted because he is a \\"carpetbagger?'' Absolutely not. While his views may not be the same as longtime residents, they are those of an intelligent, articulate observer who can place the city in the context of a larger global gambling scene.The climax of the book is Spanier's own participation in the 1997 poker World Championship, held at Binion's Horseshoe in Las Vegas. For poker aficionados, this is the obvious equivalent of playing in any world championship. Though Spanier knew going in that he had about as much chance of winning as beating Tiger Woods in golf, the honey spoonful of hope still held out that tiniest chance, which was no doubt intoxicating. There are several accounts of the World Championship, but few from this close-up.In all, The Hand I Played reads like an extended conversation one might have on a long car or plane ride with an intelligent, insightful, gambler. A great deal of Spanier's personality shines through the narrative, so we get not only a look at how poker is played, but a look, sometimes unconsciously, into the mind of a player. This is all the more poignant because the book was published posthumously. But it is a testament to both Spanier and his editors that The Hand I Played is such a riveting work for both players and interested laypeople. A hint to the uninitiated-read the appendix, which explains the basics of Texas Hold 'em, before the book itself. It will add a great deal of depth to Spanier's accounts of games and hands, which otherwise may be impenetrable to non-players.

I cannot make out a single move from the diagrams provided and the few photos are so lacking in what comes between point A and point B that they are useless too. I was glad I didn't pay much for the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"The Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and QiGong is like T'ai Chi itself: simple but complex, multilayered, giving something to everyone, no matter how much or how little time you have to spend. I have been trying to learn T'ai Chi for over 10 years. Many books and videos just make it all seem so complicated and overwhelming. But this book, like others in the Idiot's series, breaks T'ai Chi down, one step at a time. You can pick up the book for 5 minutes and learn a lot, just by reading several of the small boxes in the margins. The seated QiGong meditation written in Part 3 is worth the price of the book alone.This author's attitude and advice that a student should \\"play T'ai Chi\\" was just what I needed to hear. There is no need to get the whole form, all the postures, and everything right. You can receive great benefits from just slowing down, starting at whatever level you are, and \\"playing\\" with any small part of the process. The author has been criticized for promoting his own videos in the CD attached to this book. I thought that at first, too, but I can see that he's just giving a taste for students to practice and play with, then noting that there is much, much more to come if one continues on this path. I don't find that a flaw, I find it a strength. This multilayered quality is what keeps me coming back to T'ai Chi again and again. Every time I do a class or a video, I have so much energy that day and the next few that I keep saying, \\"I want more of that!\\"This book is a good investment, an aid to help you tune into the ultimate free and renewable source of energy in the universe that is found within each and every one of us at all times. The benefits of practicing T'ai Chi are given immediately, the day you begin. But more and more new channels continue to open slowly, one step at a time, as we learn each part and then keep relearning it thereafter, layer after layer. I thank Bill Douglas for making this sometimes esoteric-seeming knowledge accessible to everyone."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"A fair while back when I was just beginning my queries and foray into Taijiquan, this was the first book I purchased. As a beginner's aide for an overview of the subject, it was a friendly and helpful introduction. Now that I am broadening my studies, there are books I bought early on that I still continue to use; this book is not one of them. The information contained in this book, compared to others, is incomplete in detail and provides only enough to wet your appetite. At the price, I wouldn't call this book a bargain meal or a waste of money, but I would suggest you check for it in your local public library before purchasing it. More than likely, it is a book you will quickly outgrow (within months at most) if your interest in Taijiquan (or Qigong for that matter) is more than a passing phase."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I purchased this book because it has pictures and explanation for a pretty rare style of tai chi, originally taught in San Francisco by Kuo Yuo (? sp) Ling. The author seems sincere and experienced, but the book is a let down with its superficial approach. It treats the reader like an idiot. I suppose this is to be expected from the title. If this is your first book on tai chi or qi gong, it isn't the worst place to start. But if you are looking for something meatier, try the books from Dr. Yang Jwing-ming or Mantak Chia. Dr. Yang has some books on tai chi and Chi Kung plus a book on the Eight Pieces of Brocade which is INFINITELY easier to learn from a book than the qigong in this book. Even easier are the purely standing postures in The Way of Energy by Lam Kam Chuen.BTW, the book is probably deserving of the 5 stars awarded by other reviewers in terms of sincerity, it is just lacking in content.Finally, two very important teachers of this style are left out of the appendix: Simmone Kuo, who took over her husband's studio in San Francisco's Chinatown, and Master Chiang at the Wen Wu school in El Cerrito (near San Francisco), California."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I have had a long time interest in Tai Chi, this book has provided information that has been very hepful to me.

We tried acouple different videos but we were having a hard time grasping it. I then purchased this book and we now have a much better understanding of the art of T'ai Chi. This book tells you the whole ins and outs of T'ai Chi. It not only gives you a great understanding of the movements involved but it also explains what you should be feeling when performing T'ai Chi. To put it simple. T'ai Chi is for everyone. It's a relaxing exercise that you can perform anywhere without even breaking a sweat. If you are considering T'ai Chi I strongly recommend this book. It will most assuredly clear up any problems you may encounter in performing T'ai Chi on your own."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"The T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion (Sifu Hong Yijiao) &amp; Team USA Martial Arts Coach (Michael Steward, Sr.) captured the essence of this book.

Instead, what I received was a poorly veiled advertisement for the author's 4 DVD set of instructional videos.While the book does contain certain valuable facts about Tai Chi (history, etc), this is not something that you can pick up and begin doing Tai Chi exercises within an hour. The DVD on the other hand is almost completely useless and while advertising the full length 4 DVD set - looks as if it were filmed in the author's living room with long curtains hiding his sofa.I would not recommend this product. Two stars b/c the book isn't all that bad - but is not a practical application of Tai Chi - and that may have been my mistake."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"QiGong (chee kung) means &quot;breath work.&quot; Chinese references include nearly 7,000 QiGong exercises, some of which may be done while sitting or lying down. T'ai Chi (tie chee) is a form of QiGong. All T'ai Chi exercises are done while standing or moving. Bill Douglas has studied and taught QiGong and T'ai Chi for twenty years. His latest book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and QiGong, presents his accumulated knowledge in an easy-to-understand guide. Douglas says that &quot;whether you are stressed out, continually exhausted, treating a health problem, or just wanting to get in shape and feel young again, T'ai Chi is just what you need.&quot; Qi is also known as the &quot;energy of life.&quot; Stress, tension, and ill health stop the flow of Qi throughout the body. T'ai Chi exercises are easy to do, incorporating breathing and relaxation techniques in slow and relaxed movements. Douglas describes each exercise thoroughly, including information not just on the physical movement, but on the mental awareness it brings as well. Photographs accompany each exercise. He includes a section of advanced movements for those who have mastered the basics. He also includes special sections for children, seniors, sports, and healing therapy. The appendix lists organizations and energy work centers for those desiring to practice with others. Douglas also includes a complete glossary. More than 2,000 years old, T'ai Chi is the most popular exercise today. People like it not only for its simplicity, but because it &quot;simultaneously heals the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual body.&quot; Readers wanting to learn how to obtain these benefits for themselves will find that The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and QiGong provides the answers to their questions as well as the &quot;how-to&quot; they need. -- Sandra I. Smith, Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I have been interested in Tai Chi and QiGong for many years. I found all of the books interesting but just could not get myself to follow through. This book is fun to read, very motivating and you REALLY do feel a difference. I have found the Sitting QiGong a wonder after work. I wish I could give it more stars!!!!! Hope he writes more books."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I picked up this book in hopes of improving my teaching abilities. While it didn't really contribute to this, it's a good book for beginners, despite some misstatements (A. The people you see in other tai chi books aren't models, they're usually model students, B. David Carradine didn't do Tai Chi in the 'Kung fu' TV series, he did Tai Chi Praying Mantis, which is a hybrid art, and C. the cover claims 'Highly Illustrated instuction on the major Tai Chi styles', whereupon the only illustrated instruction is in the Kuang Ping and Mulan styles). Otherwise, Mr. Douglas covers his subject pretty well, and is fairly well-informed. Great book for beginners, albeit a little too 'New Agey'."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"The author tries to present the theory and the practice of tai chi and ends up doing neither effectively. In the first 13 chapters, he goes through endless psychobabble, new age stuff.Finally, he begins presenting the form in Chapter 15 (after a chapter of the history of the form which is largely redundant of what came before). In chapter 15 he presents 12 movements. Each movement concists of 4 to 6 instructions, but only one photograph. In Chapter 16, he writes, &quot;This chpater will give you an overview of movements 13 through 25 of the Kuang Ping form. Rather than detailing the movements, this chapter will focus on some of the benefits of each moment.&quot; What follows is one photo for each movement and a paragraph telling the reading the benefits of this previous movement. This is tedious and redundant and not at all helpful for someone who wishes to learn the form.If the reader wants to know the theory of tai chi, an excellent book is &quot;The Complete Illustrated Guide to Tai Chi&quot; by Angus Clark. He presents Chinese philosophy within a Chinese setting not in New AGe babble.If the reader wants to learn the form of tai chi, an excellent book is &quot;Tai Chi, For Inner Harmony and Balance&quot; by Paul Tucker. In this book, he presents a short form with amble photographs and illustrations and breaks the book into 31 very management lessons. The Tucker book is an excellent book.Do not waste your time and money on the Douglas book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"Before I begin with my review, let me share a brief anecdote on tai chi: about a year ago, I was at a town watch meeting and met a retired gentleman who lives in my neighborhood. I am a qigong practicioner, and he practices tai chi. He told me that, for 20 years, he had chronic back pain. Then he began to practice tai chi, and within a few months he no longer had this back pain that he'd suffered every day for 20 years.Now, you can accept the traditional chinese rationale for this relief, or you can rationalize it any other way you like, but the fact remains that many people, like this neighbor of mine, have benefited from tai chi and qigong. You can too.Anyway, back to the book. This 2nd edition is of a larger format than the standard \\"Idiot's\\" books, and is well illustrated to show the various stances and movements in tai chi. Mr. Douglas' writing style is entertaining, and I found the book to be informative.On the negative side, there were a few things I disagreed with. For example, the name of the taoist master Lao Tzu is pronounced, according to Mr. Douglas, as \\"Lao Dzoo\\". However, fellow taoist and qigong master Ken Cohen, who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, says it is pronounced \\"Lao Dzuh\\". I'm inclined to go with Master Cohen on this one, as he is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese. Also, Mr. Douglas says in this book that the I Ching is a \\"game\\", which it most certainly is not.However, despite these misgivings, I found the information related to tai chi and qigong to be well-written and helpful, and this book is a worthy addition to my bookshelf. If you are interested in qigong only, I would recommend \\"The Way Of Qigong\\", by the aforementioned Ken Cohen."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I have been studying Tai Chi for over 15 years and am the owner of my own Tai Chi school. I have often thought \\"I need to write a textbook for my new Tai Chi students\\" but I have never had the time. I am thrilled to say that I no longer have to do it because Bill Douglas has done it for me!!! I love it! I have found it to be an excellent resource and I am offering it to all of my students. Mr. Douglas is to be commended for his wonderful contribution. I think that his user-friendly format is ideal, his communication style effective, and his information is sound. If you are a beginner, this book will definitely help you to learn and understand Tai Chi. If you are an instructor, this book will make you a better teacher! Get it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I consider Bill Douglas's \\"Complete Idiot's Guide to Tai Chi and Qigong\\" the \\"best book on the market for a beginner\\" precisely because it doesn't just teach a form. It does show one form, the Kwang Ping long form, in considerable detail; but the real value of the book is that it covers a lot of territory relating to tai chi and qigong quickly and amusingly.The average westerner who decides to try tai chi knows very little about what he's getting into. Reading Douglas's book is one of the quickest ways to acquire a little background--something to help you understand what you hear in class, remind you of the things you couldn't take in because you were fully occupied trying to get the next movement, give you \\"enough to be going on with\\" in your own further reading--and tell you what to expect (and look for) in a class before you get there.I don't know any other book that crams as much about as many different subjects relating to tai chi and qigong into as little space as painlessly. Jou's book, \\"The Tao of Taijiquan\\", while excellent, and one of the very few that, like Douglas's book seeks to go beyond style to what is essential to all styles of tai chi, is not exactly light reading. It will tell you much more in much greater depth than the average beginner is likely to sit still for or be able to understand or appreciate. Reading Douglas first is an excellent idea, and what I recommended to my students when I was a leading a tai chi practice group.The comment has been made that the form described and pictured in this book is an unusual one that won't help you \\"fit in\\" to classes you might find more readily on various Yang forms, but for a real beginner (the \\"complete idiot\\" of the title), some examples were necessary, and Douglas quite reasonably used his own style. It isn't the one I do or taught in the practice group, but that doesn't make the bulk of Douglas's book irrelevant. Most of his material is general enough to be useful background for any style you choose--and if, like me, you choose a style that's so uncommon in your area you have to be very largely your own teacher, it's a great boon to find a book to help you fill the gaps in all that background information you, as your sifu with a fool for a student, didn't know to tell yourself to start with."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"Stress at work. Find yourself sitting in front of the television all weekend. Turning into a zombie? Been there, done that.Let me clarify this: I've never been 'up' on the Eastern arts, and until I picked up this book, I had no clue about Eastern Medicine. As a 'good Christian boy', that sounded a bit outside my realm.But, after reading Mr. Douglas' book and watching hte included DVD, I must say that I have fallen for Tai Chi and Qi-Gong 100% !!!The breathing techniques you learn early on help tremendously, especially when done daily.Now that I've read the book, I have been actively seeking a Tai Chi class here in my hometown.Easy to read and simple to follow, Mr. Douglas presents Tai Chi in a way that anyone could understand.Oh, and if you have physical limitations, DO NOT WORRY! Mr. Douglas includes information that demonstrates how you can participate in Tai Chi, too!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"As both a student and teacher of the Martial Arts, I understand how difficult and baffling some of these concepts can be. I understand how intimidating it can be for the beginner to seek out safe and credible instruction, especially women. And, to be honest, I know how difficult it is to find a &quot;sense of humor&quot; in such a traditionally austere atmosphere. As a Registered Nurse in an urban emergency department, I also know how timely and practical these practices are for our health and well being in today's heath care crisis. For these reasons and quite a few more The Idiot's Guide to Tai Chi and QI Gong is an incredible book and an important one. Mr. Douglas has achieved what I believe to be the desire of every good teacher: to simplify and convey extremely difficult information accurately. He gives the reader an excellent sense of what Tai Chi/Qi Gong is and how it works. He gives solid advice on evaluating a teacher and how to get started in a class. Many of the questions commonly asked by students are very clearly addressed and answered. And because of his methodical approach (and tons of pictures) this book is also perfect for people who have limited time or opportunity but might want to explore these practices on their own. The fact that he accomplished this with a good sense of humor is only icing on the cake. After years of reading the &quot;traditional&quot; texts, this book was a delightful breath of fresh air. He has achieved for Qi Gong what Apple did for the computer. He's brought it to the people. Anyone interested can now &quot;get it&quot; and have a good laugh too. Mr. Douglas' book is a great place to start for the beginner as well as an excellent place for &quot;seasoned vets&quot; to check in on simplicity. In fact, teachers may find this an excellent manual &quot;on how to explain these concepts to the general public&quot;, and may also find that by referring students to the book as a primer, the students may be more likely to stick with their T'ai Chi classes, and be more relaxed and easier to teach. It is perfect for people who might have health problems and believe Martial Arts are only for the strong or the fit. Most importantly, it is an excellent way to help anyone develop a &quot;Tai Chi&quot; relationship with themselves and their world.

It doesn't matter whether you study the long or short forms (and there are several out there!) or do your QiGong standing or sitting. The DVD is a great companion to the book as well.It is important, when reading books on this Art, that you try and not compare what was taught to you (or not) in your class. Although there are five main styles of T'ai Chi taught, it is easy to forget that, once passed down from teacher to student (and then students becomes teacher, and so on), that some of the original form(s) change with the individual. This book was not published with just the author's style of T'ai Chi and QiGong in mind. It is \\"generic\\" enough to fit ALL styles (did I say that already?), yet holds true to the 13 principals. Isn't that what T'ai Chi is all about?Bill Douglas is a credit to T'ai Chi and QiGong and has dedicated much of his time and energy towards taking the \\"mystery\\" out of this wonderful Art.

It simply was not fun to do. But Bill's tapes are relaxing, enjoyable and very user friendly and helps me want to come back to tai chi everyday. Today I ordered the other two vols. in the videos serries: &quot;Tai chi &amp; Qigong: The Prescription for the Future&quot; I can't wait till I get them.Thanks Bill for these enjoyable Book and video tapes to express who I really am.Enjoy the journey!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is one of the most entertaining that I have (of all my books, not just tai chi.) It also speeds up the learning process as well because you are enjoying and remembering what you are reading. The Kuang Ping Yang style that is presented is not the style that I practice but the book is absolutely loaded with both essential and interesting information. If you want a fun book that has everything a beginner needs to know but does not act as a sleeping pill, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it's a lot of fun. And you know something, that's actually the key to learning and eventually gaining success in both tai chi and chi gung. By being relaxed, by having a good time, by just being yourself, that's were mastery really comes from. I've extensively practiced Chi Gung for over 32 years and I found plenty of new insights in Bill's book.L.V.

I can't tell you what a difference the book and DVD have made in my life. I am sleeping better, my career is looking up (stress was a major problem for me; I write and was dealing with life-changing stress-induced writer's block) based on lessons I'm learning from T'ai Chi and QiGong meditation. This is feeling life-long. Thank you, thank you, thank you."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"It's always good to see material from the Guang Ping Yang side of the tracks, but it's a shame it couldn't go into more depth. Like all books on Tai Chi, it is insufficient for learning from scratch if you want to have any real ability, but may be somewhat useful as a reference to someone with some actual experience in the art (I myself have studied Tai Chi for 8 years). That being said, if you want meatier reading and more in depth discussion of concepts, one would be much better served by one of Yang Jwing Ming's books which go on to discuss the concepts in great depth, particularly in his Advanced Yang Tai Chi books.The book is a fun read, but the actual technical portions will be of little use to the beginners that it is aimed at and the advanced practitioners will find much that they already know (assuming they have studied with a decent teacher - something there are far too few of in the US)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"This book gives a good, understandable introduction to the mysteries of Tai Chi Chuan. I had many questions about Chi, Chi Kung and the Taoist background of Tai Chi. This book went a long way to answering my questions. The instructions on how to do the forms, however, leave a lot to be desired. It would be extremely difficult to learn the form from Douglas' photos and comentary. Any how-to instructions on Tai Chi need good photos to show beginning and ending postures and transitions to fully comunicate the movements. This book is lacking in this reguard."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"If you want to learn the form of this style, look else ware.

The problem that I have with this book is the extra pages that could have been removed along with all the silliness. It follows the &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide...&quot; formula and is designed to be a light hearted reference. The information civered is pretty complete, but I think the author's comparison between Yoga and T'ai Chi &amp; QiGong seems speculative and it's doubtful to me that the author has a lot of experience in all of these subjects.I like this book and bought it to suppliment my more serious Martial collection because a lot of texts assume that the readed either speaks fluent Chinese or was raised in the 13th century. I would recommend this to anyone though, regardless of experience level."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a great book on Tai Chi and QiGong.

Sadly, that's what I did in choosing this book. The positive reviews were so positive, that I thought for sure it would be valuable. But that has not been my experience. So far I've read 75 pages, and all I've seen are chapter after chapter extolling the virtues of Tai Chi, Chi Gong, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Acupuncture. The only actual exercise or movement or anything actionable so far has been the instruction to breathe deeply and relax as I exhale. That's it. If you want to pay good money for a really long-winded info-mercial for this man's not-so-reasonably priced DVD (almost $70 for one single DVD!), then by all means, buy this book. If you want to learn anything useful about Tai Chi, I would advise you to look elsewhere.How do I explain all those rave reviews? I figure this man must either have a really big family or one heckuva publicity agency. Either way, be forewarned: It's all hype."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"Bill Douglas has written the best book I have seen to introduce the total novice to this wonderful art.

The DVD that was included with the book was a disappointment to me also and was one hint after another to purchase the whole program from the author. The DVD also seemed to lack the essence of Tai Chi/Qigong and was very choppy (since of course it was actually a preview of the author's full length DVD program). I will refer to the book again but I don't ever want to suffer through the included DVD again."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I bought this book out of curiousity initially, but the more I read it the more I realized &quot;Hey, this might actually be good for me&quot;. Now, I am pretty deep into learning Tai Chi and I frequently just pick up this book and begin reading. It is easy to read and I seem to learn something new each time I read it. Yes, you can actually learn Tai Chi by using this book but most of all you get an appreciation of what Tai Chi is, what it can do for you, and why all those Chinese people do it every day. I went on to order the Video and I am really glad I did. It helps to see the speed (very slow) of the movements and it is easier to copy the author's movements on video rather than constantly refering to the book to see what to do next. I don't have the luxury of fixed hours in my job and this allows me to learn Tai Chi with out having to try to attend classes and it is really cheaper than going to classes also. Think of this book as TAI CHI instruction written in an informative and relaxed American style. Not a &quot;dry&quot; book at all and includes info on QiGong and other aspects of Tai Chi. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"I am a new student of Tai Chi.

I had higher expectations from a Complete Idiot's Guide.One of the more laughable claims in the book, is that the information presented within will make you a Qi Gong master. In truth, the Qi Gong info presented is cursory and superficial at best, and only covers the bare basics.The Taiji Quan section is also very disappointing. It is the (shortened, I believe) QuangPing Yang style form presented in photo stills with no visual indication of transition between postures, no directional arrows which are normally a big help. The movements for the hand form, the 12 movement sword form, and the fan form are difficult to follow.There is absolutely no discussion of the 13 postures or the Taiji classics, which makes this book worthless to anyone looking for solid, well rounded information on Taiji Quan, something a book claiming to be an Idiot's Guide should most definitely include. If you have access to the internet, you already have access to all of the information presented in this book. If you are already somewhat familiar with Taiji Quan, you have no need of this book at all.As a better source of information for beginners, I would recommend:-Cheng M'an Ching's \\"Master Cheng's New Method of Taichi Ch'uan Self-Cultivation\\"-Yang Jwing Ming's \\"Tai Chi Theory and Martial Power\\"-Lawrence Galante's \\"Tai Chi, the Supreme Ultimate.\\"For Qi Gong:-Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's \\"Roots of Chinese Qi Gong\\"-Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's \\"Qigong, The Secret of Youth\\"-Mantak Chia's \\"Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao\\"These books have simple, easy to follow diagrams, weight distribution charts, foot placement charts, and breathing instructions, as well as some info on the classics, which will give you far more use and information than this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"Length:: 0:55 MinsThis is a brief video note receiving and recommending the Complete Idiot's Guide to Tai Chi & Qigong."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi & QiGong (2nd Edition)","review":"Ordered this book along with T'ai Chi for Dummies.

Layed out in the popular &quot;For Dummies&quot; style, the writer covers a ton of ground. Very informative. He even discusses what to wear and how to find a good instructor. What isn't covered (in any great detail any way) is how to do tai chi. There is an exhaustive section of Qi Gong excercises, but the section on a modern Tai Chi form is rushed. Each movement is only accompanied by one poorly printed photograph and a very abbreviated explination. But, as a suppliment, this book is priceless.

She presents the argument that heavy metal and roleplaying games will cause teenagers to kill themselves, kill others, and worship the devil.It's sad that a person can believe this, and devote so much time to this. I'm sure when Gary Gygax sat down in 1970 to write Dungeons and Dragons he said 'right, my ultimate goal here is to make teenagers worship satan Hahahahaha (maniacle laughter no doubt followed). Or Judas Priest said 'yes, if we make our fans kill themselves then we'll have none left! ha! Brilliant!'An interesting book, but only when viewed from afar, as a study in how deluded some people can really be."},{"Title":"The Devil's Web: Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan","review":"I possess graduate degrees in Psychology and Teaching and I can attest that this books only value is as an example of incompetent statistics and poor logic. Sure, everybody can have an opinion, but Pat Pulling was a bold-faced liar. When she couldn't get evidence to support her hypothesis, she simply generated it. It is almost humerous if it wasn't such a good example of a person on a Quixotic crusade to explain a tragic incident in their own life and getting nowhere. The really sad part is that if somebody was intelligent and wanted to generate a case for what she argues, it could be done, even if it was as erroneous as her book. She doesn't even tell a convincing lie. It was sad that she never received the correct grief counseling by competent individuals before she passed on a few years ago. I hope her tortured psyche can rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Devil's Web: Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan","review":"Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about &quot;breaking with reality&quot;, and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what &quot;facts&quot; she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think &quot;not keeping guns in the house&quot; and &quot;not letting your child butcher pets&quot; (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&amp;D. Besides if you get rid of D&amp;D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?"},{"Title":"The Devil's Web: Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan","review":"As a person who has played roleplaying games for several years, I can assure everyone that there is nobody less suicidal than me. Pat Pulling, though understandably grief-ridden at the suicide of her son, has taken her grief to far, and is using D&amp;D as a scapegoat. If her son had played tennis before he killed himself she may well have ended up making some daft theory about tennis. Sadly, since D&amp;D is something of a fringe hobby (although the roleplaying hobby is growing all the time) many people were fooled by her and her Fundamentalist cohorts."},{"Title":"The Devil's Web: Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan","review":"Well I will start off by saying that everyone is entitled to an opinion. However for those who have read this book and can not clearly see that society takes D&amp;D to be a less serious issue than it is...they are mistaken. Some may think that &quot;Bink&quot;, Pats son, may not have killed himself because of D&amp;D. If you read the book and research it as Pat did you will see that there are dangers in any occult activity or demonic games such as this one...It's unfortunate that there are so many other games out there that teenagers get involved in today. I believe in Pat very much and all that she has said...you should too!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Web: Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan","review":"The other reviewers are way off base and have clearly lost their objectivity because thay have engaged in role playing &quot;games.&quot; While I am sure thay are good people and have not found themselves in the situation of this unfortunate young man who had everything to live for, any break with reality is no game. There is a clinical name for this: schizophrenia. Pat Pulling never intended to conclude that EVERY person who plays D&amp;D will end up like her son. However, only a fool fails to see the impact of role playing which is designed to break with reality, especally after the recent monsterous activities of youth in highschools across America (i.e. Columbine, et. al.). Mrs. Pulling has done well to caution others to the dangers of breaking with reality. The risk one takes is uncommonly stupid. If this tradgedy struck once, it is once too many. Perhaps if other parents and teachers had heeded her advice Columbine would be just a highschool and not a place synonymous with death and destruction. Read this book. Pass it to a friend. If you must err, err on the side of caution. At least your child(ren) will still be alive! I am sure Pat Pulling wishes she had."},{"Title":"Don't Look Now","review":"Du Maurier has a clear talent for writing intelligent, engaging prose in a very accessible, clear style. Her characters are real, and their conversations are completely believable. My favorite of the five tales featured here was the title story; like du Maurier's classic novel Rebecca, this is a taunt psychological thriller with a surprise ending. In the second story, &quot;The Breakthrough,&quot; the standard search for life after death is presented in a unique light. My least-favorite story of the book was the third, &quot;Not After Midnight,&quot; as it had a disappointing ending which I still don't fully understand. In the fourth story, &quot;A Border-line Case,&quot; the characters are less believable than is typical for du Maurier, yet the story is still worthwhile. Finally, for the last tale, &quot;The Way of the Cross,&quot; du Maurier takes a different tact by telling the story from the perspectives of several main characters rather than just one, and the positive result is less thriller, more human interest. du Maurier is an excellent storyteller, and most readers are likely to find something to praise in at least one of this book's well-written stories."},{"Title":"Don't Look Now","review":"Classic Du Maurier! &quot;A Borderline Case&quot; was my favorite, with the title story (&quot;Don't Look Now&quot;) a close second.

I purchased it for the story &quot;Don't Look Now&quot;, which is often said is a mere shadow of what I think is a great film(even though the book came first). I felt that all of the stories pulled you in to begin with, but the endings were just flat? &quot;Not after Midnight&quot; was pretty good but again the ending did no justice. &quot;The Way of the Cross&quot; was also interesting, great character development from the little boy &quot;Robin&quot; way too wise for his age and &quot;Rev. Babcock&quot; talk about conflicted! But again the ending just left you empty? Not that I wanted blood and ghastliness, but just a bit more force or painful irony,&agrave; la &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;This is a good book to read to and from work (if you take the train or bus of course!)"},{"Title":"Don't Look Now","review":"Daphne du Maurier's &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; is an exceptional collection of short stories. My favorite is &quot;A Border-Line Case.&quot; The sense of place of the small island on which Ballyfane Castle in Ireland is located is exquisitely described. Also, the plot unfolds at a boiler pace and doesn't let down until the final reversal. Shelagh starts the story with her father's odd death. Obviously closer to her dad than her mom, she seeks to uncover a bit about his past before beginning her role with the theatre company. This leads her to seek out Commander Nicolas Barry. She is taken almost forcefully in the dead of night in a boat over to the island, her belongings are fetched from the Kilmore Arms hotel, and she finds herself a guest of the unusual Commander Nicolas Barry almost against her will. Add to this the strangeness of seeing her parents' wedding picture in his living room with Barry's head superimposed over where her father's head should be. From there she tries to figure out what is going on here as this woman-less band of 12 men populate the island. Thinking they might possibly be homosexuals, she finds herself as they are digging at an excavation on the island. Finally, the novel speeds to its climax as we suddenly find ourselves square in the middle of Irish Republican Army bombings. The final reversal at the end caps off an incredible short story.It was &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; that was made into the great 70s film with Donald Sutherland &amp; Julie Christie. This is also a marvelous tale of intrigue as a couple tries to adjust to the loss of a child. Add to this the flare of Venice with its canals and travel by boat, two strange sisters with psychic ability who claim the dead child is trying to communicate, and we come up with another tremendously satisfying story.&quot;The Breakthrough&quot; with its emphasis on science and trying to have a computer capture a living essence at the moment of death is rather like H.G. Wells' science fiction. &quot;Not After Midnight&quot; also has a tremendous sense of place as an English tutor holidays in Greece. I was a bit confused at the end as to why the story began with him resigning his post, but the story is populated with great characters. The final story &quot;The Way of the Cross&quot; works somewhat less well with quite a huge cast of characters to shuffle through 70 pages, which kept me trying to figure out who went with whom.All in all, this is an excellent collection of short stories by a great writer.

I closed this book realizing, that after these stories, along with \\"Rebecca,\\" that du Maurier has a very monotone and bland style of writing; she often goes of on pointless tangents. \\"Pointless\\" is the ever returning word when speaking of du Maurier's writing.

One of the most interesting sectors for viewing that is the relationship between the radical left in the U.S. and Europe and Maoist China. The left deeply loved Mao, and China was held up as a model for socialist utopia. The left didn't actually know anything about what was going on in China, but that didn't stop them from falling in love.It is within that context that a worldly old Belgian newspaper reporter named Jacques Marcuse wrote a brilliant work on what he saw when he traveled through China during that period. The result is a gutsy piece of integrity. Marcuse dared to question orthodoxy, and debunked the propaganda. He knew the truth about the past and dared to say it. The result, sadly was much ignored in the U.S., in no small measure because it called into question the deeply held beliefs of leftist professors in Econ and Poly Sci departments. Worse, the book was ignored in Journalism departments, despite being an exciting piece of reporting. Marcuse beats Tom Wolfe to 'New Journalism' by nearly a decade. Be among the few in this country (U.S.) who have read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"Du Bois took a revolutionary new look at Reconstruction in the 1930's, providing a fresh view that went largely ignored until recent books by Foner and Litwack resuscitated this overlooked period in American history. Du Bois summons up his great intellectual bearing to illustrate that from being the unmitigated failure that Reconstruction has long been portrayed as, it was the crucible of civil rights legislation, a time when there was very definitely hope that America would redefine itself along more egalitarian lines. While the book deals predominately with the black man's point of view, Du Bois offers a principled Marxist view of labor relations at the time, and how the leading Radical Republicans tried to come to terms with the new industrial society that was emerging in America.Du Bois was a very compelling writer, he cuts through the layers of history to reveal the soul of the persons most greatly affected by Reconstruction. He charts the troubled waters of the Civil War, and the Presidential attempts at Reconstruction which followed the Union victories in the South. He provides a candid view of Lincoln, who struggled with his own prejudices, but eventually came to accept the black man because of the pivotal role he played in the war. Ironically, Du Bois noted a black did not become a man until he showed he could hold a gun in battle.Du Bois felt Lincoln really did alter his views during the course of the war, no longer favoring the colonist view held by many that blacks should be repatriated to Africa. However, Du Bois felt that Lincoln lacked the convictions to really push forward Reconstruction, that his principal concern remained in reclaiming the Southern states in the Union.The mighty task of Reconstruction was left up to the Radical Republicans in Congress and the &quot;Black&quot; legislatures that emerges in the South during this time. Du Bois refutes the Dunning-Bowers view that blacks were incapable of forming governments, by providing a chapter on &quot;The Black Proletariat in South Carolina.&quot; Here, he shows that blacks fully recognized the enormity of this most propitious moment, but that they ran up against a set of state and federal courts, which refused to hold up their decisions. While blacks were now members of state legislatures and of the US Congress, they did not take over the South, as is often described. Even in South Carolina, where blacks outnumbered whites, blacks were only temporarily able to seize control of the legislature, and force a new state constitution.This is the book that forms the basis for Foner's excellent book, Reconstruction. Du Bois was the first to realize that Reconstruction was more than just an epilog to the Civil War, but the beginning of the long road to freedom, which took nearly 100 years in the making for blacks in America."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"Given the way race relations have unfolded since the book was written, WEB DuBois' tome is THE essential work on the most pivotal and one of the most grossly underrated periods of American history.Since it is told from the vantage point of a Black American, it stands as one of the essential missing voices in an otherwise neatly politicized and racially sanitized periods of American history and areas of American historical scholarship.DuBois, writing with an impressive flair, is not bashful about giving credit where it is due, whether to noble and humane slave owners or to the vastly underrated and seldom reported contributions of Negroes during this period. This emphasis alone is a display of courage unlikely to be found except in very rare instances in other books on this subject.Despite its flair, the book is still dense with details that only a first rate historian could uncover and organize so well. And although the book has been criticized for being too much of a Marxist economic analysis, it is nevertheless accurate, has the full ring of truth and remains relatively non-polemical. And for one partial to non-Marxist economic analyses, I find rather strangely that DuBois' Marxist analysis seems the appropriate tool uniquely suited for analyzing the circumstances of this particular era of American history.In short, the book is not just another oblique harangue against the American system of racism as it was practiced during the reconstruction era--or as it has been practiced during any era for that matter.Along side Eric Froner's book, &quot;Reconstruction,&quot; this is another tour de force. For essential reading on one of the most important periods in American history, one is unlikely to find in print a better book on this subject. Amen."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"If history is a matter of recapturing lost voices, Du Bois does so splendidly in Black Reconstruction. It is somewhat of a tome: this is not summer beach reading. Instead, Du Bois systematically reveals Reconstruction as a critical period of economic and legal development in American history. Themes touched on are black rights, the fledgling American worker's movement, the rise of the corporation, and the corrupt nature of Southern AND Northern American politics vis a vis wealthy white landowners.If you are interested in a Marxist interpretation of 19th century American history, the general history of Reconstruction itself, or the history of the Civil War, this is a must-read. If you are even remotely curious about the history of civil rights in America, this is a must-read. If you are interested in American history whatsoever, you will not regret reading this book. By all rights, it should be a part of every high school curriculum."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"Education, Economics, Power. Exploitation of human over human. The revisionist accounts of history. All of these elements which lead naturally to racism have a central role in this monumental effort by W.E.B. Du Bois. He received a Rosenwald scholarship and two years time to research and write this book, which was a one of a kind when it was published in 1935. Most studies of the 10 years immediately following the Civil War (the period known as Reconstruction) had naturally extended the assumed inferiority of an entire race of people into a level of laziness and corruption that appeared to be unprecedented. These versions of history have extended up to our present time, as this is the first encounter I have had with this view of Reconstruction. It is certainly not the common view that is taught in our schools and colleges. The reasons for this \\"historical blind spot\\" are debatable. It could be the Marxian economics that are obvious in the text, it could be that this period of history is an embarrassment to the nation, or it could be that racism is still inherent and blatant in our culture. I believe that all three have a part in the writing of today's textbooks.Du Bois had to begin this book by stating that he wrote this version of Reconstruction with the view that the African American is in fact a human being. That statement alone summed up 300 years of assumed inferiority that continues in the re-writing of history to this moment. To many of us it is hard to imagine the level of ignorance and the false sense of superiority that would have to be achieved in order to directly hold another race of people involuntarily in servitude. At the same time, we engage in work and consumption in a Capitalistic society that makes our way of life possible by exploiting the work of other humans at below subsistence wages...or in virtual slavery. These faces are not always as obvious as they were in the period of chattel slavery in American history, but they are just as human. Du Bois touches on this topic in the book, and makes the startling (and prophetic) observation that more often than not these peoples are those of color. If we think about the worst exploitation on the planet today, we can see that this is true. It is the northern hemisphere of the planet that seems to keep the southern in subjection, striking a startling parallel to the North and South in the period of Reconstruction.The Civil War itself is approached from a different perspective than what we are taught in our schools. Lincoln is portrayed fairly and accurately as a man who only came to terms with the idea of freeing the slaves when he saw how effectively they fought in the war. It is a shame that it took this bloodshed for him to see the humanity of the race.Perhaps the most important element of the book for its time was the example of the eagerness of the freedmen to build schools and to hold political office. The freedmen took these efforts seriously, and against all odds, kept basic education and their power with the ballot alive. It is only due to the fact that the various economic forces were able to keep the war going that the African American was once again subjected to virtual slavery.It is beyond the scope of this book to examine the Civil Rights movements of the 20th century, but an important and truthful foundation is laid here. Without reading and understanding this work of Du Bois, it is hard to establish a clear picture of the era of race relations that was to follow. From an economic perspective, it is easy to see how the negative aspects of race relations are essential to the power of the rich. This idea permeates the book and shows the roots of the hatred that created one of the great travesties in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"This book changed my life. It changed my entire perspective of my citizenship in this country. It gave me an insight into our country's history that made it possible for me to understand all that happened afterwards.

It gave me a way to understand the deepest meaning of the music I express--jazz improvisation. I think this is one of the greatest books ever written. It is a history classic, on the highest level."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"I don't know why, but I waited a while before writing a review of this book. I couldn't get past the violence this book represented. Given the current state of affairs, I think it's finally fitting to publish my opinion. I was struck by the exhaustive nature of the book. Mr. DuBois leaves little to the imagination during this dark period. I was also struck by the bitter level of hatred afoot in the country at that time. Hatred throughout the land was so deeply entrenched, it's hard to believe we've made such tremendous strides in such a short period of time; South Carolina, Alabama and Texas were especially heinous. It must've been humiliating for the nation's first African American Harvard graduate to ask for the funds and accommodations to write such a book, when there was no obvious audience when it was undertaken. The publishing of this book is testament to the forward thinkers (wealthy liberal whites) of the time and I commend them for their courage. Frankly, this book should be required reading for those who complain of inequality because present day struggles pale in comparison. Let's face it, the Reconstruction Era is seen as a failed period in American history. After the war and against tremendous push back, Lincoln set out to repair the frayed lines of earnest entitlement and paid for it with his life. Unfortunately, his enlightened vision wasn't shared by the southern states or its sympathizers. Subsequently, the progressive momentum of the Republican Party was wholly reversed and forever damaged by the actions of Andrew Johnson. Following his political reversals, atrocities became the norm; consequently, DuBois's flirtation with Marxism is wholly understandable. More than equality, disenfranchised slaves craved federal protection from the accepted wrath of ugliness perpetrated against their families during the period. I think the need for protection represents the initial incubation period for the African American communities propensity for government intervention (I also realize that may be a bit of a stretch). On a more positive note, the tenacity of those who assisted ex-slaves cannot be dismissed (for instance, most people don't know the Bush family played a big role in freeing the slaves). What it must've been like for those who disagreed with the masses? In the end, the sacrifices may have paid off; the palpable feeling of common interest is a credit to the true strength of the nation; then and now. It puts recent developments in perspective."},{"Title":"Black Reconstruction in America","review":"This book is incredibly well-researched, strongly argued, and exceptionally well-written.

Since I love this book so much and forgot some of the details, I decided to read it again. I have read many classic and modern novels and this is my favorite. The free Kindle version is abridged and a lot of the free and purchased copies out there are. I started reading the free Kindle version and noticed I got to 4% complete pretty fast. This surprised me, as I remembered it being a very long book. I also felt like some intricacies were being left out. I then compared it to my paperback copy of this very edition (Penguin Classics, translated by Robin Buss), that I had read before, and noticed the free Kindle version to be abridged. A lot of the finer details are cut out of the abridged version. The Project Gutenberg version is abridged too.Some people may prefer the abridged version. It is shorter and the main plot is still intact. I am sure it is still entertaining and it will take less time to read. Others, like me, prefer to read the unabridged version for all the details, like the author intended. Some adult themes and subplots are missing in the abridged version. The book is a masterpiece and altering it is destroying a piece of art. At least you have a choice to which version you would rather read. I just want to inform you to be aware that many versions are abridged and not appropriately labeled so. The unabridged version is over 1,000 pages, small print. The Penguin Classics version, translated by Robin Buss, is the unabridged version.The plot involves a young and poor man, Edmond Dantes, who recently gets news of a big career promotion and promptly makes plans to marry a young woman he is infatuated with. She is infatuated with him too. Some jealous acquaintances scheme to ruin his recently found success, because doing so means success for them, instead. The scheming results in Edmond Dantes being imprisoned for many years and his love, thinking him dead, marries one of the scheming acquaintances. The other schemers profit by his misfortune too.Dantes escapes from prison, after many years, and comes upon a great fortune. The fortune makes him extremely wealthy. He is not very happy though and is not willing to just move on and live his live in lavish comfort. He wants revenge! It is the only thing he cares about.

Despite its length, which may scare some people away, if you read this cover to cover I swear you wll not be disappointed!

This edition brings the story to English speakers in easily readable language, and given the brilliant simplicity of the words, I'm sure this translation stays true to Dumas's original French masterpiece. There are a few \\"Frenchisms,\\" such as the use of \\"quit\\" instead of \\"leave,\\" or \\"seek for\\" as an awkward substitute for the French \\"look for,\\" but these tiny inconsistencies don't take away from the text at all. I highly recommend this version of The Count of Monte Cristo to anyone!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The best book on revenge ever! This book I could read over and over again. I read it first in high school and 5 years later its still one of my favorites.

This review may not be helpful, I just wanted to rate this a five. Read the book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The book is wonderful with number of different characters intertwined. The book is long, but once you get into the plot you really don't want to put it down. All the characters are unique and each is interesting in there own way."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"First, let me compliment the narrator. He did a wonderful job with the different accents of the various characters. It was truly a joy to listen to.I picked this up at a whim on a trip to the local library, not knowing the impact Dantes would have over me for the next two months. I found myself driving slow, taking the long way to my destination in order to listen to more of the book. Don't be alarmed by the largeness of the volume. It is a great story, easy to follow, and full of adventure. This is VERY different from the popular movie from a few years ago, so seeing the movie doesn't mean you know how the story goes or ends! Give it a shot and you will be very glad you did."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I loved this book!

Then almost a decade later I read the book and think it is even better than one of the best movies of all time! The book is very long, though. It's actually like 2 or 3 books as it is over 1300 pages...but very good. The movie only covered about 1/5 of the book. The book has many different plots going on at once so don't put it down for a couple weeks and then come back to it because you may forget some of what is happening. The language is difficult to understand at times (it was translated from French from 1844-45) along with the cultural humour. But keep on going. These parts don't have to be fully understood to get the idea of where the story is going. At the end everything makes sense and there are no loose ends."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It wa SOOO good I couldn't put it down.

Recently I was inspired to start reading the book, which as books tend to be, is much more elaborate and entertaining than the movie was. I highly recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed the movie. Although I must say the plot line of the movie is not closely related to that of the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The rising action in the Count of Monte Cristo starts out with Edmond Dantes sailing into the Port of Marseilles, eager to meet his father and his dearly beloved Mercedes. Unbeknownst to him, there are some who are jealous of his successes in life, and seek to destroy him, namely Fernand Mondego, Caderousse, Baron Danglars, and Gerard de Villefort. Danglars, Caderousse and Fernand write a letter claiming that Edmond is a Bonapartist agent, and should be imprisoned immediately. Edmond is then unjustly imprisoned in Chateau d'If for life by Gerard de Villefort, the judge at his trial. In prison, Edmond meets Abbe Faria, the Mad Priest, and learns of the treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. Edmond manages to escape prison and uncovers the great wealth hidden on the island. With his newfound wealth and power, he seeks revenge upon those who wronged him.\\"I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.\\"-Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo.The majority of the conflict in the book is Character vs. Character external. There is plenty of internal conflict however, as we note when Edmond no longer can say, \\"God is for and with me\\".This novel is exceptionally well written. The only problem with it is that there are many characters and its sort of hard to keep track of them all. However, I like how Edmond sneaks around and pretends to be so many different people, Lord Wilmore, the Count of Monte Cristo, Abbe Busoni, Sinbad the Sailor. I love how deep this book is also. Makes you think. Is it just to punish those who have wronged you? Is it ok for you to take the place of Providence and carry out your vengeance? The Bible says that vengeance is the LORD's, and that man shouldn't try to take matters into their own hands, like Monsieur Dantes did. Personally, I don't think Edmond should have executed his vengeance like he did, but then we wouldn't really have such an interesting book, now would we? I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I first read this in high school and have since then read it many more times. Dumas is a master plot creator, and this is his best. Nothing is harder to do, and more important, than the creation of an ingenious, original, complex plot. This is what holds all of the threads together, the characterizations, the motives, the scenes. Dumas is one of the world's greatest in this regard.Then, Dumas' simple, direct style impels the reader along from page to page. The result of the plot and his style is, as just about every reviewer remarks, a novel that one can't put down; if it were another 1500 pages, one still would want more!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I wish I could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I wish i hadn't read this book, so i could do it again for the first time. a thrilling, suspensful, satisfying, swashbuckling story - a great read!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great read and one of the first \\"modern\\" epic adventure novels. Dumas' style is years ahead of his contemporaries. But you wouldn't know this from reading the Modern Library edition because its poor translation gets in the way of both the story and the storytelling. The translator - who is not acknowledged (you won't find his or her name anywhere) - chooses words poorly, punctuates badly, and uses English words that while literally correct are either archaic or inappropriate in context. (For example, using the word \\"bullet\\" for \\"cannon ball.\\") Alexandre Dumas is well worth reading and I recommend the Count of Monte Cristo to everyone, but choose another version. Most Modern Library editions are exceptional; this one is an exception."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I purchased the Oxford Worlds Classics version of this book, amounting to over 1100 pages thinking I'd never finish this book. A friend told me how great the book was after the movie came out, and said unabridged was the only way to go. I figured I would give it a try, and I finished the book over a period of time.I was definitely surprised at how much the book kept me on my feet. I have not read many 1000+ page books, and this has to be my favorite. The story of Edmond Dantes' revenge on the people who imprisoned him is a true classic. One would figure that a man who has been locked away for 16 years for something he didn't do would come back with violent intentions, but Dantes does not. He keeps his cool, comes across a huge fortune and over time has truly obtained his revenge.A lot of death occurs in the book, but not by the hands of Dantes. Misfortune strikes each of the people who took everything from Dantes, and each time he reveals his identity to one of them, the suspense is very high. This book kept me on the edge of my seat for a long time, and I enjoyed every page of it.If you have the time to devote a few chapters of this book a day, by all means get it. It will remain a classic forever, and will hold a spot as one of the best pieces of French literature ever written."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written, if not the best. It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died. He is then betrayed by two people he thought were his fiends, Monsieur Danglars and Fernand. Danglars was jealous of Edmond because he was the likely candidate to be the captain of the pharaon and Danglars wanted the job. Fernand was jealous that Mercedes was in love with Edmond. The public prosecutor M. de Villefort confiscated Edmond's only proof of innocence. The reason is that the evidence proved that de Villefort's father is a Bonapartist, which would put the prosecutor out of the favor of the court. Edmond was sentenced to life in the infamous dungeon, the Chateau d'If. There he makes friends with a priest. They develop a father, son friendship. He spends fourteen long, hard years in jail. He has a daring escape and finally leaves the oppressing dungeon. He then plans his revenge on his enemies. He joins a smuggler ship to protect his identity. He returns to his village, to find his father dead from hunger. He protects himself by changing his name to the Count of Monte Cristo, and travels to find his enemies with his new found fortune. He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book. I enjoyed the book and I appreciated the author's hard work to write a fine piece of literature. It is an adventure story unlike any other, which involves a great deal of mystery. The use of one character in more than one role might be at first confusing, but it only adds to the drama of the story. The story is an intricate web of what the word vengeance really means. The plot is forever rolling and unraveling until the final resolution. You will be on your toes for most of the book and apprehensive to see what is yet to come. I greatly enjoyed the passion of the protagonist, to make his enemies feel the hurt and despair he went through. The plot is nicely developed to intrigue the minds of young adults and to make them think. The reader feels the joy of Edmond his sorrow is also felt.There are a few negative parts of the book. The length of the book may intimidate the reader at first and might deter them away from it. Edmond playing more than one character could also confuse you at first until you read more about the book. There was also the use of many different characters, which confused me as the story progressed. The positive aspect of the book was incalculable. The author's use of plot was very good and used wisely, this added to the quality of writing. I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to anybody ages 13-up. This book makes you feel the magic of reading, so enjoy it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Of all the books I've ever read, this is one of my favorite. But all my good memories of it come from the first third of the book. Up until the end of chapter 30 I'd give the book five stars, but after that it's pretty long-winded and drawn out (And that's 87 more chapters!) . Furthermore I didn't even like any of the characters introduced after the first 30 chapters, except two I'll mention below, who were very minor characters.The first thirty chapters deal with Dantes being unjustly imprisoned and spending a miserable 14 years in the Chateau d'If. The story of his imprisonment, escape, and coming to riches and power culminates in his saving his old boss from financial ruin and suicide. It's a fantastic story but after that it's on to a long, drawn out, extremely wordy, and ultimately not-very-satisfying revenge on those who put him in prison. The main characters during these 87 chapters, aside from Dantes, his woman, and the four men who put him in prison are Haydee (the beautiful, but disturbingly reclusive Greek woman), Albert (the hotheaded son of Monte Cristo's old rival Fernand), Madame Danglars (the shrewish wife of Danglars), H&eacute;lose de Villefort (the one-dimensional murderer whose love for her child is her only emotion), Franz d'Epinay, (a nice guy, but forgettable), and a host of other forgettable characters. Finally, there are Valentine de Villefort and Maximilien Morrel: two annoying and sappy lovers who remind me exactly of Cosette and Marius from Les Miserables. If you liked those two you'll love the latter half of the book. I detested them and the latter half of the book gave them an unfortunately large amount of sappy-time.So that's the principle problem with the last 87 chapters: I don't like any of the characters. I wasn't even all that fond of Dant&egrave;s during this part. The only characters I even remotely liked were Ali, Monte Cristo's slave, and Noitier de Villefort, who talks by blinking. Everyone else is either annoying or forgettable. This means that the almost the entire last 87 chapters are dedicated to conversations among all these annoying or forgettable people, very little of which was interesting.Still, my memories are mostly fond. It's only when I put on my critic's hat that I began to realize how bored I was during the last two-thirds of the book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good long read. The abridged version would probably be better for the non-OCD type, as it'll cut out a lot of the superfluous stuff."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I like reading older books, and I like reading longer books, but this older longer book just seemed to drag on and on. The section describing the \\"drug trip\\" was particularly tedious. I did some reading about the book and apparently this was a popular sort of scene in the time period in which Dumas was writing. I was yawning through it. While there was war, violence, and intrigue, I think a good editor \\"trimming off the fat\\" would have really helped Dumas's writing for most of the last 2/3 of the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The TOR Edition is full of typos.

If it's not exactly the #1 champion, it's sure among the front-runners. It's simply a sprawling, thrilling tale, which reaches out and touches most people right where they live: \\"Boy, if I had a million dollars, I'd show them!\\" \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" turns this theme into a sometimes savage, sometimes heart-breaking tale of the revenge of an innocent man wronged, but the theme can also be treated as high humor (\\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\") and surely is not unknown to music (see Madonna's \\"You'll See.\\")Anyway, I'm not going to even summarize the plot --- not even going to try. I'll just say this: if you haven't read this book, put it on your list.

A love despised by her brother, Fernand, who seeks the beautiful Mercedes for his own bride, and the calculated hate of Danglar's, Edmond's rival for the position of Captain on the Phareon. A treacherous letter written by his enemies denouncing him as a Bonapartist thrusts Edmond into the hands of the law where the deputy pro curei, Villefort, decides to sentence Dantes to the Chat e tif, an island prison for political prisoners, to pursue his own ambitions. Thus begins the tale of love and hate for Edmond Dantes, the sailor, and subsequently, the Count of Monte Cristo's merciless revenge of his Imprisoners. Without out a doubt Alexandre Dumas has written one of the greatest romance stories of all time. Duma develops the most amazing plot that has many twists and turns. He immerses the reader into the anxious world of France, just after Napoleon's demise in 18414 to just before the second revolution of France, blending in the plight of the lower classes mixed feelings hate and acceptance of Louis the XVIII, and the constant fears of the aristocracy, whose every moment brims with the fear that Napoleon, the accursed, shall return from exile on the island of Elba. The reader walks through the winding streets of Marseilles and the dark and smelly dungeons of the Chat e tif, a tribute to the author's on site research. Dumas's writing beautifully blends the language of the rough spoken sailor with the eloquence of the elite with subtle humor and powerful soliloquies.

The count's vengeance is so vivd that I read over certain parts many times. Specificall, my favorite part is when the Count doubts if his vengeance was justified, after little Edourd dies. When he gets the manuscript of the Abbe Faria and his eyes fall on the epigraph, &quot;Thou shall tear out the teeth of the dragon and trample the lions underfoot, thus saith the Lord&quot;. That part gives me chills all over, the COunt has vanquished his doubt, it was God's will that he does what he does. I own several copies of this book, and always have one around to read parts of. The count is my favorite literary character of all time. Sometimes, vengeance is not the lords, but you must act upon it according to your own situations."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Do classics *have* to be boring? With Dumas, it is never so.

My personal opinion ranks it ahead of the three musketeers. Something i would like to add to the reviews already up there is that the writing is so timeless. The intrigue, the stocks, comments about the police arriving late and the youth going to the dogs.. you could supplant horses with cars and have the setting in the late 20th century!

This novel is a breathtaking, in-your-face story that spans an entire continent in order to get the full picture accross to its readers.Dumas gave so much life to the characters he created, and though it is sometimes hard to figure out what is going on at that very moment, you are always helped out a few pages down--that is the gift that Dumas brings to his readers!

While many people would have enjoyed their wealth, Edmund is obsessed with revenge against the people responsible for sending him to prison. He is willing to destroy not only those people, but also their families. Money can buy a lot, and he expends large amounts of his new found wealth on elaborate schemes to ruin the people.

The plot is excellent and the character development is unlike almost anything else I have read (if not EVERYTHING else). As this book is a literary classic, I will compare the book mostly to the film version bearing the same name.I saw the movie at least 10 times before reading the book. I have to say, being a cultural elitist, that I enjoyed the plot of the movie better.SPOILER ALERT!!!At first I thought Danglars was completely left out of the movie and the antagonists (Danglars and Fernand) were combined in to a single person (Count Mondego). My wife later corrected me, as Danglars was in the movie. The problem then became that Danglars had such a small role it didn't make much of an impression on me. I actually APPRECIATE this Hollywood approach. Danglars and Fernand in the book are little weasels, but I have to say I didn't really \\"hate\\" them. They were just snivelers. The movie brings out the human emotion and thus the hatred of the single antagonist in a much more astonishing way.REAL SPOILER ALERT!!!The movie version is centered on the love story between Edmond and Mercedes. This is not the case in the book. Hollywood made Albert the son of Edmond...that isn't the case in the book either. It is thus hard to say which I prefer. In the book the Count at the end sails off in to the sunset (literally) with his Grecian Princess Haidee. In the book the family is reunited and finally happy. Either ending suits me. If Albert were truly the son of Edmond, the happy family approach wouldn't much work.The real awesomeness (if I may use that word) of the book is in its character development. I have to say I was wondering if there was a glitch with my Kindle when I was only 33% done with the book and Edmond has already attained the the treasure. I guessed after 2/3 of the book that the last 1/3 would be about Edmond reuniting with Mercedes...boy was I wrong! The character development was incredibly deep. If you have never read the book, but adore the movie...you should read the book.Be warned though....it is just about as long as the Bible, and pulls you in to the richness of Europe in the 1800's."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is, to me at least, Dumas' capstone work. While his other works are, without a doubt, amazing in their own rights, nothing can capture the amount of emotional connection and intrigue present in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" The translation found here is well-done (of course, you always have minor snags when reading a translated work), but it does not detract from the story.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the tale of a young sailor, well-loved by both family and the wider community. Jealousy, at the hands of a friend, causes this sailor to be imprisoned for a vast portion of his life.

Every detail in this plot is crucial, as Dumas writes with a beautifully complex, yet highly readable style. The prose is wonderful. Suspense is in high quantities at all points in this novel, as you are driven along the tragic path of Edmond Dontes' life and witness his attempt to ameliorate those wrongs done against him....is it karma, or is it divine providence, Dumas asks.

Definetly the best book ever!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book kept me up till 4 am many nights. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a good edition in English of a wonderful reading experience, which I looked over in a store. Is there anything new in it? No. But it is inexpensive and fairly well translated, tho nothing compares to Dumas pere's astonishing detail and clarity in the original language. Alas, it is abridged, which is dumbing it down in my opinion.This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and transformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society of the Restoration. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book (unabridged version). At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth and ambition are beyond the simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels if that isyour bag.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it in the original, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible, so why domb it down?Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I LOVE this book, therefore I was sorely dissapointed to discover that this is an abridged version and the amazon page did not indicate this at the time of my purchase (3/07)!! I post this to give you fair warning, buy the unabridged version, this is a FANTASTIC book!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Almost immediately in the story, Edmond Dantes, a poor 19th Century French sailor accused of a crime he did not commit, finds himself imprisoned for life in the infamous Chateau d'If. He might have died there were it not for a piece of good luck. He hears noise in an adjoining cell and digs his way to the sound, finding an old priest who tells him about a great fortune left undiscovered on the island of Monte Cristo in the Mediterranean Sea. The priest spends the next few years teaching the young, inexperienced sailor everything he knows about life and living and then dies. Dantes changes place with the dead priest, sewing himself into the winding sheet used to dispose of the priest's body. Dantes, not the priest, is thrown out of the Chateau into the sea where he is picked up by a passing vessel. He asks to be taken to the island of Monte Cristo where he discovers the fortune described by the priest. Dantes is reborn as the Count of Monte Cristo.All that I have mentioned is just prelude to one of the greatest stories of revenge ever writen. The reader is well advised to get the unabridged version of this novel and not be cheated out of any part of the Count's systematic and single minded pursuit of the men who betrayed him and sent him to prison.Many readers today will shy away from starting to read a book that lasts for over a thousand pages thinking that they might be bored with interminable pages of description and detail that add little to the development of the story. This concern is unjustified. The story always moves forward with a brisk pace and is entertaining on every page. Often we find ourselves astonished to have read so much at a single sitting. Hours pass like minutes as we accompany the Count on his mission of revenge.After years in prison Edmond Dantes has learned to be patient and the priest who taught him all he knows has given him a hope he thought was lost. &quot;Wait and hope&quot; are words which end this great adventure. The reader will not soon forget them."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I purchased the Scholastic version of the book so I could finish reading the novel (I had it on my PDA and lost my PDA). After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, \\"the Conspiracy\\" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I know this seems a little over the top perhaps but Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Christo is just that in my opinion. The scale, the depth, the characterisation, and ultimately the story underpinning it all- a tale of a virtuous young man, wrongly imprisoned, mentally and physically due to the jealousy of others, and his resurrection from the abyss as an avenging angel to exact his revenge on those who inspired it- add up to a breathtaking picture spanning 1200 or so pages. In Edmond Dantes, Dumas has created a character which deep down we can all identify with as our pure inner self. All of us can remember our childhood when everything was a lot more natural and bereft of worry. He is careful to highlight Dantes strengths and flaws early on in the novel, so as we can appreciate this person against who this terrible act has been aimed. His transgression from innocent, naive but virtuous boy into the cold blooded man of the world, is excellently handled, and fits with the gap of years between his escape from the chateau d'if until his re-appearance as the chameleon he has become. The way that the plot comes together shows the time Dumas must have spent creating the jigsaw, and the ending is everything you could want and more. I implore you to read this book- the length of the script will keep you busy for some time admittedly- but the end result and the fact you will be able to look back afterwards and remember its message for a long time, should make this top of your to-read list. And amazingly it was based on a true case."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A piece of something lost. An elegance and order that is no longer available to this generation. That is what the Count of Monte Cristo takes us back to. As you follow Edmond Dant&eacute;s, a young and enterprising French fisherman, through a remarkable journey of long and torturous suffering and carefully wrought revenge you will soon gain a new definition of romance and adventure.The book starts it's story in early 19th century France in a small fishing village called Marseilles, where we first meet youthful Edmond Dant&eacute;s who is engaged to the most beautiful woman of his village and is soon to be the captain of his own vessel. Though ignorant and nave, he is beloved by all who know him and has amassed a great deal of friends, however, one with such good fortune also amasses many enemies. Through a series of events plotted by Fernand, who desperately covets Edmond's betrothed, Mercedes, and Danglars, a fellow sailor jealous of Edmond's new promotion to captain, Dant&eacute;s finds himself in prison for a crime he did not commit. Still ignorant of the scheme that put him in prison, or the plotters who ruined his life, Edmond waits in prison. This changes, however, when he meets his cellmate, Faria, an ancient abb&eacute; who is considered mad. This \\"mad\\" abb&eacute; will reveal an amazing secret to Edmond that will change the course of his fate forever, and hope is finally in his view. Dant&eacute;s emerges out of prison changed and worn cynical by a long and terrible imprisonment of 16 years. Though he assumes many identities, he gradually adopts the identity as the Count of Monte Cristo, an immensely wealthy and indifferent nobleman as he returns to Marseilles to wreck his much-thought over revenge individually on his plotters. His last words as the former Edmond Dant&eacute;s after he rewards one of his loyal friends are:\\"And now,\\" said the unknown (Edmond) \\"farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have been Heaven's substitute to recompense the good -now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!\\" At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.-The Count of Monte CristoHowever, Edmond cannot remain under the cover of the illustrious Count of Monte Cristo forever, and he will soon find that a heart even so indifferent and cold as his own cannot remain lifeless for long. This is an amazing novel of suspense, romance and betrayal. Alexandre Dumas weaves many stories into one enthrallingly suspenseful and complex story of love, hate, betrayal and loyalty. This book has no equal and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates classic and elegant, while exciting and adventurous, literature."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"First off, if your copy of The Count of Monte Cristo is only 350 pages long, throw it out and get this one. As far as I can tell this is the only unabridged translation currently available in the U.S., and the others abridge, oh, 75% of the book. I think that's usually called Cliff Notes.This 800 pound, 1100 page gorilla is a marvel of perpetual storytelling, a spellbinding page-turner despite its length, a plot so complicated one senses even the author had only a tenuous grasp upon it, and Dumas' prose style, the elegance of which might charitably be compared to King or Lovecraft.Doesn't matter -- 150 years on the culture's archetypal revenge drama still kicks like nobody's business. The initial betrayal of Edouard Dantes, his politically expedient persecution at the hands of an unscrupulous prosecutor, and his imprisonment in and escape from the Chateau D'If are the bits we recall from a dozen films, rip-offs, cartoons. But that's just the first 300 pages.Then comes the dazzling if at first puzzling stop-off for Carnival in Rome, where Dumas puts his predilication for stories within stories to spectacular use, and then Paris, where the bulk of the novel turns on The Count of Monte Cristo's mind-bogglingly complex plot to avenge himself against the four principals of his ruin.Does the plot hinge on one unlikely coincidence after another? Does the writing turn ludicrously purple? Can anyone, including Dumas, keep track of all these characters?Again, it just doesn't matter. This locomotive of pure story won't be denied. The pages fly by, leading to a conclusion of suprising power. The Count of Monte Cristo is considered to be one of the first \\"popular\\" novels ever written -- it remains one of the best. If only our current popular novelists could work such magic."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I admit, I was motivated to read the book because I saw the movie first. I don't know how I escaped both high school and college without reading this one, but I regret not having found it sooner. The movie, though enjoyable on its own, shares only one thing in common with the book: its title. Everything else has been inexplicably altered.There is sooo much more to the story. Here is a man, who, unfairly convicted and imprisoned for 14 years, has everything good in his life taken from him. He cunningly escapes prison, finds immense wealth, and spends the next 10 years plotting vengeance on those who took his former life away from him. He studies his enemies and, one by one, brings about their downfall and destruction by exploiting their vices. He also finds cause to reward those who did not betray him, and who lived irreproachable lives of unrewarded nobleness.The writing is enthralling and fast-paced. It is a fascinating story, well-told and impassioned. I wouldn't limit it to any specific audience, like juveniles or only those who know they like adventure stories ~ I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The characters in this book are so Shakespearian. They're all larger than life. We're not dealing with post-modern self-doubting everymen stumbling through life, these are extreme characters in extreme circumstances: it's not too often you're going to pause and say, \\"Hmmm, I know exactly how he feels.\\" Likewise the plot, action, and devices. It's all around a quest for revenge (or is it justice?), there are crucial letters, poisonings, star-crossed lovers' trysts, courtroom performances, disguises, last minute averted bankruptcy, and, for goodness sake, yet another of these meddlesome priests with their cunning plans to fake a death with an ingenious potion. We have dozens of prose soliloquies, characters turning over their plans, doubts and motivations, and wonderful extended dialogue, with people talking with a depth and precision mere mortals could never hope to improvise (even if there aren't as many killer one-liners in there).And while I'm making big comparisons why not throw in Tolkien: Dumas too has pulled off an epic. I can't think of many other books of this size that maintain such coherency. Now they do it in different ways, and Dumas teeters on the edge in a couple of places (while Tolkien is sublimely on track the whole time - he simply needed that many words to tell his story), but they both still manage to bring so much to a basic central story line. Most epics climax in book one, then have weak sequels added on once the publishers realise they have a hit. Most unsuccessfully try to reopen the old story and climb back in to a structure that will not fit them, and only undermine the superior complete original (Card, Jordan, Feist). Some series avoid this mistake by telling a new story within the old world (Pratchett, Leiber, Saberhagen), but this isn't making an epic. In the Mars series, Robinson gave himself freedom to continue because no character is indispensable, the future is open.But Dumas! Like I said, in a couple of places he's on the brink, but doesn't quite fall over. We wonder why we spend quite so much time with Franz - who turns out to be quite incidental - but in Dumas' defence, to meet Edmond reinvented as the Count through Franz' eyes is an intriguing and clever way to introduce him. Indeed, the book could almost have started here (and the second part does feel like an entirely new book for some time), but, like Tolkien, rather than leap in with the \`main' story, Dumas patiently and painstakingly has to paint the whole history before we get there. But while Tolkien splits up the major characters and has us desperately turning pages as he leaves each in cliff-hanger situations, Dumas has the slowest of slow burns running through the whole book. You don't have to read it all in a sitting, and as the protagonist points out, a simple and quick revenge would not be just or satisfying. So he takes his sweet time. Along the way some of the time he spends to flesh out the characters of the sons and daughters of the subjects of the Count's patient and comprehensive revenge seems liberal, but I suppose Dumas could say with his Count, \`What's your hurry?'And to carry you along you have this wonderfully sophisticated French high society. Being cool - or being honourable - is not only about ego and looking good, it has a major effect on your whole family's prospects. Make a fool of yourself in public, and you could lose your credibility - which could also cost you your house or your life. How you're presented, who presents you, and how you carry it off is a game with big stakes. There was an excellent SBS movie that caught something of this - about a relatively low income 19th Century noble who actually cares for the people on his land, and knows the only way to save them is to get them clean water. To afford this he needs the court's patronage - and the favour of the court has nothing to do with the needs of the poor, and everything to do with whether you are seen as having a lively wit. The decent noble has to play the dirtiest games to do good. It's in this sort of Dangerous Liaisons context that much of the drama takes place, and Dumas does it well (indeed he's probably the prototype).Moreover his count is a real triumph. He imagined the pinnacle of 19th Century cool and painted it. Moreover he gives us the whole process of just why this guy has got it so completely together. He's Shaft, James Bond, Miles Davis ... whoever ... you just can't touch him. So when the reader gets to see someone getting a bit close to his self-possession it has a real impact.When we do eventually get to the resolutions of the old wounds, they are powerful and satisfying. I said this is Shakespearian, and there's no pulling punches here - the crimes are terrible, the prices paid apposite, and both are vividly and minutely explored. Hence the massive length of the book - but this epic, unlike so many others, is coherent.And all this without even mentioning the fascinating central philosophical issue of just who the Count thinks he is to take charge of so many lives. Is he, as he contends, merely the agent of providence? But the way he treats those he cares for seems at times more cruel than the way he treats his foes! The torture he puts Morrel through can only be compared to God calling Abraham to sacrifice his son. Monte Cristo is unapologetically taking the role of God, and his justification is that:...There is neither happiness nor grief in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another - nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness...It's a tough one to try to pull off. Did he manage it? Let the discussions commence."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I love the Count of Monte Cristo, but I'm about a quarter of the way through and I feel like little pieces are being left out of the story from what I remember it to be. My memory could be wrong, so can anyone confirm if this is the unabridged version. Guess you can't beat the price though."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you're reading Dumas for the prose and the style of writing, the words \\"abridgement\\" tell you everything you need to know: this isn't the edition you want. Unfortunately, even if you're reading Dumas for the story, this /still/ isn't the edition you want. While there have been good abridgements -- the Signet Classic springs to mind as being relatively inoffensive -- this is not one of them; it butchers the story to such an extent that anyone who doesn't already know the tale is likely to come away with the impression that Dumas was a scatterbrained idiot who couldn't be bothered to keep track of what was happening in his own work.There is so much in Dumas that /can/ be sliced out without harming the integrity of the story that it's hard to see why the abridgers resorted to the measures they did. Whole subplots and, worse, parts of subplots are left on the proverbial cutting-room floor in apparent ignorance of the tangled mess this creates. Some of the decisions on what to keep and what to cut seem to have been made by throwing dice or flipping coins -- what possible train of thought could have led to the excising of climactic scenes of Monte Cristo's revenge on his tormentors so as to retain the chapter where Haydee recounts in vivid detail a story that's told later on in the book anyway?This edition is closely associated with the film version starring Antonio Banderas (who appears on the cover), and perhaps the edits to the text are made to keep it in step with the movie -- a bad choice, if so. While there is a (somewhat) coherent story left standing after the abridger has had his say, it hardly does justice to Dumas' original.Overall, a very, very disappointing edition. Even badly edited Dumas is better than no Dumas at all, so I can't in good conscience award it zero stars, but anyone interested in the Count's story -- whether via the movie, Dumas' other works, or recommendation, is strongly urged to consider another printing rather than purchasing this one. It's a fantastic adventure story -- I would rate better versions at four or five stars -- let down by sloppy abridgement."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading one of the greatest novels of all time, and the displeasure of seeing one of the worst movies. Both were The Count of Monte Cristo. If you've never had the pleasure of reading the book, I urge you, read it. But at all costs, stay away from the movie. Don't even watch it on cable for free. If you want to read an enriching tale, read The Count of Monte Cristo. It will not disapoint!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"WARNING: May include \\"spoilers\\".\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the most extraordinary book I have ever read.The first aspect that makes it so interesting is its variety. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is usually described as an action-adventure novel about revenge. It is that, but it is also much, much more. It is a fantasy novel, a romance novel, a mystery novel, a horror novel, a comedy, and a social satire. There is something in this novel that will please nearly every reader.The second aspect of the novel that causes it to be so wonderful is the characters. There is, of course, first and foremost, Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. Dantes is an amazingly charismatic character. He is also incredibly complex, being at once a philanthropist and a sadist, a man who is remarkably intuitive about what motivates his enemies but who at the same time is frequently oblivious to the feelings of the people who he cares about. For example, he thinks that Haydee, a beautiful Greek-princess-turned-slave, loves him like a father. He's right about the love part, but not the \\"like a father\\" part. In parts of the novel, he appears God-like, in others, he is compared, not entirely without justification, to the Devil. Edmond Dantes is fascinating.Then there are the secondary characters. The secondary characters in this novel are such that you can't help but wish that many of them had their own novel for which they could act as protagonist. There's Albert de Morcerf, Eugenie Danglars, and Haydee. Of the three, Haydee is my personal favourite. She is, initially, somewhat annoying due to her hyper-sensitive, cloying, and comedically melodramatic nature. Gradually, however, as the reader learns more about her tragic past, it becomes extremely easy to sympathize with her and care for her. She later demonstrates her inner strength when she aids in the ruination of Albert de Morcerf, one of the men who had betrayed Edmond. Both she and the Count have gone through similar experiences and are remarkably alike, which helps makes the novel's conclusion logical and rewarding.An additional aspect of the novel that makes it qualify as a classic are its themes and the way the novel presents those themes. Dumas pokes fun at the aristocracy, mocks the often contradictory social values of his day, and philosophizes about revenge, love, hate, and philosophy itself, among other things.Some readers have complained that the plot is too complex and confusing. I, for one, found that not being certain about what the Count's plans were made the novel all the more interesting. As well, some readers have said that too much of the plot relies on coincidence, luck, etc. True, some portions of the novel stretch believability, however, I did not find that this in any way damaged my enjoyment of the novel. The story is, in many ways, allegorical, as a result, the occasional implausible plot twist makes little difference in whether a reader enjoys the story or not.It's impossible to summerize what makes this novel so wonderful in a simple review. I strongly advise against reading the abridged version, because there's something worthwhile on every page of the full-length novel. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is that rare specimen of a book that manages to be intellectually and emotionally satisfying, and, at the same time, is extremely fun to read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this book for a high school book report in 1966. And I mean I read every page. When I started reading the book I had the feeling that I had bit off much more than I could chew. The book is over 1400 pages which would be a very large book for a 16 year old. I found that I could not put the book down. The writing and the intrigue of the manuscript was spell binding. I even read on the week ends and late into the night. I have forgotten much about the book but I am in the process of buying the book to read again now that I am 52 years old. If you want a spell binding, can not put it down, book to read - this is a strong candidate."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Never in my life have I read such an outstanding work as \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Alexandre Dumas is brilliant in bringing us an air tight story of a naive young man who is unjustly accused of aiding the Napoleanic uprising. He spends fourteen years in prison until he finally escapes, bent on revenge. Every single chapter was crucial--nothing was thrown in just because. All extra subplots had a reason for being there and were all excellently intertwined, as each furthered the main plot. Nothing is left to chance. That is master storytelling and that is what makes a book not just good, but oustanding! If you want a good, thick novel to curl up with, this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed. Highly readable and bursting with history."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book, The Count of Monte Cristo, is an engrossing tale of loyalty, revenge, and obsession that can still teach lessons today. Edmond Dantes seems set for life: the young man is now the captain of a ship, his best friends are his father and his boss, Morrel, and he is set to be married to a beautiful girl named Mercedes. But two men, Danglars and Fernand, are jealous of him for different reasons (Danglars for his job, Fernand for his fiancee). This jealousy comes in the form of a conspiracy so that both will be benefited: a letter is written saying that Dantes is a Napoleonic agent (he is not). He is further crossed by the ambitious magistrate de Villefort, who destroys the only piece of evidence because it implicates his father and sends him to prison, using the Napoleonic phobia of the time. While there, he meets the brilliant yet enigmatic Abbe Faria, who teaches him several languages and they collaborate on how to escape. The Abbe has an attack, he tells Dantes to leave without him, so he does. But before the Abbe dies, he tells Dantes about the magnificent treasure of Monte Cristo, and then the adventure begins as Dantes gets the treasure and lives extravagantly for a while, then he comes to pay vengeance to his enemies and rewards to his friends. This book is quite long, but I could not imagine it being shorter: it is the perfect size for the story. This is one of the best books of all time for a reason, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in adventure."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In the story, as written by Alexander Dumas, the reader is entraced into a world of peace, war, honor, nobility, piratery, prison, crimes, and most importatly their vengeance.

A MUST read for any literate adult or high school-college student."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Ever since I was in 9th grade I have read The Count of Monte Cristo every summer. I can't seem to start the next school year without reading it one more time. Each time I discover more about the characters and I relate to their struggles. I wish that I could give this book more that 5 stars because it is better than that. I have made all my roommates read this book. Each time they come back to me and thank me for making them read it. It is an excellent story of lost love, despair, and revenge. You will not be disappointed, I promise. You literally wont be able to put it down. If you have ever thought about reading this The Count of Monte Cristo now is your chance, trust me you will read it over and over. So sit back and relax because you are in for an epic adventure that will change the way you select the books you read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have read the Count of Monte Cristo about 4 times and have seen it on TV numerous times starting with Tyrone Powers as the leading man.

A great piece of literature made fun to read again and again."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Do not be dissuaded to read my review because it is a children's review; I do not have an amazon account. On a more relevant note, the Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best novels I have ever read. Period. I have always been an avid reader, and since high school I have been required to read rather tedious books, some from the same era as Dumas. However, the Count of Monte Cristo stands above the rest from its time; it is an amazing story, and to not read it due to its size is a terrible decision. In fact, the intricate, detailed, and entertaining plot of the book necessitates more pages to explain. This translation is superb. It keeps you awake, and it has a modern feel to it, as it should, all the while retaining the feel of the orginal transcript. One note I should make is as such: do not, and I repeat, DO NOT attempt to read this book over an extended period of time, as there are many characters and plot points you ought to remember throughout the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If there's one thing I can't stand is when people liberally give out 5 stars on books; epecially when a book doesn't deserve it. I rarely give out 5 stars, so a book really has to \\"wow\\" me and go way over the bar. The Count of Monte Cristo is such a book. Dumas grabs your attention right from the beginning, and never lets go. There's not one boring moment, and I kept wondering: \\"What's going to happen next?!\\" It's incredible. Edmond Dante, a sucessful sailor, is promoted captain and is about to marry a beautiful girl, when two men, jealous of him, devise a way to get him out of the way of their own ambitions. Dante is imprisoned, ecapes, and vows revenge on them. This is only 3 of 200 books I read that deserve 5 stars, so I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The story is very captating, it taps into two of humanities' basic desires; revenge and power. Too many french words were left unexplained in the book, I assume that they were just copied from the original text.

If you liked the Three Musketeers, you'll love this book"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I was first introduced to Edmund Dantes as a child (circa 1946)and was enthralled by the child's edition of this classic. Even the movies of the day told the story of The Count of Monte Cristo (abridged and with the &quot;typical Hollywood altered screenplay.&quot; The story has been a classic since its inception; but Robin Buss translates the French with aplomb clarity and poetry.

The hero is buried in a shroud, then returns with power and influence to exact righteous judgement with great riches and a healing balm for those on whom he chooses to show kindness.I'm ashamed to admit it took me 10 years to realize I had read a thinly veiled allegory of the Holy Bible. There are hundreds of ingeniously crafted points of contact that only someone who has studied the Scriptures is likely to spot, after having it pointed out. It even goes so far as to express Dumont's dispensationalism and perhaps a little bit of anglo-israelism.Like all allegory it breaks down, of course, but then that's the nature of the thing.Public schools would have an absolute fit if they had the religious background to see the clever work for what it is.The Count is a must read, and would highly recomend you read the Bible thru to see the full extent of Dumont's ability to tie the works together."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most masterful piece of storytelling to ever have been written.

This book has everything!If you are looking for an epic adventure, then this is the ultimate book for you.This book has been my favorite novel since I was required to read it in 9th grade English class. Over the years I have visited and revisited it, and have yet to grow tired of it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stands alone as Dumas' best work. His character development and innovative storyline should be used as a model for fiction writing. A lengthy read to be sure, but worth every page.Among the classics, this is one of the greats.

When I finished the book-which I had been glued to and finished in one week- I felt like burning my DVD of the Count of Monte Cristo. The movie screen writers must have been mentally impaired to massacre the book as they did!I loved the way the book was always moving, it was never dull for a second. Many people seem to think that the book was too long and too complex with the many characters, but I thought that made it all the better. When it was over I was disappointed, not by the story, but by the fact that I was finished reading it. I have to admit being a little disappointed that Mercedes and Edmond don't end up together, and that Edmond and his friends end up separated, but really I was not expecting the book to end the way it did (again Hollywood's fault!) and so I was actually pleasantly surprised to be surprised. I don't think the book could have been any better than exactly as it is. The bottom line is that it is an excellent book, and I will no doubt read it several more times before tiring of it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"At first I saw the movie.

When I was reading after chapter and chapter it became just more and more captivating.This is a genius story about revenge and betrayal.

The man is an incredible writer who, despite the length of some of his novels, is able to entice the reader on and on and when the story ends they put down the book wishing that there was more to read. The reader by the end is won over by the enduring characters, good, bad, and in between, by the intricate and exciting plot, and by the wonderful wit of the author who is almost another character himself because of the flair of his writing.All I can say is that if you are the type of reader who can be scared off by the length of a novel, you should realize that Dumas' books usually move along at a wonderful pace and that everything in them is essential reading, and everything cut out of the abridged editions is a loss to the reader.So that being said I recommend The Count of Monte Cristo very highly, and recommend also that if you choose to read it that you are sure to get an unabridged copy. To cut out parts of this wonderful story is a crime, and a needless one considering how wonderfully told this story is."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a \\"must-have\\" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The emotions I felt while reading it were of varying degrees. There are many lessons to be learned in this book and the most profound is the revelation Dantes had in the end. I never imagined I would feel pity for those who so sorely wronged him, but the reader cannot help but feel that way. In the end, Edmond realized that he too, was not above this passion. That is why I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not to mention the intricate web designed between all the characters.

Through Dante, he depicts the most exciting story of love, friendship, adventure, justice, and drama. From the very beginning to the last page, I was always curious and dying to know what was going to happen on the next page.Edmond Dante is a young man who is a good and innocent son, fiance, and a sailor. He is being envied by his collegues and, on his wedding day, gets arrested and later put in the most infamous prison for no good reason.

There are so many mini-plots, each of them fascinating, to keep your interest. Do yourself a favor and read this book!

One of the best books you'll ever read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond Dantes, a/k/a The Count of Monte Cristo, is just as vibrant and nearly as famous a hero as D'Artagnan. This novel is beautifully written, full of emotion and witty dialogue as well as Dumas' famous adventure, action, and mystery. The story of the wrongfully imprisoned Edmond and his quest for revenge is spellbinding. In fact, this book can be dangerous-- if you are midway through it and your house begins to burn around you, it is entirely possible that you will not pull your nose out of the book and go outside. Also, this book may bring out an ugly side to your personality; almost everyone has someone they would like to treat as the Count treats those who framed him. There's nothing like living vicariously through an almost 200-year-old fictional character.Someone commented in another review that this book is too long. I can't tell you how little I agree. I wish it were twice as long as it is. I don't believe that is has a single dull moment. However, there are abreviated versions available.

Whereas &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; featured a quartet of swashbuckling heroes, &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; centers around one mysterious, seemingly omnipotent individual.The book opens in Marseilles, where the reader is introduced to the central characters as young men. A plot is laid and carried out against one of these men by his rival for the love of a woman. After the passage of 14 years, the lives of these characters slowly begin to converge once again as the victim of the conspiracy seeks his vengeance.The setting for his revenge, however, is a far different venue than the Mediterranean fishing community of Marseilles. His old enemies have become wealthy and powerful, and move in the highest circles of Paris society. The skeletons in their closets would now be the ruin of lofty reputations. Their families will become unknowing actors in the drama of vengeance that begins to unfold when the Count of Monte Cristo takes up residence in Paris.The victim of the conspiracy of hotheads in Marseilles was an unsophisticated provincial at the time. Upon his return, he is wealthy, subtle, and implacable. He embarks upon his quest for revenge with a well-planned, methodical campaign, marshalling resources that he has devoted years to organize. He uses a dozen or so people as his allies, some unknowingly, others willingly, but none are aware of his ultimate objectives. Yet, as complex and detailed as his plans are, he encounters complications that force him to choose how far to pursue his revenge.I was captivated by the dark and light contrasts of this story. The glitter and elegance and courtliness of French society of that day are set against the darkness of scandalous family secrets and destructive, coldblooded scheming. It's a combination that can't miss, particularly at the hand of a master writer like Dumas. This is a long book to plow through, but the further one gets, the more the threads of the plot come together to the final triumphs and defeats. As you reach the closing chapters, you may be reminded of a line from the movie &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; -- &quot;no man is rich enough to buy back his past.&quot;"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"you find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination of the physical book itself. only by an in-depth reading of almost the entire introduction is it made clear that the translation is quite old, and considered one of the worst. surprised eco put his name to this."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The first time I read this book I was a sophmore in high school.

I'll never understand why producers feel so obligated to completely change stories...OK, back to the book. This is one of the best revenge tales you'll ever read. Edmond Dantes is wronged in a huge way by three evil cohorts, and he plots for years to bring them to justice. Anything more and I'd be spoiling a book that shouldn't be spoiled! The elaborate schemes are unequaled in literature, and yet they are quite believable--especially as they almost all require the premise of \\"be sure your sin will find you out.\\" Dantes simply utilizes the evil that resides in his enemies to expedite his own plans for revenge.

Readers will lose count of the subplots, and indeed Dumas even let one of them peter out somewhere in the 1400+ pages of this unabridged version. Some parts of this novel flirt so much with contrivance it gets a bit ridiculous at times, but we're all here to see the well deserved smack downs for which the antagonists are just itchin'. The revenge wrought on each baddie is poetic, but not totally predictable. What's more, Dumas hints ever so subtly that in the end, evil for evil doesn't completely fulfill.This is the sort of novel that can't be well translated into a two-hour movie format. The older version with Chamberlain, Pleasance, and Curtis was kind of fun, but as with all other versions, the complexity of the interwoven subplots was entirely omitted.The full rendering of The Count of Monte Cristo must remain between novelist and reader a wholly telepathic experience."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The book is long, and seems to deviate from the plot a lot, although towards the end you realize that they all served purpose.

Batman comes close.You don't know who Edmond Dantes is?Well, allow to offer up a brief synopsis (very brief) of the novel that is The Count of Monte Cristo.Edmond Dantes, a successful young sailor, returns home to France in the early 19th Century with plans to wed the love of his life. Instead of the expected happiness, several of Edmond's friends have grown jealous of his life and go to the authorities to accuse Edmond of being a spy for Napoleon. Edmond is sent to prison, his life ruined and basically over. But in prison he makes friends with another inmate, an old man who tells Edmond of a secret treasure hidden away on the island of Monte Cristo. After the old inmate dies in prison, through some twists and turns Edmond manages to escape. Then he goes to the island and discovers this treasure, so huge it would make any kings of Europe envious. Soon a mysterious stranger, the Count of Mont Cristo, appears in Paris and begins to make the rounds as to \\"coming out in society.\\" To give away more would be a disservice to the reader, but let's just say poor Edmond is no longer poor and goes to extremes to find his revenge against his old \\"friends.\\"Unlike most of the film versions I've seen of this tale, the novel does not have the happiest of endings. The tale is sort of a tragedy, but one in which the protagonist wins out, though finds that what he has won was perhaps not truly worth everything he went through to achieve it.There are no simple endings here. The good guy doesn't win the girl and everything else. In other words, this is a lengthy, complicated tale that will make you think in the end. All the while giving you a darn fun reading experience. There's action to be found here, sword fights and the like, as well as intrigue and skulduggery. There's also a bit of comedy here and there, but out-and-out murder at times.Most of Dumas' longer novels touch upon many facets of the human existence, and this one is no exception, though it is perhaps the darkest of his longer writings."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This Puffin Classics edition of Alexandre Dumas's classic \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is very readable. If you are looking for an abridged version of this classic tale, look no further. The storyline is well captured and with many delightful descriptions still kept in. Often, however, the story seems to move quite fast and it makes you wonder what details are being left out. The level of English is about equal to the High School senior or early college level. A number of French word's are left untranslated which help add to the flavor of this classic French tale. The price is very low and its a great deal.I would definitely recommend this novel to students studying the French Revolution and Romanticism. There is a lot of historical and stylistic content that make this novel a gem for scholastic study. Also, if you would like a portrait of the comings and goings of aristocratic Europe around 1835, this novel depicts a lot from those societies.[...]"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book this much!

It was performed/read beautifully with a wide variety of accents that added to, rather than detracted from, the depth of the story.

The only downside to this book is that it's a bit heavy to read. However it is absolutely worth it, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Unfortunately, there is also much that is bad to be said about it; on balance, I think the bad slightly exceeds the good.On the plus side, there is a fascinating basic plotline, and some excellent characters. The writing is effective, and draws the reader into the plot; by the end of the book, I actually found myself caring about the characters and what happened to them, in spite of not really liking the book. And if you like complex, involved, convoluted plots, this book is certainly one that you will not want to miss.On the down side, while there is certainly 400+ pages of excellent plot in this novel, it takes the author 875 pages to tell it. (This refers to the unabridged Wordsworth Classics edition, in paperback.) The writing reminds me of a quote I once heard describing Dickens (and which could easily be applied to many 19th century authors): he was paid by the word, and it shows. Further, Dumas uses an odd convention for conversations: he does not change paragraph whenever he changes speakers. I don't know whether this was a standard convention for his time and place, or whether it is strictly his own. This is a minor quibble, but it is distracting, at least at first.Then, there are some truly immense amounts of suspension of disbelief that one must manage if one is to take the book seriously; primary among them is the fact of Dantes' immense competence, especially in the social skills and understanding of people, during his long, drawn-out revenge. Here, after all, is a man, who when he was a 19 year old was so naive that when he was imprisoned, he couldn't even fathom who would have wished him ill or why. He spent 14 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, the rest of it with only his one fellow prisoner as company. Granted, he had a native intelligence and charisma, and his fellow prisoner was well-educated, and spent much time teaching him languages, math, science, and history during their years together. And of course, once he escapes, he becomes fabulously wealthy. But native intelligence, a fine classical education, and a ton of money do NOT equate to a knowledge of people; he could not have picked that up in prison, because it is not the kind of thing that one can learn by studying the abstract; it can only be learned through practice, and he had none of that. Yet as soon as he leaves prison, he immediately is portrayed as a masterful schemer and manipulator. Granted, there is a ten-year gap during which we do not see his adventures, but even so, it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would be able to learn all that he learned in that time. Not to mention that it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would have been able to protect his person and his wealth while learning the people skills necessary.Then we have specific instances of his manipulation being more complete than anyone could reasonably expect to do, no matter how much they know, or how much money they have, at least without better explanations from the author (which we do not get). For instance, at the very beginning of his insinuation of himself into Parisian society, he buys the superior horses of one of his unwitting enemies, and then gives them back to the man's wife as a present, to sow marital dischord. When he does this, he knows that she intends letting a friend of hers (also the wife of one of his enemies) have a ride in the carriage behind the splendid beasts the next day. So he positions himself and his servant at precisely the right place to intercept the carriage the next day when the horses run amok and threaten to overset the carriage, and save the lady, thus insinuating himself into her good graces. It is made very clear that he knows that the horses will run wild by the questions and orders he gives his servant, but it is never explained HOW he knew that. Had he provided the driver for the carriage? It was never stated. Had he bribed the existing driver? Again, it was never stated, and it seems unlikely that such a bribe could be safely made, and kept completely secret. Had he insinuated an irritant into the horses' equippage? That would have assured them running wild, but not at the exact place and time that they did so, with no chance of overturning the carriage before ever they got to that point. All in all, an incident like that one needs to be explained in order to be at all plausible, and it wasn't. And there were others, too, less obvious, but still implausible.And a last negative, which causes me to drop my rating from three stars to two: Dantes is supposed to be a sympathetic character, terrible to his enemies, benificent to his friends, but all I can say is, preserve me from the pain of such benificence. Toward the end of the book, he saves his best friend's lover's life, by simulating her death. Yet he allows his friend to think that she is dead FOR A WHOLE MONTH in order to &quot;test his mettle&quot; to discern if he &quot;merits happiness&quot;. And in fact, years before, in his other act of benificence, to that friend's father, he saves him from financial ruin, but only does so at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute, allowing the man to come within a hairsbreadth of committing suicide in despair. If this were done in order to demonstrate that his ordeals have cost him all compassion, it would be one thing, but as I say, he is portrayed as being a marvellously benificent friend; the friends he has treated in this way not only forgive him, but don't seem to be aware that there is anything to forgive; they act as if his treatment of them has been marvellous.No, I cannot say that I enjoyed this book. I cannot rate it highly. I cannot, even, concede that it is (on balance) well done. But there certainly are things to like about it, and any book that can produce the interesting philosopical arguments that this one is capable of can't be all bad."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Modern television did not invent &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Alexander Dumas did. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; follows the life of Edmond Dantes who is falsely accused of treason against the crown, imprisoned, escapes in true MacGyver fashion, and then spends the remainder of his days wreaking revenge on his enemies. Dumas creates an interesting plot which winds its way through some 400 odd pages (and this is the abridged version). The plot is never boring and it is truly fascinating how Dumas manages to make what seem initially to be the most tangential details essential elements to the Count's plan for revenge. Also of interest are Dumas' explanations of events such as Dantes' tunneling through a stone prison cell using a tool he made from a soup pot, escape from prison by wrapping himself in his friends funeral shroud which he sews from the inside, and the construction of the crypt containing the seed money which transforms him into the count. That Dumas could coordinate all these nitpicky details and meld them into a singleminded plot makes the book worth reading just for that.Unfortunately, that is probably the only reason to read the book. Admittedly the abridged version leaves out significant portions of the story, but 441 pages should leave enough room for explanations without everything being attributed to sheer coincidence or to being brought into action via bribes and million dollar franc pensions. My other criticism of the book is that the singlemindedness of the Count seems fickle and unbelievable. Revenge is the overwhelming thought process of the count. In the abdridged version he spends some 350 pages ruminating about how he's going to have his revenge. Then suddenly towards the end, he has a change of heart - he feels that he just might have gone a bit overboard, after spending millions of francs bribing people and ruining the lives of several innocent people, all to give three persons their comeuppance. The count mopes about for a few days, then remembers that he truly was miserable in prison, and finally decides that he did the right thing and everything is fine and dandy. Bologna! If a man spends the majority of his life planning revenge and assumes the powers of essentially a sovereign entitity in doing so, what seems reasonable is that at the end he is either a hideous fiend who feels utterly no remorse or he is a total wreck of a man filled with unending guilt and remorse - certainly nothing that can be relieved by the joyful sight of the Morels.In summary, &quot;The COunt of MOnte Cristo&quot; is a great tale to quickly read (and that is probably needed since it is so long) but on closer inspection is unconvincing because of its reliance on coincidence, bribery, and superficial emotional turmoil."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is Dumas at his best.

Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version.

Dumas reallly did an excellent job creating a twisting plot and real sympathy for the very much wronged main character.

I saw the Count of Monte Cristo movie some time ago and decided to give this a shot. The beginning middle and end of the book are fabulous. I had to push through at about 70% through the book though. I even watched the movie after reading this. The author does a great job detailing the agony of the Count's revenge, where in the movie its one nice little trap set that does not really show how the Count made the others suffer. It was a great read, and had me thinking in old English all week."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of the greatest tales of revenge of all time. We owe to Dumas's skillful hand a narrative rivaling WAR AND PEACE, a vast collection of characters and tales within tales, all finally ancohered together upon the dreadful downfall of Edmond Dantes and his in some ways equally dreadful rebirth as that mysterious agent of justice, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a fascinating story, providing thrills -- but not at the expense of shallowness -- and provoking thought -- but without affectation.My only piece of advice to the reader is to take a few notes on the characters, since they disappear and reappear, and sometimes are referred to by different names and titles. However, for what it is worth, I was able to follow the story closely enough to thoroughly enjoy it even without notes, and despite occasionally being forced to set the book down for a few weeks between chapters.Because of the size of the book, the Modern Library Classics edition is especially useful, having comparatively large and legible print, decent spacing between lines, and, most importantly, a flexible spine which allows it to be set open on a table without creasing or cracking."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"i love this book! it is one of my favorite classics, and i higly reccomend it to everyone. however, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!! i borrowed this book from the library, only it was a much older edition, in hardcover, and much longer. i loved it. i bought this edition because i wanted to read it again and again, and i thought that it would be nice to have a paperback that was shorter, so it wouldn't be so bulky. i got three chapters into this edition and realized that it was abridged, despite not mentioning the fact anywhere. not only was it abridged (not to mention not telling me of that) but it left out complete parts, parts that were important to the story, including when fernand and danglars write the note accusing dantes, danglars trying to make caderousse too drunk to remember, and renee asking de villefort to be merciful to the prisonr. i don't know what else they've left out, seeing as how i didn't finish beyond the seventh chapter. also, the chapters are only two to four pages in this edition, while in the real book they are much longer. i would strongly like to deter anyone from buying this edition. it is a waste of time and money. buy the real thing."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The introduction to this excellent Modern Library edition says, &quot;The long journey of Edmond Dantes is one that we should all take at some point in our lives.&quot; I couldn't agree more. This novel easily ranks among the greatest epics--The Odyssey, Don Quixote, Les Miserables, War &amp; Peace and The Brothers Karamazov come to mind as works of comparable scope and moral grandeur.My only advice is: set aside some time. With 1500 pages, a complex web of characters (including many with shifting identities) and more than a few dispensible subplots, this unabridged edition is a challenge--albeit a rewarding one.The novel tackles all the great themes: war, revolution, love, power, money, justice, evil, God. But in a word, it's subject is REVENGE. A good-natured young man of exceptional promise, Edmond Dantes is betrayed by his erstwhile friends, unjustly imprisoned by an ambitious magistrate, and left for dead by the woman he loves. The first three hundred pages of the story are fast-paced and almost cinematic, from the wrenching scenes of betrayal and imprisonment, down to Dantes' miraculous escape and rebirth as a remarkable new man, the Count of Monte Cristo.The Count is part 007, part Stoic philosopher. He'll drop you in a duel, match wits with you in the salon, concoct potions from recipes in a dozen languages, be in three places at once, with three different identities, and exercise a kind of foresight and control over human events that we normally associate with gods and conspiracy theories. Oh yeah--and he's loaded, too.Dantes burns with a desire for revenge, but it's an entirely different sort than the Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson variety. Instead of blasting his way into Paris with a semi-automatic (or less anachronistically, with a really big sword), Dantes methodically plots the downfall of his enemies using even more lethal weapons: the evil that lurks in their own hearts.All this takes a long time. There is a big drop off in intensity in the middle chunk of the novel, as Dumas transitions from the swashbuckling Napoleonic days to a more traditional European novel of manners set in the 1830s. A whole new set of characters are introduced. Later, we discover their relationship to Dantes' earlier antagonists--but for a time we are totally at sea. Meanwhile, Dumas launches various digressions that will occasionally cause the reader to wonder whether he was getting paid by the word (probably).But don't despair. The last half of the novel gathers steam like a freight train, as Count of Monte Cristo moves in for the kill. The suspense builds--not because we wonder whether Dantes will get his revenge, but whether he can avoid turning into a monster in the process.Ultimately, Dumas offers as sane and humane a message as you can hope for from 1500 pages of injustice and vengeance. In a novel where fortunes shift, names and titles are granted and extinguished, and identities are transformed on turns of luck, the old Stoic wisdom shines through. It's not what happens to you, good or bad, but how you respond to it, that determines true virtue in this world. One suspects this would be true even without an avenging Providence, even if Edmond Dantes' triumph were less complete."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The single star refers to this version, not the book itself. Do not read this version if you want the complete version of the Count of Monte Cristo. Other reviewers have noted that this is an abridged version, but it is much worse than that, this is a 19th century English Bowdlerized version. Still worse is the fact that the publisher does not disclose this fact, which I consider to be quite deceptive. Significant subplots have been eliminated so as not to have to contend with what the Bowdlerizer considered unpleasant story elements such as: murder (two of them are eliminated in this version), an affair between two main characters leading to the illegitimate birth of a third character, the attempted infanticide of that third character and a lesbian relationship. Important characters become merely ciphers, and main characters just fade away because the chapters describing their fate have been eliminated. While important chapters are eliminated, the flowery 19th century prose (or at least the English translation of this language) is retained. Thus, this version is over 600 pages long. In contrast, the Lowell Bair translation and abridgement (published by Bantam) is about 200 pages shorter. However, the Bair version is more complete in terms of story elements and is a version that I recommend.This book contains some enrichment in term of additions of some historical background, information about the life and work of Dumas, chapter notes and interpretive notes. In my opinion, however, these enrichments in no way compensate for the trashing of Dumas' story. Also, beware if you read this version for school, you will suffer the double handicap of not getting the complete story while still having to wade through over 600 pages of 19th century prose. Read the whole thing, or at least an abridgement that uses a more modern prose style, while still retaining the whole story. Beware, however, the complete book is about twice as long as this version and many times the size of the Bair abridgement."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I picked up the book because I found the movie very entertaining and thought it'd be nice to read the classic novel.

As soon as I found out I went and got the complete version of the book and started all over. It astounds me how much they cut out. They pretty much butchered the story. Please read the book because is fabulous, but not this version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Parisian bon vivant, drinker, womanizer and genius Alexandre Dumas has, in \\"The Count of Montecristo\\", given the world one of the greatest stories ever told.It is a marvel of literary invention. Its literary scope and scale and historical sweep is nothing short of revolutionary, and for all of its grandeur and jaw-dropping perspective, it is unfailingly intimate, brutally so.\\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is the story of young Edmond Dantes, a French sailor aboard the merchant-vessel Pharaon in 1815, who returns to the port of Marseilles with the glorious Catalan girl Mercedes waiting to be his bride, and with a promising future as the captain of the merchantman ahead of him.Or so he thinks: for there is no poison so bitter, so brutal, or so deadly as envy. And as Old Scratch slithered forth as a serpent to poison even earthly paradise, so too Dantes is stalked by an envious trio of the sort that put Caesar in an early grave: the bitter and calculating Danglars, supercargo of the Pharaon; Danglars's drinking buddy Caderousse; and Mercedes's cousin Fernand, hopelessly in love with his cousin and aghast at her impending marriage to Dantes.It is 1815; a time of shaky stability for France and Europe. The Ogre of Corsica has just been put down, exiled to Elba---but Bonapartist clubs assassinate Royalist generals in the capital, and the alleys of Marseilles are rife with whispers of Napoleon's return.It is into this poisonous, heated, feverish atmosphere that this trio of serpents work their vindictive magic, and with the flick of a plume the happy Dantes, on the very day of his wedding and at his nuptial feast, finds himself surrounded by soldiers, held at bayonet point, and hauled before the implacable gaze of Justice. And fatality!---Justice consigns him to the wretched dungeons of the Chateau D'If, a heartless, impregnable rock off the coast of France---for the rest of his life.To say anything more would be to give far too much away, but know this: \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is both black book of revenge and horror tale: a consumptively engaging story of double Betrayal, Death, and Despair: a Man consigned to death and rot by his supposed friends and colleagues, buried beneath the Earth in a great black tomb, forgotten by his best beloved, lost to everything, left for the teeth of rat and Time.And it is also a tale of Resurrection---and Revenge.You'll want to get a copy of the unabridged version; Random House's The Modern Library edition (published in 1996) is a fine choice, and just so you can check (be warned: the shelves are full of sliced and diced pretenders) the unexpurgated version clocks in at a hefty 1462 pages. That means once you're through with it, you can use it to forestall a burglary or brain an assassin.Never have 1500 pages moved so swiftly and deftly. A rumor, bandied around the streets of Paris in Dumas's day which resurfaced in Perez y Reverte's mesmerizing \\"Club Dumas\\", is that the jolly-faced Dumas signed a blood-contract with Satan, and in return for his soul he was given a diabolic gift to be prolific.Diabolic or Angelic, there is no doubt that Dumas is pure genius: you marvel at the simultaneous breadth and depth and intimacy of \\"Count of Montecristo\\". There is no padding here; not one sentence is superfluous and every word tells. A paragraph sliced away here, a sentence taken out there, and the perfect, brutal, logical, coldly calculating structure would fall apart.In the meantime, the reader is introduced to some of the most fascinating and memorable characters in history: the tragic, beautiful Mercedes; her dandyish son Albert; her husband, the stiff and martial Count Fernand de Mortcerf. We see, in his middle age, the ever-calculating banker Danglars and his miserable family, including the boyish, driven, devious and ultimately foolish Eugenie; the Prosecutor of the King, Villefort, and his fascinating family: the hopelessly innocent Valentine, the paralyzed, rabid old Jacobin M. de Noirtier, and the Prosector's young---and tragically greedy---trophy wife.Beyond these characters, \\"Count of Montecristo\\" gives us even more, taking us deep into the lives of France's Rich & Famous---and villainous! We come face to face with the Old Ogre of Corsica himself, Napoleon Bonaparte. We pass the time in Latin and philosophy with the foppish, foolish, overly confident King Louis XVIII, who would rather count the angels on the head of a pin than martial his troops against the lively spectre of Bonapartism.And I have but scratched the surface: this story is the very essence, the pure, undiluted blood, of swashbuckling fantasy. Here we have pirates and Roman brigands, the famous Italian banditti Luigi Vampa, stories within stories within stories, buried treasure on a deserted volcanic island rising up over the waves of the Tyrrhennian sea. We have mad monks, and midnight assignations, and foundlings and changelings and villainous [...] sons appearing out of the blue. We have plots, and poisonings, and murder, and villainy, and great heroism; we have connections to the marvellous, tragic downfall of the great Abyssinian hero Ali Pasha.In short, we have a marvellous witch's brew of high treason and infamy, a Devil's Codex of revenge, retribution, and absolution. My flimsy prose is not worthy to provide adequate praise to this masterpiece: get a copy, close the curtains, have a bottle of your finest chianti at the ready, smoke some Montecristo cigars if you're a smoker (you should know that these, the finest the Dominican Republic offers, were inspired by this tale), turn off all the phones in the house---and transport yourself to a tale of betrayal, death, resurrection, villainy and revenge---served Piping Cold."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Unfortunately when I ordered this edition, it was not shown that this is only the abridged version.

Both my father and I found ourselves questioning the way we develop and uphold relationships and why bluntness seems useful to many in the place of eloquence and perception. The only reason that no one, excepting Mercedes, figures out who Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo, Sinbad the Sailor, Abbe Busoni and Lord Wilmore are is because of the way the Count represents himself and 'others.'I think the real question that The Count of Monte Cristo is asking us today is why we have forgotten the things that were so key to the way people lived back then. Maybe we have gained in science and math, but we have lost so much! Thinking of the forgotten things is the real painfulness of this book. This one is at the very top of my list.

Edmond Dantes is a respected sailor who was going to marry a girl named Mercedes. Edmond was going to be the captain of his own ship and make a living. He lived in France in 1825 with his father. He is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist (a friend of Napoleon's) on the day of his wedding. Two men planned this accusation and they both benefited from his disappearance. Edmond was sent to a horrible prison and after a month an old man tunnels into his cell. The old man becomes Edmond's teacher in language, manners, and math. He also tells him the names of his two enemies, Danglars and Fernand. Edmond is filled with the power of vengeance and vows to avenge himself. Together, they plan their escape but the old man is hit by a disease. Before the old man dies, he gives Edmond a treasure map. Edmond uses quick thinking to devise a plan to escape and retrieve the treasure. Edmond gets out of jail and recovers the treasure making himself rich. He starts to do good deeds for others and changes his name to the Count of Monte Christo. The Count (Edmond) begins to slowly avenge himself while he helps out \\"Edmond Dantes'\\" loyal friends even though it is Edmond who is really helping them.My favorite quotes are \\"I have instilled in your heart vengeance\\" and \\"For the last four nights I have been watching over you.\\" These quotes show the two main meanings of this book, which are Edmond getting vengeance and Edmond helping his friends. The Count of Monte Christo is a fiction/adventure book that tells Edmond Dantes life story and his adventures. Alexandre Dumas creates great pictures in my mind with his fabulous details. He made the characters consistently sound the same in their dialogue. He used wonderful language and added a little bit of humor in some parts. I was amazed how he mixed English and French together.I would recommend this book to fourteen or fifteen year olds because it is hard to comprehend and the language is old fashioned. I think that it would be hard for younger children to keep track of all the characters. The Count of Monte Christo is unlike any other book that I have read. It is the only book that has had me guessing all the way through. I would infer something and then I was completely wrong, which makes the book exciting. I would compare the Count of Monte Christo to the Lord of the Rings because they are both great adventures. They are extremely well written books and I like them both. Another book series that I compare The Count of Monte Christo to is the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt series because in both of the books there are great schemes. In the books, written by Clive Cussler, the people who make up the ingenious schemes are bad. In The Count of Monte Christo, the good guy is the schemer who plots his revenge. They both have good schemes but what separates them is that the good guy is outsmarting the bad guys, Fernand and Danglars. The Count of Monte Christo is the best genre it could be. Very few fantasy or mystery books that I have read matched up to it. The Harry Potter series and Eragon were also good books that I would compare to The Count of Monte Christo.This book was really addicting and I read the whole thing in three days. I was completely hooked by the twentieth page because of the author's detail. I could not put down the book; I even brought it in the car for a two minute drive. The book ended with a twist that I never saw coming."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I believe this book is excellent, the movie is mediocre compared to the book.

If you are incredibly curious and are way into the story, reserve the next 24 hrs or so just for reading the story! A good and happy man is imprisoned wrongly....he spends the next---what 14 years of his life in the cell of a prison for a shallow crime he didn't even commit. (The author doesn't dwell on that point). What happens in prison? Well, Edmond Dantes discovers a story of a hidden treasure and eventually an escape. It takes him years to set up his revenge and come to terms with it. (We don't dwell on the years, either). The author explicitly states that Edmond has God's approval to carry out his plans on his &quot;backstabbers.&quot; The revenge is great---for he only pushes these evil people's deeds in their faces. They choose what to would do with the realization of their numerous crimes. I hope I'm making sense. But don't except a sweeping tale of love, any romance or swordfighting here.

If you have seen the film adaptations of this book then some of the character names and general outline of the story will be familiar to you.A young merchant sailor, Edmond Dant&egrave;s is about to achieve prosperity in his life.

Dant&egrave;s, ignorant of the political scene, has agreed to take a letter from Napoleon to some Bonapartists in Paris. Using this as fodder, Danglars, Mondego and Caderousse bring him to court to be tried for treason.Dant&egrave;s is convicted, and once in prison meets a man named Abb&eacute; Faria. He is a priest who educated Dantes into a well-rounded, well-informed man. He leaved Dantes with the knowledge of many riches on the Isle of Monte Cristo, and how to get to the place. When Faria dies, Dantes uses his shroud as a means of escape, and is thrown into the sea.He reaches Monte Cristo and is astounded at all the riches. Disguising himself as a priest, he travells to Marseille. Upon arrival he learns that his father has died and that his fiancee Mercedes has married Mondego. He also is told about the plot to frame him.Ten years later, he reinstates himself into French society, giving himself the title Count of Monte Cristo. Nobody recognizes him with the exception of Mercedes. He uses his knowledge of his old aversaries to bring about their ruin in very public and humiliating ways.Not all of his motives are driven by vengance, however. He also sets out to reward everyone who helped him over the years, and does this through his extensive riches and influence.Overall the novcel is very intriguing and exciting. It is full of action filled escapes and duels which add to the excitement. There is an air of mystery around Dantes that gives it the air of a thriller novel. It is full of plot twists and intrigue that make it difficult to put down for a minute. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent storyteller who has crafted a masterpiece that rivals his well-loved Three Muskateers series.In addition to being an excellent storyteller, Dumas is an astounding writer. The plot line is gripping in and of itself, but Dumas' expert control of the English language grips the reader with the words themselves, not just what they represent.It would be wise to read the abridged version of this novel, because for the average person the excruciating detail in the long version detracts from the story a little bit. To keep it more exciting and gripping, the shorter version covers the most important parts without many of the very miniscule details in the original.The original is also an excellent read, and gives much more insight into the characters' lives, but it would be reccomended to read it second to the abridged version, and only by the most patient Dumas fans."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This has to be one of the greatest novels ever written.

As I pored through page after page, I was awestruck by Dumas' skill and compassion. I've since read his Three Musketeers. Although enjoyable, it lacks the depth and soul-stirring of The Count.

Imbuing it with a rich and captive plot, Dumas enriches his masterpiece with themes of love, hate, vengeance, and forgiveness--all part of our quotidian lives.Although the original version stretches over 1200 pages, the abridged version with its 600 pages is just as enticing but more complex at few scenes where some characters appear suddenly.A background of the author's era is essential in understanding the setting and beginnings of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was during this era that French royalties exiled Napoleon Bonaparte, the hailed French hero, to the Mediterranean island of Elba, where Edmond Dantes, the protagonist, finds him. It is the letter containing Napoleon's secret plans of retaliating against the French nobility that partially causes Dantes's imprisonment. This political reason, however, is not the main reason.Though mostly direct and clear, Dumas's style varies to a more philosophical one when discussing human nature, which he does often towards the end. Edmond Dantes, as mentioned above, is the young and well-off protagonist, ready to become the captain of his ship and get married. With a big heart and somewhat ignorant soul, Dantes falls into the farce those closest to him had set up. In the beginning chapters, the ready already sees themes of love, hatred, and jealousy.Returning after a long time under the name of Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes begins executing his plans of revenge against those who destroyed him and recompense those who helped him. What truly makes this book such a remarkable one is the beauty and perfection with which the Golden Rule (\\"Do unto others what you with done unto you\\") is applied throughout the development of the plot.With abundant characters that differ in personality and beliefs, every reader is sure to find his/her own reflection taking part of the story's advancement.Overall, this book is worthwhile to read. I assure you that you will not be disappointed but you will enjoy every chapter of it. It is no wonder that it is hailed as \\"one of the greatest classics.\\""},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just recently revisited this brilliant novel and recalled all the reasons it's one of my all-time favorites! It's a lengthy book but you hardly even notice with the way it keeps you hooked! Dumas originally wrote this as a serial in a publication over the course of a couple years so he kept his segments packed with plenty of excitement that keeps you wanting more. You don't need to wait for it to pick up like with most longer books-- you know right away that this is a great story!Edmond Dantes, nineteen years old, about to be made captain of the Pharaon, and just ready to celebrate his marriage to a young girl he is very much in love with has his liberty snatched from him and spends the next fourteen years locked in a dark prison cell, falsely accused. When he finally escapes, he finds his father dead, his fiance married to one of the very men responsible for his imprisonment, and the other guilty parties wealthy and respected. But a vast treasure bequeathed to Edmond by the Abbe engenders the Count of Monte Cristo, a man hellbent on being His hand of justice. Fast death is too good for these men that ruined a life for their own ends... ."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have been a fan of the count and his story for a long time with tv series and the movie based off it, but nothing quite compares to this book. It's absolutely amazing and has become one of my favorite books along with Les Miserables. It deals with justice, revenge, and hope. Many of the passages are inspiring, and on a whole, it flows beautifully.This took me a very long time to read because of it's length, but I was able continue with ease every time I picked it up. All of the characters are interesting and detailed in a way that is almost shocking. This book draws you in and leaves you anticipating for what happens next. The ending was not exactly what I expected, but I was very satisfied with it. Dumas is a remarkable storyteller and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Two jealous men plot to have Edmond Dantes thrown into a hellhole of a dungeon on false charges, and a third self-serving government man arranges to have Dantes kept there for life in order to protect his own interests. However, after fourteen years Dantes manages to escape and soon finds that his life as he once knew it is over: his promising career as a merchant ship's captain was aborted, his father had long ago starved himself to death out of grief, and his former beloved fiancee had married another. Yeah if I were in Dantes' shoes I'd hold a pretty serious grudge too.Fortunately Dantes' only friend in the dungeon had divulged to him, just before his death, the secret location of a buried treasure on the uninhabited isle of Monte Cristo near the French coast. Dantes soon becomes the fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo and proceeds to gradually but relentlessly exact total retribution on his betrayers, two decades after they'd first hatched their plot.This long tale of revenge satisfies. The basic plot is quite drawn out as Dantes' master plan requires him to befriend and gain the trust of the men who destroyed his prospects in youth. He accomplishes this mainly by becoming somewhat intimate with these mens' families, so there are various sub-plots that comprise the middle third or so of the book. Following this section, the Count has his chess pieces where he wants them and proceeds to rapidly and systematically destroy his enemies. Of course the best parts are their horrified aspects when he finally reveals his identity to them.Though 'Count' is replete with rich renderings of scenes in various parts of Paris, Marseilles and the French Riviera, and Rome and rural Italy, his emphasis is on the dialogue and action more than on the settings. Unlike for example Victor Hugo, who puts much more weight on describing the stage upon which the actors walk, through delightfully sudden tangents on history and philosophy that do in fact relate to the subject at hand. Dumas's style is much more focused and to the point.Though rather simple in plot development and resolution, 'Count' stands among the finest of the classics. An absolute must for teen readers. For adults it's still a great read, though most of the events and the ending are somewhat predictable and almost always go the way of the hero. Also, Dantes' transformation from a poorly educated happy-go-lucky sailor boy to a cultured single-minded demi-god with seemingly infinite knowledge / wisdom and superhuman insight is a bit too much to believe!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you're going to read The Count of Monte Cristo you must read the unabridged version (the abridged version cuts out so much it will leave you going, \\"Huh?\\" half way through!)Betrayal, Adventure, Revenge - this is classic literature from which everything exciting we currently are exposed to derived.The translation of this particular version is excellent.It's the single largest novel I ever read (I'm not a big \\"reader\\"), but it went very quickly."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I had seen the movie and thought that the element of surprise would be removed because of that fact. I feared before reading it that I would not feel the tension or shock in the story that makes reading a novel like this so enjoyable, like a kid who peeked at his Christmas presents on the 23rd and then feels little emotion at the unveiling on the 25th. But, the movie had only basic similarities with the book. I was enthralled with every page and amazed with the character and plot development. Dumas was a genius. Do not miss any of this story. I do not see how an abridged version could possibly capture the weight of this story or produce the same kind of effect upon the reader."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I've been a reader of an abridged version of this tale since I was a kid in 7th grade. Probably read it 20 times. Then 2 years ago I got a copy of the Penguin unabridged version - holy cow!!! I had no idea what I was missing - incomparable depth, nuance, and detail so richly rendered you feel as if you're a bystander in the scenes!The story is a classic - a young man full of hope, love, and unlimited potential is falsely accused and imprisoned on the eve of his wedding. A miraculous escape 14 years later, re-birth and transformation into the formidable Count of Monte Cristo begins the painstaking planning of a long awaited revenge. And what a complete revenge it is.Even at 1100 pages, it's never boring (and although at times Dumas stretches out what could be related in a more concise way, I inwardly smile when I recall that he was paid by the word:), and when you reach the end you'll certainaly want for more. It's beyond awesome - I never tire of this story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I thought it was well written and that it explains the story so you are not confused. I thought the was a little short because it goes through his prison time almost three-fourths of the book. My conclusion is that revenge is not the best way to handle things. Very well written!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I think that Count is a really good book. I was hesitant to read it, at first, but once I got started, I couldn't stop. The action, once it gets started, is amazing. There's never a dull moment.

Excellent unabridged copy. Well worth the price!!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I had purchased a copy of this book because I love the story of the Count of Monte Cristo and wanted a version in hard back. It was only after I was reading through it when I noticed stuff different from my penguin soft back version did I flip to the front to discover the book was abridged.Who ever edited this book had to have been stupid because they did a horrible job of editing. I could understand cutting material which isn't critical to the story. Examples from the unabridged version included 'How to rescue a gardener from dormice who are eating his peaches' and 'the road for Belgium.' However to deliberately omit major portions which are critical to the whole of the story is wrong and causes the whole story to be misrepresented.Major portions which were omitted included the the final judgment of Danglars at the hands of Vampa, and also the story of Andrea Cavalcanti and how he ties to both Villefort and Danglars. Even the comic book version of the story I read as a kid managed to included all of these.This abridged version of this book isnt worth the paper it is written on. I am extremely disappointed at Barnes and Noble for putting their name on crap like this. Don't waste your money, go get yourself a penguin classics version instead and read the whole story.The Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)Hard Cover."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Although billed by Amazon as unabridged, this is a butchering of the story that would make Dumas roll in his grave. The back of the box says \\"abridged,\\" yet somehow the store insists it is unabridged, simply because it is longer than other audio additions. Make no mistake, many rich and wonderful (not to mention important) are left off with no attempt to apologize, repent, or make amends. A proper COUNT audio book should be in the neighborhood of 30 CDs...this one is only 14, although this information is concealed in the product description. The picture shown is not accurate. BEWARE!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and tranformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book. At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth is beyond a simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the best book I've read in quite a long while. I wasn't expecting it to be. Frankly, I tend to have low expectations for 19th-century European novels in regard to sheer readability. Like vegetables and trips to the dentist, they tend to be more good for you than simply good. Add in the fact that the unabridged version is over 1000 pages, and I felt sure that the Count would be a somewhat difficult companion.Nothing could be farther from the truth! Edmond Dantes' adventures kept me fully engrossed from beginning to end. I was disappointed to turn the final page, left longing for more.If you've seen a movie version of Count of Monte Cristo, expect surprises. I had seen both the Richard Chamberlain and Jim Caviezel versions before reading the book (mmmm . . . Jim Caviezel), but neither were entirely true to the storyline or the mood of the original.Edmond himself is a thoroughly satisfying and seductive hero. (The reader must take with a grain of salt the numerous references to his drug habit; at the time, opium was unfortunatly de rigeur for a Romantic hero.) The secondary characters are equally engrossing, from the admirable Maximilian Morrel to the villainous Danglars; and the ingenious machinations by which Edmond contrives to reward the deserving and doom the guilty make the chapters fly by.I would encourage everyone to be sure and get the unabridged version of this masterpiece. It is by no means slow or ponderous, and the thought of what must be left on the cutting room floor to reduce this book to half its size makes me wince."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This masterpiece is a story of triumph, love, jealousy, wisdom, mystery, revenge, suspence, travel, secrets, longing, all the things that make up life. What an amazing book! It has been my all time favirote for years, I recomend it to anyone! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a brilliant work of fiction. Every one of the 1300 pages has meaning. Every character, every event, and every other detail of the story are connected. The story is totally unpredictable and makes you want to turn to the next page. The author has an incredible sense of time, place, and human nature. Every scene is developed with great eloquence and artistry. This story is simply brilliant.Stories like this put writing to shame. It makes me wonder, is it even possible to write a great novel anymore? (not that writing is some big competition or something). There is nothing about this book that could have been better. It is as close to perfection as you could get. The writers intimate knowledge of paris, life, and people is unparalleled. If you want to be a writer or simply want to see the artwork of writing at the height of it's powers, here it is. This has the power of a mozart symphony or a charle parker solo. I thought les miserables was great and that it couldn't get any better. It just did!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"WARNING: For people who want to read a 1100 page The Count of Monte Cristo translated by Robin Buss on Kindle, it is NOT the one. Buss's version is not available on Kindle!! :("},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In these troubled times, we are facing a crisis that is not mentioned very much. We have grown teenagers who don't like to read and cannot pronounce the simplest words. If they do read, it's the latest Wal-Mart fad novel that will not be remembered in 100 years. As for the classics, they are shunned upon as being too complex and too long to read.At least I still got the reading mojo people lacked. This is probaly the greatest book I've read in awhile. Even though it was written over 160 years ago, it's still hard to beat.The basic outline of the plot is simple. It takes place in France, and even though it is written in English, many French elements remain. Edmund Dantes has it all. He's a well respected sailor who has a beautiful bride-to-be named Mercedes. But unknown to him, a man named Fernand, (who is also Mercedes' cousin 0_0) wants her as well. So with the help of a man name Danglers, he sends a letter accusing Dantes of being a traitor, and the prosecutor Villefort sends him without trial to the Chteau d'If, an island prison, which is a real place, by the way. There he spends fourteen years of his life, the only company he has is a secret communication with the supposedly mad Abbe Faria, who helps him figure out who the framers were. When he dies, Dantes replaces his body with his own and he is thrown off to sea, where he manges to recover and heads to the island of Monte Cristo, where Faria said there was a treasure at. After becoming rich, he plans his unique revenge against his accusers, under the alias of the Count of Monte Cristo.But it's more than a tale of revenge. The novel is filled with many characters who have their own agendas, as well as some extraordinary writing and many twists in the story. It's actually kind of sad that this book doesn't get as much respect as it deserves. While you may be turned off by its length (don't get the abridged version, or God forbid the Great Illustrated Classics version, AKA 'Literature for Dummies') and its archaic language, but anyone who actually knows how to read should understand this book.So yeah, the next time you're at the library or the bookstore, perhaps you should skip Breaking Dawn and read something good, like this."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best work of fiction I have read in a long time. The depth and detail is just stunning. People don't write like this anymore. I'm only about halfway through this (it's over 1,300 pages), but I haven't tired of it at all. This is really a character study on the nature of man at its core. The author's observations in this respect are sprinkled throughout the story and are both deep and humorous at times. Truly a classic work of literature. This unabridged translation is very well done, and maintains a \\"classic\\" feel - slightly challenging and not at all dumbed down in the language. I would recommend it to any mature adult. However, it is not for children or adolescents, due to the wide ranging and at times harsh situations."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I bought this book last minute as a Christmas gift and received it just in time for me to wrap as a little something extra.

Edmond endured a trial by fire and with inventiveness and unwavering steadfastness was able to achieve his goals. His revenge in each was a fitting exactment of justice. I personally love the revenge on Danglers. While the ending was predictable, I think that was the whole point. Revenge certainly is a dish better served cold.

Since it is so much based on revenge, I have often wondered what this meant about me, but it makes me feel ill to read some of these reviews by those who do not grasp the essence of this book, unless they found it too difficult for them to understand. I cannot in any way see this as a shallow novel. This book is truly a classic, especially for one who is as infatuated with France, as am I.

I am not a big reader of fiction and the story line of the book didnt inspire a lot of confidence. A story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned who comes back and avenges his enemies -- doesn't sound too interesting.Anyway, I just started reading a few pages just for the heck of it and found that I couldn't put the book down. This was story-telling at its best. It took me a couple of days to finish the book -- I really did nothing else during that period. The book was so well written -- and well translated.There are a whole bunch of characters in the story and their stories weave in and out of each other sustaining the pace of the novel. In some ways, this book seemed to be like a collection of novels (or novellas) that somehow got intertwined into a coherent large novel. Some of the things in the story might seem remarkable and hard to believe -- but that doesnt detract from the craftsmanship of Dumas which is quite unlike anything I have read thus far.There are a lot of abridged editions floating around -- however, after reading the original unabridged translation, I think its not possible to abridge the story without taking away significantly from its greatness."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Yes, that's my only complaint.

When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it...thinking of what may happen next etc. How did Dumas craft such a story, I'll never know.Also, the book is much different and better than the movie (I saw the movie first and liked it so decided to read it). The book definitely does not have the Hollywood ending the movie.

Dumas's style of writing cliffhanger endings consistently throughout the novel plays well to today's generations (myself included) who have been raised by television and movies. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO reads like a compelling dramatic series (as it once was when published) that you simply never want to end.

Forstadt"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, or The Count of Monte Cristo, has often been refered to as the greates adventure novel of all time. The novel begins with a great betrayal of the lead--Edmond Dante, the count of Monte Cristo, etc -- by four associates--Fernand, Caderousse, Villefort and Danglars--which results in a lengthy imprisonment for Dante in the dreaded Castle d'If. During this imprisonment, Dante becomes highly educated under the tutelage of a fellow prisoner, Abbe Faria, and undergoes a spritual awaking; Dante henceforth wishes \\"...to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.'\\"What follows is a daring escape, the discovery of great treasure and an elaborate plan, taking place over more than a decade, to bring all to justice. There are approximately 45 different characters (of which 5 or 6 are aliases of the lead), and a complex, interwoven relationship among them. (I suggest creating a 'character map' as you go along to keep things straight.) Additionally, and unlike 'modern' novels, there is purpose in each carefully crafted scene; each element serving to drive the plot forward to the unforgettable climax. This is undoubtly a classic that is as relevant and exciting today as it was 170 years ago. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have read The Count of Monte Cristo a few times. The Unabridged Oxford Edition is the best. The explanatory notes are a great bonus as they deepen the experience of reading this Masterpiece. The introduction gives us very interesting supplementary information that allows for a greater appreciation of the story as well as for Alexander Dumas himself. This is a book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime, and I highly recommend reading the actual book, not Kindle. This is a book that you will develop a relationship to and it becomes your friend. There's something very nostalgic and comforting about holding a real book in your hands. I may be very old fashioned, but sometimes books don't feel right when electronics are involved. I love the cover of this edition as well (revised edition 2008) . I feel that it captures the essence of Edmund Dantes: A young, beautiful man with sadness and revenge in his eyes. The painting (Leon Cogniet's self portrait) evokes an ability to penetrate the Soul of Dantes, the greatest protagonist of all time. It may sound a bit silly, but reading this book makes me pause. And when I pause, I find myself studying this image while contemplating life. Life as I experience it through this incredibly complex adventure called The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is epic!! As the back page states: 'A novel of enormous tension and excitement'. I buy this particular copy in bulk and gift it to anyone I meet who is even just slightly interested in reading it. Most people, myself included, are absorbed within minutes of reading this book and we all finish it. As a good friend said to me while she was reading 'The Count': \\"You know when you are reading a great piece of literature; Classics are Classics for a Reason."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"When asked if he feared death, Alexandre Dumas' replied, \\"I will tell Death a story and she will be kind to me.\\" After reading this book, I believe him. This is a very intricate story with a wonderful variety of characters. My paper copy of the book actually has a list of characters and historical events to help the first-time reader keep track of what's going on throughout the story, so it is an involved read the first time around. However, the story is so wonderfully worth the effort that I have since re-read it at least five times. This book is the epitome of timeless classic to me."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Engrossing, captivating, heart-wrenching, thought provoking..... I, too, could not put this book down! It may not be verbatim but I can not imagine that it could be any more wonderful than it is. I read a variety of books and re-read the good ones on occasion. I will definitely re-read this book and encourage all of my children to do the same. I think having it on a kindle will help so they do not know how many pages it is and get discouraged. Warning! It had me so enthralled that I burned a few meals while I was reading."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It took me 3 months to read this. I read it consistently. There was literally never a dull moment. I must make the bold statement of claiming it The Greatest Book I Have EVER Read!!! I am now going to buy the actual book, the B & N Leather Bound Classic just to display proudly."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is riveting, thrilling, and fantastic! BUT for those of you who like me have seen movies and animation \\"loosely\\" based on the book. Two elements in adaptations: the union of Edmond & Mercedes, and Edmond's transformation from cold-hearted avenger to human being again, are limited to the adaptations!!*SPOILER ALERT*The original story (English version anyway) is a lot more complicated. Edmond or Monte cristo, as the story progresses, is cold, cruel, and blind with revenge as he drives one enemy to the madhouse and the other to commit suicide, and yet another he allows to be beated to death. By the time he realizes he has gone too far and starts to feel remorse, the horrifying damage is done. Edmond never truly forgives the men who framed him or his betrothed (Mercedes) for not waiting for him. However, he does realize he can't play God and is not the hand of providence. He knows he must atone.As for Edmond and Mercedes, they DONOT reconcile and reunite, instead he hangs her out to dry and sails off with some Greek princess, Haydee, who is at least 20 years his junior in the last chapter of the book. Haydee who is a supporting character at best is so ineffectual and child-like, its actually annoying. It's hard to feel sympathy for her sad story while she acts pompous and dim witted. Her main purpose in the story is as a plot device (the revenge on Fernand), she is otherwise a shadow character whose affection towards the count is parasitic, she herself appears so indulgent and kind of a moocher. The count's choice of her as a mate killed the ending for me. Granted, the count is pathetic and all alone in the world at this point, and will take whatever he can get.The orginal story destroyed my cherished idea/memory of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was heart breaking! Daggers and thunderbolts :("},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Since the download was free, I decided to give it a shot. I was very pleased with this Kindle version. It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much, if anything, missing from this version.If this is your first time reading this story, don't be put off by other reviewers who claim that it is too wordy or easy to get lost. It really isn't. And if you've only seen the movie (unless it was the Richard Chamberlain version, which in my opinion is the only good adaptation)be prepared for the ending to be different.Overall a really great, must-read book!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Just got the book today and will be looking forward to reading it. This version, however, is abridged. The cover does not state this but the inside title page does. Quite disappointed because I wanted the unabridged version. Will be buying the complete version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I love my Kindle! Free classics! I read the summary for The Count of Monte Cristo and knew there was a movie version so I figured, why not? It has to be good if hollywood wanted to make a movie out of it. It has this reputation of being a very long book, but with the kindle you can't really tell and because I had a hard time putting it down, it didn't seem long at all. The story is fantastic! A man goes to prison, finds treasure and spends years....YEARS plotting the perfect revenge. Unlike other trite revenge stories of people going out and trying to murder whoever wronged them, Edmond Dantes just tries to make everyone's life miserable without actually appearing to be the cause of it. It's just very clever! You empathize with him and understand how he became the way he is. I liked almost everything about the book except his love story with Haidee because he treated her like she was his daughter and then realized he loved her....gross. Anyway, yes i guess it is a long book but definitely worth the read! It has become one of my favorite books...definitely in the top three! I wish I knew French so I could read the actual version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"From the moment I picked up this book it has not left my eyes. I cannot put this book down.

Compelling, cannot put the book down. Highly recommendThe Count of Monte Cristo-a must read for everyone. Classic!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! That may seem incredibly overboard and over-dramatic, but honestly, when a novel is about the intricately plotted revenge of a man who escapes one of the toughest and unforgiving prisons after being falsely accused for thirteen years, then I think I have the right be be a little over-dramatic. To me Dumas never gets old, his writing is always meticulous and sweeping and he never misses a beat when it comes to plot. Everything is so perfect and with all the identities that Dantes takes on throughout the novel, it's so important that the audience understand what is happening and who that English Gentlemen or Sinbad the Sailor really is and Dumas does it with style.If Dumas was alive today and I somehow finagled the chance to meet him, I would probably swoon and faint on the spot. He's amazing. His writing is SUPERB! READ THIS BOOK if you haven't already, and if you have read it, read it again and again and again because it's never the same but it's always delightful"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters in this book due to the number of typos and poor translation. As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion! You're better off just buying the book instead of this."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I'm going to start out by saying that this is one of my favorite stories ever and it has had many adaptations and given inspiration to many more in all sorts of media. I've seen the anime, the old 1975 movie and the newer 2002 movies, I've even read the abridged version. I'm just now getting around to reading the full unabridged version and regret not having done so sooner. After a quick glance at a few different reviews I discovered that this was the most faithful translation of the original, though I have no way of truly knowing for myself since I can't read french, but either way this is an absolutely amazing book. Getting the full story is much more fulfilling than getting the watered down unabridged version.To elaborate on the story for those who don't know it, a man named Edmond Dante's has everything he can ask for in life when it is all taken away by a few other men who were jealous of his success. He is then thrown into prison and after being trained in many aspects by his cell mate he manages to escape and that's when the true journey starts of him dedicating his entire life to exact the ultimate revenge on those who had robbed him of all he held dear all those years ago."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is one of the best books ever written, by a great author. Revenge is necessary, but is it sweet?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Since I was a child, I've heard of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" but as I grew into my teens and became an avid reader, I never gave a thought to reading it. For some reason (perhaps because the name was familiar to me from childhood), I saw it as a young readers book. Now, at the wise? old age of 69, my daughter, who is also an avid reader, suggested that I read it. She claimed it was one of the best books she's read. Normally, we have the same taste in literature. My daughter has read most of the \\"classics\\" and read the majority of them one after the other several years ago.After reading several pages, I gave up on it. While it is a fine work of literature for sure, I found a lot of the descriptive paragraphs to be repetitive and interrupted the flow of the story. Another issue for me personally was the amount of French content which I realize, is no fault of the author but a fault of my own for not knowing how to pronounce the French names, places, references etc.Another reason I gave it up was that while I found it to be a very cleverly written book, to me it was a childish/simplistic storyline.If it had been a smaller book (it's huge), I probably would have persevered."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"They do not write stories like this anymore. It is a complex and long read but worthy of the time. Without any spoilers, after about 150 pages into it, the novel will be hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is an enjoyable story...even if you've seen any of the movies based on this book, you should still take the time to read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This classic was interesting, but it had so many characters, some with multiple names, and subplots that it was a hard to keep straight at times.

I will probably read it again."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And the dictionary on the Kindle was a godsend for all the archaic or foreign terms used in the book. It would have been nice to have a description of the various characters, without giving away the secrets of those with another identity. Sometimes I had to go back to verify who a character was. But other than that, it was a great story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Once the history of all characters were read, it was a book hard to put down. E v everyone is important in this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I love this book!I was inspired to re-read it after spending a month in Corsica, where, on a clear day, you can see the island of Monte Cristo from the east coast beaches. When setting eyes on the outline of this large rock, it's not hard to imagine something mysterious associated with it. In fact, these days, you can take a boat near the island to fish, but if you get too close, military boats come along to shoo you off.I won't provide a summary here - the Book Description on the product page does that quite well enough. What I will say is, as a story, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" has everything - everything! Deception! Intrigue! Romance! Ambition! Honor and vengeance, redemption and forgiveness. More than one character sinks to the depths of utter despair. All that's missing is a bit of swashbuckling, which might have appeared, except that the story took a different turn...Towards the beginning, it would probably help to know just a little about French politics around the time of Napolean. You can get by on context, though I did find myself reading up on some Wikipedia entries.As the story progresses, it does get a bit soap opera-y, as all the characters eventually come together, and everyone happens to know everyone else. But, all the connections do make for a great story, so I'm not complaining. If this is your first time reading the book, it might help to write down the characters in order to keep track of them.Some people might call this book a tome, but don't let that discourage you! It's just more of the story to enjoy. I usually only have enough time to read a few pages a day, and it honestly made me happy just to have this book to look forward to, for whenever I might find a spare five minutes to indulge myself."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This enormous book took quite a while to read, but I was certainly happy because I could not put it down. I felt that no part of it dragged along and felt insignificant compared to the genius of the author.The only problem I had was that the Kindle version says the book is about 600 pages, which was certainly not nearly correct. Maybe they will fix in an update."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"No words of mine can properly express the immense poetry and wisdom of this saga. It fully captures all of the human condition and experience but in a way that is gentle and respectable. If only more of today's art would take a similar approach, humankind would benefit and be better for its' influence. Need to read something that can excite you in thought and feel deeply for the characters? This is a must. Truly timeless written art."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Very good quality, very good book.

It pretty much has everything - wit, wisdom, an interesting plot and a bit of History. It didn't get a five star rating because it seemed like it was a different author with a totally different style in the middle section and picked up back again at the last part.I understand this is a good translation of the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"As people have always said, life is not fair. It's up to people to have the courage to give everyone, including the former fiancee what they have comming to them.

They can stand the test of time from 10 years to 100 years beyond, due to their meaningful story lines which everyone can both relate to and have different interpretations of. The Count of Monte Cristo has all these characteristic of a classic story. It is a story of revenge, love, hatred and the second chances in life one may be lucky enough to receive. Even though this story is almost 200 years old it still appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.Edmond Dantes is wrongly accused and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. After spending 14 years in a horrendous prison he miraculously escapes and uses his new fortune given to him by a prison mate to live out his new life of enormous wealth and his quest for revenge. This seeking of revenge captured me along the ride with Edmond Dates' use of wit and internal hatred towards others to seek revenge on those who destroyed his life. It came to my discovery through the Count of Monte Cristo's experiences and actions that people back in 1800's were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, manipulative and vengeful as people can be today in modern times.Alexandre Dumas builds a captivating and rich plot throughout his story which makes the reader wonder what will happen next and what the consequences may be. The theme of love, hatred, happiness, vengeance and forgiveness is something everyone can relate to since they are feelings we have all felt. My negative critique for this book is the fact that it was a struggle to keep all the 40+ characters in order. The French names I am not familiar with as an English speaker, were confusing at times.I found this book intriguing because this story portrays the evil nature of the human spirit while at the same time teaching a lesson in the possibility of Karma and how eventually people will end up paying for their wrongdoings. It was at times a struggle to get through, but I was glad I did."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"except for the Bible, this is the best.It is the full and undiluted version from the first english translation.read it, learn it,live it.j"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a classic for a reason. The story is easy to relate to. Love, betrayal, revenge, and a fanciful use of unlimited wealth. This is quite a monumental read for any bookworm. I have not read many \\"classics\\" but monte cristo was one I have wanted to read for quite some time. I'm glad I did. It took a while to finish because of its length and language, but it was well worth it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is now added to my top five favorite books of all time. This is simply a great book! In my humblest of opinions this is what literature should be. The story touches the themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. But the story doesn't become excessively self righteous, because the whole time your evaluating what you would do if you were the protagonist. This is what great literature can do; make you consider your morals and ethics, so the story is much larger than just a tale. This book is long so be prepared. At times characters would be reintroduced and it would take some time before I could completely pull my remembrance of them together (such are the challenges of long books). It was funny the whole time reading this book I pictured Robert DeNiro as the Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It is wonderfull even though i'm just nine i'm 49 chapters out 71 through it and i have 23 chapters left it is a triumph for Alexander Dumas has captured the life of people in france at the time of Nepoleon Barnepart&eacute;.He has given all his characters from the seafearing Edmond Dant&eacute;s to M. De Villefort."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this book about 20 years ago and it left a big impression on me. Edmund Dantes, framed for a crime he didn't commit goes to an island prison to rot. There he meets an elderly man who quickly becomes his teacher. The man seems to know everything and his lessons transform Dantes into a sophisticated and wiley-intelligent individual.The two plan Dantes escape (I don't want to give away how but it has to do with the old man's death) and when Dantes, ultimately does escape he reinvents himself as a mysterious Count and starts taking revenge on those who framed him.This book made me appreciate the value of learning and how you can make yourself a better person, no matter your station in life, if you take advantage of books and other sources of information available."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Mote Cristo is a really exciting and fabulous story; I really enjoyed the book while reading it. The main character Edmond Dantes is about 21 years old, and for him, life is just full of success. He is a successful merchant and is about to be promoted to captain of a ship. At the same time, he is also about to marry a beautiful young girl whom he has loved for a very long time. But amidst all of these happy things, misfortune strikes, and Edomnd Dantes finds himself to be a prisoner in the Chateau D'If for life. He is a prisoner because he is betrayed by his so-called \\"friends\\" and rumored to be a servant of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, something miraculously happens, so read it to find out.Although this novel is usually thought of as a story of revenge, it has an even deeper meaning than that. This story not only warns people who betray others, but it also promotes love, friendship, and most of all hope. When the Count of Monte Cristo comes back and seeks revenge, he also meets some friends on the way that move his heart. Some of his friends become poor and have a sad life because of his imprisonment long ago, but they still hope that he will return and they wait for him day by day. The count rewards them in a secret way, and shows how important it is to have hope in one's life even when there looks like no hope. So when you read this book, keep in mind that there is more to it than just vengeance.This book is very pleasant and I finished it in a couple of sittings. It will definitely put you on the edge of your chair and you will hardly be able to put the book down. This book is for all kinds of people, but it is especially for people that think life is hopeless, because as this book will point out, nothing in life is ever hopeless."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am reviewing the Pocket Books Enriched Classics version of the novel The Count of Monte Cristo. At about chapter 30, I was hooked on the story and reading reviews and doing research on it. At that point I discovered the Pocket Books version is an ABRIDGED version with about 70 chapters. The real version has around 117 chapters. This frustrated me immensely because nowhere on the Pocket Books version does it say it is abridged. That is my biggest complaint.I then found a complete version of the book and read it. If I was going to read the book, I wanted to read the whole thing. However, if you want a more tightly written book, I guess I could recommend the abridged version. It won't take near as long to read and will probably tell the same story. Just a quick comment about the 2002 movie starring Jim Cavizel and Guy Pierce. The 1st half of the move covers Dantes' imprisonment and escape, while in the book, it is maybe 25% of the story. While the movie is good, it in no way does justice to Dantes' life as the Count of Monte Cristo. I don't see how it would be possible to make a movie that follows the book closely, the book is just too long.Dantes is madly in love with Mercedes. On the eve of their wedding, Dantes is betrayed by 3 supposed friends. Dantes spends 14 years in prison and there he meets a priest he teaches him many things an tells him where to find a massive treasure. Dantes escapes, finds the treasure and sets out to get revenge on those who betrayed him. The revenge plots are long, detailed and sometimes farfetched. It seems Dantes can do anything he wants and is always able to buy what he needs or be in the right place at the right time. Still it is fun to get to know the characters and to see how Dantes exquisitely exacts his revenge. Many characters view suicide as a honorable way to deal with grief, which is ridiculous today but was accepted back then. In spite of leaving out 1/3rd of the novel, the pocket books version does include an large reference section that includes plot summary, character lists and other commentaries.If only Alexander Dumas were alive today. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing novel with an intricate plot, numerous characters and plenty of twists and turns. Unfortunately, it is written the style of the times, and is as not as exciting as it could have been. The dialogue all has a poetic feel to it. I wish this story could be told by an author today. This book oozes sexuality (affairs, lusts, lesbians) just beneath the surface. There is so much sexual tension that could be exploited without crossing the line to obscene. Also, so much of the behavior of the characters is wrapped up in French social customs that are hard to understand at first but the reader will quickly pick up on them.I recommend this book to anyone interested in books of this era or of a good adventure. Just decide if you want the abridged version or full version before you buy this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a story that must be read to be truly appreciated.Set at a time of political turmoil in France, with Napoleon in exile,Edmond Dantes is an ambitious young sailor with prospects, and a beautiful fiance, Mercedes. Three people conspire against him to ruin his life, one wants his girl, another his position. He is banished to the notorious Chateau d'If, and is believed by his friends to be dead.In prison he meets the Abbe Faria, who becomes his teacher, and together they plan to escape. Edmond escapes with a treasure map 14 years later, claims the fortune, and becomes the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, bent on getting revenge against those who wronged him. With his new found fortune he effortlessly penetrates the highest levels of society, and unrecognisable to his enemies, he now befriends them.The revenge comes slow and sweet, as he plots the downfall of his enemies. He is ruthless, deliberate and unrelenting, and appears to know everyones dark secrets, although we don't always know how he knows.There are many sub characters and subplots that are not in the movie versions of the story. There are some genuinely good characters whose path to love is blocked, and he is in the background pulling the strings to work the situation for those he loves. He is also pulling the strings on those he is out to get.He refers to himself as providence, as he takes the archetype role of flawed hero avenger, and wreaks his awful vengeance. He mysteriously appears everywhere, and knows everything, and uses it. He is karma incarnate.The society and manners of the time are brilliantly evoked by the beautiful writing of Alexandre Dumas. As the words leap from the page into your imagination, you see the characters, you hear their words, and feel their emotions.Most of all, you feel for Edmond Dantes. Will revenge bring him some measure of satisfaction, and make him happy? Or, will he be forever unable to forgive, and be happy. In some respects his life is our life, as you hope for some measureof transformation in his experience that you can apply to your own.Will he reunite with his beautiful fiance, now married to one of his enemies? Can he get revenge, and be forgiven by her?This is a story to be savored. So, go for the unabridged version.If you have seen the original movie with Robert Donat, and the more recent one with Jim Caviezel, who subsequently went on to play the contrasting role of Jesus Christ, I love both of the movie versions.There is way more in the book than can be conveyed in a two hour movie, and so the story is condensed and some of the characters altered to make the story more movie friendly. So, if you are like me, and enjoyed the movie, you will love the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"First off let me say that I love The Count of Monte Cristo. It is a great and exciting story that will leave you reeling.However the Signet Abridged version is not a great clipping of the long saga. For the most part the book seems to flow well enough with only a few potholes. The story of his neighbor who let his father starve is completely dropped without it ever being resolved. However the largest problem I have with this version is at the loss of one of the books most important points. This version shows how Edmond Dantes/Count of Monte Cristo takes out two of his three enemies and leaves them in ruin but completely ignores how he finishes off with his final enemy (As you can tell I am not trying to give away too much of the plot). This leaves his final actions to seem confusing.Please please read The Count of Monte Cristo, but I recommend getting yourself an unabridged version. But if you simply do not have the time then do not try this version as the cuts are so deep that it leaves the plot to bleed to death."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I often enjoy reading a book, and then checking out the movie. Almost always I enjoy the book more, although it is fun to see the movie version after reading the book. I don't think it would really even be possible for a two hour movie to do Dumas' classic justice (although the movie is enjoyable). This book is very entertaining, involves an intricate plot with many intertwined characters, and elements of suspense that could not be understood in a movie. It also covers a 24 year time span. The story is of Edmund Dantes, who after being promoted to captain of his ship, is brutally betrayed by those he trusts. On the day before his mairrage to his beautiful fiance, Mercedes, he is arrested for treason and taken to a prison on an island off the coast. He holds the image of his fiance in his mind, but unknown to him, she assumes he is dead and marries his friend who betrayed him. He is in prison for years, but life becomes barely tolerable after a tunnel is dug from a priest's cell to his. They are able to meet daily, and the priest is able to teach Dantes science, language, and even defense. Through his torturous incarceration, Dantes vows revenge on those who betrayed him. The two plot an escape through a tunnel, and the story continues to tell Dantes' life after prison.This is an excellent book and certainly a classic that most people, even younger readers, will enjoy. I plan on reading it again in a couple of years, and just may read it again after that. It is that good!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the only Unabridged edition of The Count of Monte Cristo I have been able to find for Kindle. It looks like a public domain copy that has been adapted, but it is formatted well. It doesn't say who the translator is. It has the whole 117 chapters. It is worth the 99 cents, if you want the unabridged version. I think if you read the abridged you are missing out on some great parts of a great story. I gave this 4 stars because it looks like the public domain and has no extas that a lot of the big publishers have, but still, a great buy and a great version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I got this download from Audible.com and it is brilliantly read by James Lee. I was completely captivated and transported to the world of Edmond Dantes and early 19th century France. I did consult spark notes every 5 or 10 chapters, because when listening to a book of this magnitude where aristocrats are changing their names (and sometimes needing aliases) and getting titles, it could be easy to get lost and hard to keep track of who is who. But I never felt lost or dragged down by this story that must be the blueprint for every romantic, adventure or character study novel that came afterwards. The novel is rich with sumptuous prose and unforgettable characters and is on par with other masterpieces like Lord of the Rings. It has everything and feels surprisingly contemporary. The language is not stilted at all and I found it to be extremely witty at some points. With Monte Cristo the first superhero is created by Dumas as he seems (to characters in the book) to posses superhuman strength, wealth beyond imagination and can always see 10 moves ahead in this very intriguing game of revenge chess he is playing with the people who falsely imprisoned him. John Lee is an amazing reader, so if audible books is your thing, go for it. I was never bored and was sad when it all, finally ended. It could have even been longer for me. I can't imagine being satisfied with an abridgment of this novel...it is too rich, and why let someone edit it for you when you can have the whole, glorious tale. And if you prefer print books, then I really don't see how you could go wrong. The Count of Monte Cristo is a hell of a good ride and deserves every single recommendation it gets. This is one of those once-in-a-decade books that deserves a whole constellation of stars instead of just five."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"You are not getting the full story with this edition and I am afraid you miss a bunch if you try the fast food variety of this book. While you will get the basics of the story, you miss too much background for it to be believable. The abridged version takes you from a dirty convict one day to a suave and loaded Count the next without showing you the transformation. The story is too good to skip 800 pages!Anyway...This is a really cool story! Not many of us know what it is like to be extremely wealthy and all powerful, but this book shows us this. After poor fisherman Edmond is thrown in prison for nothing, his fortune turns around and he escapes to the world again (after a decade and a half!) and finds trillions upon trillions (?) of dollars in jewels in gold that a fellow prisoner had discovered a map to. He spends alot of money over the next decade setting up the ultimate vengeance on those responsible for his earlier arrest. VERY ENTERTAINING THROUGHOUT!!! You will get an early view of not only early 19th century Paris but also a beautiful panoramic from life along the Mediteranean to the Catacombs of Rome. A truly sweeping narration!5 stars for the story!3 stars for this edition!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Often when I read, I have the television on (but muted). Imagine my surprise when I saw a trailer for the new film Count of Monte Christo while I was actually reading the novel. I suspect that the film will in no way measure up to this monument of world literature. This book is phenomenal. It is truly a magisterial work of the ages. The copy I read was the Penguin unabridged version, which clocks in at 1,078 pages in very dense font. I've never read the abridged version, but I imagine that cutting even a small bit of Dumas' work does it a great injustice. Read the unabridged version. It takes longer but always pays off. In fact, always read the full version of any piece of literature. Why cut corners?On the surface, the book seems to be a simple tale of revenge. Edmond Dantes, a young sailor with a bright future, has his life turned upside down when three men get him arrested on a false charge. Dantes ends up in prison for 14 years, where he meets a man who tells him of a hidden treasure. When Dantes escapes, he finds the treasure and emerges as \\"Le Comte de Monte Christo\\" and wreaks havoc on his enemies. Simple, right? There is so much more here than simple revenge. Dumas uses his sprawling epic to cast aspersions on the French aristocracy, as well as examining the relationship of God and man. Is man right to seek earthly revenge? Is it acceptable for man to assume the role that has been eternally given to God? It's all here in eloquent prose. Dumas also weaves into his work the European fascination of the time with anything Oriental, as some of the characters and events have a distinctive Turkish and Balkan character. As stated above, this book is brilliant. Dumas has an exceptional eye for character, and he loads this book with plenty of interesting people. The scheming businessman Danglars, the crown prosecutor M. de Villefort, the Greek slave Haydee, and Albert Morcerf are all characters you will meet during your journey through this book. My favorite character was Monsieur Noirtier, Villefort's father. What a tough old bird! Noirtier often saves the day.I was almost done with the book when I realized that I was reading a soap opera. All of the elements are there. It's the high level of melodrama that is most apparent. Eyes are constantly cast upwards towards heaven, chests are clutched in agony or joy, and sighs and blanching occur frequently. I felt sorry for the chairs and other furniture in this book. People are constantly collapsing into them over some agony or other emotional breakdown. Despite these constant emotional outbreaks, the book is still great. The book closes with the typical happy ending (even a ride off into the sunset occurs).This book is a classic and you'll quickly see why within a few pages. I would sure like to read other Dumas classics, although I can't imagine when I'll find the time. His musketeer stories apparently encompass some 3000 pages in its entirety. Start with this gem and it will suffice. Robin Buss is to be credited with his translation. Devoting the time to translating this huge book certainly is a labor of love. Five stars just aren't enough!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In the same spirit of challenge that led me to read Pride and Prejudice and A Tale of Two Cities (and find that they have become irreplaceable parts of my bookshelf) and that will lead me to read others like Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, and The Three Musketeers, I have now officially read The Count of Monte Cristo, and I can say that it was the easiest and most thrilling of all the classics I have yet read.Oh, sure, A Tale of Two Cities was tearjerking and triumphantly sad, and Pride and Prejudice just made you want to squeal in happiness, but The Count of Monte Cristo makes you think, makes you tear up (not out of sadness, at the wonder of the dialogue and the love you have for the characters -- and this is a translation!) makes you wonder, and finally, makes you go to this page to write a glowing 5-star review for one of the greatest books ever written in any language.If you're not fluent in French you'll do fine with this book, though without a basic knowledge of just a few words you might have a little trouble with it, and without having heard of some of the places or having been to France, you might not know exactly what the Champs-Elysees or Chateau d'If is. It doesn't matter. Those aren't the focal points of the book. The story is Edmond Dantes, happy and fortunate young sailor, about to become captain of his own ship, marry his beloved Mercedes, and live happily ever after. Then success is snatched from his hand and he is unjustly thrown into the monstrous prison of Chateau d'If, where he spends fourteen years vowing to avenge himself.He gets out eventually, in one of the most dazzling and vivid scenes ever written, and makes his fortune finding buried treasure on the tiny island of Monte Cristo. Henceforth he is known as the Count of Monte Cristo: Enigmatic, a little surreal, and ready to exact perfect reward for those who did him well -- and perfect justice for those who did him evil.But there are complications that even the mighty count couldn't have foreseen: the son of his ex-fiancee and his bitter enemy befriends him, the son of his dead benefactor is in love with the daughter of the man who sentenced him to life in prison to protect his career, and the question comes up: When is revenge right, how far do you go, and do humans even have the right?It's a fantastic story, a memorable and fast-paced story, and, unlike a few books I could mention, truly deserves its label of classic. For those who like action: This book has prison, escape, treasure, poison, love, cruelty, redemption, revenge, forgiveness, ambiguity, sadness, triumph, and hope. Don't be daunted by the page count. It's a true work of art.Has anyone got a copy of the Three Musketeers?Rating: Masterpiece"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Our Christian book club read this book from the \\"classics\\" genre.

It formed the core of two of his earlier novels, but nowhere else did he devote to it so much study and development as he did in his mid-19th Century gothic romance, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" Readers who choose abridged versions of this unsurpassed tale of vengeance short-change themselves, because it's only in the many sub-plots, the painstakingly depicted details of French elite society of France's Second Republic, and the subtle twists and interweaving of the activities of the novel's many characters that we truly come to appreciate this masterpiece in its in-depth exploration of what constitutes revenge in all its hideous terror and in all its glorious satisfaction.Edmund Dant&egrave;s suffers at the hands of brutal enemies, spends 14 years in one of the most awful prisons human perversity could devise, and through a series of suspense-filled circumstances gains his freedom - and a fortune - before spending an additional 10 years meticulously planning his revenge. He leaves nothing to chance. He watches. He waits. He is infinitely patient, and patience when wielded by skillful hands can be a weapon sharper than a sword. Edmund Dant&egrave;s, through years of training and practice, becomes dispassionate, cold, supremely calculating, supremely confident and capable - and implacable. The Count of Monte Cristo is born, and slowly, inexorably, he brings down retribution on those who betrayed him or forgot him rotting in prison. Even his former fianc&eacute;e, the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s (who certainly is no Homeric Penelope), does not escape unscathed.And in the end, for revenge to be complete, it must be cathartic. Dumas, after much carnage and financial destruction, leaves us with a few green shoots of love rising from the ashes, closing his magnificent saga with the line, \\". . . all human wisdom [is] contained in these two words - \`wait' and \`hope.'''"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my favorite novel. Extremely interesting, complex, detailed, contains so much history (along with historical fiction), this book is great (was that a sentence?).This is the unabridged version, which i recommend. Reading the abridged would be like watching a thirty minute version of Shaw shank. It is just so much more detailed and complex. I took me about a week to read, with most of my time doing just that. The second time i read it, it took much longer.Watching the movie first does not ruin this book at all as they are very different.General plot and style for those who don't know:This novel defines the expression 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. Its tells a story of an innocent and optimistic young man beset by misfortune, who then vows to exact a long and meticulous scheme of revenge. Because of the books great lengths, many other characters are examined as deeply as shorter books examine their protagonist. Obviously the book is very detailed with interesting insight into the time period it was written in and about.Truly an epic book like no other, I strongly recommend it.

When I first looked at the book I thought over 1200 pages it has to be long and drawn out. But, I was wrong about drawn out. I found the book interesting all the way through. This is one of those story where once you finish it you want to start it over again.I had a couple of problem through out the book. One problem was that the book assumes that the reader is familiar with French culture in the 1800s. The book would slightly mention some current event like the Hundred Days of Napoleon and assume that the reader know about it. Also, the book would use French words for some items or events and assume that the reader knew that they were without explaining them. This was explainable because it was written in the 1800s in French for French readers who lived in the 1800s. It was hard to keep all the characters and their relationships with each other straight. It really became a large problem half way through the book when they introduced 8 new characters all at once. I would suggest writing down the main characters and their relationships with one another when you find out about them. Another problem was that the book would refer to a person with two different names."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have read this book in my childhood and got it for my son for Christmas.

When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"We only recently found out that all our copies of The Count of Monte Cristo were abridged.

You will be amoung \\"bandits\\" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"How does one review a classic? Especially one so noteworthy as to have demanded the creation of 11 or more film variations, numerous adaptations, and even television series? I long avoided reading this novel due mainly to it's daunting size, and the fear that it's translation would cause the reader more work than I was willing to put into it. However my burning desire to know the true tale of Edmond Dantes overruled my hesitation.The story, for those of you who are unfamiliar, follows Edmond Dantes in his wrongful imprisonment at the hands of his friends, his 14 years in the Chateau D'If, his escape and rebirth as a self proclaimed hand of vengeance against those who had wronged him. If you have only seen the movies, the book, particularly the ending, is far different than what Hollywood has created. There are no dramatic duels, no massive swordfights with brigands, and not everyone who we believe should, lives happily ever after. This is instead a slow but genius work of Dantes methodically stripping away all that his enemies held dear to them, at whatever cost. None die by his hand, but are rather destroyed by his influence, and their own evil choices come back to haunt them.The story itself is genius, interesting and very fun. The writing, particularly the translation that I read, is an often difficult and sometimes tedious work that one may need a notebook to keep straight. The cast of characters is very large and they are often referred to by different names, making it a bit more difficult to keep track of who is who without some sort of note taking. I was not smart enough to take notes, and thus had to spend quite a bit of time searching my brain to make sure I was thinking of the correct person as I read, particularly with some of the more minor story lines and the characters that weaved in and out of the story with multiple chapters between their appearances. Also, this book will probably be disappointing to those who are interested in the action that the movies provided. The Count of Monte Cristo, does not come in with guns blazing, but rather plays a very well thought out and disturbing game of mental chess against his opponents. As readers we hope for their downfall, but also wonder how far the Count will go... his years of imprisonment have left him hardened and disturbingly without remorse at the use of innocents to gain his vengeance. As he plays his pieces we wonder just who will be sacrificed, and who will have the chance to live happily ever after in this dark world of Dumas.Readers of more modern novels may have trouble with this book because of the sheer volume of concurrent story lines, all of which are necessary for understanding the strings being pulled by the Count. But to remember the tale of the lovers, the orphan, the bandit, the banker, the ship builder, the assassin, the count, the princess, the steward, the military man, the lawyer, the cheating husband and wife, the lost love, the musician, the buried baby, the dying father, the paralyzed grandfather, the murderess, the thief, the countess, the emperor and all of their relations, can be quite a daunting task for any reader. Still each of these stories could be a book of their own, keeping the reader quite entertained, but Dumas has managed to weave them all together into one, brilliant and shining tale... if you can keep them straight through the end.What surprised me most was the ending of this story. It was not what I wanted, or hoped for. True I loved Haidee, and wanted nothing but her happiness... but many seemed to be left in suffering that did not deserve the fate that they were bound to. I will not elaborate for fear of spoiling the ending... but this does not end on a Hollywood, \\"they all ride off into the sunset\\" ending. Perhaps the meaning of the story is not all about revenge, but rather what damage the hunt for vengeance can bring to not just those who have wronged you, but to all those that surround you. The downfall of selfishness; be it falsely imprisoning someone to gain what you may, to the selfishness of vengeance... there is so much meaning in this book, I can see why it is so often \\"required reading.\\" Though I highly recommend this book, I would advise you attempt to read it with others either in a class or a reading group so that you can discuss all of the rich meaning behind Dumas's words."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Having never read The Count of Monte Cristo and only faintly recalling a movie of some years ago, I was prepared for a swashbuckling epic of swordplay and derring-do. My expectations were entirely inadequate. The Count of Monte Cristo is rather a tale of revenge through the artifice of intrigue and cold calculation. Dumas creates a broken man, betrayed by a trio of duplicitous schemers, and devotes the bulk of the book to the complex machinations employed in retaliation.The phrase \\"intricately detailed\\" does not begin to describe the plots and sub-plots which carry this classic forward. Like all novels of its period, the author relies on what the modern-day reader would consider implausible convenience. This doesn't detract from its worth. To create such a tightly-laced weave, some liberties must be granted. The reader gladly forgives Messr. Dumas.On par with The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, and the works of James Fenimore Cooper, The Count of Monte Cristo is wonderfully thick and magisterially constructed. Set primarily among the preening social elite of post-Napoleanic Paris, yet ranging from Rome to Normandy, it is a 5-star reading experience."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I bought this book for one of my children for a summer reading project.

It's about a twenty-year old man named Edmond Dantes, whose early fame (as a young, newly assigned ship captain) is short lived. Jealous of his success, a few bad men take actions that, on his wedding day, lead to his arrest and long imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. After leaving the prison, he again gains fame, as well as fortune, learns all that he can about the men whose actions led to his demise, uses the information to concoct acts of revenge, ingratiates himself with the bad guys and their family members, and strikes. Although I'm not a fan of spending the time required to read really long books, in this case, I'm glad I did. An amazingly easy read, The Count of Monte Cristo has a complicated, well-thought out plot (though that involving V near the end is hokey and the ultimate fate of H troublesome) and great characters. Plus, it's always nice to see the good guys gain and the bad guys get their due.

English teachers are an odd lot as a whole, and I guess they're the ones who more or less determine what is considered classic. Some are clear choices, however, and to me \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" falls into that category.To begin with it is immensely readable, a point of necessity often overlooked on modern lists. It is a page-turner of the highest order, with romance and intrigue, suspense and drama, and as complicated a morality play of revenge and justice as one could desire. And the reader isn't harmed by a decent dose of French history in the process. There was an old movie version, with Tony Curtis of all people as the Count, that was amazingly true to such a long and complicated story. The more recent movie was forgettable, and if you don't recall it don't feel bad.Back to the story. It is well worth the reading, or re-reading, and personally I enjoyed it far more even than the Three Musketeers. It starts a little slowly, but if you stay with it through the point of Dante's (the Count) imprisonment, you'll be rewarded with a story you can't put down."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Wow, where to start on this? If you haven't seen the movie starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce yet, I suggest watching it before reading the book. The movie was a great movie also, but completely butchers the book, so to enjoy both, watch the movie first. My fiance bought this book for me, when I told her it was my favorite movie and I would like to read the book. When I first recieved it, I was intimidated. 1243 pages of pure classic literature! I was afraid that since it was a classic novel, it would confuse me greatly with the writing style, but Robin Buss (the translator) did a spectacular job of making it easy to understand. Also in the back of the book, he has included notes of certain words and phrases that are used to help clarify even more. The book is quite enjoyable to read, and I find myself laying in bed until one in the morning reading it. I have to force myself to put it down so I can sleep. Basically, a well written, very gripping book that I recommend to anyone. This is not my normal style of reading, but I have enjoyed it greatly. Again, watch the movie first so you can get the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Please note that the product details dont mention it but this is an ABRIDGED edition and as such, leaves exactly those details out that make the book a classic.

These parks seek to give their visitors the greatest thrills possible on these rides without actually endangering the riders and thrill seekers flock to these parks by the thousands in order to take what they hope will be the ride of their lives. My advice is to skip the long trips and even longer lines and take a ride with Alexander Dumas and Edmond Dantes. No technology known to man can match the excitement and adventure you will thus find.Make no mistake; this will be a long and sometimes bumpy ride. Dumas occasionally will drop his reader into a chapter that seems to have no relevance to any of the chapters before it. After a while though, it will all become crystal clear as this master storyteller weaves his magic. There will be twists and turns that the reader will not be able to foresee and in the end you will marvel at the scope of the story and the extent of both the vengeance and kindness of the story's hero.As with many great works of literature, there have been many film adaptations of this book. Some were of course better than others were but none of these films come close to doing this book justice. If you have watched any or all of these films, be prepared to find that the book will often only resemble the films in that the characters have the same names. At least the characters that make it into the films will have the same names but many of the characters in the book never make it into the films. This book is simply too rich and too deep to be captured on film. To really experience Dumas' work you simply must read the book.This is a story of love lost, of deception, jealousy and murder. Within this book the reader will find villains so vile that they seem almost inhuman but when their downfall comes it is so terrible that one almost feels for these wretched creatures. All through the book the reader sees the story building to a climax, but it builds slowly. So slowly in fact that the reader will be almost on the edge of his or her seat as they wait for the inevitable falling of the ax. When the final act does finally come, the reader will know the characters so well that they will almost be able to feel their agony. On the other hand, the reader will also see that the Count's victims would not have become victims but for their own greed and pride. The traps laid by the Count simply would not have worked had not his victims been ruled by same vices that led them to wrong Dantes in the first place. As with all great works of fiction, the moral lessons are there, but buried under the surface so that they don't interfere with a great story.This is indeed a great story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Updated to 5-star: Originally I gave this a low rating because it was incorrectly marked as the Unabridged version.

The setting (Napoleonic France) is an abstraction to most of us today. And at 1000+ pages, this is the antithesis of what the Sesame Street generation is used to.But pick it up and you soon discover that people back then were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, and vengeful as they are today. In other words, the book is captivating.This is a fantastic story in both the full and abridged versions. It is a study in what it means to have character: Dumas explores both the corrosive impact of petty and unethical indiscretions, as well as the awesome power born from personal responsibility. He keeps the protagonist human by tempering that power with a insatiable taste for revenge. As a reader, your heart breaks as you stand, helpless, while human weakness--greed, fear--bring ruin on a truly good soul. You find yourself oddly conflicted as that soul survives, strengthens, and flourishes while pursuing the dark goal of revenge... your desire to enjoy the journey is never without a nagging feeling that the evil that was done to the protagonist has left its mark...I cannot recommend this book highly enough... if I had a sixth star to give one book and one book only, this would be the one."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was the first book I have read by Alexandre Dumas, and I have to say I loved it. The size is rather intimidating, but it is completely worth it. Despite the large size, I decided to read it, and I could not put it down. You know, I had those late nights where you just stay up and read for hours.The story begins with Edmond Dantes arriving home off his ship to marry his beloved Mercedes. The novel dives right into action with a plot made up by his \\"friends\\" to ruin him for some gain of their own. Edmond is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist involved in a scheme to overthrow the King and gets arrested right during his betrothal feast, and is thrown into prison. Right when he begins to give up hope, he befriends a very intelligent, old Abbe, who helps Edmond escape. The novel continues many years later with Edmond, or rather, the Count of Monte Cristo, and his brilliant, conniving plot of revenge.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a tale of adventure-yes, it is a tale of love-yes, but what this novel truly is, is a tale of revenge. How one's past haunts them because of one's wrongdoings and losses. But also how revenge cannot fix everything. Things in life do not usually work out perfectly, but there is always hope.This is a book full of twists and turns and those \\"Oh! What happens next!? I want to know!\\" moments. I can't wait to read more of Dumas' books. He's a gifted writer- able to write a thrilling plot and portray realistic characters and their true feelings. If you're a sucker for good literature, like myself, this is the book to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"i had a similar experience as previously indicated. in fact i ordered both the unabridged and abridged versions of this product and received the exact same product (despite the fact that the allegedly unabridged version was 2X the cost.) if you'll notice, the picture are confusing and therefore you don't know what you will be receiving. now i am looking elsewhere for an unabridged version as the information on amazon is inconclusive and ultimately unhelpful."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The count of Monte Cristo is actually based on a real life character, The Jesuit General. When you read the book in parallel with the Jesuit order all becomes apparent. The Jesuit General is the guy behind the scenes of the Vatican church."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the kind of book that the author has a wonderful idea, but has the thought spread too thin over the novel to keep the reader's attention. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent writer but seems to accentuate too many subplots that are unimportant. He also focuses on numerous small and confusing characters.The basic plot, is about human nature, particularly revenge of a young man named Edmond Dant&eacute;s. At the age of nineteen, Dant&eacute;s has a series of important events happen to him. He is convicted of being a Bonapartist by two jealous rivals. He is unable to marry the lovely Mercedes and he is no longer capable become captain of the Pharaon, the merchant ship, on which he used to work on as a first mate. He is thrown into the notorious dungeon, Chateau d'if, for fourteen years. He escapes with a large secret: the map to the famed treasure of Spada. Naturally, he'll use it for his revenge. As they say, the rich can do anything.The book has so many intricate subplots and minor characters that the real plot seems to be lost in a hurricane of court intrigues, treasonous affairs, and numerous social gatherings. There are at least nine chapters concerning meals and balls, ranging from brunches to dinners, suppers to breakfasts, from a mere ball to a summer ball, and everything in-between. If you understand the difference between a baron and a count, then these things would obviously make sense, and may even be interesting to you. If you don't know the difference, prepare to be a little confused.Getting to the action takes a while, but when it comes, Dumas gives you a good read. From being captured by bandits, meeting Dantes's old fianc&eacute; (who is now married to his arch rival and has a child), to getting even with all those evil men who planned his imprisonment. Although, if you're not at the action yet, get ready for a long, not-so interesting read. Dumas, still manages to throw in some unimportant details and small talk in-between the action. You can't just go skipping around the book, because there are too many important details embedded in the small talk. If you don't read every word, I guarantee you'll get lost.This book is jam-packed with murderous action, so if that sounds good to you, you should consider reading this book. If you are looking for a challenge then this is a book for you. We recommend this book to older, more advanced readers."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The unabridged version of this is huge, huge. Like 1200 pages.I actually did read all of it. First time, though, that I would have to count myself sorry that I read the unabridged version of anything.There were exciting elements to the plot, to be sure, but after Dantes makes sure that M. Morrel is taken care of (p. 300 in the Penguin Classics edition: the part where the narrator skips ahead 10 years without telling you), the next 800 pages or so really drag. It's obvious that, at this time, writers were being paid by the word.Could be much stronger as a shorter (er, say, 200 pages) novel."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Very long book and not what I expected.

Not possessing the knowledge that the unabridged novel is over a thousand pages long, I assumed I had the entire book in my collection. Having finally cleared my schedule so that I could fully concentrate on Alexandre Dumas's classic about vengeance gone wild, I was horrified by what I was reading. Halfway into the book I took the trouble to look at the title page, and then the inherent weaknesses of the book were quickly explained; I was reading the Borders Classics Abridged Edition. Suddenly all the plot inconsistencies, timeline malfunctions, gaping holes in the story--along with all the mundane, trite, and nauseating melodramatic dialogue--made perfect sense. The Borders Abridged is awful, and, although I doubt I will ever try to tackle the unabridged edition, in my opinion does Dumas's classic not one iota of justice.I do hope the original tale is not as myopically presented--with each major character engaging in a monotonous pity party--as the abridged edition I suffered through. Protagonist Edmond Dantes comes across as cruel and reprehensible; the characters that conspired to send an innocent man to prison are demonstrably shallow and superficial. Hosts of other characters such as Haydee, Madame Danglars, Madame de Villefort, Debray, ad nauseum, are never fully vetted or explained. The only benefit from enduring this particular abridged edition is my determination, upon the purchase of another classic, to make darned sure I'm buying the unabridged version. Books, especially good books, are meant to be enjoyed as they originally were written--not hacked to nonsensical pieces for the sake of brevity. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO deserves better.--D.

I thought too much time was spent describing certain people/situations. I felt some chapters where new characters were introduced did not hold my attention enough to keep me wanting to know more. It felt like a roller coaster ride. One minute I was riding high and excited about a particular scene and then the next I was falling asleep. I do plan on trying again, however and hope that I can get past this to finish the book.

I had to push through it. The count seemed so cold in the book that I did not invest much emotion into him, he lost Edmond in his personality until the very end. Although the plots for revenge were far better in the book I can actually say that I liked the movie better. First time for everything. The two were completely different.

The book begins that our character is betrayed by his best friend and is sent to prison.

Recommended to me by my mom and as a choice for my World History class, I at first considered it to be overwhelming and incredibly long when I first picked it up. After getting into it, I couldn't put it down. The book, which is about a young man who is betrayed by the people who he considered his friends, is filled with love, revenge, murder and suspense. Yet it is full of European history and facts about the Napoleonic Era, which starts the book off. Alexandre Dumas' style of writing is extraordinary and even though it has a lot of detail, it makes you feel like you are a part of the book as you are reading it. He is constantly adding more and more conflicts through out the book and keeping you entertained. Just as you think everything is not coming together, he ties everything perfectly at the end. I definitely recommended this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was a great book. I first read it in the eighth grade and thought it was pretty good...

I just want to recommend that you buy an unabridged version... sit back... and read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"For Edmond Dantes, these words kept him alive in the nearly 2 decades of imprisonment at the Chateau D'If. Unjustly placed there upon return to the port of Marseilles; made scapegoat for a Bonapartist action which he had no involvement with, Dantes is torn from his life as sailor, fiance, and son, and tossed into the darkness of solitary confinement, left to rot; untried, unexplained, and forgotten.Many years later, hope comes in the form of an ailing prisoner trying to tunnel his way out. He confides his greatest secret, the hiding place of an immense fortune, to Dantes before he dies. Seeing this as his only chance at freedom, Dantes assumes the place of the corpse, is removed from the prison for 'burial', and escapes.Thus begins his revenge. After collecting the very real wealth in the cavern on Monte Cristo, he assumes the title of Count, and exacts his vengeance on those who stole his life.The Count; benefactor, patron, and friend of the elite, insinuates himself into the lives of those who deprived him of all he loved, and authors their downfalls. All the while rewarding the good and just, he prepares punishment for those who are deserving.The book is entertaining from start to finish and was well worth the read. The Count's revenge is deserved, and well doled out, as he allows all to destroy themselves with their wrongdoing, simply supplying them the means. The ending is not so grand scale as to be Hollywood-esque in scope, but satisfying nonetheless. Dantes realizes that in following his path of revenge he has simply placed himself in another 'prison,' that of hatred, and he tempers his actions with deeds of generosity and gratitude, perhaps as a measure of atonement. But no matter what ills befall those who betrayed him, you constantly root for Dantes to emerge triumphant.The more classic literature I read, such as Count of Monte Cristo, the easier it is to see why good literature survives the test of time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this book several years before the movie came out but before I go to my review, i suggest you see the movie as well as read the book. The movie is nothing like the book but it keeps the same basic storyline and point. I'm talking about the new movie on it. I believe there are several.anyway, I love to listen to music but I also love to read. I have loved reading since I can remember and in all that time I have NEVER read a book as good as this one. This is the all time best book ever written.Most books written a long time ago, are slow placed and full of hard to read words but not this book. This book is written pretty modern despite it's time period. It was ahead of it's time, believe me. This book has action and romance and blends it in with a super awesome storyline like no other book ever. The characters are memorable and the bad guys are really bad. It's full of deception and betrayel and, above all else, REVENGE. Revenge seems awful to some but reading this book makes you think about all the good you can do with it.It's a very long book but you never get tired of reading it. It's very fast pace and once you start it you won't be able to put it down!I highly suggest getting this book no matter what kind of novels your into. Music has a greatest masterpiece(Pantera's Far Beyond Driven) and so does reading: The Count of Monte Cristo!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"For those who don't know the plot of this story, it is a story of revenge for injustices. (I'll let you read the dozens of other reviews to get the plot in case you don't know it.) What this book brings to the table is dozens of intricately interwoven subplots that all come together and make for the most satisfying read I've ever had the pleasure to consume. If you're afraid of reading a classic or have been told you HAVE TO READ this book, take heart. You will find this intriguing, provocative and without a doubt the best written book I have ever had the pleasure to read. Dumas is a master of weaving many stories that all come together as a whole. I'm one of those people who believes most things that need to be graded/judged/rated are rarely at the end of the scales (superlative or horrible). This book is an unqualified 5 stars."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my all time favorite book.

People who don't read the unabridged version, translated by Robin Buss, are doing themselves a tremendous injustice. It's true Dumas was paid by the page, but when a story is this jam-packed with detail and intricate sub-plots, who cares?Edmond Dantes is set up by his enemies and wrongfully imprisoned within the walls of the Chateau D'If. While in prison he is told of a lost treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo, which he finds upon his escape many years later. Needless to say, his enemies have forgotten him, but he has not forgotten them.The way he uses his vast wealth to utterly destroy the lives and families of his enemies is simply amazing. For those interested in Paris, the orient, scandals, murder and all-out adventure, it's hard to beat \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\""},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was a teriffic book, and well worth the length. It is about a man who is wrongfully accused of a crime based on forged evidence by his enemies. After spending a long time in prison, he meets a strange old man and discovers who has forged the evidencce against him. The many years in prison have changed him, and made him dedicate himself to revenge, which he completes very satisfyingly."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"More than a story of revenge and personal satisfaction, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is a story of loss and achievement. Young Edmont Dantes, of Marseilles, is a good-natured and competent man, and, being so, many of his acquaintances long to have him out of the way. Four people, for different reasons, throw him, using a series of schemes, in a jail where he will pass the rest of his life. But in the ill-famed Chateau d'If he discovers a secret that leads to an incredible wealth, and he is able to escape and work his life on the sole purpose of destroying his ancient enemies.We must understand that Dumas wrote this masterpiece on the apogee of romantism, and that is what Monte Cristo is: the utmost romantic story. And even if the potencial reader should think that, being written in the past century, it's going to be lots of cliches and known plots, think again. I don't want to spoil anything but to Edmont Dantes his revenge is not like what he thought it was going to be.The book is very long and sometimes even boring, with sub-plots seemingly leading to nowhere, just to be all sewn up in the very end. The best part, however is the inicial (the first 200 pages, more or less), when we see Dantes' life fall apart and he looses everything he cares for. This part is so well and pationately written, allowing similarities with Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;, but wherever Kafka is dark and cold, Dumas is colorful and emotive.Dumas is one of the best nineteenth century writers and has left a vast amount of works. This is, in my opinion, his best and should be read by everybody who is interested in good literature.Grade 8.7/10"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Buss' translation makes The Count of Monte Cristo a beautiful, smooth and understandable read.

This has become one of my favorite books of all time.I will give a warning though to be prepared to spend time thinking as you read, this isn't a book where you can thoughtlessly read.

There were numerous \\"edge of your seat\\" moments for me.The Robin Buss translation is wonderful and very easy to read. However, the only thing I don't like about this is the binding. The cardstock paper for the cover is very stiff and it seems impossible to not permanently bend it out of shape once you open the book. It also seems impossible to not get ugly white cracks down the spine. I'm disappointed that Penguin didn't publish the paperback out of sturdier material like the Modern Library books.Other than that, I think this is one of the greatest novels I've ever read.

The first time I listened to the book I sometimes got confused about who was who.John Lee did an amazing job at naaration. In no way did his reading get in the way of the story.For those that have not read classical literature from this time period you are in for a treat. The dialogue is AMAZING. I am convinced that we have forgotten how to fully use spoken words in our everyday communication. Alexandre Dumas is a master of communication and I found myself thinking that I must remember some phrase or other that he uses.The story is no less captivating. The intricate web of diverging and converging plot lines kept me fully engaged as Dantes fortunes rose, fell, and rose again.For those that have not read The Count of Monte Cristo and are not afraid of a longer book you are in for a treat.

It helps to print out a list of the characters as there are many.Though the term Magic Realism wasn't coined until around 1925, the Count of Monte Cristo easily fits into this genre. Hope, justice, revenge, mercy and forgiveness are themes in this excellent novel.I don't think I can write a meaningful review of a novel this long.

It is a long book - let's admit that right up front. I mean weight-lifting heavy and need a month to leisurely read long. It is totally worth it.Author Dumas starts with a young, thriving protagonist who is a little wide-eyed innocent for my personal taste. Stay with it, things change big time. The count is well drawn and full of cunning, driven by revenge, grounded in a sense of his place in justice and frankly someone I would love to be...well, I would want only the count part of his life. His fate was forged by the worst of betrayals and self-centered ambition of those who could have helped him.I'll never meet a woman named Mercedes without thinking of young Edmund Dante's love.

It is a great way to spend some quality time with a count."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a wonderful book.I second the comments of J. Cooper.As mentioned in Cooper's review, there are two versions, the abridged and the unabridged. I have read both, and I strongly recommend the unabridged. It is long (Dumas was writing a serial for a magazine), but worth it. The time saved in the abridged version is paid for with confusion: People pop up and events happen without explanation. In addition, the secondary characters are fleshed out and made much more interesting/enjoyable in the longer one.The Buss translation is also very nice, particularly in comparison to the old, out-of-copyright, standard version. The notes are good, without being obtrusive, in explaining both current events, e.g., the July Revolution, and current literary allusions.In re-reading the book in this version, what struck me was how religious, in a sense, it is. The characters, and presumably the author, are people who believe in a God who moves in mysterious ways. The book is like a little time machine that takes you back to a way of thinking in mid-19th century France. Although the language is a bit florid (everyone seems to \\"shudder\\"), the book, particularly in this version, is well worth the time.I read the book in the Kindle version, which, given the book's size, is especially convenient.

The story introduces Edmond as an enterprising sailor, a young man full of promise, and one who appears to have everything in control. Edmond is a bit naive, but honor-bound, which ultimately leads to unwarranted hardships, grief, and despair followed by an unquenchable desire for revenge.The story includes numerous references to God and providence where blessings come down on those that do good, and punishments come down on those that do evil. I agree with these Christian concepts, but I was constantly thinking of Romans 12:19-21 where the Bible states we are not to avenge ourselves because \\"Vengeance is mine, I will repay says the Lord\\". Edmond feels it is his God-given duty to avenge himself by punishing those who plotted against him.I felt the story was a bit unrealistic at times in that things outside of Edmond's control usually worked out just as he planned; however, there were a few surprises. I held back giving this story five stars primarily due to its length and complexity. I understand Dumas wrote this in 18 installments and was paid by the word. I thought this caused the story to drag at times and to include some unbelievable schemes.

And so my dad introduced me to this book when I was 13. Alexandre Dumas' epic is a much-treasured book that has sojourned with me over many, many years: I've read all 1200+ pages at least five times (not including the time I mistakenly checked out an abridged version from the library), and own an unabridged copy published in the 1940s. My hardcover copy is in two volumes, heavy and cumbersome to read. Reading it one more time, now on Kindle, has been a delight.This book has it all: love, fear, betrayal, friendship, greed, passion, hatred, remorse, vengeance, death, heartbreak, intrigue, magic, second chances, and includes the drugs and sex as does my hardcover copy. The story of Edmond Dantes' wrongful imprisonment, his suffering, despair, education, ultimate escape from the dungeon of the Chteau d'If, and re-appearance as both the angel of love and mercy, and that of vengeance and death, is the story of humankind in all its permutations. There's no way anyone can read this book and not come face to face with aspects of their own being, for better or worse. I remain in awe of Dumas' imagination and ability to draw you into a world where the full range of human emotion is laid bare and anything, or almost anything, is possible.Those of you who have enjoyed this book might also want to consider The Prince of Foxes and Captain From Castile, both by Samuel Shellabarger, and of course Dumas' The Three Musketeers. I credit Dumas and Shellabarger with helping me break out of the spell that was cast over me by my traditional education and opening my eyes to the truth that things are not the way we're taught they are. Shellabarger in particular helped launch me into a lifetime of inquiry."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I first read this book only because my mother nodded her head when she saw it, and I enjoyed the Three Muskeeters. I started reading it, and I couldn't put i down. You know most classics, the beginning is really a drag, especially for sophmores in high school like me. But unlike other classics I read ( and I did read a lot) the action begins from the beginning. I want to recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book that requires it to be: a classic that is not boring, fit for m\\\\both male and female, mysterious, romantic, and full of vengeance: overall a book that is not boring.

It may take some time to read, and the story may have many characters, but he develops everything so well and brings it all together.Not only is the story itself well developed and fascinating, but Dumas presents many other angles to observe and watch for while reading this book. The entire plot itself is a study of morals, honor, and ontological questions. Throw this in with the elegant setting of post Napoleonic France and you have one fascinating tale that touches on every aspect of the life and times.All of this and more makes this a very rewarding read that everyone should take note of."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Of course, I only found out about this book through recommendation from a friend.

For 14 years he begged, cajolled and finally cursed God for letting him be in such a hellish situation. While in prison, he becomes close to a man of religion who, on his death bed imparts the location of a treasure hoarded centuries before and forgotten. Dantes escapes prison, finds the treasure and after years of refining and hardening himself, returns to Paris as the mysterious and implacable Count of Monte Cristo to exact his vengance upon those that stole his simple fisherman's life from him some 20 yaers before. So the story begins... If you have an ounce of Romanticism in you, it is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Whether you are looking for romance, drama or mystery this book covers so many exciting genres. It is an exciting and easy read - don't let the length hold you back from discovering this wonderful adventure filled with love, deceit, revenge and tragedy.

It has love, joy, despair, fear, deceit, jealousy, and revenge. The characters are wonderfully developed in full detail, and by the end of the novel become intricately interwoven. The story itself is very moving. It is fast paced, with several exciting moments, and varied settings. It is a trajedy, yet only in circumstance. The main character does, in fact, triumph in the end.

The Count of Monte Cristo is far superior. So many people I have met have never even heard of this wonderful book. Why?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you like suspense mixed with delicately crafted details and descriptions, Dumas stands alone in this field, then this is the book for you.

Amazing book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The book arrived crumpled and amazon did everything they could to ensure I was happy. This is the reason it's so easy to choose amazon over everything else."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great story make no doubt about it, but it is slightly sprawling and unfocused, not that i'm suggesting and abrigment, it's just that the book could do with a trim rather a complete gutting. Several of the parts are rather longer than the need be, the Rome section in particular drags tediously (it was originally meant to open the book, it was only after he had scetched out the plot that he decided to tell the story of Edmond Dantes incarceration and break-out instead of us meeting the enigmatic Count in the middle of the Roman Carnival and moving on to Paris shortly there after).As most people know the Count of Monte Cristo is the story of a wrongfully imprisoned man who breaks free, gets a massive fortune and then sets out to revenge himself on the people responsible. What most people don't know is that the prison section serves only as a small part of the story and that it is in the main taken up by the Count's prolonged revenge. What most people also don't know is the bits that are often left out of the movies and the abridgements yet so enliven the tale such as suicide, infanticide, lesbianism, transexualism, murder and drug taking. On the whole then Monte Cristo is a brilliant if flawed tale."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A true classic with good reason.It's a great read. Entertaining throughout. I was so happy that I'd read it and wished I'd done so sooner."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond has everything going for him. He is handsome, young, and popular. He is engaged to the girl of his dreams, and has just been appointed captain of a ship. Life couldn't possibly get any better for Edmond.But every likable and successful young man has enemies. Edmond's conspire to get him arrested as a spy, at a time in France when the political situation was very touchy. On trumped-up charges, he ends up in prison, in confinement alone in the dungeon.For awhile Edmond thinks he will die. He thinks he would like to die, and begins starving himself to death. But then a chance interaction with another prisoner allows Edmond to gain some insight into his situation. Despair gives way to fury, and Edmond decides to get himself out of prison and take revenge on those who did him wrong. Through a fortunate set of circumstances, Edmond begins to put his plan into action.I really liked the plot of this book; I loved the idea of Edmond having the mental strength as well as the financial resources to ruin the lives of those who had him locked away in his youth. I enjoyed watching the worlds of Edmond's enemies crumble.The book was rather simplistic, though, with far too many coincidences that allowed the characters to get what they needed to get, from stumbling into a fortune to being in the right place to eavesdrop on a critical conversation. The author's hand was heavily felt in this story, when things just happened to work out exactly right for the characters."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I was pleased with my purchase it came very quickly and the price was great."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I enjoyed the movie, but the book has so much more story background.

The unabridged version in hardcover is the best way to go. I had a trade paperback version but it fell apart during the second reading.

Now about the book- I love the story, the way it is written and all the intertwined side stories that make the main plot all the more intriguing. I get something more every time I read it. It holds a permanent place on my night stand. You will not be disappointed reading this book.

Now it's on to Madame Bovary!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It's very hard to find an unabridged version of this work and I had to wait a few years until this particular version came out...although even here there is some abridgement to eliminate repetition from the manner the story was originally written. I was very happy when it did. As a commentator notedThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)is the authoritative fully unabridged edition although it's in paperback. It's a classic story of the era - if you've never read this or heard of this story, it's classic.In my mind its very similar to Les Miserables and Great Expectations. There's the hero who gets beaten down, then he rises up, gets helped by a benefactor, and then proceeds to get some revenge: its a dish best served cold :-)This edition is wonderfully bound just like all the Everyman Library Editions. It comes with a dustjacket which is nice and it's a thick book.I highly recommend reading this by a fireplace in winter with some wine and cheese.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"great condition.

Unlike many works of classic literature, this book does not gbet overly wordy. Unfortunately, Dumas does begin to confuse the reader at times. This is due to a high number of characters who are either having affairs, scheming together, etc. From that standpoint, it was at times (short though they may be) like a very complicated soap opra. Fans of Monte Cristo are advised to read Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you have not read this book, I encourage you to stop what you are doing right now and read it. It is simply the greatest book you will ever read. All too often the classics tend to be boring or a little too wordy. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is different. Even though it is over 1400 pages, the story never drags. Alexandre Dumas grabs your attention from the first chapter and never lets go. I read a childrens version when growing up which was my favorite book for years. Recently, I decided to read the unabridged version. Needless to say, I loved it. You will, too. So, do yourself a favor. Buy the unabridged version and just give it a try. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This edition is worthwhile alone for the translator's introduction, highlighting exactly what was missing in earlier editions and how the exclusions/changes grew in each version. His translation of dialogue retains some of the direct simplicity that Dumas' original has (per the experts), but lacks the faux, grande-melodramatic language of the popular editions I read as a child.This is THE classic 19th century saga, incorporating the Gothic and globe-trotting heroes of the tail-end of the 18th C. with contemporary Romantic sensibilities. If you've only seen film/tv versions you'll find some of their swashbuckling elements missing. This is not The 3 Musketeers; instead the search for a moral core to their choices is in all the characters. With a supporting cast of characters as rich as Dickens at his most memorable (Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist) the Count himself (and Sinbad the Sailor, and Edmund Dantes) still remains a complex archetype. I urge you to read this translation, whether you've visited the story before or not. Put it on your list with Big Reads to Savor (right next toWar and Peace)."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If I could, I'd give it 6 stars rather than merely 5. Alexandre Dumas' writing style is what we lack today. He could not have told the story any better, and no writer will ever surpass his brilliance. If you think you've found your favorite novel and still have not stumbled upon this one, then you don't know what you're missing. In all honesty, this is what literature is all about. And if you don't care to read long novels, then buy the abridged one. This is absolutely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which deseaves to be a best seller even today.

When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of the book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate. I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If I could give more than five stars to 'the Count of Monte Cristo' I certainly would. Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness. The story's protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he lingers for years. During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune. Dantes uses this fortune to set a plan into action. For years he has dreamed of revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it. More riviting than the web of intrigue Dantes spins to fulfill his scheme is the deeper quest for self-redemption that unknowingly haunts him. Retribution and revenge, though important plot points, take a backseat to Dumas' opptimism in this stirring tale. Magnificent!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read The Three Musketeers and loved it, so I decided to read another book by Dumas. This one was even better and easier read.

I do think, though, that the end could have been better...I didn't think I would like a revenge book, but there is so much more to this one. I highly recommend it for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is a great book. The way the plot is structured, the way Edmond Dantes slowly takes his revenge, to make it all the more painful on his enemies.The setup is ingenious--Dantes is in the best situation he could possibly be in. He is getting married, and is going to become the captain of the Pharaon, a ship that he is first mate on...and then, out of the blue, some police come in, and he is put away in the Chateau d' If, an island prison, to die.Dumas is a master of conveying emotion. At some parts of the book, one is forced to be depressed, and share the melancholy with the characters in the book. The arrow of anger that Dantes must feel toward his enemies is shot from the pages and into one's heart. And the happiness when Dantes is going to be married and at other joyous occations is almost an aroma in the air, rising from the pages of the book.Unfortunately, this book does, like every book ever written, has some aspects to be criticized. First and foremost, the length: 1074 pages is quite a bit for the average reader! Even the abridged version is 500-something pages. And there are also French sayings, anecdotes, and words that you must look at the footnotes to understand. Of course, in the abridged edition, it doesn't even have footnotes. But overall, this book is an enjoyable book, and unlike some other books written by amateurs, this book makes you think about the very nature of mankind."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Worth all the 1,000 over pages.

It is a book packed with themes such as betrayal, imprisonment, revenge, romance, history, drama, mercy, and ultimately forgiveness. It is a novel about a man named Edmond Dantes who has a good life up until people he thought were his friends betray him and end up taking away everything he holds dear to him: His wife to be (Mercedes) is stripped from him on his arrest for false conviction for being an agent of Napolean, this causing his father to die of grief and hunger. With the help of Abbe Faria, a former prisoner, teaches Dantes the ways of the world. He escapes one faithful night from the prison known as the Chateau D'If, finds the island of Monte Cristo with the treasure Faria spoke of and tracks down and punishes those who have wronged him under the avenging angel persona: \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". After reading the full Unabridged novel I could see why people loved the book so much for it's rich detail and lush writing in politics and French history to undertone the great revenge of Edmond Dantes. The way in which Dantes carries out his vengeance is cold and swift; whatever they did to make him suffer he launches twice back at them. Dantes also finds romance from the girl Haydee who is the long lost princess of the Pacha Ali Tebelen of whom he rescued from a sultan after her parents' deaths. It was nice to see the count get a beautiful girl and find happiness again for the very reason his Mercedes was stolen from him by his enemy, Fernand Mondego. I don't want to ruin it for you so just go and read the darn book. If you are interested in reading the unabridged version (Which I recommend you do and not some stupid abridged edition) get the Modern Library hardcover like I did. It is a 1,462 page book and the longest novel I've ever read in my life, but it moves along at a fast, steady pace. Thats all I can say is if Alexandre Dumas was able to construct this huge genius book with great characters and a great plot all back in 1844, he must certainly have been ahead of his time along with his book. A beautiful piece of literary art and probably the only classic I've been able to read all the way through.

I wonder how the abridged version might have read? I guess I didn't feel rewarded for reading 1500 pages where the abridged versions are less than half the length.Anyhow, I found the plot a bit too convenient. Everything from the treasure to the intricate tangled web of the people involved in the central plot.In the first part of the book, I felt the emotion of Dantes. But towards the middle of the book, I became completely disconnected. It all came down to character development, but I lost my emotional connection to Dantes.The book is a marvelous read to discover the upper-class world of France in the 1800s.

It is an extraordinary account of a man's life which is full of intrigue and deception. With the great fortune of attaining a promotion as the new captain of the Pharaon and the hand of his beautiful fianc&eacute; who will soon stand at the altar with him, Edmond Dant&egrave;s could not have been a happier man. Yet, behind his back and in the shadows jealous eyes watch him and plot his downfall. On the night of his much awaited betrothal feast, Edmond is arrested and accused of being an aid to Bonaparte. Not long after an interrogation, he is condemned to life in prison at the Chteau d'lf. Unfortunate souls sent here are never heard or seen again. Death is the only way out of this dark place. Many of Edmond's precious years are spent alone, forgotten, and in despair and wretchedness. When all seems lost, he has an unusual encounter with another prisoner, Abb&eacute; Faria. A strong friendship forms as they plan their elaborate and final escape. But only days before their escape, Abb&eacute; Faria falls ill and cannot make the journey. On his deathbed, Abb&eacute; Faria gives his beloved friend the whereabouts of a forgotten treasure. With the life of his friend fading, he must make the most important choice of his life. Spurred by the hope restored to him by his friend and by the vengeance that has grown and festered in his heart throughout the long years spent behind bars, Edmond attempts his final escape. Whether it be death or great riches that lie outside his four prison walls, he is determined to play his part as the avenging angel. Those who have ruined his life will pay, and those who were undeserving of their fate will be avenged. He will have what is rightfully his, what he deserves...or...so he plans.This is one of Dumas's greatest novels. It will draw the reader into its story within the first few pages. It is a book that is hard to put down or walk away from. If you enjoy tales full of unexpected twists and turns, you will love this one. Yet, as a warning, it is a book that you cannot just breeze through. It takes your full attention to catch all the details. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time. So, if this is you, just sit back and prepare yourself for the ride of your life."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just finished this book this morning, and, as any good book should, it moved me to tears (and not for the first time). Of course, this made me look a little strange when I showed up at work.When taking on a book of this size that is this good (and therein lies the catch), it becomes a part of your life. Some of the characters will remind you of people you know and bring them more to life, but already Dumas' characters are so lifelike and incredibly, amazingly real, and that with each chapter you have spent that much more time with them, learning something new about them (up to the very last chapter!), the story literally becomes a memory that you will be fond of looking back on.It is interesting to note that this translation is from an anonymous person. I had several issues with the translation unfortunately. I feel it was completed by at least two people, and I believe one can tell (in the first half of the book) because the chapters are clumped together in specific styles. It probably won't affect many readers, but I noticed it and thought I should point it out. This edition, unfortunately, has typos! Beware, that though they are sparse, they are blatant. This saddens me when I see a beautiful edition slighted by the hands of lazy-eyed editors. (I expect no less for modern authors!)I have waited years to read this. I would have loved to have read this when I was younger, but a lot of it would have gone in one eye, out the other (so to speak).Enjoy, and let the story take you away from this life for awhile."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; Alexandre Dumas weaves a tale of love, revenge, intrigue and adventure to make one of the greatest novels ever written.This story follows Edmond Dantes as he becomes the captain of the Pharaon and is going to marry the beautiful Mercedes. During his betrothal feast for his wedding, Dantes is arrested because he is thought to have been a follower of Napoloen. When Dantes think he is going to get put off the hook, he is sent to the Chateau d'If where he spends over a decade of his life in prison. When he meets Abbe Faria at the prison, his life is changed. He gets out and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. And this is only the beginning!&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is one of the greatest books ever written.

This is over 1400 pages! I'll never get around to reading it!\\" Although an avid reader already, I was not prepared for this amazing work of art. My friend and I read it over the summer, and we both say it is the singular greatest book we have ever read! We agree that Alexandre Dumas must have been a genius to be able to think of such an intricate, fascinating plot. The characters are believable, moving me to tears at times and laughter at others. I recommended this book to all my friends and family, and to all people who love reading a good story as much as I do."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have read 6 different translations of this book starting with a children's version when I was 6. I know, that doesn't count. But the 5 other ones were full versions. I know that such a thick book can be intimidating but it is worth while. Each turn of the page feels like unwrapping a new gift. By the time you get to the end you will miss it and wish that it was even longer. This is the best translation that I have read thus far. This book is for anyone that likes to treasure their time with their books and is not for impatient people who just want to know the plot."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a great book full of betrayal and deceit. It may be long but it's definitely worth reading.Edmond Dantes was a sailor from Marseilles, poised to be married to Mercedes, a beautifl village girl. However, enemies of Dantes plan his arrest on the day that is planned for his wedding and he is condemnned to imprisonment on a desolate island in the dreaded Chateau D'If. Here, he meets the priest Faria who helps plan Dantes' escape and tells him of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond escapes the prison and goes to retreive the treasure and changes his identity. Now he is called the Count of Monte Cristo. He goes back to the mainland to retreive his love and seek revenge on his betrayers.I used a copy by signet classics, the editing was terrible and I found at least five typos; it was kind of distracting. I do highly recommend reading the book though!!!(only get a different version)"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Enough good things can't be said of this book. It is rightly considered Dumas' masterpiece. The story in a sentence is how a man named Dantes is falsely accused and imprisoned thanks to the machinations of his treacherous enemies, escapes jail, comes across a fortune and spends many a year spinning a sweet, sweet revenge on all.Of course the brilliance of the novel can't be described. It truly is great in its descriptions of the machinations and the motivations of the characters, as well as its insight into the human condition, second to few. Just because a book was published serially as popular fiction doesn't make it less worthwhile than the most pompous novel. The book explores the moral justification of Dantes in his revenge.This is a work where the hundreds of details come together (nothing being told for no reason) to pack a powerful punch. As such, no abridged version will ever do. It's long but it's a good read and worthwhile. A must."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is about a nineteen year old sailor named Edmond Dant&egrave;s, ion the post Napoleon era. Edmond is engaged to a beautiful Catalan woman and, after his captain died, became the captain of the Pharaon. His life seems to be very good and blessed, however, while his captain was sick, he stopped, under orders, on the Isle of Elba where he encountered Napoleon and received a letter from him. Once Edmond is found with the letter, he is imprisoned in the Chteau d'If, an island prison.I found this book to be very interesting and filled with excitement. It shows how a man, through faith in God, can prosper. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, conspiracies, and classic books. This book has been around for a long time and is still flourishing."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I originally read this book for school but it turned out that I really enjoyed the book. This book allows you to take a look into the life of royalty and of peasants during the early eighteen hundreds. The action in this book took a while to start but when the action started it kept up throughout the novel. I saw the movie before I saw the book so I thought that the book would be the same as the movie. The book in fact is very different than the movie. There is fighting in the movie and the details of the story are different. This story filled with deception, but you know whom to trust. But Edmond does not seem to realize whom to trust. Edmond does horrible things to the people whom he has revenge for. Edmond only does this however to get back what he has lost and he still helps people along the way. Edmond plans out this revenge that he destroys the people he is out to get. He makes them into laughing stokes."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is THE book to read. No other book that I have ever read comes close to the excitement, passion and feeling that this book portrays. As I read it, I could feel the emotions Dantes felt... Dumas does a wonderful job of grabbing the reader and pulling him/her into the story, so that it is no longer just a story... but rather, it becomes reality."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I'm sure everyone is familiar with what the book is about so I won't tell you any of that. This book is a great read. Yes, it is 1000+ pages but it's difficult to put down and easy to get through. The Count of Monte Cristo is an interesting and mysterious character. Although the reader can easily see that Monte Cristo is Edmond Dantes, the author does not state this until near the end of the book, and even then continues to refer to him as Monte Cristo, as though Edmond is no more. This adds greatly to Monte Cristo's appeal, although you come to miss the sailor from Marseille when learning more about the bitter, vengeful count.I have to say, I wished the author would go deeper into Monte Cristo's mind, and show us his thoughts and actions when he was alone, rather than follow wherever there is action or dialogue. Although by no means am I critisizing, I couldn't possibly, being an amateur reader in the classics.I found that the beginning, during his imprisonment, and the end, as the story comes to a close, are the best and most moving parts of the book. It gets a little disturbing near the middle, with the executions and bandit stories and all! The moments when you see some of Edmond in the character of Monte Cristo are a delight. The story stirs your moral ideas, and you ask yourself as the story progresses whether the Count goes too far in seeking revenge. Other characters are equally interesting, such as Villefort, Maximilien, Danglars, Mercedes, The Viscount Albert and even Abbe Faria, who is a bit like the Bishop in Les Miserables. Don't hesitate to read the book because of its size, the pages fly by! And it's mostly action and dialogue anyway. I haven't seen any of the movie versions, but as is often the case, I'm sure they lack a lot of what the book can offer. Same goes for abridgements. So don't waste anymore time, read this book!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The real thing is about twice as long. I'd prefer that merchants and publishers would plainly label the abridged versions. As for the content, Dumas's &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is central to the development of modern western literature, a precursor to Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and a grand yarn in the league of Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Your grandparents read this story. Your grandchildren will read this story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Unfortunately, the only copy of The Count of Monte Cristo I could find was the unabridged version in my school library. At the time I was glad I was reading the short version, 1,500 pages seemed a little too overwhelming at the time. But after reading the short version, I found myself wanting more. I could tell when they cut stuff out and it drove me crazy, I kept wondering what I was missing.I found myself wanting to read this book in the first place because I saw the commercials for the movie on t.v. (Which I know I'm not going to watch because they changed everything.) My mom told me it was a really good book so I checked it out. It took me a little bit to read because of school and chores. But once I picked it up I read 20 or 30 pages at a time. Sometimes more. Alexandre Dumas is a genius. His writing style is so unique. He draws a beautiful picture inside the readers head. All the characters in this book were multidimensional. I'm not used to seeing characters like that.At the beginning of the book Edmond Dantes was leading a happy, perfect life. He was engaged to the woman he loved, Mercedes. He was going to become a captain. And he had wonderful friends. But before he knows it his wonderful life becomes nothing but misery and pain. Two of his so-called friends, blackmails him and he's thrown into a dank prison for being a Bonapartist. Over the long harsh years ahead of him he plots his revenge on the people who sent him there. . .I'd love to tell you more, but there aren't enough words in the world to describe the impact this story had on me. I'll just give you a quick overview: This story is mostly about a man who gets revenge on those who made his happy life miserable. He slowly ruins their lives and they don't even realize it's him. No one recognizes him, except Mercedes, but she doesn't let him know for a long time. She becomes a very weak woman, who lives only for her son. But she still loves Edmond and I believe in some ways he still loves her. But he's a completely different person, then. He knows their time has passed.This book is very well written and has all the elements of a good story. Romance, adventure, revenge, mystery...And anything else you can think of. I'm going to have a hard time reading a book after this one. Other books will pale in comparison, I'm sure. Someday, I'll read the abridged version, but not today. . . Maybe when I'm older and have enough patience and time to read the whole thing. This story will stay with me forever, even if I never read it again."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I learned French for this book. Simply, I wanted to read such a remarkable piece in its original version. This being done, I can assure you of two things when picking up Buss' translation. First, you are guranteed of a precisely accurate and tremendous translation. Secondly, you will be smitten with Dumas' work. Period."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Buss' translation is brilliant - spares no blushes. The \\"adult themes\\" are complete and unbowdlerized. This is not a children's book.[...] sells the audio book which is the Lorenzo Carcaterra translation, read by John Lee. It is some 48 hours long, unabridged. While listening to the sample, I followed the same passage in the Buss translation. The difference is staggering. Buss' translation is not only more readable, but would make a far more listenable audiobook. This translation should also be made available for the Kindle. I'd buy it a second time if it were in that format. The paperback (1070+ pages)is heavy and hard for me to hold up, and the font is too small for these old eyes. Nevertheless, it is an outstanding translation of a wonderful story. If you read any other, you will have been cheated.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Wow. What an amazing book. The plot was so well laid and a joy to uncover. I am truly glad that I took the time to read the unabridged version, which is quite daunting, but worth the length.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"As human beings, we, for the most part believe in justice. When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of the thickest books I've ever read, and it was worth every page. Don't be daunted by the size, the complete, unabridged Count of Monte Cristo is not just one of the best adventure stories ever written, but one of the best stories period. The simplicity of the story conceals everything the story has to say about life; the expectations, disappointments, despairs, hatreds, loves, joys and bittersweetness that everyone experiences. This book is timeless and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is far and away the best book I have ever read, and considering I read about a book a week, that is definitely saying something.I'm not going to give you another review of the storyline because there are probably a hundred others on here already so to do it again would seem quite pointless. What I want is to give people a couple of reasons why this book is so great. One of them is that the book is so well balanced and what I call an \\"everything book\\" because it has a great balance of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. There is really no one category you could put this book under which I think makes it even better.The other thing that makes this book so great (along with the great storyline) is the writing style of Dumas. First of all, he is never overly descriptive which is something that a lot of authors tend to do. He uses just the right amount of description on the scene and then lets the characters take over from there. Also, he has this wonderful way of always making the reader want to continue on to the next chapter. You just can't put the book down! Everything just seems to flow in such an effortless manner. Many nights I was up at two in the morning because I just couldn't put the book down.Do yourself a favor and read this book (unabridged penguin classics version, of course) and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Wow. I am so glad to have bought this book. I cannot put it down! At first I must admit I was intimidated by its size as well as the period it was written. I find that many period books are really dense and difficult reads. Not this one at all!!! Easy to read and such a gripping tale! It draws you in and you do not want to put it down. I am so glad that I am reading the unabridged version because I cannot imagine it any other way. I am also so happy that it is so long because I do not want the story to end!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a literary masterpiece. It has everything one could want in a book and more: adventure, fighting, planning, tales of riches, tales of suffering, tales of ultimate betrayal and revenge, and even a little love.This book may be long, but every single page is worth your time. It is written so perfectly and the story put together with such great design...an epic tale perfect for any reader."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I had never read Monte Cristo before and was at first reluctant to invest the time needed for this modern, unabridged version. I'm glad I did though, because it was a great story that moved along quickly in spite of its length. The freshly translated language helps, and because it's unabridged, it's satisfying to know that you're getting the full text that Dumas intended."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a phrase that most people are familiar with; the broad outlines of his story have become a part of everyone's general understanding via cultural osmosis: Edmond Dantes, wrongly imprisoned by the contrivance of four men, escapes jail after decades, and, armed with essentially limitless money, plots his revenge. With this in mind, those revisiting the original novel have a general idea of what happens with the principal characters. While it would perhaps be optimal to begin reading with no preconceptions, the novel does not suffer for knowing the general outline. In particular, adaptations always end up significantly cutting the original story, which clocks in at nearly 1300 pages in this edition; so there are plenty of story points normally omitted for the reader to discover.An English professor once related that in the Renaissance genre of revenge tragedy, there were only a few that really examined the toll taken on the revenger (Kyd's \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\" and Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" being the notable ones), while most simply offered a black-and-white story of wronged men slaying the demons who haunt them. Alexander Dumas' story, which has become perhaps the archtypal revenge novel, also falls into the more complex category. It is perhaps telling that while the novel follows Edmond Dantes' perspective from the beginning to the point where he escapes from prison and finds the treasure that will finance his scheme, as soon as Dantes becomes The Count of Monte Cristo the perspective largely shifts to other characters; Dantes, a young and happy man, becomes something different and less human; the Count is almost automaton-like in his calculations and actions, though, as the story wears on, pricked by resurgent emotions. It is the conflict between his assumed roll as the wrath of God and his mere humanity that serves as the major conflict in the novel's climax.Dumas offers a panoply of other characters, generally well-drawn, and absurdly interconnected in the best traditions of the Victorian novel; particularly notable is the oblique sketch of a lesbian couple who ride off into the sunset, a risky inclusion for the time period (and generally sanitized from most versions of the story).This is by no means a quick read, but it is very much recommended for fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This Penguin Classics version of what is in my opinion is the best book of all time.The translator even includes a chapter where Edmond returns to the Chateau de If to get a sign from God that what he was doing was just.Please if you have never read this book, buy this particular translation and, do not get the abridged. Why cheat yourself?This is such a wonderful story of love, and revenge."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Perhaps the only work in popularity to rival Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers is The Count of Monte Cristo. As with many of Dumas' works, the story has huge cast of characters and several underlying plot lines dealing with political upheaval and scandals in France during that era. I found that the The Man in the Iron Mask had so many side political story lines that it made the novel confusing and hard to follow. And then I got bored. However, The Count, has just the right amount and ties together very well at the end, which does not subscribe to the generic formulaic predictable plot. In fact, I would deem it the ultimate revenge story.There have been 11 films and 4 television series that have attempted to tell the tale of the wronged Edmund Dantes and his search for his fiance Mercedes and his pursuit of the man that wronged him. The most recent film was in 2002 starring Jim Caviezel and while casted well, paled in comparison to the novel in many ways and the liberal creative license taken with the story almost offending. The latter half of the film no longer resembled the masterpiece of the novel. Yes, most films pale to their written counterparts, but this one in particular deserved a Golden Razzie.The novel has a huge story to go with the cast of characters, but is pretty basic in that a man is wrongly accused and seeks to right the wrongs, along the way, losing those that he cared about, mounting his need for revenge even further. Edmund calculates and plans out the most exquisite plans and is not completely heartless or merciless. In fact, his compassion and loyalty are overriding themes throughout the novel. I guess you could say the richness of the Monte Cristo sandwich rivals that of it's namesake!The Count of Monte Cristo is not a novel to be missed.And if you really need the short version, The Simpsons did a 10min summary in the episode \\"Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times.\\""},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am so pleased to see that the Count of Monte Cristo has moved up to about 2880 in Amazon's rating out of over 6 million books. It was about 280,000 3 years ago when I checked. Imagine, a book over 150 years old has again, like it did when he was alive, captured the world. Penguin was perspicacious in providing the first complete English translation of this inspirational classic written around 1840! I have read it 3 times and never tire of it.It is difficult to add anything of value to the fantastic comments already made on the site, as the book has over 5 out of 5 stars and I agree with every one of the reviewers. I am thrilled that this generation is reading the author that I personally consider the best author that ever lived. It goes to show that true art is immortal. One member of royalty, on their deathbed in the 1800s, said they read Dumas because he gave life in his works. I agree.The book, as well as his over 1000 works, is riveting, enthralling and full of plot twists and great characters.Alexandre Dumas was the ultimate wordsmith and studied, and studied, on his own, to master his craft, never getting his dues until recently, by the French government. They dug him up from his hometown of Villers Cotterets, France, and moved his body to the Pantheon, finally calling him a national treasure. I read his biography and he wanted to be buried in Villers Cotterets. The move was disheartening in that the town lost revenue from tourists. Also, you can find pictures of the Chateau he built on the web. The man's personal life is as fascinating as this book, but beware, there are many lies circulating about his father, a brigadier general in Napoleon's army, being born out of wedlock, as well as Dumas himself. Neither is true, according to his 5 volume autobiography.Current reviewers also love to emphasize the illegitimacy of his son, an author in his own right, named Alexandre Dumas, fils (Jr.), the father being pere. No child is illegitimate and the two were close. People were admitedly jealous of Dumas then and, in my opinion, today. The writing academy only recently admitted him and that was a goal he held when he was alive. Great men, superior men, as Dumas points out in his narrative about some of his characters, including Dantes, are generally hated. Dumas was one of those hated men.If you loved this book, I'd suggest going to cadytech and checking out his other works. In the Count of Monte Cristo, Dumas's ability to capture the emotional spectrum of the human heart, to portray a wide array of human interactions, his mastery of dialog, demonstration of the conflicts of man versus man and man versus himself, his ability to paint descriptive pictures and completely draw readers into well defined and thought out plots, his expertise in interjecting philosophical truisms as food for thought, to make you feel the experiences of the protagonist and construct a perfect story of revenge, indeed one of the best ever stories of revenge, in my opinion, all make this my favorite book of all time.Dumas loved Shakespeare and many other authors and if you are as interested in the life of this fascinating man, as I am, please don't forget to go to cadytech. It is maintained by one of the most prominent translators of Dumas's works from french. Also, for another good read by this author, check out the complete 3 musketeers musketeers series, comprised of 5 books: The 3 Musketeers, 20 Years After, 10 Years Later, The Count de Bragelonne, and finally The Man in the Iron Mask. Dumas actually wrote 1 book but it was later divided into the 5 mentioned above. I could go on and on but will stop now."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book was amazing. I first learned of the story watching the tv show \\"wishbone\\" as a child. Which opened my eyes to this great story teller Dumas. I am also ashamed to admit that I saw the movie before reading the book. =( If its not too late to warn you, dont watch the friggin movies! Does not do the book any justice whatsoever. They throw in a bunch of hollywood BS. sword fights are thrown out like candy to a bunch of school kids. And no matter how good the movie is, your cramming in 2 weeks worth of literature into a 2 hour clip. The penguin copy is the best Ive seen. The intro is very informative and the notes in the back are helpful. Dumas made tears swell up in my eyes 3 times.

In it Edmond is accused of being a Bonaparist and had to go to jail for fourteen years until he ecscapes and bec omes wealthy. He then set out for revenge. I like this book because it is very exciting and has lots of details that a lot of other authors would have kept out. I also like it because it is told in lots of points of view.

Even though the book is over 500 pages, he couldn't put the book down, nor could we."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Apart from 'The Three Musketeers', this is probably Alexandre Dumas' most famous work and one of the greatest novels in Western literature: a novel every literate and educated person should read at least once in their lives.In this story, Edmond Dantes is an innocent man who was caught in the intrigues of Napoleon's escape from Elba and his 100 days of power until Waterloo. A sailor entrusted with a sealed letter of highest importance by his dying captain, Dantes delivers it into the hands of the evil prosecutor Villefort who, for reasons unkown to him, immediately sends him without trial or appeal to spend the rest of his days at the Chateau D'Iffe: a dark and isolated island prison presumed to be inescapable. With the help of Abbot Faria, a dying prisoner who knows the secret of a great hidden treasure on the small islet of Monte Cristo, Dantes escapes and prepares to unleash his revenge on those who did him wrong. For years he spends his time meticulously preparing his vengeful scheme against the treacherous friends and characters who left him to rot in prison for years and years. He refines his arts of disguise, alchemy, and manipulation to content himself with the ruin of his enemies.Unlike the adventure themes in his works such as 'The Three Musketeers', this story is a deep character study on being the victim of utmost injustice and how cruel revenge is sweet after all: how a wronged man is entitled to become the agent of divine retribution when God and mortal laws have abandoned his cause. The various themes, complex plot, profound character development, and rich prose makes this long work undoubtedly one of the greatest works of literature ever written: Dumas was without question a literary genius.This is a great story for people of all ages and should not be ignored by anyone who has a profound love of literature. I think this is Dumas greatest work far surpassing 'Queen Margo' 'The Three Musketeers' or 'The Corsican Brothers.'"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most thrilling tales of betrayal, adventure and revenge that I have ever read.

I've read other translations, abridgements and the full version of the novel, but this is my favorite. When I get to teach the story, this is the version I choose. It has the main plot elements and major characters, but leaves out much of the cluttering, distracting detail."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A brilliant piece of literature, a real tribute to French literature, Alexandre Dumas is a genius with all the subplots and major plots that he intertwines which makes this a superb novel. I found myself guessing about what was going to happen next but each time I tried to guess, I was wrong. I loved the character development. There were so many characters in this novel and each character brought new attributes to &quot;the table&quot; which made the book even more interesting. Also I loved the plot development. There were so many subplots that all ended up tying into the main plot which made the book that much more interesting. Starting out as an honest sailor in Marseilles, he is framed for being a Bonapartist, and is sentenced to life in jail... With little hope for escape he is left to die in his cell, but when he meets Abbe Faria his luck just starts to turn around... With this in mind I would definitely encourage others to read this book!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexandre Dumas truly surpassed himself with the publication of The Count of Monte Cristo. The gripping beginning is full of mistrust and betrayal, as the main character Edmond Dates, is imprisoned as a result of his supposed friends. The story covers the turbulent years of his imprisonment, starting with depression and thoughts of suicide, followed by years of being educated and developed. After his phenomenal escape from prison, Dantes sets out on a journey to seek fortune and revenge himself. Years of tragic, surprising, and dynamic events follow, in which Dantes is exposed to old \\"friends\\" and even an ex-lover. The plot thickens as infidelity, bankruptcy, danger, and astonishment are incorporated into the scheme. The story ends the way it begins, full of love, and adoration.The Count of Monte Cristo is beautifully written, and truly a story that intrigues you the moment you pick it up. Its fast-paced plot line is full of revenge, love, and lying. The length, although extensive, is irrelevant, because the story that the many pages tells is revolutionary, and truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"You see all these reviews on this site of highschool kids says 'SOO BOORING' but these are obviously immature lazy students, who cant appreciate a great book. Im a freshman in highschool and this book was great! I didn't read it for school, i did on my own accord and loved it. Don't bother with the movie, it left so much out, and it isnt a quarter as good."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Not a bad translation, but AVOID AT ALL COSTSThis is an abridged version, and as such a waste and a slap in the face to the author's original vision.I'm doubly upset because I didnt notice this was abridged till I already bought it, and was already 200 pages into it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Occasionally departs from believability, but overall, an engaging, adventure packed story of a man (Edmond Dantes), his unjust imprisonment, and spectacular revenge."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is amazing. Dumas's style has been criticised for its luxuriousness, but it has the great virtue that it always has the vision of something half-comprehensible behind the humdrum life. Some of his sentances are crafted with such mastery of language it is almost inconcievable. The beauty of this book is that, though we understand Edmonde Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo is eternally a mystery. With every other character we get incites into thier mind, thier reactions, passions etc. For the Count, we get only the perceptions of others and thus never know the main character of one of the greatest books of all time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I love this book! It's a great story about love, lust, money, and revenge. The first few chapters are a little dry, but after the main character is falsely accused of treason the pace picks up remarkably so stick it out. The plot keeps unfolding and there are a lot of little twists and hints. The ending might or might not surprise you, but suffice it to say Dumas is the one author that doesn't cop out and put everything in a neat little package tied up with a red bow. This ending is real. And if you haven't seen the movie yet, READ THE BOOK FIRST because you'll enjoy it more if you do."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"this book is awesome. Its a little complicated because of all of the characters and the past crimes they have commited but in the end the characters all tie together in weird twists of fate. You'll enjoy every one. The book is so different from the movie. Way better!! It goes into more detail and depth."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A simple sailor, Edmond Dantes, becomes ship captain and wins the heart of one of Marseille's most beautiful women, eliciting jealousy amongst a shipmate (Danglars) and a friend (Fernand), who then use a loose connection between Dantes and the Bonapartists to have him arrested. After escaping, he transforms into the Count of Monte Cristo (with the help of an uncovered treasure), and infiltrates Parisian high society with the intention of ruining the men who unjustly imprisoned him fourteen years prior.An interesting story with a lot of drama, but the Count is a bit larger than life, richer than the wealthiest man in Paris, extravagant, and omnipresent in a really annoying way. Rather than retaining the modesty of the Marseille sailor he used to be, he turns into this perfect, almost deity figure who can do no wrong, cures the sick, solves everyone's problems,walks on water, etc...There are alot of detailed discussion about money in the novel, perhaps a sign of the times and the birth of capitalism. Money and politics are the tools used by the Count to get revenge.This novel is definitely better than the movie that came out last year (distorted Hollywood [junk]) but it was not as amazing as I'd expected. By the way, I read the full, unabridged edition, but this was the only edition I could write a review for."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",D,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const q=d(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-d81f85ab"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/41.md","filePath":"guide/41.md"}'),j={name:"guide/41.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
