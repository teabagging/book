I have not yet downloaded the Kindle edition but it would clearly be more convenient to carry around than the paperback. The book itself has a much more tightly focused story than The Lord of the Rings. (This makes me worry about the decision of the film-makers to turn it into a series of three feature films. There was easily enough material in The Lord of the Rings to support that treatment but I can't see how it will work for The Hobbit.)

They don't make 'em like this these days. Pages have absolutely massive margins which is so nice to look at.

Everything in here that seems cliche is because other people took it from Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is hard to get past how clumsy the writing can be, and how simple the plot is -- a challenge appears and is solved in a few pages, usually by luck. Fans of R.A. Salvatore or Terry Brooks or any more modern fantasy writer will probably be disappointed. There is action, but it is scant. Where this book really shines is in the description of an amazingly fleshed out world. And while the plot is simple and straightforward, it is certainly extensive. It is easy to see how Peter Jackson decided to turn it into three movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Beginning of one of the most clssic trilogy's ever written. Great story line.

I was disappointed that the story did not go more in depth regarding the elves, Beorn, and the lake people.

And, in an unnoticed corner of the world there lived a race of hobbits: a small people with furry feet, and too much common sense to go on adventures. But, when a particularly stable hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is visited by the great wizard Gandalf, he soon finds himself in the middle of an adventure with 13 dwarves, facing ogres and orcs and all sorts of dangers. Is the adventuring life too much for one small hobbit in the great big world? Read this book and find out!OK, everybody knows the story of the Hobbit, right? Well, if you haven't read this book recently, then it's time to reread it! My children are now old enough, and every night I am reading a little more to them from the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. They love this tale, and reading it again is a great treat for me!

I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book had the same avuncular, almost childish, style I remembered, the depth of story and myth telling was there in spades and I could see why it was such a mine of a story for the film maker. The Hobbit should never be read as a predecessor to The Lord of the Rings, but it remains an ancillary story which is fun, and tempts the reader to explore the whole Tolkeinverse."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'll not rate the book content, because everyone knows that it's amazing, but I'll rate the edition, which is simply deluxe.

He uses just enough variation in his reading to identify characters without over-emoting and the singing was really well done. We listened to this the weekend before The Hobbit movie came out and the movie seems like a Silly Putty version of the novel with very small scenes stretched to ridiculous proportions. I prefer this original. Definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently read \\"The Hobbit\\" for only the second time in my life, and I have to argue with the people who say this is a children's book. I disagree wholeheartedly. Although there are elements of children's fantasy tales in the text, the themes and actions of \\"The Hobbit\\" are much more oriented to adults.I won't waste time rehashing plot points with this iconic text; instead I will focus on some features that stuck out to me.First off, if one is familiar with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I think their reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" will yield some interesting insights and they will catch some details that people not familiar with LOTR would miss. One can read, and greatly enjoy, \\"The Hobbit\\" as a standalone text, but I think it is much better when considered within the framework of LOTR.Another observation that surprised me was just how unlikeable the dwarves are in this book. Tolkien frequently mentions in his other works that dwarves are foolish and selfish, and usually only do good works when prompted by circumstance, but on this reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" they greatly annoyed me. Perhaps because of how much they remind me of most of humanity. And maybe that was Tolkien's intent? An allegory for how humanity often only makes the right choice when goaded into it, as opposed to it being our first and natural instinct.Although there are moments in the text that are a little slow going, they are few and far between, and Tolkien focuses much less on the minutia of detail about Middle Earth in this book as opposed to some of his others. I had also forgotten how action packed the last 100 pages or so of \\"The Hobbit\\" are. I was recently arguing with a friend that the decision to make the films of \\"The Hobbit\\" a trilogy was just greed as the book could not support 3 films. I was wrong, if the movies are well done, there is more than enough in this text to justify three films.This rereading of \\"The Hobbit\\" has made me want to jump back into Middle Earth, and I sense that I will be picking up and rereading more of Tolkien in the very near future. As for \\"The Hobbit\\", I will gladly revisit Bilbo Baggins and his adventures again and again over the course of my lifetime. No greater praise can one give a book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great time reading this book.

A place where evil exists and is growing, but also a place where good exists and is willing to stand up to injustice, slaughter, and violence.Fans familiar with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy will recognize characters, stories, and events from this tale, and will likely delight in learning more about Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the discovery of a certain ring.

I first read this book when I was 20 years old, so I didn't have the attachment to it like many people I know. I read it, enjoyed it, but felt like it was a trifle compared to The Lord of the Rings books that I read soon afterwards.I've gone back to reread the book in preparation for the new movies. I'm glad I did. Tolkien's writing is fantastic. His authorial interventions give the book a good dose of humor and set up the tension for the story very well. Gollum emerges as a well-defined character right from the start. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter is definitely the highlight of the book.I had a few issues with the book. Some of the resolution to the story isn't as satisfying as I'd like (certain actions are done \\"off screen\\" and other actions are performed by minor characters that we haven't followed on the adventures). There are so many characters (specifically dwarfs), that very few leave a real lasting impression. The book doesn't line up very well with the sequel, but I guess that is more the problem for the sequel.In the end I was surprised how much I got sucked into the book and the writing right away. The world of Middle Earth isn't as fleshed out and \\"real\\" as it is in the Lord of the Rings, but what is here is a great adventure tale that is thrilling and well-written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's the Hobbit for darn sake.

Tolkien is truly a \\"precious\\" piece of the fantasy genre. As the book is about a group of dwarves, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard named Gandalf whom embark on a journey through the world of Middle Earth. Along the journey they will meet new and unthought-of characters that will make the story even better. For example, along the journey the group meets dangerous goblins and giant spiders. You will not want to put the book down, as the adventure never stops from the beginning of the journey in the Shire to the end of the journey in the mountains where the dragon Smaug lives. However, the book can get a bit slow at some points when you are just waiting for them to do something. As a reader though, this book will attract the eye of a young reader interested in fantasy or someone who has read the Lord of The Rings trilogy because The Hobbit is a prequel to that series and written by the same author.

In fact other than Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, this book has little connection to the trilogy that would follow it other than introducing readers to the world of Middle Earth. In fact, it is written in a completely different style. The prose of The Hobbit has more of a fairy tale feel to it than the straight-forward fantasy of The Lord of the Rings. This gives the book a large appeal to children, but it can still be enjoyed by readers of all ages.In The Hobbit, the wizard Gandalf involves Bilbo in an adventure (despite hobbits' aversion to such escapades) with a company of dwarves. They seek to repossess a treasure that is rightfully theirs and is currently in the lair of the dragon Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo and his companions encounter trolls, elves, goblins, giant spiders, and a host of other fantasy story creatures. Bilbo also encounters the strange creature, Gollum, in a diversion from the main story. In this part of the book, readers meet one of the most memorable creatures of all fantasy literature in a fateful encounter that sets the stage for Frodo's later adventures. Of course Gandalf and Bilbo also rank up there among the most recognized characters of fantasy literature as well.The Hobbit gives readers an introduction to Tolkien's world of Middle Earth which is probably one of the best developed worlds in fantasy literature. Every creature in his world is alive, even the plants and the birds. This gives an animated and lively feel to the world that keeps the reader engrossed in the story. Tolkien also does a masterful job of contrasting the feeling of safety and security in places like the shire and Elrond's home with feelings of dread and uneasiness that the reader experiences as Bilbo and his companions venture through such places as the Goblin caves, Mirkwood, and Smaug's lair. This draws the reader into the story and helps them feel like they are experiencing it with the characters.Tolkien only wrote four complete novels about Middle Earth, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also wrote a wealth of background material as well as several short stories about Middle Earth. For the new initiate to Tolkien as well as the young reader, The Hobbit is the place to start. And for those revisiting Middle Earth, The Hobbit reintroduces them to the fantasy world that is as familiar as it is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I picked up \\"The Hobbit\\" to start my reading of the Lord of the Rings series. I decided to start at the beginning of the series where the Ring is initially found. Also I wanted to test out J.R.R. Tolkien writing before I dropped $56 on the hardcover box set. Plus my interests into the movies made me want to read the classics.Well once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. It was very well written. As one of my friends described it \\"It is easy reading\\". It takes you through your imagination senses. Of course it does help to have watched the movies and have a visualization of the characters and the environment in which this tale takes place.The tale is about Biblo Baggins and his adventure with thirteen dwarfs to go after a dragons treasure. Biblo is reluctantly recruited as the burglar for this adventure by Gandolf. Gandolf insists that Biblo is perfect for the job and believes in him whole hardily. As Biblo gains courage in himself he proves to be a leader and is one of the biggest reasons that the group continues on in their journey. Bilbo's courage is amplified once he finds the ring and understands the power it posesses.I found this book to be an excellent read for all ages it truly is a classic. Obviously I give this book a 5 out of 5 rating and will be reading the next three books over time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is JRR Tolkien's prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Though it stood on its own legs for 30 years, it is now difficult to disentangle this tale of Bilbo Baggins' adventuring with dwarves and finding of the One Ring from the grandly-scaled tale that would follow. This is a charming story, less an epic than a good old-fashioned tale, as Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the rest trek to the Lonely Mountain to wrest dwarvish gold from the dragon Smaug. Along the way they encounter Beorn the Bear-Man, elves, trolls and giant spiders.This edition is quite beautiful, and would make a lovely gift for someone who has read the story and considers it something special.

The paper is heavy and augmented by Tolkien's own illustrations."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are true fans of fantasy books. This book is about the expedition of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and a company of dwarves. A wizard, Gandalf, also accompanies the hobbit. They intend to travel to the Lost Mountains to recover the treasure of the dwarves from the dragon, Smaug. Tolkein does very well at describing the adventures of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. This book is not a light book and will take some time to read. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this leatherette edition along with The Lord Of The Rings leatherette edition.

Or are they new errors committed by Houghton Mifflin? I have read this novel several times in other editions and never seen these errors. The odd use of grammar at times, even ending sentences with a preposition is understandable although curious. But the wrong word entirely isn't likely coming from a Professor of The English Language. The workmanship of the book is acceptable and worthy of the price at Borders/Amazon. The unusually wide margins are a bit strange, but quite handy when holding the book open! The inclusion of the artwork of Tolkien is a welcome treat also.

His voice is clear, resonant and beautiful, and he has created unique voices for each character -- even the fourteen dwarves. He could relate the dialogue with no intervening narration and you would be able to tell who is speaking! In addition, he lends animation to the text, not reading in a dry style, but with appropriate inflection, humor and drama. It's a pleasure to hear this beloved book brought to life by such a talented actor.Minimal packaging of ten CDs, each approximately 1 hour in length.This is a wonderful way to introduce The Hobbit to children, to enjoy the book as a family, or to give to someone who, for whatever reason, can't read the book for themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just finished reading The Hobbit for the first time in several years and was surprised by it. This novel reads much easier than Tolkien's later books. For anyone who hasn't read Tolkien before and has become interested, the Hobbit is a wonderful place to start. Besides being one of the shortest novels, it also predates The Lord of the Rings, making it chronologically the novel to begin with.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit who goes and a grand adventure. Unfortunately, hobbits do not like adventures and Bilbo takes a while becoming comfortable with the situation. The novel takes place predominantly in three parts. Tolkien develops his plot over the first part of the novel as the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo travel to the Misty Mountains. The second part deals with the adventures reaching the dragon. And, the third part deals with confrontation of the dragon. For novels this size, The Hobbit has more detail and plot than any self contained novel I have read.But, I am decidedly biased in favor of Tolkien. I have read all of his novels at least twice. The open a world full of tragedy and heros. The greatest of his work he never published. However, the Hobbit is the first and inspiration for the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien was a great author, and in writing the Hobbit wrote a novel that can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I realize I will be tared and feathered by the hordes of Tolkien Fans but it must be said.... I've read better. The collector's edition of the Hobbit was a gift for my birthday...the book itself is beautifully bound with wonderful illustrations. I'm not saying that I hated the book. It had a wonderful story with interesting ideas and characters (and is a must read for anyone who wishes to attempt to read the Lord of the Rings &quot;series&quot; in it's entirety), but (yes there is a but here) the story can be slow going at times not to mention the big made-up words and names that totally through you off. True, when dealing with a new, made-up world you have new words/names , but you don't need to make them 14 letters long and unpronounceable.So what am I saying? If you want to &quot;collect&quot; books just to say you have them...buy the leather-bound collectors addition. If you want to read a well-written book...go read The Sword of Truth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hi, I am Japanese and trying to improbe my English studying every day.One day , my English teacher said it was worth reading.Through this book ,I studied no only English but also what Hobbit was orwhat Dowarf was,mean while , there is a different betweenJapanese imaginally liveng life , food, or things like that and British one.I am getting like Hobbit, and I prefer them rather than Japanesemonsters.(Miyazaki Hayo , Mononoke , etc)However, reading this book was pretty hard for me.Because, my dictionary is based upon American English , sosometime, I have to refer the dictionary twice for one word.I was wondering , will I be able to finish to read the \\"Load of the Ring \\"sooner than the secound epic comes to Japan.I am dying to read touch 3 books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked this story. It is a great story about bravery, suspense, and drama. In the story friends have to trust friends to be able to stay alive. The author ( J.R.R. Tolken ) makes you feel like you're in the story, and you can picture what's going on. The story is about a hobbit who lives peacefully in his little hobbit hole with no intention of ever leaving it. But one day a wizard and dwarfes appear at his door wanting him to go on a dangerous adventure with them. At first he says no to the idea, but once he finds out how much gold is in it, he just can't resist. He and the dwarfes face many dangers. What I learned from this book is that you need to be brave and that it doesn't hurt to try new things because you might like them. I think that everyone who likes stories with dwarfes, wizards, dragons, and lots of excitement and suspense should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I don't know what to say.

By now, I've read it more times than I can count."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitBilbo's adventure begins with a meeting from Gandalf the wizard. Gandalf tells Bilbo he is going to have visitors. Pretty soon dwarves start showing up at his door, seven total,coming in pairs and the last one by himself. Then Gandalf arrives and they set out on a adventure. They encounter everything from goblins to orgs, to spiders. Bilbo himself is a hobbit. Hobbits are short stalky beings. They are known for there generosity and love for stories. Gandalf leads them through most of their adventure, coming and going as he pleases. eventually the group ends up at a great hollowed out mountain. A dragon lives inside. Bilbo is able to steal part of the dragons treasure with a magic ring he picked up on his travels. The ring makes him invisible. This is a great book, it is the first book in a great series of four books. The first is the The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, The Twin Towers, And the Return Of The King.Pablo"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion, The Hobbit is one of the greatest fantasy books ever writen. One reason I liked it was because of the detail. Tolkien wrote with such precise detail and acuity that I thought that I was acually there in the middle of all the action following Bilbo the hobbit every step of the way. What each character looked like, acted like, smelled like, what they were wearing, even what weapons or tools they were carring were all described in the most precise detail. Also, Tolkien describes the settings down to the cracks in the road so anyone can just picture these places right in his or her mind. I believe that this particular piece of literature is directed toward anyone who loves to hear stories about wizards and magic and dwarves and trolls and hobbits and goblins and elves and all other manner of Middle Aged mythology. The only drawback to the entire book is the fact that it requires the reader to be at a fairly high reading level do to some of the relatively long words and odd concepts. Dispite these few troublesome qualities, The Hobbit is still one of the greatest fantasy books ever writen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a student who really loved this book along with the hobbit I also loved the harry potter series. The hobbit is a great book. I really liked it because it was very adventurous. The Hobbit, who liked to be left alone, was drug into an action-packed adventure. He then was in for a lot of fun and so are you when you read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was good but kinda boring at times. I hated Chapter 7. I almost fell asleep through it. Other than that, this was a really good book. Another flaw was some of the songs and poems. Some were just too long and I really didn't wanna read them. Some were funny but..long. And how would those people think up songs so quickly like that? I know I can't do that. I couldn't make up a song if I tried for weeks. I reccomend this book to fantasy fans that have actually read alot before. If you're new to fantasy-type novels then....this is not for you.

It was on the same basis of Lord of the Rings and there was not as much action and suspence. It would be a good book for a younger child who wanted to read it then go onto the Lord of the rings.

I read this book aloud to my children who found it wonderful and amazing and completely different than the movie.It is a spring board into The Lord of the Rings for sure!

It's great for your imagination and your mind will be strengthened!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien really captures the imagination that a young child has. The Hobbit shows you a whole new side of the world. Whether you're sitting on your couch or flying in the claws of an eagle, you can't help but love the adventure that Bilbo Baggins is experiancing. You begin to have a real fear of the goblins, and to admire Gandolf for his wisdom. The Hobbit truly brings out the inner child in any adult."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just finished reading The Hobbit and I thought it was Great! It really kept my attention and the vocabulary was at a pretty easy level for me. I also liked how you could tie christianity into the book. J.R.R. Tolkien's book, The Hobbit, is a big book about the adventures of Bilbo (the hobbit), dwarves, and many other fascinating creatures that you meet along the way. Now when I say big, I mean big. This 272 page book is filled with page turning fantasy that will keep you reading for hours.Hobbits are creatures that don't like to leave the comfort of their home, and especially don't like to go on adventures. One day Gandalf the Wizard comes to Bilbo's hobbit hole and asks him to join him on a gigantic excursion to get the dwarfs' gold back. One day latter about one dozen dwarves come to Bilbo's house encouraging him to come. Bilbo finally gives in even after being warned that the journey will be long, hard, and dangerous. This book is about their tough times. I definaily think that the theme of this book is about how adventure can change a person."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have an affection for the Hobbit that I don't have for the other volumes in the series, likely due to seeing the cartoon in childhood and enjoying the comic book adaption. (see paperback edition highly recommended!) It is rightly described as a prelude to greatness.We see how it all began when the most inoffensive of creatures Bilbo Baggins enjoying a day of smoke rings and the ordinary life he leads is drawn by fate (or Gandalf) into a great adventure with 13 Dwarfs, Elves, Spiders, Gobblins, Eagles, and of course a dragon. It is an adventure where he finds out more about himself than he himself knows.Unlike the later volumes the songs are of a higher quality (or so I think) but that again could be because I have actually heard them sung in the old cartoon. The story is both exciting and calm and easy. Not even the climatic battle near the end seems to take the focus off the Hobbit.The book seems to keep the calm and relaxed pace that a Hobbit likes in his life. In my opinion it adds to rather than takes away from the telling. Lots of time for more adventure in the next series.I think the pace of the book more than anything else makes it. It doesn't thrust itself upon you. It seems to say; to paraphrase the words of Bilbo: &quot;It is a fine day for smoke rings, come blow some with me.&quot;It is an invitation worth taking"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With all of the current hype about the Lord of the Rings, I decided to read both that trilogy, and its predecessor, The Hobbit. I haven't quite gotten to the Fellowship of the Ring, but if it is even half as good as this book, I will be overjoyed.The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is, well, a hobbit. The wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Thorin, along with the rest of the company of dwarves, came to the doorstep of Bilbo's respectable hobbit-hole in the Shire, in need of a burglar on their &quot;adventure&quot; to regain the treasure currently in the possession of the great dragon Smaug. Reluctantly, Bilbo agrees to the journey.J.R.R. Tolkein weaves a wonderful story, following Bilbo's adventure. Along the way, Bilbo and his counterparts meet trolls, goblins, elves, humans, giant spiders, and many other dangers. As Bilbo learns more about being a burglar and going on adventures, he slowly gains the respect of his comrades. And in the end, it was Bilbo alone who took the weight of the company, when worse came to worse.This is a classic tale, one that has already been immortalized in literary history. I loved it, as many have before me, and many will after. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone, because it is one of those books that must be read at least once in your lifetime!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Only C. S. Lewis can come close to J. R. R. Tolkien in creating exciting mythincal worlds and believable characters and still have room for plot. Of the four &quot;Lord of the the Rings&quot; books, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is truly the best, and is, in my opinion, the greatest fantasy tale ever told. The Trilogy is splendid, but Tolkien is able to put all of the adventure and granduer from the other three books into this one, outstanding novel. This book is the paramount novel of fantasy epics and it shall be remembered throughout history as one of the greatest stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There and back again, as the subtitle goes. A round trip in the book, yet a beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A round trip, yet an intro into Middle Earth. A spectacular story about a Hobbit, his journey, and a ring.As you can see, there have been over 900 reviews of this book. All told, this book has a 4.5 star rating. What can I say that will change your mind on this? What can I say that has not been said already? Most likely nothing. I can shed no new light on this piece of fiction. All I can do is chime in with an opinin that has already been stated but by using other words. This book is excellent.Well, so be it. The book is a great read. It's a great tale in a great locale. This book is certainly required reading for anyone who reads various genres. Be it normally fantasy, sci-fi, history, or satire, I'd be surprised if you picked up this book and did not at least like it.Is this a high level brain teaser? No. Is this going to change the world? No. Are your problems going to be solved after you read this book? I doubt it. This book is an escape, an escape into the world that JRR Tolkein pulled from his mind's eye and thrown down on paper. This is the intro to that world he saw. And what a great advaneture it is.I'm not into revealing polt when I write reviews. I think that's silly stuff and I don't want to be told what to expect when I read a review. However, you have to give hints. And the book here is all about an adventure. An adventure that goes over hills, under hills, and around them. An adventure that meets with various good and bad people/things. An adventure that sometimes goes well, and seomtimes not. An adventure that finds its way to the lair of a dragon and his hordes of gold. This adventure is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but only a small find by Bilbo along the way links the 2. That and the wizard Galdalf.In reading this for the first time in about 10 years, I found it just as interesting as the first time, if not a lot easier to blaze through the pages. The writing is fantasy. You could easily digest this whole book in a solid day if you wanted to. And it would be a crime to do so because then the adventure would be over barely after it began.The only point of my review is this. Read it. Even if you hate it (which you probably won't), this is something you should have read in your lifetime. If you are 10 or 100, it is a fun book to pick up. It appeals to all ages and is something that no home library should be without. I can say I've read American history, Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut, Doglass Adams (and Coupland), Middle Eastern history, as well as other fantasy books and escapism novels from the likes of Clive Cussler. And this belongs on my book shelf just as much as any of those."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dating back to 1937, THE HOBBIT is truly a timeless classic. This wonderfully vivid fantasy stands perfectly well on its own, but also sets the stage for Tolkein's grand work, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Hobbits are (or were) little people, smaller than bearded dwarves, but without beards or magic. They dress brightly and are somewhat fat in the stomach. They don't need shoes and have good-natured faces. Bilbo Baggins is a very well-to-do hobbit.When Gandalf the Wizard comes calling on Bilbo, offering a great adventure, Bilbo graciously declines. However, Bilbo is cleverly tricked into joining, or rather leading, 13 dwarves on a long and dangerous quest for a long lost golden treasure.The Hobbit captures the hearts of young adults and adults alike; a classic to be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As I was planning to read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I found it essential to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Kind of like a background preparation. I was instantly captivated and brought right along with Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the dwarves as they made their journey to the treasure. I could not put this book down until I was through with it. (That is actually true). As the first fantasy book I read I recommend it to anyone considering joining the world of dragons, trolls, dwarves, elves, etc as this was a wonderful start to MY fantasy reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"To see children writing bad reviews for this book because it was too difficult to read and because it wasn't interesting is truly depressing; no, abominable! These children's parents should be ashamed to have raised such illiterate children who (apparently) are bankrupt of imagination. My father read this book to me when I was a little boy; it is one of my most dear memories. I can say that I am a better person for having read this book (and The Lord of the Rings), and that any young person can reach a deeper level of understanding of the potential of their mind and of the possibilities that exist in their life by reading, or by having read to them, The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ver read! I love all of J.R.R. Tolkiens books and I wish he could have written more about hobbits. My favorite line in this book is when gandalf is talking to bilbo for the first time and asks for poeple who want to go on adventures and bilbo tells him adventures make one late for dinner. I love that line! If you are looking for a good book, You can stop looking now. Just pick up a copy of the hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, but I am already having a blast reading it! I picked up the book years after seeing the LOTR Trilogy motion picture and I thought to myself how did I not pick the book years before and felt I've wasted my time reading other fantasy books when we have the granddaddy of all fantasy literature just waiting to be read?The great thing about this book is, it is surprisingly readable (since the story was originally for JRRT's children)and not bothering to rack up your brain trying to decipher excessive archaic writings. This is one of the best literary treasures to own along the lines of Tolkien's sagas!The only drawback is also the very thing that made this book great; you will not stop reading it and feel the need to read and know more of the canonical characters, places and events. But worry no more, Tolkien's preceding/succeeding stories are in no way short of stock.All in all, I am awestruck and amazed how a children's book could still enchant a grown up like me. And you get to spoil the upcoming movie to irritate friends who are non-readers!! How cool is that?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fantastic novel. The pages practically turn themselves in this tale of Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo's journey is epic. Our humble hobbit faces up to great dangers, is morally and physically challenged. In the end Bilbo is transformed by the journey: he becomes more courageous, more generous, and more a complete living being. I read this as a twelve year old and absolutely relished every page: it's readability is outstanding. The far more imaginative Lord of the Rings trilogy is often badly written and overdrawn. The later work has obviously lit the fires of fifty million dreams, but this first book is the more taut. While many readers will dislike the trilogy and recoil from its complexities, nearly everyone can enjoy this wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent recording by an animated narrator.

It should be noted, for those that don't know, that Hobbits are the salt of the earth and enjoy the basics of life (mostly centering around meals). Most Hobbits frown on those who disrupt the status quo or go out adventuring.

Also of note is Magic Ring that plays a big part in the sequel,The Lord of the Rings. 3 Vol. Set.The Hobbit is great fun for most reading levels and is a great way to introduce the fantasy genre to young adults.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" is a terrific story for adolescents and it starts out simply. (Alert: Possible Spoilers!) There is the hobbit hole where a certain Bilbo Baggins lives. Then, Bilbo receives a visitor, Gandolf, a wizard. And, the visitor brings other, visitors (dwarfs). And Bilbo is enticed into setting forth on a journey, which becomes very adventurous and dangerous. Bilbo acquires a ring, which belonged to Golum. And, finally, there is Smaug's treasure. Every thing, seemingly, turns out good for Bilbo. It, eventually, will turn out that the ring that Bilbo acquired is a very special ring. But, that is another tale.This adventure is fantasy at its best. Though, once upon a time it might have been called a fairy tale. There is adventure and magic throughout. And, this is where the author, Tolkien, begins to build his reputation as the finest fantasy writer of the twentieth century. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After reading the Silmarllion first, I read this book. Wow! What a contrast. If men are stupid, the hobbit is small AND wise. How refreshing. It has been a long time since I have read a book so entertaining. Reading The Hobbit is a most cherished experience. All illustrations were created by JRR Tolkien. There are four (4) colored illustrations and the rest are black and white. The black and white prints are of very poor quality. What a shame. The binding is solid, the black hard cover is well made, the paper is standard quality with intermittent annoying ink blotches, and the paper book jacket is well done. Of interest is the paper book jacket. It is reproduced exactly as JRR Tolkien wanted it since he was the artist. Which leads me to think, the 70th anniversary version was an attempt to recreate what JRR Tolkien wanted when originally published but budget wouldn't allow. Also annoying is that at the end, the book publishes the first chapter of the LOR? What? Everyone knows of the LOR! Even with the short comings of the publisher, JRR Tolkien's genius shines thru in this little Masterpiece. I recommend this gem (or Arkenstone of Thrain) to anyone who has not read this book. I envy your first read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A wonderful book filled with lots of excitement.This is only a small preview of what's in store in the following books.It will keep you reading!Strongly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know it's heresy to give Tolkien anything less than a 5. He is the undisputed Lord and Master of the contemporary fantasy genre, from whom all subsequent attempts are somehow derivative. No one has since been able to write speculative fiction without owing Tolkien a great debt. But, while Middle Earth is certainly more complex than Hogwarts, those who sneered at JK Rowling's godawful prose stylings might want to take a look back at Tolkien's first novel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a prelude to the epic The Lord of the Rings, but it still stands quite well on its own. This story tells of the finding of the Ring of Power, though at the time it seems a mere piece of luck and comes in quite handy for Bilbo during his adventure. More important to this story is the journey of Bilbo and the dwarves toward their ancient home, the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug the dragon sits atop their hoard of treasure. Always, the goal of reaching the mountain and reclaiming the gold (somehow) is foremost in their minds, even though they become sidetracked several times along the way. This is a perfect adventure story, ideal for reading to children or for anyone of any age. Bilbo, a seemingly insignificant person of a seemingly insignificant race of people, is a wonderful hero, as he finds that he possesses more courage and wits than he ever imagined. This is one of those books that everyone should read, if not for its relevance to the Middle-earth saga, but also because it's simply a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This wonderful adventure captures the imagination and is a great read. A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins reluctantly embarks on a perilous quest to help dwarves recover their long lost treasure. They encounter trolls, goblins, elves, and others along their way to Lonely Mountain where the dwarves had their treasure stolen from them years ago by Smaug the Dragon.One strength that The Hobbit has is that there are many thrilling adventure points throughout the book. You are also able to get to know the key characters and feel the dilemmas that they go through. One weakness that I felt was that it takes a lot of time and pages to get to each of the thrilling spots of the book. Also, at some points it can feel like the plot is slow moving. But, it is an easy read in terms of use of language and plot and I recommend it to the youngest teenagers and adults alike. I truly enjoyed the casual writing style that J.R.R. Tolkien chose because he gives the words on the pages a story-like feeling."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book when I was in middle school, and although I enjoyed the story, the characters, and the adventure, I did not appreciate what a magnificent piece of literature it was. I recently read it again to prepare for the coming movie and I literally could not put it down! I have read many books since middle school and I think that fact helped me to appreciate what a great story teller Tolkien truly is compared to the rest of us mere mortals. This book is brilliant from start to finish. What more can I say? Its a great read for kids, adults, Hobbits, Dwarves, and man-bears. Warning: not a good read for goblins."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Probably one of the most well written and complete stories I have ever read and I read daily. My meager words really cannot begin to describe what a wonderful story this is. If you haven't read it, you haven't lived!Yes its got a dragon in the story and treasure and elves and dwarves,etc. But it really is an enjoyable read. My 13 year old daughter read it and really like it and she doesn't like these kinds of stories.Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Lord of the Rings is an amazing achievement that has set the standard for all other heroic fantasy efforts. Many people who have read Lord of the Rings expect The Hobbit, (because it deals with events that set up the plot and action of Lord of the Rings), to be written in the same style and to the same standards as Lord of the Rings. If so, those readers will be disappointed.The Hobbit is written for a younger audience. Simpler language, shallower characters, broader humor, less rigor. It is just fine as a tale for younger readers and listeners, and just fine as an introduction to Middle Earth for youngsters, but if you start your Tolkien reading with this work, you should understand how different it is from Lord of the Rings.Interestingly, if you have heard the audiobook version this point is driven home by the entirely different performance given by Dale from the one in which he reads Lord of the Rings. Dale's Lord of the Rings is gripping and dramatic. His reading of The Hobbit is light-hearted, almost casual in places, as though he felt the material only warranted a very broad interpretation.So, enjoy this pleasing and light-hearted tale, but then be ready to be captured by Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.Reading the first 10 words of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 The Hobbit in the 8th grade, a sense of wonder overcame me. What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole? I had so many questions, and I was hooked. I wanted answers! I knew immediately that Mr. Tolkien's hobbit hole would take me somewhere I had never been before, somewhere that would lead not to Alice's Wonderland but into the complete unknown.That's the appeal of much fantasy fiction like The Hobbit. That's the secret. It is the unknown that stimulates the imagination and keeps readers turning pages. Quite a feat, too, considering how even children's fantasy isn't known for brevity. J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is over 750 pages. Nevertheless readers of all ages press on with wide yet perhaps tired eyes for answers to the mysterious and often tantalizing questions presented by fantasy authors.What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole?Only by continuing to read will answers be discovered. And by reading, audiences are transformed into the explorers of faraway, strange places. They become Neil Armstrong, Sacajawea, Magellan, and Captain James Cook. New worlds await!In my youth, no work inspired me more than The Hobbit. While not the first fantasy book I had ever read, it was the one that inspired me to continue reading (and writing) fantasy into my 40's. I owe part of who I am to Bilbo Baggins and his illustrious creator."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the only unabridged version of The Hobbit. The reader is pretty good but SLOW!!! You really need to speed him up or just read the book on your own. If you rip this to an m4b and play fast on an iPod, it is good. I just need to find the right Android app to speed up his talking."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just re-read this again in time for the coming movie. I wonder how they will make it into a 2 part movie because really not that much happens. I am surprised by how short it is and that the tone it is written in is much different from the LotR books. I still enjoyed it a lot, it was great re-reading it again after 15 years. You can read LotR without this one, but it does make it more fun and interesting."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For our anniversary my wife bought me a Kindle and a gift card. The Hobbit was one of the first books I downloaded and I loved it. I read the book many years ago and I listened to the unabridged version on CD, and I loved reading it on Kindle. It is a great story and one I like to read or listen to from time to time. As one who enjoys the pleasures of being home, I can relate to Bilbo as he ventures forth on this great quest. While many of us are comfortable with things we know and are familiar with, I think Bilbo's story is good for all of us to read and enjoy. Life is too short to not get out and try new things, and I remember this lesson everytime I read the story.Recently downloaded the Lord of The Rings trilogy and I am now about half way through them. Great reading for one and all."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i had never actually read this book until just recently. i vaugely recall seeing the animated feature on TV, but apparently I had forgotten most of the story. this is a quick and easy read and a great introduction to the Tolkien world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Luckily for me, The Hobbit was my introduction to Fantasy (many, MANY moons ago). I wore that book out. Although definitely written in a different time, by a man from another age, there's a timeless quality to what Tolkien left for us. A quick read - and you'll be a little sad when you realize it's almost over. The Hobbit is one of the only books (well, perhaps THE only book) I've immediately restarted reading the moment I finished it. Well, after a couple minutes to sit back and soak it all in. Make some tea, toast a biscuit, sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is full of adventer,and it keeps you on your toes for more. When the story is dull it gives you a suprising twist which keeps you reading on. The characters in the book run into a few problems on their adventure. If you liked this book as much as I did I suggest reading the rest of this series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Branch G. - Miller Place, NYThe prequel to the epic Lord of the Rings series, The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is a must read for young adults who love fantasy literature.One reason I enjoyed reading this novel so much was because of its unique storyline set in a fantasy world called Middle-Earth. Its storyline is so exclusive compared to all other books because it is almost like a lost part of Earth's history, set in the Middle Ages, and yet includes fantasy items such as immortality and magic.Another reason I took pleasure in reading this story is because it is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. If you have already read the series, this will give you a very good background on how the One Ring of Power was originally discovered and passed down to Frodo.On the downside, I disliked the Old English elements in the story and high vocabulary used by J.R.R. Tolkien. I must have picked up the dictionary fifty times to look up words that I was unaware of their meanings. Also, the author usually goes into great depth using detail to describe the setting and characters. After a while this did bore me.All in all, if you are a fan of fantasy novels and enjoy the Lord of the Rings series/movies, you should definitely pick up this book and give it a try!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am an avid reader and I read The Hobbit when I was in 4th grade. I immediately loved it. It is much easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo was funny, and I liked the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum. Fat ol' Bombur was humorous,too (mostly by the fact that he was so lazy and fat). I felt sorry for poor Bilbo. He was forever wishing to be back at home in his nice hole, the kettle just beginning to sing. The Hobbit definitly showed Bilbo's Tookish side. I would reccomend this amazing prelude to The Lord of the Rings triloqy. The amazing thing about J.R.R. Tolkien is that he didn't just create a few characters, he created a universe! He made cultures and empires, from the men of old to the graceful elves, from the evil orcs and goblins to the peaceful and food-loving hobbits. This is, in my opinion, the best book of the century. This is a must have book. If there is an avid reader in your family who likes fantasy, buy them this book for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The novel starts out with some strange happenings. First a bunch of dwarves come and visit the main character without any notice. Next the main character (Bilbo) starts this adventure to try to kill a dragon. Bilbo is only 3 feet tall and not very strong. They face many adventures and during one of these Bilbo finds a magic ring that can turn you invisible. The problem is that the ring has an awful magic power. It will consume and take over the person who wears it. The ring doesn't consume him in this book but it does in the next. Bilbo also faces many creatures like wargs or wolf-like things. He also meets trolls and with the help of Gandalf, a wizard, he defeats the trolls. Then Gandalf leaves their traveling band and they think all hope is lost until elves capture them. The elves put all the dwarves in prison but not Bilbo. Eventually Bilbo figure out a plan to get them out. They finally make it to the land of the dragon. The dragon is bigger than Bilbo could ever imagine. Bilbo steals some gold from the dragon and that makes it mad. At the very end the enemies who were fighting each other become friends to fight off the goblin hordes that come and try to take over. As they gain friends throughout the story all of them come together to fight. A funny part is when Bilbo gets home he sees people are auctioning off his house and all of his other stuff. He eventually gets most of it back but is still missing some. Over all I think this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was an excellent book because it starts out with an average charactor not in search of any sort of adventure, who actualy does'nt even want one and think poorly of those who do.

Now Bilbo has the power of invisibility, making him an excellent thief. He helps the dwarfs escape from trouble at the time they need him most.

Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \\"Lord of the Rings\\". A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me. This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End. Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including monsterous trolls, pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children. It is more for adults, teenagers and older children."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a very good book. It is full of action and adventure. There weird creatures in the book like Golum and the Orcs. The book shows that even the smallest character can make a diffrence. Like Bilbo. A small hobbit from the Shire. Bilbo is only about four feet tall. All hobbits are four feet tall. That's why they call them small folk.I would rate this book two thumbs up.

The is a wonderful adventure read ,with man-eating spiders ,the goblin fight and of course the dragons lair, and yet having to go through that Gandolf and the 9 dwarves were strong to handle it all. Tolkien , through his writing gets you to like the characters more and allows you to expereince whatthey do as he pulls you in to the story wanting more at every page!

I wanted to publicly thank him for such a wonderful prize which, of course inspired me to re-read the novel.The Hobbit is a tale that I will always hold near and dear to my heart. My father first read it to me when I was around five years old and I have had a love of fantasy in my heart from that point forward. The time that we spent together journeying with Bilbo and Company in their quest to the Lonely Mountain is one of my treasured childhood memories and I cannot talk or think about Tolkien without bringing up fond images of my Dad.Luckily, the story also holds to the test of time. It is a fast-paced, sometimes humorous, adventure story with an almost continual stream of action. The poor party seems to go from one peril to the next to the next in such rapid succession that it is truly one of those books that is almost impossible to put down for any significant span of time. The characters, especially dear old Bilbo, are lovingly crafted and presented to the reader in such a way that they become stamped into the memory for all time.Truly one of the greatest stories of all time and forever one of my favorite books.

I did have a few friends that had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and said that I needed to read them before the movies came out. I'm not sure if it was my age or the fact that the books had been sitting in my parent's basement for years and were yellowed, but I had trouble getting into them.As soon as rumors started going around that Peter Jackson was going to be doing The Hobbit as a movie, I decided that I wanted to try and read it before it hit theaters. A couple weeks back, I downloaded it on the Kindle and started this unexpected journey, only remembering bits and pieces of it from the cartoon that I watched as a kid.Needless to say, I loved this book and recommend that you read it as well. The style that Tolkien chooses to write his books in is amazing, because you can almost imagine sitting in a room with him, while he smokes his pipe and rocks in chair, telling you this epic tale of bravery, dragons, dwarves, goblins, wizards, and rings.It was also very cool to see how Bilbo actually got the ring and how it was used to complete his journey.

Tolkin in 1937. It tells a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarves and a rather unlikely (and somewhat unwilling) Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who would rather have been sitting in his easy chair at home watching his tea kettle come to a boil than be off in search of gold and jewels guarded by a very much alive and deadly dragon. Along the way, this band of travelers enjoy some good fellowship around the campfire, as well as run into some trolls, goblins, elves, and giant spiders. The story takes place about 60 years before the story of The One Ring.While written as a story for his children, the tale ultimately has an objective, and that is to teach children that unbridled lust and greed, coupled with obsession, can have diasterous consequences. Here it is shown in Thorin's lust for gold and precious jewels. His unwillingness to do what is right and just leads to a World War in Middle Earth, with all the major powers and some of the minor ones taking part. Ultimately, it leads not only to his own death, but to the death's of his sister's children and to the deaths of uncounted thousands of other dwarves, elves, goblins, men, and other creatures.The version I am reviewing is the Kindle edition, made available on April 19th, 2009. It is remarkably free of typographical errors. It is also illustrated, in black and white of course. Though the drawings are not too useful on the Kindle 2, they may be useful when viewed on the Kindle DX, because they are full page illustrations.

The text also has been updated to account for various corrections through the years from Tolkien and his publishers. What I liked best about this edition is it includes drawings and color illustrations by the man himself, J. R. R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Looking for a good book to read? If boredom comes knocking at the door, reading The Hobbit is a great excuse for staying put! In 1937, J. R. R. Tolkien wrote this classic book as a prelude to his vision for the upcoming Lord of the Rings series. Originally, The Hobbit was not a well-liked book, but when The Fellowship of the Ring was released, it became exceptionally popular because readers realized that The Hobbit filled a gap. This book recaps in detail events, which the trilogy only brushed upon. Questions are answered. Definitely, The Hobbit will be cherished by new and experienced readers alike.The story begins. One day, Bilbo's doorbell rang with mysterious, unexpected visitor. Bilbo was a hobbit, which is a creature that looks like a very short human. Living in a forest called the Shire with a large colony of other hobbits, Bilbo lived in a house carved into a small knoll. Hobbits are known for their love of simplicity and dislike of change; however, Bilbo was about to be thrust into an adventure whether he wanted to or not. When he opened the door, he found that his visitor was a wizard named Gandalf. Unquestionably, Gandalf was a good man because he protected the innocent and foiled malicious schemes. After a particularly long discussion, he finally persuaded Bilbo to go questing across the land with him and thirteen dwarfs to rightfully recover an ancient dwarf treasure of gold and silver. Years ago, the treasure had been stolen and hidden in a mountain fortress where it was now guarded by an evil, fire-breathing dragon. Although Bilbo was reluctant to go with Gandalf, the excitement was as exhilarating as the moment when a child learns he or she is going to Disneyland. He was going questing.Shortly after leaving the Shire, Bilbo and the rest of the travelers encountered the first major obstacle of the time-consuming, tedious trip. To leave the Shire, a traveler would have to travel over a secluded, dangerous mountain, which only had one small, curving road. The travelers were in peril. This road was known to be inhabited by goblins, but no one knew for sure since no one had ever returned; however, the traveler's fears were confirmed. They were separated and ensnared by goblins. While trying to escape, Bilbo stumbled upon an underground lake and found the Ring of Power. For those not familiar with the history of the Ring, the others books go into more detail because the Ring is more important, but the main idea is it makes its wearer invisible. Using the Ring, Bilbo was able to save his friends and allow them all to escape. After traversing and barely surviving an enchanted forest, the travelers were finally at their destination. However, there was still one more challenge ahead of them: the evil, fire-breathing dragon Smaug, who was the guardian of the treasure.Normally, if a treasure hunter endeavored to enter the ancient mountain stronghold, he would have to survive a passage through a giant wood gate, because it was the only entrance to the city. However, the dwarfs knew of another entrance, which had only been used for a secret escape route. Using this underground entrance and the Ring, the dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf were able to enter without Smaug knowing, or so they thought. When they tried to remove the treasure, the battle began. However, Smaug was not the only one who was fighting the dwarfs. When the Elves and Men who lived in the area heard about the treasure, and that the dwarfs were trying to take it all, they wanted their share. In reality, the treasure belonged to the dwarfs as it had been stolen from them, but the Elves and Men were covetous and wanted more wealth. It would seem that the thirteen Dwarfs, a hobbit, and a lone wizard would be wiped out by the massive armies, but Gandalf's timely intervention saved the party. Because he was up high in the mountain, he could see for miles in a panoramic view. Another army was coming, an army of goblins and dark wolves! Realizing that in order to survive they would have to settle past differences, the Men, Elves, Dwarfs, Gandalf, and Bilbo made up past differences and proceeded to ride to battle. Will Bilbo survive the battle? Will differences be settled? Will good triumph? Reading the book is the only way to find out whether Bilbo and the Ring survive.Reading The Hobbit is a great activity, which people of all ages will enjoy. After people try to comprehend the original books, they often complain, \\"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is grueling to read as it is difficult to follow the plotline.\\" The Hobbit is different. Apparently, Tolkien tried hard to make The Hobbit more appealing to a broader audience. The plot is easy to follow and the characters are well explained. Personally, the only thing that this book needs is a movie because the others become great movies, and The Hobbit would probably be even better. When this charismatic fantasy novel has been completely read, any reader will agree that The Hobbit is a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in fourth or fifth grade, every afternoon we'd have private reading time. One kid in our class had a copy of this book called \\"The Hobbit\\", with this smug looking dragon on the front guarding some glowing gold. Between the pages of his book there was a bookmark with a royal red tassell on the end. I was more interested in the bookmark at the time, but I'd never forget that image. For ages I thought a hobbit was a type of dragon!A couple of years later, my younger brother got into Tolkien and would tell me bits and pieces about \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (the riddles, the heroes, Gollum, etc). One of my Dad's friends was into Tolkien and Middle Earth too. I had an encyclopedia of works of fantasy, and they spoke of Tolkien like he'd hung the moon. I was into fantasy, but looking at the covers, thick volumes, and the elven language everywhere, I avoided Tolkien's books. For ages, the only work of his I'd looked at had been \\"The Father Christmas Letters\\", which I thought was all right. I saw the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, tried to follow them, though I ended up falling asleep halfway through \\"Return of the King\\". Though to be fair, I hadn't got much sleep the night before I saw that one.What was wrong with me? Fantasy lovers seemed to get so much out of Tolkien, but I could never catch on, try as I could. I tried one last time the other day, picking up a copy of \\"The Hobbit\\". Tolkien had written this as a children's story, so maybe I might be able to plug into his world a little easier here. I was right, and I did. It's a pretty good book.The book is all about a hobbit (a quiet, short creature with hairy feet) named Bilbo Baggins. He's very friendly, very helpful and a something of a homebody. He lives in a world full of all sorts of magic and wonder, but he has no interest in adventures. Or does he? Gandalf the wizard seems to think he'd be quite an adventurer, a burglar in fact. Gandalf is so confident about this that he's gone and invited thirteen dwarves to Bilbo's house. Gandalf has told them that Bilbo is going to lead them back to their ancestor's homeland, to get back both their treasure and territory guarded by Smaug the dragon. Despite the promise of a share in the plunder, Bilbo is not at all interested. Still, he gets dragged along, and after facing trolls, goblins, wolves, elves and giant spiders, becomes all the more stronger a hobbit for it.I think the main reason I'd been so put off by the idea of Tolkien's work is the way that others have interpreted it. Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films, for example, are all in washed out, filtered or pastel colours and are full of mud, sweat, metal and bleakness. I found this book showed Tolkien's fantasy world to look nothing at all like that. In the book of \\"The Hobbit\\" the dwarves wear bright hoods, the autumn leaves are a deep red, enchanted waters are a mysterious black, the gems in Smaug's cave reflect light in every colour of the spectrum. There's a flavour to the work that's just absent in about every interpretation I've seen of the work. It's hard to put a finger on it. C.S. Lewis described such moments as \\"the joy\\" and \\"northerness\\". It's like behind every object, every tree, there's something deeper. This is a world you can get lost in. The narrative is warm and witty, as if your grandfather was telling it to you, complete with asides and hints at the story to come, which was nice. There is something of a twist at the end, with a message within the twist. It's not what you'd expect, and it may disappoint some, but I found it to be rather interesting.J.R.R. Tolkien was a Anglo-Saxon language professor of at Oxford university, and it really shows. He's very particular about the words he uses. Check out the way that Gandalf tells Bilbo off for his vague use of \\"good morning\\", for instance. There's a lot of plays on words too, and lots of poetry. I haven't read as much ancient and classic literature as I'd have liked to, but I can see elements of what I have read in the Hobbit. Beowulf, one of the oldest stories in the Anglo-Saxon language, (and one I've read) features great halls, feasting and battles with a horrible beast by water, and so does \\"The Hobbit\\".I heard that during the 1960s a lot of the trendier types were into to Tolkien (the Beatles had wanted to make a movie around one of his works, for example). \\"The Hobbit\\" has strange creatures, unusual names and a wizard who can puff mulitcoloured smoke rings which he can command, so I do kind of understand why this happened. Kind of funny actually. I also think it's funny that throughout the book Bilbo is caught in a fantastic place, longing to be in his warm and cosy home, while Mr Tolkien was probably in his warm and cosy home writing, longing to be in a fantastic place.The edition of the book I read came with illustrations and a couple of maps, I'm guessing drawn by Tolkien himself, as there's no other credit for them. They also added to the depth and the \\"northerness\\" of the story.\\"The Hobbit\\" I can see now has been rather influential on the world of modern fantasy. Joe Dever's \\"Lone Wolf: Flight from the Dark\\" features green scaly Giaks riding Doomwolves, similar to the goblins and the wolves they ride in Tolkien's work. Dever's sequel \\"Fire on the Water\\" features a mountain with a cave going through it, rather like Smaug's mountain. J.K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" has a dark forest full of giant spiders, as does the Hobbit. I could go on listing examples, but I think my review's getting a bit long.I'll probably get round to reading \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", but before I do I'll probably get my hands on one of those Middle Earth inspired prog rock CDs (Jon Anderson's \\"In Elven Lands: The Fellowship\\", Glass Hammer's \\"The Middle Earth Album\\", etc) get some atmosphere going.Recommended to lovers of fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Back in the late 1970's, in an era when radio drama was disappearing from public radio, the American prodcution of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were created with a full cast of voice actors along with music and sound effects. Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Annotated Hobbit when it was first released in the late 1980s, and when I heard it was to be re-released at first I thought I wouldn't bother with another copy. Then I saw the new edition and was amazed. There are many, many more notes, pictures of different editions, and illustrations in general. So even if you have the first edition, this is well worth the price.The real joy of reading an annotated book, especially one as beloved as The Hobbit, is the additional insight one gets into the author's &quot;creative juices&quot; or as Tokien himself said &quot;the leaf mould of the mind.&quot; The Annotated Hobbit is additionally valuable in this respect because Tokien was a painstaking and thorough author, who concerned himself with every niggling detail of his world and of the concrete details of his book's publication."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Masterpiece. A work of Art. A lasting piece down through the ages. How ever you look at this book, it is all those things and more. Most notable is the endurance that this book has, lasting over sixty years and still a favorite of millions, perhaps billions.The story is that of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit. Hobbits are peaceful creatures who live in and around Hobbiton. One day, Bilbo is approached by Gandalf, a wizened wizard who sees Bilbo as a necessary force for the gathering of a party of dwarves bent on revenge and getting back gold stolen from them by Smoag, a nasty dragon. In the midst of this party and all that they encounter upon their journey to the Lonely Mountain (where the treasure of Smoag and Smoag himself lay) they encounter other forces, strange creatures -- some friendly and some very unfriendly. Deadly spiders, Trolls, Goblins, Wolves round out the deadly enemies. Elves, Men, Elrond half-Elvin, Byorn, and dwarves, round out the good guys. And of course, we can't forget Gollum...the dispicable creature within the Misty Mountains whom Bilbo encounters and gains the ultimate power over the lands....the RING! A magic ring that renders it's wearer invisible, but also takes part of the person away (as you learn in later books). But the Ring is mainly a sideline to the main story which is the success of good against evil thanks to a little, nothing of a Hobbit. Even the smallest of creatures can have a monumental impact, is what Mr. Tolkien was trying to tell us I think. That, and don't judge a book by it's cover.Enjoyable in everyway and a book to pass on to your children and their children. Please read it! It will change you, just as it changed the lands before humankind."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, if you can follow what's going on. I am a student who has read the book separetly from school, twice, and I am angry that other students have written inadequate reviews. The first time I read this, when I was eight, I was not following and comprehending what I was reading and would simply scan over all the pages, so of course it was boring, but I knew that I wasn't paying attention, so I didn't think badly of it unlike the other students who have taken the liberty of writing their opinions to Amazon. The second time I read it, I payed attention while I was reading and enjoyed the book. For those students which have disgraced The Hobbit's average rating, if they they didn't pay attention or missed a day in class, the book would be boring when it shouldn't. If you had to read The Hobbit for accademic purposes, please do not display your opinion as it has probably been damaged by the educational process."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm am 13 years old and I have read this book 37 times! I loveit! It is an excellent book to read if you love fantasy. I love Elvesand Dragons. And most of the creatures of Middle Earth are so original and captivating that one can't help but love them. This book was one I could not put down! The detail makes it a difficult book for some, but if you have time on your hands it is a good suggestion. And the Lord of the Rings continuing afterwards is even better, but the Hobbit is a sort of introductory to these books as well as a story in it's own. I highly recommend that you not think about reading it and go on! You won't be disappointed! It is a masterpiece, a novel telling the story of Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Men, a Dragon and a wizard called Gandalf. It transports you to the mystical land of Middle Earth where only your door seperates you from adventure and danger. It is very imaginative as well as wonderous. An absolute must-read! -Bonnie Adams"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I mean no offence but I am not going to review The Hobbit as a novel, I find it quite a useless task.Let's only say that it is a beautiful book, admirably suited for kids from 10 years on, provided you were able to teach them to read and you manage to get them away from their Playstation.This edition, though expensive, is a good one: paper is fine, print is fairly good, the binding is solid enough.Illustrations are those by the author, so they will not excite joy screams from your kids.This edition, in my opinion, is perfect for youngsters who love their books and keep them safe from rain and ketchup and for any adult who wish an average hardback edition of a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm fairly picky when it comes to books. I love action, twists, turns and plenty of suspense. Unfortunately, I was only given half of my portion of expectations. First, I must admit that I really enjoyed reading this book, and it had a few unexpected twists. It was a remarkable story that frequently changed my opinions about the characters. But a fair warning to those of you who are determining whether or not to read this book; the beginning is extremely slow, due to its descriptive nature. Personally, I like having full description in suspenseful areas of text, rather than full description consistently. The rest of the book is occasionally slow, yet when compared to the beginning, the rest of the book is full of nothing but excitement. It seems that Tolkien rambles off on something unimportant once in awhile, which was most likely his only downfall. Although the beginning was slow, and he tends to get off subject once in awhile (which is not always a bad thing), this book is extremely creative. Who would have ever thought of such things as hobbits that live in hills that eat 6 meals a day? His descriptive settings really helped me feel as if I were in Mirkwood, or gazing upon the dreary Lonely Mountain. The story overall was incredible, and I especially love the poetry and songs. \\"Alive without breathe, As cold as death; Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking\\". Gollum was the most interesting of characters in my own opinion. Living most of his days alone in darkness with nothing to talk to but himself and his \\"precious\\". On the other hand, Smaug's personality did cause me to laugh several times. Tolkien brought each character to life, and really portrayed the contrast in each of their personalities. His ideas were imaginative, funny and sometimes suspenseful. His style of writing makes the book more humorous and interesting to read, plus his fantastic description of objects left a perfect picture. Although this perfect picture remains, the overall reading was for me, fairly easy. It is often thought of as a child's tale (although it is definitely not written as one), but it seemed to be so much more than that. It is definitely a book worth reading, and has plenty of description. So don't get upset when the beginning starts off a bit slow, for trolls, goblins, wargs, elves, spiders and a large dragon are awaiting you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although a fan of LoTR, it was only movies I had ever seen. Needing this book for my school I wasn't alltogether sure about how it was I'd be willing to read it. But, even after completing my assingment, I continue reading this book.

Anyone who is a fan of Tolkien or fantasy novel should never miss this. It is humorous, clever, interesting, creative and inspiring.

Since it was shot in New Zealand I got to see a lot of the country's scenery as well as enjoying a masterpiece of film. When reading a copy of Tolkien's original work sometime later I read \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" all the way through but something about Tolkien's writing style caused me to lose interest after I started \\"The Two Towers\\". The fact I'd seen the movies was likely the reason, since I knew how the story went. After reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I might have to read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in its entirety to see the differences between Tolkien's work and the Peter Jackson films (I'm sure both Tolkien's and Jackson's work are masterpieces of literature/film).While reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I could see/hear in my mind the faces/voices of Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm and Andy Serkis (who played Gandalf, Elrond, Bilbo, and Gollum, respectively, in the films). I heard these actors had agreed to reprice their roles from Lord of the Rings one more time for \\"The Hobbit\\" (not sure about Ian Holm). It's too bad about the rights to a \\"Hobbit\\" movie remaining in legal limbo, but Tolkien's work is a literary masterpiece and I'm so happy I finally read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you love adventure or just a fantastic story I highly recomend that you read this book.

Great for those who want an easy intro into the series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" back in the late 70's... and I haven't been the same. To say that this book fired my imagination would be an understatement. As a result, I have reread it dutifully every five or six years since.I am truly in awe of this commemorative edition celebrating the 70th anniversary of one of the most entertaining books of the twentieth century, and there's not much more they could have done to make this book appealing to a Tolkien fan. The sumptous artwork on the dust-jacket, the maps of Middle Earth, even the detailed illustrations reach out to the reader and expand upon Tolkien's carefully constructed world in the most appreciated way. Seriously, this is one of those times you really want to click on \\"See inside the book\\" and see what all the fuss is about.Oh, and as an addendum for those interested in medieval romance, Tolkien's translation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" the 14th century's gem of the alliterative revivalist movement, is equally compelling. I don't think it's currently in print but it's definitely worth tracking down if you want to see how literature influenced Tolkien's creative spirit. He was a professor of medieval studies, after all, and knowing his influences only serves to deepen our love of his fiction."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great read, should have your children read it before they see the movies as a kid, one's imagination takes off when reading Bilbo's adventures, quests and all the fantastic worlds he visits."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This unabridged rendition of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit provided many hours of entertainment for my wife and I on long drives.

While most LOTR fans may only be interested in this book because of the finding of the One Ring, there are many elements in here that make this stand apart from \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This is, very much, a classic treasure hunt tale and a good example of the hero's journey, the hero in this case being Bilbo Baggins. It also has a better view of dwarf and hobbit culture than \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" if you don't includes the prologue and appendices from that novel. And it is far more accessible to the average reader than LOTR due to it's smaller size and somewhat playful tone. However, that playful tone is one of the drawbacks, in my opinion, about this book. Having just finished \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" with it's distinctly epic tone and scale, it is quite jarring to go from that to the childlike tone of \\"The Hobbit.\\" Not only that, but due to the fact that this was the first book to be published (ca. 1937), it didn't seem to benefit from Tolkien's extended revisions of his mythology that were published later. In fact, though he tries to put \\"The Hobbit\\" into his mythology, it seems clear that Tolkien didn't have it all fleshed out as he later did in LOTR or even \\"The Silamrillion.\\" Regardless, this is an enjoyable book and a necessary prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's works because hobbits are such an unusual race, at least in the realm of fantasy. As Bilbo once told Gandalf, &quot;We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.&quot; Yes, hobbits do tend to be more fond of regular meals and comfortable beds than having adventures. Imagine Bilbo's surprise at being confronted with, first a wizard, then a large number of dwarves who show up for tea unannounced, threatening to stay a good while and (much worse, from Bilbo's perspective), wreak havoc with the crockery. Bilbo then finds himself actually going on one of those shocking and inconvenient things called adventures, and we must assume that he will be all the better for it by the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book.

For those who have started reading the book: Keep reading. The beginning is a little slow, but once they leave Bilbo's house it is wonderful. One of my favorite things about this book is that the villians are not SOOOOO SCARY. They are funny. If you liked Harry Potter you would love this book. This is one book I consider equal to Harry Potter even though it is a bit slow moving."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My personal feeling is that not many books in literature today even come close to the adventure contained in the Hobbit. 'The Hobbit' has everything from the magic of wizards to the bravery of knights to the simplicity of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit. The culmination of this book at the battle of five armies as a backdrop for the slaying of a giant dragon named smog is untouched by any book I have ever read since. This story sets the table for J.R.R.Tolkien's opus trilogy 'The Lord of the Rings' which is a masterpeice in itself.

Amazing in both its simplicity and its scope Tolkien's Hobbit is a delight to readers of any age, and should-as others have proposed-be read over and again, at different stages of one's life. It is in this humble reviewer's opinion that it remains a jewel in the crown of fantasy literature, timeless in its appeal and its applicability.I am now in my twenties, and have only recently re-read \\"The Hobbit\\", and while I am more critical of the book now than I was when I was eight, I cannot in any way belittle or take away from its effect. While I read it, I fought against the constant exclaiming of the characters, more often than not a sentence ends in \\"!\\". However, once I understood the simple, cheery, and kindhearted nature from which our vantage point sprang, I embraced it.\\"The Hobbit\\" or \\"There and Back Again: a Hobbits Holiday\\" draws the reader into the first adventure of the honorable Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit. We are privy to his journey, along with a band of Dwarves as they venture off across the Wilderlands in search of treasure and nothing more than vengeance against the venerable and most feared Smaug the Dragon. No doubt, the story is familiar to you, but if not, I will not be the one to ruin any of the suspense or wonder you will behold.This wonderful story is necessary for every respectable reader, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone of any age without remorse. And I'll always take one thing away from it with me, best summed up in these words: \\"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\" Indeed, I believe old Tolkien hit the proverbial nail on the head."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great for people of all ages.

Written in a light tone, it is nonetheless not a book solely for children; as Tolkien himself has said, adults are in greater need of fantasy than children, and 'The Hobbit' shows us just how true that is.The focus of the story is, of course, on Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit indicated by the book's title. Initially, he is a solid member of his society -- well respected for doing nothing rash or unexpected. After being essentially co-opted into an Adventure by Gandalf the Wizard, he is forced, little by little, to grow from someone who bewailed having left his pocket handkerchief behind to one who is able to face down Smaug the Dragon (admittedly while invisible) and give up the Arkenstone to prevent a war between Dwarves, Elves, and Men. These are serious matters, even if told in a faintly whimsical manner.Finally, however much one might want to analize what makes 'The Hobbit' a great book, what comes out most clearly is what an outstanding story it is: one that can be enjoyed by almost everyone, whatever their age or temperment, and read over and over again without losing its flavor."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My parents had tried to get me to read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series since I was 11 or 12 years old.

Tolkien's masterpiece works, is clearly one of the most amazing pieces of literature ever dreamed up. It is extremely well thought out and written. Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read. The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them.

It is a story about a quiet Hobbit who is on a treck with dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf to get gold back from the evil dragon."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that &quot;make&quot; students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. I am jealous of you people who were &quot;forced&quot; to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a prelude the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it tells the many(and I mean many) adventures of Bilbo Baggins. In this book you dont know what will happen next. Great for teens to adults. Tolkein was a great author!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book had me totally absorbed. Great detail, descriptions, and enough plot to let me say that this is one of the best books ever written. They don't make books like it these days. 12 dollars isn't enough to get a good copy of this book. It's worth a lot more, if you ask me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"We ordered this to make a 10hour roadtrip a little more tolerable. My wife and I both enjoyed it alot, even though we bought it for our 8yr old son. The narrator does an AMAZING job of inventing voices for all the characters, many voices (mostly Gollum) became noticeable from the Peter Jackson films (which were filmed much later).The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)Made me itchy for the Hobbit movie coming out in 2012."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great -a bit pricey but if you're a Tolkien Fan, worth it. Some discrepancy's in a few of the illustrations but I still love it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ever since childhood I have loved this story. Apart from Sean Wadley's The Legend of Rudwin, I don't think I have ever read a book like this. It literally leaps from one magical scene to the other, like a deer flitting through a glade!The imagination in this one book cannot be equalled. To me it's a singular piece of work. Many refer to it loosely as a type of prelude... but no! It's far more than that. A classic to stand alongside the greats.The charming humour throughout the story is a reminiscent of forgotten times, and through the narrative you can read and see an old way of life - a forgotten way of story telling. And the author's love of nature blooms through the verses of every page. The characters are marvellous, and Bilbo - the hobbit in question - is without doubt the greatest of anti-heroes. He would rather spend all day eating and smoking pipe weed! Top man I say!Though I do read the new fantasy books that have followed in its wake, The Hobbit is still the very best as far as I am concerned. I'm just so glad the book is still loved and bought and reread multiple times. Long live the Hobbit!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For any fans of fantasy, this is a must read as many fantasy authors looked to Tolkien's masterpiece for inspiration. Good read for early teens to adults."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My children are now old enough to introduce to this lovely classic. We have completely enjoyed listening go the reading of it on the CD's. The characters are protrayed so differently and the songs only add to the story. This is lovely, well done.I would buy it again and again.Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is something rare. The Hobbit is both a great story for younger children, as well as an interesting tale for adults. The characters are great, Bilbo and the Dwarves being just one example. The world is in-depth and very magical (well duh, it IS Tolkien after all). The story keeps you interested and having fun, and the book itself isn't even lacking in action. Now, don't hate me when I say this, but I actually think this book is better than the Lord of the Rings. That's not to say I don't think LotR is good, but I think this book is a lighter read, and more geared towards everyone. I for one cannot wait for the movie to come out, and I will be rereading this very soon."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is different from Lord of the Rings. Firstly its short but equally interesting. The Hobbit takes you to the wonderful world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins ( the hobbit) and how he is swayed away to the world of Adventure. It has everything a fantasy book should have - Trolls, Goblins, Elves, Wizard and of course the magic ring.I loved the book because it keeps you hooked from the first page and keeps the excitement right till the end. It's descriptive and a light read .All throughout history , we human beings have been fascinated of being Invisible - Invisible Man, Hollow Man, LOTR and of Course The Hobbit. The beauty of the book lies in the presentation and the creativity of J R R Tolkien.Enjoyable 320 page read with a good adventure and strong story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With about 2000 other reviewers, maybe 6 people will notice my comments. But it seemed appropriate to note that since I first read the Hobbit some 30 years ago and wanted to read it again, the purchasing options were surreal.My first version was just the mass market paperback, published during the seventies, it may have been a public library book, although I'm sure I owned it, or one like it later (after I read the Lord of the Rings series, I re-readThe Hobbit.) Having recently purchased LOTRO MMORPG software (Lord of the Rings Online Massively-Multi-Player Role Playing Game) because it's characterized as 'adult' friendly RPG, I've not yet selected a server to subscribe to (there are several stateside, as well as international locations.)I'm just as enthusiastic as everyone in J.R.R.'s fan club to see the up-coming release of The Hobbit at the theater. I can hardly wait to see how the screen writers deal with the crisis point of the Arkenstone. And, beautiful as New Zealand makes Middle Earth to appear on the silver screen, I even find traces of Africa and America in the novels. (Middle Earth being a 'one' continent, where all the worldThe Silmarillionbegins.)This review is from a hard cover version still available in Amazon Marketplace:HobbitThe latest paperback and hardcover versions are also listed here:The Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book is absolutely beautiful with extremely high quality pages and binding, the illustrations are amazing, you most likely already know about Bilbo and his adventures so Ill leave the story out of this review.

Yet, it wasn't the best fantasy book I've ever read. I read some of the other comments on this book but fail to see why those morons who didn't like it gave it a 1.

It contains all the characteristics that either such story would have. The characters are all well developed and believable with enough human traits that anyone can find their soul mate in one of them. I wouldn't recomend this book if you're looking for something allagorical or with deep meaning, but if you're looking for something that's easy and fun to read, The Hobbit is it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Words can't describe the excitment, joy, and appreciation I feel every time I pick this book up. I've read The Lord of the Rings also. Poor Bilbo! You can help but chuckle as he runs out of his house without a hanky. Worse things await him and his heir. I have read this whole series, The Hobbit plus The Lord of the Rings, at least 10 times. Tolkien's refreshing writing blends innocence and a view that sees the world in a pure, unadulterated fashion. It makes for a thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I like this book because Bilbo(a chubby, furry footed character) is so unsuspecting of what is going to happen. He gets smarter as he is trapped on the long staircase of Smaug, and he fellow friends follow him to the the treasure. If you like books with adventure and fantasy characters, read this book and let Bilbo's adventures take over your mind!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read The Hobbit 35 years ago for the first time and many times since and throughout my life it has been a joy and a comfort. Knowing that Smaug will be defeated, that Gollum's ring will find it's way to safer pockets with brighter futures and that in the end the inhabitants of Middle Earth are not so different from ourselves. A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read this first when I was 9 and fell in love with the genre from this point on...

Just pick this book up and get lost in Tolkien's magical world!1-17-02"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book that can be enjoyed by all, but is mainly appreciated by two very seperate audiences. As a fairy tale style story it can be read to young children and generally enjoyed, but the true depth of the story is mainly appreciated by those old enough to read between the lines and understand what an amazing and detailed world Tolkien has created and placed this story in.Unfortunetly, the &quot;bed-time story&quot; style of writing can put off some older and most young adult or teen readers who find the book too childish for their likings. To anyone who feels this way after reading through a few pages all I can say is this - allow yourself to get past the all of that. Pay attention to the great characters and excellent story. And then look deeper and appreciate the wonderful and deep world Tolkien has created. From Bilbo's Hobbit-hole to the Last Homely House to Smaug's Lair every location is detailed and rich with character.If you haven't read The Hobbit, go read it right now. If you've already read it, then I'm sure you can understand everything I'm saying. If you don't, then read it again. This is a book that, on the first read, is an incredibly entertaining, original, and creative story. And every subsequent read allows you to peel away more layers and see deeper into the world of Middle-earth. And once you begin to see just how incredible a place it is, you should go on and read The Lord of the Rings - a novel that allows you to delve even further into the mythology and provides yet another eminently enjoyable story that anyone can (and should) love."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A big world of magic, fayries, dragons, dwarves, elves and other creatures has been described in this book of travels.The way in wich Tolkien describes these characters is of an unbelievable and honoust way of writing, so pure ,so precise in detail and character,as if true, as if alive,as if these travels of Bilbo could have once be described in your primary school historybooks. Looking at the maps,seeing all the sequals of this book, all the information available, it as a truly magical book that will keep you intrigued all the way through,it certainly has got me hooked on Tolkien for life!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book all by itself, but this nice edition makes it even better. It has a nice leather cover, good paper, and drawings by Tolkien himself! When I look at it, I want to read it again and again! I really advise you to buy this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Looking to be drawn into a portal that leads to the world of fantasy? Tolkien's The Hobbit will take your imagination on a wonderful, magnificent flight of fantasy and enchantment that it has never experienced before. Starting with the first page, Tolkien will grab your attention and reel you further and further away from reality and into this magical world he has created. This world is like none other, and is described right down to the mountains that surround it and the sky that engulfs it. Tolkien describes exactly what's happening in every scene and enables you to picture every plant, every cloud in the sky, and every character depicted in such a way that you will never forget. The storyline is so extremely fascinating and addicting, that you won't want to put down the book. Tolkien's attention to detail is magnificent, and his imagery is outstanding. The action scenes are extremely suspenseful, and they force you to read on in order to see what will happen next.The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read, and I recommend it to people all ages, especially those who have an interest toward mythology and fantasy. Don't get the conception from the front cover that this is a child's book, for it is far from that. The Hobbit not only will titillate your imagination, it will reflect certain truths about the real world. The Hobbit addresses the problem of determining the \\"right\\" way for a hobbit, or any ordinary person, to live his life. Should one concern himself with great deeds and wars, and risk losing the humble perspective afforded by the simple life? Or should the ordinary person never look outside his or her own quiet existence, and risk ignoring the larger perspective that might have allowed him to do great things for the common good? My advice is to go ahead and read the book and see how you feel, for if you don't you'll miss the adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read this book, I thought it was soooo boring, and just forced myself to plow through it (it was a Christmas gift from my brother, and I didn't want to hurt his feelings) I ended up skimming a good portion of it, and feeling that it was a waste of time. A couple of months later, I blew off the dust and made the decision to really READ it. I couldn't believe all the good stuff I had missed. I loved it. Skimming doesn't seem to work for this series, unless you've read them before.Anyway, The Hobbit was a great book. It was filled with quirky descriptions and personalities, and even the songs and poems are interesting (most of the time :-). Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, unexpectedly finds himself on a mission with Gandalf, the great wizard, and a bunch of arguing dwarves. Their mission: to find the treasure of Thorin's (head dwarf, descended from kings) ancestors and desolate Smaug, the feared dragon of The Mountain. Bilbo's occupation is a thief; not swiping radios from the nearest department store, but helping the company retrieve the treasure.Though doubtful at first, the dwarves begin to admire Bilbo in his talent to get out of nasty scrapes (of which there are several). Bilbo proves his honor, though being &quot;just&quot; a little hobbit, and nearly everyone leaves happy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit: a young hobbit (by their standards) by the name of Bilbo Baggins is thrown into a great adventure with the 13 dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Their quest is to go to the misty mountains and reclaim the treasure and let their dwarf leader Thorin take back his throne. They were driven away by the evil dragon smaug many years ago now they are back. Yet, the most important thing that happens in the quest has nothing to do with any of this, although it will change the world forever...I recommend this book, because it is an epic fantasy that is so well written and truly mind boggling. Tolkien takes you were you never could have gone with out him; he takes you to a different world. That seems almost realer than ours. If you like fantasy you will cherish this book.By: Michael"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien intended \\"The Hobbit\\" to be a children's story, and the matter-of-fact writing style in which it was written makes this rather apparent. Nevertheless, the prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is endowed with its own special magic that captures the attention and imagination of its readers and takes them to a place that is as real as it is fantasy: a place of hobbits and dwarves, a place of trolls and elves, of spiders and dragons, of heroes and goats. In fact, Middle Earth can be likened to the whereabouts of our own subconsciousness and its function as the battleground for competing human emotions and values.As the story opens, we are introduced to a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a creature not unlike a munchkin in appearance but perhaps less squeaky in voice. Passive and gentle, he is recruited by the mysterious wizard Gandalf to contrast the abrasive nature of Thorin and Co. (a group of dwarves on a quest to recapture their stolen treasure from the clutches of Smaug the Dragon). How can this unassuming and timid little being possibly be the protagonist? Indeed, he is of little value early in the dwarves' quest. Yet Bilbo's latent desires for adventure (attributed to his Took side, as we are so informed) are slowly awakened, and soon we are taken aback by his ability to manipulate enemies and rescue his friends time and time again. Still, it's hard to root for the dwarves, controlled as they are by their greed and selfishness, and eventually they have to pay for their sins. It may be too late before Thorin and Co. come to value the hobbit's appreciation for cheer and brotherhood over gold and other material possessions. Is not unity and charity better than suspicion and avarice?Some may bicker that Tolkien's approach is too straightforward. And granted, \\"The Hobbit\\" isn't very Dickensian when it comes to names. Heck, one of the huge, ugly trolls the dwarves encounter is called William. With a name like that, I had trouble picturing a troll at all and thought he might start up a conversation with, \\"Excuse me my dear Thomas, but it appears you have some mutton on your face. Care for some more tea and crumpets?\\" Irrespective of a handful of critics, however, most readers will come to love \\"The Hobbit\\" for its enchanting scenic representation of Middle Earth, its memorable characters (especially Gollum and Beorn) and its original storytelling. Best of all is it's wonderful simplicity and an opening that's as a portal to escapism: \\"In the hole in the ground there lived a hobbit...\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that started it all. Tolkien tells an enchanting and magical tale about the journey's of one Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo gets into all kinds of trouble with the band of 13 dwarves he must accompany. There are elves, dragons, goblins, and wizards in this book; everything that makes fantasy great. This is an excellent book to read if you are just starting to read the fantasy genre. It really has everything. I made the mistake of stopping after the first 50 or so pages. A few months later, I picked it up again and it blew me away. I read the last 100+ pages in only two days. It turns into a real page turner towards the end. Please pick up this book and you will be whisked away to the enchanting land Tolkien creates. It's a great escape from the day-to-day drone we are used to."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great! It should be a cornerstone for future authors so they may know what true writing is all about! The book portrays the adventures of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins as he is hired on a quest for treasure. He finds courage and adventure in him he never knew existed until he travelled from his home to the lonely mountain, where the treasure is along with a dragon, and many more trials and tribulations on the long journey in between. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone and everyone. This book has such a faced pace edge to it that the action never stops. As soon as you think that the character couldn't possibly entangle hisself in any more ordeals, the story takes a new twist and has you on the edge of your seat. You will find yourself wanting to be right alongside the title character, Bilbo Baggins, fighting goblins and puzzling a nightmarish creature named Gollum! This book was so well written and the detail tolkein put into this book makes it immortal. You can see everything that tolkein saw when he wrote this book. I commend tolkein for such an outstanding job he did with this book. I am now a true believer in the magic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wanted to offer my older brother a nice gift, but was not sure what to get.Then, I saw this book, and remembered his love for real books.

Like most of his work, the characters are underdeveloped and the story is plot based."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is a character most of us can relate to. He likes to eat and is a bit overweight. Bilbo desires adventure, but he would prefer to stay home and enjoy a quiet life. He prefers the familiar to the unknown. But once in a while something bigger than us gets in the way.The Hobbit's adventure begins when he is chosen by the wizard Gandalf to be part of a team that travels across Middle Earth to restore the dwarf kingdom of Thorin Oakenshield. The group must travel over the mountains, through a treacherous forest, up another mountain that is inhabited by a terrible dragon, sleigh the dragon, recover the treasure, and restore the kingdom.This book is the story of how a little Hobbit rises to the occasion, and takes on the challenge. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book in seventh grade because I had heard great things about it from relatives and friends. I didn't think I would read it all in about two days. I couldn't put it down I stopped on the first day at a part where Bilbo Baggins of Hobbiton was saving all of his dwarf friends from giant spiders in the mirkwood. The next day I woke up at about six o'clock just to finish the book. When I was finished and just about the same second that I was finished I begged my Mom to take me to the book store to get The Fellowship of the Ring. I highly recomend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If the names Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the wizard don't mean anything to you, READ THIS REVIEW, THEN GO READ THE HOBBIT! This is a fantastic story that will keep you hooked until the end. It tells the story of Bilbo, a hobbit, or midget, who goes on adventure with thirteen dwarves in search of a treasure that was taken from the dwarves by Smaug the Dragon. For most of the trip, they are accompanied by Gandalf, a mighty wizard who got Bilbo to sign up for the trip. Along the way, Bilbo finds a special ring that makes its wearer invisible. He &quot;wins&quot; this treasure from a creature called Gollum, who swears revenge on Bilbo's family when Bilbo escapes. The troop has many great adventures with goblins, elves, wolves, trolls, and giant spiders! If you've never read this book, do yourself a favor and read this A.S.A.P.

It is about a hobbit named Bilbo, twelve dwarves, and a wizard called Gandalf. They need to go to a mountain guarded by a dragon. They make it to the mountain with lots of trouble. But then they remember the dragon.This book takes place in a place called the Shire, and Middle Earth. It was long ago, and it might be true, might not.The main character, Bilbo, makes me feel very good, and I want this story to go on forever.This was one of the best books I have read so far, and I ask you to read it. If you already have read it, then I encourage you to reread it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an action and adventure book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It takes place during the medieval times. The main character, Bilbo, is a halfling called a Hobbit that is smart, fast, he hasn't been on an adventure, andd he loves his Hobbithole in Hobbiton. The major conflict in the story is a dragon called Smaug steales a lot of treasure so Bilbo, 13 dwarfs, and a wizard go along to get the treasure back and slay the dragon. The author makes the characters really strange. This book is like The Fellowship Of The Rings and The Two Towers. I recommend this book to everyone 8 and up.A person that likes action or adventure storys would love The Hobbit. I really like how Tolken decribes the characters and setting very gook, and it is also exciting. If you havn't read this book YOU HAVE TO!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a true classic. J. R. R Tolkien's unique blend of simplicity and detail is great. You don't get bored reading it. I recommend this book to just about anyone, especially people who like fantasy or science fiction. Also, if you've seen the new movie \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" it's really interesting to read about what happened before that story. So buy it, or check it out at your local library, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THE HOBBIT is a fun book full of daring adventures, a reluctant hero and plenty of evil beasts. As a stand alone it is ideal for children and adults have certain aspects to the story that only an adult could appreciate, but plenty of things children will absolutely love. It is also a fun introduction into Middle Earth, and is a prequel that will get people started into the world of hobbits and magic.Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is the fantasy epic that started the fantasy genre altogether. Tolkien is a master of the English language and his wonderful writing and beautiful world make one of the best novels of fantasy literature.For those who are not familiar with this tale, it is the story of Bilbo Baggins and a band of dwarves that set out on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the treasure of an old Dwarve civilization. Along the way we run into goblins, elves, giant spiders and much more intrigue.I recommend this novel to any lover of fantasy or books in general. This is the book that put me onto the fantasy genre. Tolkien makes Middle Earth seem like it's a real place with the depth that he goes into with each race of species living there. After this wonderful novel I recommend the granddaddy of all fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. Be sure to pick up this great novel.HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first read The Hobbit I was 13 and although I did not fully understand everything and the language was not easy I loved it and finished it in a day. I could not put it down. Now I am older (I\`m 20) and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read.We get to know Bilbo - a hobbit that starts on an adventure. he travels trough the Middle Earth with a group or dwarfs. He joins them as a thief (he cam move very quietly) on a quest to the home of the dragon Smaug, who guards an old treasure that origilally belonged to dwarfs. On his way he also meets a strange creature called Gollum and from him he gets a very special and magical object (I will not tell you what it is in case you haven\`t heard it, read it, or seen the movie yet :), but you can imagine what it is right?)It is also the begininng of something much larger, it is the starting point for the Lotd of the Rings.Tolkien\`s source was the celtic and nordic mythology, but he created creatures of hisown also - the Hobbits and also the Vargs. He created a new elven lenguage.It is less complicated than Lord of the Rings and notably written for a slightly younger public, but it is one of the masterpieces of fantasy and it always will be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book and even greater adventureIf you've read the Lord of the rings, the hobbits is a must read as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book!

For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was just like the original.

As Bilbo and the dwarves and Gandalf neared their goal of destroying Smaug in his Lonely Mountain lair, there were unintended consequences of their acts to other groups including the community of men down the river. I liked it that things were not so black and white.

I'm waiting to see if the movie does it justice. I will read it again after seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is the epitome of classic tales of adventure. It allows the reader to venture on a journey impossible to take in the real world. Adults are reverted to their childhood ways while reading about the encounters Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves face during their voyage. Tolkien's skill in entertaining was clearly shown in this literary work. Even though The Hobbit is not as well known or recognized like Tolkien's later work, it is still greatly acknowledged as the book that started a great series, and also launched his career as an important figure in entertainment.Tolkien's use of imagery is what helps this book flow so well. Tolkien, by using imagery and literary devices, displays a journey that the readers feel they are a part of. Tolkien's simple syntax gives the story an old-timely effect. This makes the story feel like it is a treasured legend recorded on paper. The simple syntax gives almost a play-by-play account of Bilbo's journey, allowing the reader to closely follow along with Bilbo and the troops' every action. This allusion makes the book more enticing, and engages the reader into the book. The author's expansion of certain made-up words, places, people, etc. keeps the reader informed and saves them from becoming confused and disinterested. These literary strengths make The Hobbit an extraordinary and classic adventure novel.Although The Hobbit is an interesting read, the plot itself has some holes that left the reader questioning what had occurred. These gaps, as minor as they are, still draw attention and create some confusion. The flow of the book is consistent, but it is clear that the middle to the end is more rushed than the beginning. In the beginning, Tolkien used great detail in describing context, characters, and plot that it set the reader on a steady pace. However, towards the end of the book Tolkien greatly quickened the pace of the events, resulting in a rushed feeling. Tolkien's flaws altogether are still minor compared to the literary strengths he displays.This book is a classic adventure novel that is altogether very well written. Tolkien, after gaining a reputation from The Hobbit, later goes on to write his famed trilogy The Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit may be lesser known than his other works, it is a great read and undeniably entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A lot of life makes more sense now.

Not only does it help you understand but it also gives you an easier read to prepare yourself for the intriguing and confusing words in lord of the rings.

What an intriguing and magical world Tolkien created here. For such a short story, the characters and settings have great depth and hold the reader captive all the way to the end, or there and back again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When you read a good book, you sometimes can't stop singing it's praises. In my opinion, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is one of those books. I actually had not read this book until a few years ago, and regret not reading it earlier in my life. 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.Many people often imagine heroes as strong and comely in form. Comic books are filled with mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues amount to \\"beat people up\\" good. Tolkien's protagonist is radically different than such heroes as, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman. Bilbo Baggins is small, mundane, weak and sometimes whiny. Of all characters in this story he possibly possesses the least amount of \\"fighter's instinct.\\" Yet, he is not a completely mundane character. Bilbo is one of my favorite of all times characters as he is gentle, simple, and humble. He bears no grudges and desires no vengeance. Bilbo is indeed another breed of hero; A hero who succeeds though a mixture of luck and common sense. Bilbo is a unique take on the everyman hero!Gandalf is also a favorite of mine, despite being a deus ex machina in several situations. The wisdom of Gandalf along with his pure, unfailingly good, although slightly grumpy demeanor make him quite interesting, and mysterious.The Hobbit is an outstanding book that I highly recommend to all adults and their children!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a tale straight from the imagination of the #1 adventure story-teller of the 20th century, J.R.R. Tolkien. A young Hafling, name Biblo is drafted against his will into an adventure that forces him to face down trolls, goblins, and a horrible dragon. The Hobbit is a tale of magic and adventure that any Tolkien fan will enjoy reading, for the simple reason that it is a good example of his wild imagination.Readers above the age of 12, however, will find the book somewhat childish, as was Tolkien's intent. The story he wrote for his children, as is apparent in the ease of reading, and toned-down violence. If you do not plan to read The Lord of the Rings, I suggest you ignore this book. If you do, however, plan to read the best adventure story of all time, read the Hobbit only because it leads up the story about Bilbo's nephew, Frodo Baggins, and his adventure in The Lord of the Rings. You can finish it relatively quickly, and better enjoy the sequel trilogy. I read at only 350 words/minute, and I was able to finish this book in two nights (a total of maybe 6 hours).If, however, you would rather read a story to a young child, this book would serve as great entertainment. I further suggest that you be sure to purchase an illustrated version, as if your reason for purchase is thus, a child would enjoy to see Tolkien's monsters monsters come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins that has a lot of courage and spunk. i wish i had that much courage. i think this book is for advanced readers that are very sufisticated."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character, Bilbo, starts out hating adventure, but in the end he has a slightly different opinion. This is a wonderful fantasy filled with adventure and suspense. With zany characters that make you want to continue reading. Many people have read this book and there is a reason why."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While it is not absolutely critical to read the Hobbit in order to enjoy the greatest work of fantasy ever written, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit does provide valuable background information on the later quest. The character development is top notch and the book is a very quick read. Tolkien's ingenuity in creating a time and place is surpassed by none. The one odd thing I noticed is that it appears that the Lord of the Rings was written for a more mature audience than the Hobbit. All that being said, I find myself re-reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings every two to three years with the same amount of enjoyment and a growing appreciation each time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not a fantasy/sci-fi reader, and I did not overly enjoy Tolkien's extreme run-on sentences. I admit that I had to read more carefully. But aside from those issues...I Love This Book! Tolkien talks directly to the reader, interrupting himself every now and then to define a term, give a background fact, and sometimes to show the reader just how anxious he is to tell us the ending before we get there! Pictures are easily created. Puns are very intented. Characters are realistic in their personalities and traits. Any reader who gives the book a chapter's chance will become involved in Bilbo's adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently re-read The Hobbit, a story I first read in High School. My children are of an age to read it, so this time I read it with a critical eye, rather than for the sheer joy of immersing myself in a story of adventure and fantasy.It is unfortunate that the Hobbit has apparently become required reading in some schools. Forcing young adults the read a fairy tale in these literal and cynical times may only dampen their enthusiasm for literature. This book was written to be read for enjoyment, not a grade.So read it and enjoy a tale that will take you far from the fast paced industrial world we live in, into the land of imagination and adventure. Read it aloud to your children, and you will find them very attentive.Now, on to the review.A significant obstacle to enjoying this story is Tolkein's British English, which carries a startling variety of idomatic phrases and terms not currently in use here in America. I have had to translate a lot of words and terms for my children when they have had trouble with understanding.The style is light hearted and conversational. You feel as though the story teller is speaking to you in a friendly voice. The frequent asides and blatant foreshadowing add a personal touch to the story that enhances, rather than detracts, from its accessability.The themes are fairly easy to discern, and particularly good for young audiences. Far from beng a whimsical fairy tale, there are simple messages here, even for the un-alerted reader. Such as:Heroes arise from unlikely sources. (This is certainly true in real life.)The sedentary life has little flavor-- get out and have an adventure.Self interest and greed are dangerous motivators.Trying your best can produce results for unexpected reasons.Ones actions can have unintended consequences for others. The devastation of Lake Town is a poignant illustration of this concept, often overlooked in today's self oriented culture. At a time where the lawsuit and strict liability grossly punish unintended outcomes, the conscience driven resolution in the Hobbit is a refreshing concept.Is this the best story ever written? Hardly. Is it an engaging and enjoyable adventure story? Absolutely!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thoroughly appreciate the illustrations of how the Hobbit has been illustrated in other countries that are included in this edition. The introduction is first rate, though mysteriously it uses end notes while the rest of the book uses annotation in the margin. The notes that delve into the possible sources and influences on Tolkien's thought and work are mostly interesting and informative. The main negative I find is how many marginal notes are devoted to textual variants between the various editions. For example, in the section where the company meets the trolls, a note explains one version has \\"they dropped him\\" while another version has \\"he dropped him.\\" Although the textual variant notes are usually more extensive than this, they are an uninteresting disappointment to me. The level of detail is high, but at times, almost to the point of being pedantic. Still, if you love the work of Tolkien, you will find this version enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"God I get tried if writing reviews, I just want to buy a product and go on with my lifeSorryDavid"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"12 year old girl hereI personally hated this book.

This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently read \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as the main \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and I really enjoyed all four books. However, I have to note something. Before reading the series, I was under the impression that \\"The Hobbit\\" was an unnecessary, but related book mainly telling you more about hobbits. However, it does more than just tell you about hobbits, and, in my opinion, it is necessary to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading the main trilogy. There is a lot of content in it that will make the trilogy even better. For example, \\"The Hobbit\\" tells you how Bilbo happened to find the ring, it tells you a fair amount of useful \\"history\\", and it can help you make more sense out of much of what is mentioned in the trilogy, such as locations and such.This book could very well be read without reading the trilogy. However, I would definitely recommend reading all four books, because they are all very exciting, and each one builds up more and more interest as the story unfolds.As other reviewers have mentioned, the writing style could have been better.I only gave this book 4 stars mainly for that reason. The style isn't too bad, however, it can be a little annoying at times. Sometimes it sounds more like an uninvolved person commenting on the situation, other times it is like a storyteller getting distracted too much by a similar story or by history. That is one of the very few problems I found with this book.Overall, I am glad that I finally read these books, and I am especially glad that I was able to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before I read the main trilogy. I highly recommend all four books. They are all very exciting with constant surprises and twists in the plot to keep you interested. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book really is a genius story, although, if yur someone like me you have to wonder, with the way Tolkien writes this story, how did he know when and how all this happened?Anyways, as some might have thought his style of writing, odd, I thought it entertaining, he kade it seem like he was telling you, you sitting there reading this loooong book, what's going on. I swear at some points I could here him telling it to me. It's just such a wonderful way to write.As for the ending, although odd, for those who haven't read it yet don't read this next part! I still wonder how such a magnificent dragon, as described in the book, is killed so easily!When I started reading the end finally) I couldn't put it down, so much happens in the last 20 pages, you have to wonder how he crammed all that story in there.Seeing as it took me forever to read, I liked how in some chapters he would take you infor the detailed begining of one of their many adventures, and then in the last 2 pages of the book would sumarize what happenened to the gruop in the end!I'm more into realistic fiction, but I have a few exceptions here and there, this is fantastic, if you have a lot of reading time on your hands, then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didn't read any of Tolkien's books until the movies(awesome) came out and made me interested. So I started with The Hobbit. Amazing. The whole book feels like this big classic adventure and its fun to read. It is also very important in setting up The Lord of the Rings books. Gandalf has got to be one the best characters ever created along with Bilbo of course.There have been many people who have tried to imitate Tolkien's works(Christoper Paolini who wouldn't know originality if it broke his nose) is one example. And sadly no one has made fantasty equal to The Hobbit, Narnia is close but not quite as good. Because if someone did make a fantasty equal to The Hobbit we could have the joy of reading another book that captures your imagination and takes you to another world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although \\"The Hobbit\\" exists alone in the Middle-earth realm, it preludes (and is fairly crucial) as the foundation to the masterpiece story \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". The novel follows the comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he reluctantly leaves his secure home in the company of numerous dwarves and Gandalf, a wizard of good character. The author expertly combines delightful riddles, the singing of well-versed songs, and adolescent banter amid charming creatures, spooky monsters, and minor magic to craft the ideal tale for young readers.The continuous adventure may start with many characters, but Bilbo composes the storyline from a third person view and interjects his own pleasant personality. Other than one affair relating to Gandalf and a Necromancer, all events are resolved in a thorough yet amusing manner. \\"The Hobbit\\" helped define expectations for a reader and laid the groundwork for future fantasy novels with the introduction of different races including Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, and their relationships between each other and with Humankind.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. Original artwork by the author highlights storyline events and sufficiently illustrates the path traveled by the adventurers. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I visited an old friend I hadn't seen since the fifth grade, my first 'Hobbit' book. Although I like what they did with the movie, they couldn't have copied the depth of the novel onto the screen, it's something different. The movie will only wet your appetite, so read the book for the full Tolkien experience. I enjoyed visiting the characters again as an adult, re-visiting the Hobbit's wonderful world with a tear in my eye. As a youngster I didn't get the 'feel' of how J.R.R. Tolkien's feelings about war spiced the pages, but they rang in my ears reading it as an adult. Not only did his writing show the talent to entertain, there is great wisdom to read between the lines...Chrissy K.

This simplistic opening sentence has become a classic tagline, memorized not only by fantasy fanatics or escapist stoners, but by literate juveniles and adults nearly everywhere. Do we need another review about the Hobbit? No. Those who chose to read the Hobbit don't need to read a little review to read 'it'. But I will waste a few more seconds of my precious author time for this review:The Hobbit is a fantastic, minimal read that spans the imagination of a well developed mythical (linguistically, and characteristically) nation. It's a quick and lively trip across the wilderness of Middle Earth. An excellent adventure and treasure-hunting story, (think of The Elder Edda meeting Treasure Island.)This book is the archetype for all other commercial 'dungeons and dragons' fantasy that follows in floods. But rather then delivering the sedentary life message that most contemporary fantasy readers would like to hear, it delivers an entirely different message: GET OFF YOUR MEEK BUTT and START LIVING! START AN ADVENTURE! That's a message from a World War 1 veteran/author, not a hackneyed, cardboard-style, fantasy author who is today at your local mall convention.To many, (not just me,) The Hobbit is superior to the Lord of the Rings in that it is basic, it's wordplay and wit is constant, it has more humor. Though the LOTR's is an epos, an epic. The Hobbit is a lot more of a fairy tale...you read it when your young and it stays hidden - but not forgotten - in the back of your mind so as long as you live.In this postmodern age of cyber-hacks as fantasy acts, CGI modelsas 'imaginary' flesh and blood creatures, passive escapist adventures as real authentic adventures, The Hobbit is again a refreshing read....it should inspire one to see and hike mountains, to carry a walking stick instead of a laptop.Like Virgil, Tolkien's message is simple: FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE....not the meek, not the docile, not the lazy.(AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT)-Myles P."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"one day while sitting in my class at school, we watched a movie. instead i chose to read The Hobbit. it should have been good right? after all...it is so famous. i soon learned i was wrong. what a horrible book. do not read it. forget about all the other reviews. they just think bilbo the bimbo is hot.

It was very very boring. It was about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He went on a big andventure with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I didn't read this collector's edition, but I don't think there is much difference."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After writing LotR Tolkien should have hunted all of his Hobbit books and burnt them in a giant bonfire.This book tells about the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and a number of Dwarves (I can't remember the actual number, because all the dwarves were so similar).This book is so silly, juvenile and ridiculously written that it is completely unprecedented.People are defending this book by saying that it's a childrens' book unlike LotR. Well here's some news for you. There are some actually good childrens' books out there.Not all would doom this 1 star, but no way would this book be receiving so many 5 star reviews unless it was written by Tolkien.I'm not saying someone couldn't like it, but from any sane point of view it just isn't *good*. Period."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Warning: Don't read this book. It'll scare you from reading any other book The Hobbit stinks. The Hobbit is terrible. The Hobbit is down right boring. It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb. It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit. Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure. All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home. While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring. He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea. The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow. To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends. I strongly recommend that you do not read this book. I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together. Unless you want to be bored to death, do not read the famous The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book in my literatuure class and I fell asleep a lot.(If I wasn't sleeping then I wasn't paying attention).

Most of these people who've reviewed books by Robert Jordan, claim that his series is just another set of stories based on the writing of the Tolkien series. Many of my friends seem to agree with me that this story was a total bliss. Bilbo is a Hobbit who seems not to do much in the story. Of course, the whole meaning of him being their, is to keep the story revolving around a world of addiction. The ending of the story is horrible and it seems that Tolkien wasted his POOR and SENSELESS usage of his brain. No offense, but the suspense was not at all amusing and you felt as if you wanted the book to end on the first page. Bilbo practically does nothing to defeat the vicious (funny word to use here), dragon, Smaug. Surely this book was a waste of energy. The intricate details which are suppose to consist within this &quot;story&quot; are no where to be seen. The book does not unwind itself to a twisting and strange plot, but clearly a purposeless one. I despise and loathe this series tremendously. Bilbo is not exactly the character which you would find addicted to. He stammers and is basically a coward. Dwarves. Now where have I heard this word babled by little five year olds? Oh, that's right, Snow White and the Seven DWARVES! For the dwarves in the story, remind you very much of the ones in the Disney classic. Idiotic and Irritating. This book is a story of your everyday savior (supposedly Bilbo) having adventures and slaying a dragon. So it's like your medieval classics of a prince saving his beloved, only with a more dull and tasetless...yawn. Excuse me. Just remembering that I read the book makes me just faint in exhaustion. What was I drinking when I decided to read this piece of junk? And like all stories, there are monsters and strange happenings. Flipping through the pages, the words &quot;been there, done that,&quot; echoes through your crying mind. Crying because the story will NOT END! Agghhh! Gandalf the wizard is a bogus, he does absolutely nothing that would benefit to anything worth mentioning. Come to think of it, Bilbo reminds me of a pig. Small, always desiring food, foolish, cowardly, lazy...I can go on forever. Also, the series is quite poorly written. The words used remind me of the time when I picked up my first book around the age of four. Take my word for it, this is not the sort of book which makes you read till past your regular bedtime. One more things on the dwarves. They are useless characters and this story makes me want to vomit. No originality whatsoever is involved and the pages make me wish I was not even in existence. There you have it. I wouldn't even give this book a star, but since that was not an option, I had to settle for a WHOLE star. I'm just glad this guy's dead. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Why people claim to enjoy this book I'll never know. The writing style doesn't flow, the characters aren't particularly all that well developed, and the storyline isn't all that interesting.

Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, is a story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has an unexpected, unwanted, adventure of a lifetime. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is just a normal, modern day hobbit that lives in a normal, modern day town (modern for the &quot;old days&quot;). He just wants to live in peace in his \\"hobbit hole\\" and to drink tea and eat cake all day. He enjoys visitors and certainly isn't looking for an adventure. But what he gets are unexpected guests who are strangers and an adventure he'll never forget. Over the edge of the wild, through the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood forest, and to Lonely Mountain where the dreaded Smaug the dragon lies, guarding the not forgotten cache of treasure once belonging to the legendary dwarfs under the mountain whom once existed. Bilbo's job is to assist the descendents of the legendary dwarfs (yes, they are dwarfs too) in taking back their precious treasure. On this epic journey, they battle trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, and encounter many more mysterious creatures and obstacles. I thought that this book was great, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a fantasy like quality to it. It has many bold, diverse, built up characters involved that make it exciting. It was an unpredictable adventure all the way through."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R.

They myst travel hundreds of miles to get to the treasure through haunted forrests, across rivers, and through caves. &quot;Must we go any further?&quot; asked Bilbo at many parts in the story. And the answer was always &quot;Yes&quot; They all tried so hard at everything they did. Especially at getting the treasure and defending themselves and eachother when they were in dangerous situations. I think this is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is amazing how good someone can describe some things. Such as J.R.R. Tolkien does in this book.

These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this great play of literature so many times it is hard to tell where to begin, I only can say that it was the perfic classic.

It wasn't what I expected of a prequel it had very little to do with the actual Lord of the Rings series except for a couple of chapters which jokingly showed similarities.It also had another feature where it had it being told in a bed time story type of manner almost Roald Dahlish.

Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting. When I started to read the book I learned that this was true. I also started reading this book because I heard the name Hobbit in a movie commercial for the lord of the rings. I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.The main character is Bilbo Baggins. This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is what Harry Potter is not. Let there be no pretense in saying \\"The Hobbit\\" is among the finest pieces of older children's fiction ever.Bilbo Baggins is a humorous, lovable sort of hobbit. In fact, if I were to meet a hobbit, I should hope it to be Bilbo.What Bilbo brings is boldness in the midst of genuine concern over the task at hand. He is afraid, but not so much that he doesn't rise to occasion.Delicious language. Images you can taste and smell. A story that matters, and is well-told.Read \\"The Hobbit\\" and be entranced. If your children or nephews/nieces are old enough, read it aloud to them. Read it to your class. Show them Harry Potter is not bad, but Bilbo is better.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is full of adventure and excitement.

The only downside to the book, was the fact that the pages (the outside, not the actual part where you read) were speckled with green dots (intentionally) For some reason.

The Lord of the Rings is much more in depth, descriptive, and more entertaining than the Hobbit, but it also includes several references that only one who has read the Hobbit will fully understand.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins and his journey away from his comfortable home in Hobbiton and across Middle Earth in order to defeat the Dragon Smaug. Bilbo travels with 13 dwarves whose homeland has been taken by the evil dragon, and their journey is aided by the wizard Gandalf who has chosen Bilbo to join the dwarves in their quest. The Hobbit is a fairly simple story in which Bilbo and his new friends encounter many dangers and hardships along the way, but most importantly, it is the story in which Bilbo finds the Ring that will eventually be the centerpiece for Tolkien's subsequent classic.Read The Hobbit to enjoy a quick story that will give you the background and introduction to Hobbits and Middle Earth that will make reading The Lord of the Rings much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book last year.....I LOVED it. I thought it was the most exciting book I had ever read. Remember, &quot;thought&quot;, I am now reading The Lord of the Rings epic. Now these books are exciting. All of you dumb idiots who rated it one star because there wasn't any lower stars than that, did you know that Tolkien made a whole earth? Did you know he made 15 total languages for The Hobbit and LOTR? ... Didn't you think Gollum, the trolls, goblins(Orcs), Wizard, Dwarves, wolves, hobbits, or Smaug(Dragon) was exciting? If I were you at home, it would be the best book you ever read....Buy it...Now! It is an AWESOME book. Those of you who rated it one star, read The Lord of the Rings and then rate them...I know what they'll say. For more info on the Hobbit, it's about a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, that lives peacefully in a hobbit hole. One day some dwarves leaded by Gandalf, the Wizard. They offer Bilbo to be a &quot;Burgular&quot;, a person who steals treasure for pay. He accepts...and thats when the excitment begins.

I really like how I didn't have to deal with marking which page I'm at and holding a 300-ish page book. E-delivery is also very nice."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Written before \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", Tolkien introduces us to the world of Middle Earth through the unexpected, and unsolicited, adventure of the main character Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit to help the dwarves retrieve their long lost treasures of their long gone ancestors. As they pursue their quest, we come across many other inhabitants of Middle Earth. Some of them are friendly and others are inherently evil and blood thirsty. Hobbits, dwarves, man, elves, trolls, wolves, eagles and the infamous Gollum are properly described to advance the plot but not extensively enough for you to loose interest. I couldn't derive a definitive moral message from the novel but it was immensely entertaining nonetheless. Two points worth mentioning about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, the language Tolkien used is so elegant and eloquent. I couldn't help but compare it to other temporary writings which seemed a bit vulgar! Secondly, there are many songs (lyrics) throughout the book and some riddles too. Personally, I found them entertaining and conveyed the spirit of the situation whether it was warring or a peaceful one. This book surely has popped up \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" on my books-to-read list. Now, I can't wait to watch the movie and make a comparison. Tolkien has set the bar a little high but I guess Peter Jackson is up to the task since he did such a great job with The Lord of The Rings. Highly recommended if you're into fantasy.

This particular edition has some lovely illustrations, some seem to be Tolkien's work and there are some others done in full color by other artists. The font is larger than is commonly used today, as is to be expected from a children's book. It would be easily read by young and old alike. The text is distanced from the edge of the pages somewhat by about an inch and a half which makes reading a bit awkward at times but is otherwise merely a matter of style. As for giving this as a gift I would recommend it to those that are probably over age 10, and with caution at that, as a younger sibling might take revenge on the older by destroying the book, which is rather nice. Preferably it would delight the heart of an older Tolkien fan, a teenager or older, One who would appreciate what it is.

The fact that people could not understand this book baffles me because I read it and understood it in 5th grade. The people who think this book has too many characters and too much detail must have absolutely no memory because I who can not remember how old people are could remember almost all of the detail. I agree that this book should not be class reading, not every one reads at the same leval and not everyone can appreciate this form of lituratuer, but Shakspere is no better he totaly bores me. His books have too much dialog and not enough substance. I think Tolken is a great writer and his books are at a level that not many people can understand. So if you have trouble reading or have poor memory don't read this book, but if you are a good reader with relitively good memory at least try this book, you may not like it so you should cheak it out from a library, so if you don't there will be no loss but if you do like it buy the book, it is an excelent investment."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and I thought it was a good book in nearly all ways.For readers that have not read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; please do not do what my mother and many other people have done:give up at the start or in the middle just because it's boring for a bit (near, in or just after a chapter called &quot;Flys And Spiders&quot;). The best bit in my opinon is at the end of the book but the whole thing is good.

Reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has made me appreciate the book and its author even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was ten years old I was introduced to the world of Middle-Earth by an older friend. I had to struggle through the section of the book that describes hobbits and their habits, but the story that followed made the struggle worthwhile. Every lover of fantasy owes a great debt to Tolkien -- his success, both literary and commercial, made the fantasy genre viable. If this story seems too familiar it is only because every fantasy writer since &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was published in 1937 has drawn from the well of Tolkien's creativity and imagination. Now my son is ten years old and I am a proud father to be sharing this timeless classic with him. Like many other readers I preferred the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, but reading this book first enables the reader to truly mine the depths of the masterpiece that follows. Brian Jacques and Piers Anthony have learned well at the foot of this master, and if you enjoy their work you need to go back to the beginning with &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; While it is clearly a children's book, the depth of meaning contained within &quot;The Hobbit&quot; spans all ages.

This story tells of the finding of the Ring of Power, though at the time it seems a mere piece of luck and comes in quite handy for Bilbo during his adventure. More important to this story is the journey of Bilbo and the dwarves toward their ancient home, the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug the dragon sits atop their hoard of treasure. Always, the goal of reaching the mountain and reclaiming the gold (somehow) is foremost in their minds, even though they become sidetracked several times along the way. This is a perfect adventure story, ideal for reading to children or for anyone of any age. Bilbo, a seemingly insignificant person of a seemingly insignificant race of people, is a wonderful hero, as he finds that he possesses more courage and wits than he ever imagined. This is one of those books that everyone should read, if not for its relevance to the Middle-earth saga, but also because it's simply a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful book to read out-loud. I dont' think I had ever read this before. I know it was assigned reading in middle school, but I never read it then. I have a strong anti-authoritarian streak evidently.I found that Bilbo was quite engaging, as he is somewhat like myself. He likes to eat, and entertain, but doesn't much like uninvited guests. When Bilbo gets a call from a childhood acquaintence, Gandalf the wizard, he gets quite a party of uninvited visitors that accompany Gandalf the next day for tea. The party sets in motion a most tumultuous adventure which is not very hobbit like.Throughout his adventure with the thirteen dwarves, Bilbo grows from a squirming dunderhead in leading his comrades into danger with the trolls, to the fearless leader whilst conversing with a dragon. He proves his bravery many times over. Despite the growth of his testicular fortitude, he remains a humble being. Which is a trait that is perhaps lacking in myself.Some people can go over the top with humility, and in their baseness turn humility into self-depreciation. This Bilbo never does, and I am glad of it. He does not boast of his successes, nor does he lament to long on his follies. The hobbit is too balanced for the everyman appeal, but is fun nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Most of us have seen or read the lord of the rings, but have you ever wondered what happened before this? Well, you can find out by reading The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien. This story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and how an adventure changes him and the rest of middle earth.In the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is met by a wizard named Gandalf, who sends him on an adventure with thirteen dwarves: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Fili, Kili, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifuf, Bofur, and finally, Bombur. These 14 companions are sent on a quest to travel to the Lonely Mountain for the purpose of regaining the dwarves' treasure from the evil dragon, Smaug. On this journey, they will travel across the Misty Mountains, through the Goblin Caves and into the Dark Forest of Mirkwood. They will encounter Elves, Men, Goblins and various creatures of all sorts as they travel across Middle Earth.One such event occurred soon after they left the Shirt. This encounter was with a group of three trolls. After hearing noises in the forest, the dwarves sent Bilbo to investigate. When he did, he found that the trolls were eating. So, he tried to steal from them while they were distracted, but was caught in the act. While a prisoner of the trolls, the dwarves, hearing the commotion, gave themselves away by trying to save Bilbo, causing them to be bagged and thrown by the fire. The trolls then started arguing on how to cook the dwarves and the hobbit. Little did the trolls know, Gandalf was hiding in the bushes where he kept the argument going by disguising his voice as their own. Gandalf kept them arguing until daybreak, knowing that trolls cannot survive sunlight and turn to stone. When daybreak arrived the trolls failed to seek cover from the sun and indeed turned into stone. After this, Bilbo and Gandalf freed the dwarves who were cranky, angry and upset from being in the sack all night. This was just one of many adventures in Professor Tolkien's book The Hobbit.This story has many strengths. I believe the biggest is how Professor Tolkien paints a picture of the character's surroundings. An example is: \\"The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side.\\" Another strength is how he leads up to an action scene. An example of this is how he has the dwarves and Bilbo wandering around Mirkwood, chasing lights before they actually get to the spider colony where a battle follows. A third strength is how the author uses song to relate to scenes or stories written the book. An example is from the beginning of the story, when the dwarves are all gathered at Bilbo's house. During this time, Bilbo gets anxious about the dwarves no being gentle with his belongings. So Tolkien ha the dwarves sing a song about breaking his plates when they clean up after a meal. Evan though this is a great book, it does have some weaknesses. One weakness is how the book has more narration then dialogue. An example of this is how Tolkien focuses more upon Bilbo's thoughts during a conversation that he is having than the conversation itself.This book is similar to other fairy tale/medieval novels. This is because of the creatures, weapons, and technologies used. Also, they have castles and every \\"kingdom\\" is for the most part independent and uncaring of one another. It is different from these types of novels because this story is used more as a prologue to The Lord of the Rings than a full story in and of itself.I believe The Hobbit was written for all audiences. Although there can be big words and weird phrases, even young readers would enjoy this wonderful story. The genre of this book is fantasy. I know this because this book has many wonderful fictions characters and places in it. There is no other book in comparison to this one (with the exception of The Lord of the Rings).Ultimately, I believe The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read. I think this is because it's written very descriptively and the storyline is amazing. If you enjoy adventure and action, you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is incredible anyway, but the illustrations make it even more of a delight."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It must be over a decade since I last read this book- and nearly 35 years since I first read it. Yet, when I reread it this week I still became completely engrossed in it once again. Tolkien crafted a nearly perfect faery-tale here. In some ways it presages the Lord of the Rings, yet it is somehow different. It has a different feel to it. Had LOTR never been written this book would have still stood on its own as a classic.When I choose to reread this classic I searched out a copy of the edition that I first read in High School (a friend lent me his treasured copy.) This was the 1966 Houghton Mifflin hardcover edition- 25th printing. I had heard some negative reports on the quality of later editions and I knew that this one was first rate. It has Tolkien's own illustrations in it and on the dust cover. Plus, after over 40 years it has still physically held together- and probably shall for 40 more.So many books have copied this one over the years, but most of them are quickly forgotten while this one will last forever.

A mythical wizard, Gandalf, confronts Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit in the land of Bag End. Bilbo reluctantly joins Gandalf and his thirteen dwarves in a search full of obstacles for a lost treasure. This exciting and empowering journey is a page-turner for readers of all ages. All you need is a comfortable chair."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a tale of twelve dwarves and Bilbo Bagins, an unlikely Hobbit, and their quest to defeat a dragon and restore the rightful king, Thorin, to the dwarf city of Gondor. A once prominent city destroyed by the evil dragon Smaug. They travel far across Middle Earth in this dangerous journey but before they can defeat the dragon, they must overcome trolls, wolves, orcs, and some of the most wicked creatures imaginable. They often need the powerful wizard, Gandalf, for protection though sometimes he cannot help them and they must overcome these grave dangers themselves. The Hobbit is one of my all time favorite books. If you like The Lord of the Rings, then you will love this book. If you've never read The Lord of the Rings this is a great novel to enter the enchanting world of J.R.R. Tolkien. J.R.R. Tolkien is a writing genius, no other author can compare. No one can create a fantasy world like J.R.R. Tolkien can. He creates the Middle Earth, a land laden in fantasy, full of Elves, Wizards, Hobbits, Dwarves, Men and so much more. In this novel the magic comes alive and assists in the classic story of good versus evil. Yet the novel has a human aspect one that we can relate to as mere mortals such as dwarves, hobbits and men conquer evil. This is a timeless novel that will always be considered a classic. Why not read the prelude to The Lord of The Rings, one of the greatest hits of all time?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the main character in The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien. The story begins at his cozy, quiet home in Bag End; where he is invited to join 13 dwarves and a wizard, Gandalf, on quest. He is supposed to be the thief in their master plan. Along the way, Bilbo obtains a ring which turns the wearer invisible. He uses the ring many times to save the group from danger. Eventually they end up at their destination, Lonely Mountain, where a dragon guards Thorin's treasure. After the dragon dies, the people of a nearby town come to claim their share of the treasure, but Thorin refuses and locks them out. So the humans and elves besiege the mountain. Then goblins arrive and everyone joins to defeat the goblins.This is my favorite book that I have read so far. It took my imagination through a great adventure of magic and monsters. I liked it because I am a fairly big Dungeons & Dragons fan. Although I have never played the board game, I have played similar games since I was five. Though the games I play have come along way since then, it's the same concept.If you're the type of person that is fascinated by adventures, especially with magical creatures, objects, and places, this book has them. Maybe you enjoy Role Playing Games, or maybe you have just seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD, then this is defiantly a good book for you. It's also a fairly easy read; any person from an eleven year old kid to a middle-aged adult would enjoy this book very much. My last suggestion is that when you read this book, be prepared to not want to put it down, because it keeps you wondering, \\"What's going to happen next?\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a fantastic read for older children and adults. It takes you to a fantasy world (Middle Earth) and deeply involves the reader. The book may be complicated for younger children, but if read to them could be an awesome imaginative journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since this is a book I love, I have always felt I owed it to myself--or the fourteen-year-old me--to put in my two cents worth on a review. But you know, as I sit here, I cannot think of much to add to what's already been written. I mean...if someone has already read The Hobbit, then she's already got an opinion. And if someone hasn't yet had the honor of being among those who have journeyed along with Bilbo through Middle Earth, then odds are she's been exposed to enough \\"Hobbit 101\\" background information on this famous subject to the point where anything I say is merely added noise. And if by some rare chance a person who has neither read The Hobbit nor knows details of it should locate this review, then is it really fair of me to say anything at all to influence how this potential reader might feel, or alter what he or she might know? Funny, but I've never felt this hesitation about any other work, and perhaps that says something unexpected about the sacredness of this book to me even now, a dozen years after I first spent a wonderful Saturday in June 1993 reading it. Maybe writing this review has been more of a voyage of discovery about myself and my regard for J.R.R. Tolkien, that right-wing, nature loving Oxford professor, whose life's work made him an icon among those of the political left. So let me end here by saying this: The Hobbit is a work of wondrous scope that was huge to me at one time in my life, is still of more importance than I knew a moment ago, and if you are about to read it for the first time or the thousandth, I hope you enjoy it as much as I always have."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"'The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again' is a wonderful book by author J.R.R.

To those who are young and find it too long, too confusing, too dumb, etc., perhaps you should just stick with Stephen King until you mature a little. Ironic that this book, which was originally intended to be a &quot;kids&quot; book, misses with so many kids...Anyway, I'm 30 and I have been meaning to read Tolkein for years; I'm not a fantasy fanatic (at least not yet) and picked this up a week ago, and I loved it! It's so original (considering it was the first, after all), and I've had wonderful dreams of hobbits, wizards, etc. all week. Thank you J.R.R.'s spirit!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved The Hobbit. I found the fantasy land in which it takes place, Middle Earth, to be extremely well developed. The history of this land was so detailed that it was almost as if you were reading a non-fiction book, except that it was extremely exciting. There have even been a number of atlases published on Middle Earth that, I believe, can be found on Amazon.com. The characters in The Hobbit were very well put together. The only problem I had with this book, at the time that I read it for the first time, was that the characters in some of the parts seemed to all have the same name. You couldn't tell which one was which! Upon reading it a second time, I found that it was much easier to understand. This book was made for children, unlike its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. I loved the suspenseful parts of The Hobbit, such as when Bilbo enters a secret door in The Lonely Mountain to confront Smog for the first time. I really am a fantasy nut, so this review may be a bit of an exaggeration. If you don't like fantasy books, you should look at another review to get a different perspective."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"you will simply never understand. I first read The Hobbit when I was eight years old, and have read the book seven or eight times since. This book is not as powerfull as the trilogy that it preceeds, but is far better in its own way. As is well known the book was written for children, because of this alot of people try to insult the writers style. Like I said, they just don't understand. That is what attracts me to the book. The drifting, whimsical style that makes you feel like a child every time you read it. Some of the other reviews said that it was poorly written, that could not be farther from the truth. It takes an exeptional writer to tell a tale in such a captivating manner, and someone with at least minimal intelligence to recognize and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R.

Reading it then, I was enthralled by the adventure and the action and the strange creatures. I couldn't help but wish I had a magical ring too as a child.I'm older now, and enjoy the Hobbit for the messages and the characters, as well as the excitement and fantasy. And, much to my surprise, I find it a much faster read than the Lord of the Rings. Like a magical fable, it simply flows from chapter to chapter until it reaches a magical completion.The Hobbit is much more lighthearted than its successor trilogy, and well-suited to children of all ages. All that is required is a love of fantasy and escape that's missing in today's world. And I can think of no better world to escape to than the realm of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was boasting with the great imagination of J.R.R Tolkein. About 60 years before the lord of the seires Bilbo Gandlaf and a gang of Dwarfs travel through the misty moantians to get to a treasure stolen from the Dwarfs. As the gang travels through the land they meet tons of epic characters (elfs dwarfs goblins trolls). Tolkein could have written more voilence like its sequel Lord of the Rings. Overall it was a epic classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Though I grew up reading fantasy, playing Lone Wolf books and sometimes joining an AD&D game, I had never read any of Tolkien's works until recently. The Hobbit sat on my bookshelf for seven years because I couldn't get past the first chapter. Now I breezed through it, soaking in the rich world of Tolkien's imagination and discovering where most modern fantasy has its roots. Though I've seen the first two Lord of the Rings movies, I'm now going to get and read those books and anything else JRR Tolkien wrote in the way of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a sophomore in high school when I first read this book.

This audio adaptaption is not as strong as the BBC The Lord of the Rings. I especially prefer the LotR's Gandalf, and no one can beat Ian Holm as Frodo. Nevertheless, the BBC Hobbit is entertaining and delightful. After aquiring my own copy and listening to it numerous times in the car, etc., I bought a copy for my niece and nephew, and they loved it too. It is abridged, and has minor changes to the actual story. But overall, I thought it was pretty good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit. Now, the reader of this might be questioning the validity of this statement, however, in every case a new \\"empire\\" rises to introduce something so revolutionary that it shakes the foundation of the Planet itself. Understandably, overthrowing tyranny, introducing governments for the people, and building understanding for all that is good in the face of evil mark monumental events in history. Unlike previously mentioned events, The Hobbit is the first book to use fantasy to capture interest in the struggle to overcome pure evil from an underdog. The Hobbit is the world's first view at a self-help book that uses a magical world created by J.R.R. Tolkein to illustrate overcoming adverse odds to learn about the power of the mind and breaking out of the ordinary: in short, a must read.When reading The Hobbit there are a few key things to remember. A Hobbit is a small person, only about three to four feet in height, with a taste for beer and food, a life without adventure, and normality. Bilbo Baggins represents the boring life of a Hobbit, constantly in uniform behavior with which he is expected to partake in. However, surrounding the land of the Shire, home to Hobbits, lies an immense world filled with goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, dragons, and other fantastic creatures eager to be explored. Bilbo Baggins is the book's main character and symbol for taking on the unordinary and challenges contemporary theology. Living in Hobbiton, there are key differences between men and Hobbits, all of which Bilbo represents. Hobbits are only about half the size of regular humans, have hairy feet because they do not wear shoes, and are foremost opposed to taking up adventures, much rather preferring to Garden or drink tea. Bilbo's quest into adventure begins with the introduction of Gandalf, the Grey Wizard, and 13 dwarves in search of a \`burglar' to accompany them on a mission to hunt out the marauding dragon Smaug, who took their gold and hordes it on Lonely Mountain. Surprised to find himself involved in such a quest, unbecoming of a Hobbit, Bilbo accepts the introduction to the \`unexpected party' and heads out of his comfort to the land of Middle Earth.While on his quest, Bilbo learns about relying on others, himself, and bravery. Bilbo partakes in fighting goblins, tricking trolls, riding upon eagles, and saving his entire band from killer, giant spiders. The themes of the novel and motifs are not very well exhibited, except through Bilbo's narration and the chapter titles, such as \\"out of the frying pan, into the fire\\". Through the chapter titles, and Bilbo's personal queries into fighting off creatures unknown in his homeland, the Shire, Bilbo learns the most about himself and displays the book's message: if faced with adversity and doubt, anyone can do anything if they just try and push through the comfort boundaries. Overall, The Hobbit is a wonderful book because it introduces things children and adults can come to enjoy in fantasy, with real world, mature lessons about life that connect to a broad range of readers. Like the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, and Roman Empire, The Hobbit teaches its followers to rise up against the tyranny of doubt and fight for anything previously linked to doubt, a true historical masterpiece of the human spirit and escape to a world of Fantasy.BY SEAN CAMPERSON (NOT CYNDIE CAMPERSON)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit.

Our protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, finds himself drafted most unwillingly into the role of burgler for a band of dwarves who seek to reclaim the treasure stolen from their ancestors by the dragon Smaug. But before they can accomplish this goal, they must survive the journey to the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug dwells. The trip is long and dangeous, and Bilbo proves his worth along the way.While this book doesn't have the deep and powerful themes of the subsequent trilogy, it still provides a cautionary story about the dangers of greed, and of unintended consequences. Bilbo's companions allow their greed to cloud their judgement (as it does many others along the way), and while they only intended to reclaim what they considered rightfully theirs, their actions provoke the dragon into attacking a nearby town, with potentially disasterous consequences. Only the arrival of a common foe prevents these natural allies from fighting among themselves.An enjoyable fantasy tale, with a simple message, this story is still a classic because it sets the stage for the powerful battle between good and evil in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book \\"you read before bed\\". I would recommend this for ages 10+. You could also say that there are three different climaxes, in the beginning, middle, and end, so this is a long, detailed book. The plot is detailed and is a classic example of fantasy literature. The book starts at the house of Bilbo Bagins, which is in a place where houses are built in hills and the people are very short or hobbits. His peaceful life is shattered by a party of dwarves and a wizard who takes Bilbo on a adventure through the Misty Mountains: with cold winters and hordes of evil goblins, Mirkwood: a forest where giant spiders and bloodthirsty elves live, and last, the Lonely Mountain, where a great treasure is guarded by the dangerous dragon, Smaug. Soon a series of events lead to the ultimate treasure hunt for an unsuspecting Bilbo Bagins. But as interesting as the settings are, it is the characters that bring the reader inside the story.One of the main characters is Bilbo Bagins. Bilbo is short so he is shy and wants to look big at times, yet he is shy in most other scenes. Gandalf is the wizard of the party and is the wisest. He saves the party many times and is a great negotiator. Thorin and the many other dwarves are the others in the party. They are seen as a bit short, fat, but strong warriors. Thorin and the other dwarves love the adventure and each one has unique traits that give the story a variety. Many of these characters bring the reader inside the story, and combined with the setting makes The Hobbit a classic fantasy.All in the fun, classic fantasy book \\"you read before bed\\" The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A good read that would appeal to young and old alike.The world of Tolkien is a must for all travellers on their journey through life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the very book that captured my imagination as a 8 year old and still holds on to the title as my all time favourite!

Took about a week to read and i am now reading the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit- By J.R.R. TolkienThe Hobbit is a very good and quite easy read. It is not very difficult to read because of the vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. Although in some areas it is a little difficult because the names of the dwarfs get confusing. The characters are explained very well and by the end of the book it really seems like you have met the characters. All except for Gandalf. Gandalf is a little less explained than the other characters, all of the other characters have a little backstory on how they came to be in the story. Although the author gives a brief physical description of Gandalf, Gandalf's personality or non-physical characteristics are unknown. I really like J.R.R. Tolkien's writing style because in one paragraph he is telling the story of what is happening and the next paragraph he may be talking directly to the reader which I thought was very interesting. My favorite character has to be Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is my favorite character because he is the character that the reader gets to know the most. Another reason why Bilbo is my favorite character is because he is an unsuspecting, \\"normal\\" hobbit when Gandalf came along and changed his life. I think what the author was trying to say through this book, was that life can change very quickly so enjoy what you have. You never know when the next wizard will come along and tell you that you that you are going on a quest. One of my favorite moments of the book was the Golem chapter, or chapter five. This is one of my favorite moments in the book because it really sets the entire story up and for the Lord of the Rings books. This is the scene when Bilbo picks up the ring that can make him invisible. I also really like the author's word choice and how he forms sentences that flow and transition into one another. I also think that the names of the places and people are very interesting. I thought that it was very inspiring that he made up his own language for the ruins. One thing that I didn't like about this book was that the names got very confusing and I kept having to flip back to figure out who was talking, what race the thing that was talking was, and what the relationship between the speaker and Bilbo. Another thing I didn't like about this book was how some of the characters were not explained as thoroughly as the others. \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\\" This quote sticks out in my mind because it is a key describer, hook, and introducing sentence to the entire story.

Bilbo Baggins isn't exactly prepared to meet evil goblins, carnivorous wolves, scary trolls, and definitely not a dragon. I would strongly recommend this book who like the Lord of the Rings series and the Percy Jackson series because this book will help you extended your knowledge about mythical creatures. I also would suggest this book for people who like to read about fantasy and adventure.

Tolkien's book, The Hobbit, is the exciting beginning to the story of the Lord of the Rings, his greatest work. Even though this book was written about thirty years ago, it is still considered one of the best fantasy books of all time.This book tells the story of a hobit named Bilbo, who is swept up into an adventure when a wizard, Gandalf, and a group of dwarves show up at his house with a request. The dwarves are going on a journey back to their home in the Misty Mountains that has been taken over by a dragon named Smaug. Bilbo's role in this journey is to steal the gold held in the mountain by the dragon for the dwarves, and in return he would receive a share of the reward.Along the way, Bilbo discovers a ring with magical powers. This ring is the reason for the conflicts found in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The ring has the power to make whoever is wearing it invisible and have a longer life. This ring gives Bilbo the strength and courage he needs to survive the adventure and help his friends.This book is a good choice for anyone who has seen and liked the Lord of the Rings movie or enjoys fantasy novels of adventure. The Hobbit gives you a clear beginning to where the Lord of the Rings trilogy starts, but you can understand the trilogy without reading the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a major Lord of the Rings fan and my favorite one is the Hobbit.Tolkien did an execlent job of writeing this book.

I had a hard time putting it down. The story of a well respected hobbit and his 13 companion's travel tells not only about each character but their surroundings as they continue with their journey. The story teaches that not everything is at it seems, and friendship is much more important to keep then even the greatest riches, also it shows that if you are determined then you will succeed. Tolkien's bed time story to his chidren is a novel every adult should read. There isn't much you could do to the book to make it better, and if you did it wouldn't be the same. Includes a map of the adventurer's travels with as much detail and intrest as the story itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"AWESOME book!!

It is the 2nd of the series viewed in chronological series:- The Silmarilion- The Hobbit- The Fellowship of the Ring- The Two Towers- The Return of the KingIt is the pivotal book in this series. The Silmarillion describes the ancient history of Middle Earth that provides the introduction.The last three books present the consequences of the finding of The Ring of Power.The Hobbit describes the events that led to the finding of this ring. It is tightly plotted and action flows smoothly and entertainingly. The book is full of wonderful poems and rhymes that everyone uses from the heroes to the villains.

I purchased this hardbound edition of The Hobbit so as to enjoy the story again in a more desirable format. I am very pleased with the quality of the book binding, paper, and the inclusion of many of Tolkein's own drawings that are to be found in the appropriate places throughout."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first picked up this book at the bookstore, with my parents, I didn't know what to expect. I decided to get The Hobbit because of its immense popularity. Being 7 years old at the time, this was one of my first 300+ page chapter books. The introduction was simple enough: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins was sitting lazily outside his hobbit hole, with a long pipe, when the wizard, Gandalf, came by. Our first exposure to Gandalf is quite a bit different however. \\"Gandalf came by. Galdalf! If you heard only a quarter of what I heard about him, and I have only heard very little of what there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.\\" To the reader, Bilbo Baggins seemed the lazy type -- content with his quiet life, baking seedcakes, smoking pipes, and living in his father's enormous hobbit hole. One must question Gandalf's motives for choosing such a person to go on a daunting quest. The \\"daunting quest\\" is helping 13 dwarves, including the great Thorin Oakensheid, recapture their gold from the dragon, Smaug. Smaug smashed down on the merry village of Dale, utterly destroying the village itself, eating up all its inhabitants, and (to add insult to injury) taking all of the gold and moving it into the Lonely Mountain. Thorin himself was the grandson of The King Under the Mountain, and so was even more outraged at this attack. After eating most of his food, the dwarves sang a song, which made Bilbo feel many adventurous things. Hobbits do not normally even appreciate this type of music. Bilbo must use all of the qualities he never knew he had (i.e., bravery, wisdom, ingenuity, and unselfishness). Along the way, a major part of the book takes place in Bilbo's legendary meeting with Gollum, a peculiar underground creature who calls himself \\"My Precious\\". Here Bilbo picks up a magic ring that gives the wearer the power of invisibility. Now, to fully understand the curiousness of a hobbit going on an adventure, you may want to know details about them. Hobbits are half the height of humans, love to eat, dress in bright colors such as green and yellow, live in holes in the ground, and hate adventures or anything that is unpredictable. The Tooks are an exception to this, and are the unpopular relations of the Bagginses. This is why Bilbo has his \\"Tookish\\" side. Another amazing part is Bilbo's memorable confrontation with Smaug. I would recommend this book for all ages. As this was also the intended age, since J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book for his children (unlike the darker, yet still fabulous Lord of the Rings). And many other children will probably also enjoy this book. Lastly, I have to say that my soft cover edition of The Hobbit has lasted four years, an amazing feat for a soft cover book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Normally this wouldn't have made my reading list... J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: or There and Back Again. I was well aware of Tolkien's books, but I wrote them off because \\"I don't do fantasy.\\" Elfs, dwarfs, hobbits... just not my thing. But I'm also a techno-geek, and as such the Lord of the Rings books and movies are required in order to maintain your geek cred membership card. I 'fessed up on Twitter that I hadn't read any of them, and immediately was pilloried by my peers... Then I was subjected to the debate as to whether Hobbit or LOTR should be read first. My peers even went so far as to send me BOTH of them via mail (thank you, ladies). Since I had both at the same time, I decided to start with Hobbit.Having explained the backstory as to *why* I read this, the question becomes did I enjoy this. And the answer is yes, I enjoyed it very much. Bilbo Baggins was quite human in his personality, and I could relate to his struggle between wanting to be left alone vs. living up to the expectations that others had of him. Watching him go from a timid hobbit afraid to do much of anything to a leader able to stand up to anything others could throw at him was something you could definitely learn from. And of course, his traveling companions mirrored much of society... totally behind you when you have something they want, but also ready to throw you under the bus moments later if fortunes turn.My friends didn't tell me until after I was done that this is technically considered a \\"children's\\" book. Could have fooled me. :) I enjoyed it, and it was probably the best way to get my mind wrapped around the LOTR concepts and imagery (since it's not a normal genre for me). We'll see how well I fare when I get to the \\"adult\\" version of the stories.

I have to say that this book may be up with some of my favorite books.I was introduced to this book from my father. I had to pick a book for my 10th grade reading project, and my dad brought up \\"The Hobbit\\". He said that when he was growing up, \\"The Hobbit\\" was one of his favorite books, so I decided to give it a try. It was worth it.What I truly like about the book is that there is almost always something going on. You never find yourself bored with it or wishing that the characters would be more exciting. I could not find a truly dull moment in the book. I love Bilbo's evolution as a character throughout the story. I don't think that I found anything that I didn't like about this book.If I had to recommend this book to someone, it would be to anyone who enjoys a true adventure. There are times in the book that you get sucked into the adventure and don't want to put the book down.

It is a must-read for any fantasy/adventure lover."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"No, this book isn't \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any of the volumes in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It's just different. Less serious, for sure. And for me, that meant a much more enjoyable experience. This is a book that reads like an extended fairytale, with all the associated delights, while the LOTR books read like a chronicle of war. Both good, but you have to pick your poison. Humor plays a huge part in this story, where it plays only an ocassional part in the later Tolkien volumes ... As for the story, it's engaging from the beginning, and because it's earlier Tolkien, it is not burdened by any undue pressure of having to produce something better soon: in fact, a lot of it was just notes Tolkien read out loud to his kid before bed. When he went to compile it, he had to think back to how the tale went. Bedtime stories, in other words, which I think adds to its charm.The chapters are mostly fun, and wholly unpredictable; I loved finding out what happened next, and rarely saw it coming.Some negative points involve the \\"songs\\"; just as in the LOTR volumes, personally, I could have done without. Tolkien is no poet.Some unforgettable scenes here, and most will linger in your memory, like the image of the group of adventurers lingering for weeks (months? years?) near the dragon's lair, unable to figure a way inside. Or the \\"Invisible Bilbo\\" chapter. Haunting stuff.Then there are the precursors: the introduction of Gollum, the Ring of Invisibility (which was not the One Ring at first), and Gandalf, among other things.All in all, not only one of the best books-for-children I've read, but one of the best books period.And the title of the new movie should be \\"The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again,\\" stupid Hollywood people.

It will be great prep for the upcoming Hobbit film releases!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After being given the Hobbit as a ten year old,i can say it singlehandedly kindled my love for reading. Eleven years later, I've read this book over twenty times, and still don't get tired of it. If you enjoy fantasy AT ALL and havent read the Hobbit you must give this book a chance."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you love reading, then good for you. Give yourself a pat on the back, and a wink in the mirror, there are not enough of us left in the world. But book worms beware, skip the reading this time and listen to The Hobbit as narrated by Rob Inglis. Listen as Gollum, Gandalf, Thorin, the house of the elves, the mountains come to life. Inglis even sings the many Middlearth folk songs that appear only as words in the book, folling JRR Tolkien's music but even having to create some of the tunes himself. As a twenty year old college student I remember this book fondly in particular as it was played in the car on road trips. I can only wait until I have my own family to read this book aloud to, but I will treasure and play this for the rest of my life. If you want to hear The Hobbit in a fresh and truly enjoyable way, don't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"To make it clear I want to say that my three stars are only for the kindle edition maps.I like maps when I read a book that involves traveling, but unfortunately in the kindle edition the use of the maps for The Hobbit is not good!You can not make it larger and using the iPad you can not see it from the wright side.It always turns and is too small.When I tried to make it larger it just got blured.It is my only complain.I am otherwise a total admirer of J.R.R.Tolkien's books since 1991 and I have them in various editions.I love his history,because I see his stories as the History Of Middle Earth.I have read his books over and over again and I will read them many times more.They are my books for me.I usually read them when I feel stressed and I want to get away but cannot travel at the time.They take my mind off things."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book shows just how versatile Tolkien was. The written style is completely different from TLOTRs, although just as good. Read much, much easier than TLOTRs, it is a great kid's book-to kindle that little reader's flame-and perfect for Tolkien fans. It gives you a prelude to Bilbo's story before Frodo, and how he got the Ring. Would most definitely recommend it to any person of any reading level."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A truly enchanting tale which spurred an entire fantasy revival you can't say no this book. It is well written and easily read by all ages. Give it a chance I am sure you will love it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Inglis does a fantastic job in performing the roles of all of the characters in this unabridged audiobook. His voice differentiations are fantastic and this is definitely one of the best audiobooks I've listened to. He makes it a real delight to hear, as you can clearly imagine the characters interacting with each other in this manner as they all sound quite distinct.So, being the unabridged version of The Hobbit, this contains the entire story from cover-to-cover, nothing missing. I feel compelled to mention that the tracks are not sorted by chapters. Since I first heard this version on cassette, it was never a big deal for me, but some people might be annoyed by it.I don't really need to mention that I think The Hobbit is a great book/story, but it really deserves a-lot of credit just in terms of a literary piece. It's one of those works that either really keeps you enthralled or bores you. It's extremely well written and has a great flow to it that really suits the audiobook format. A magnificent story with one of the best story tellers out there reading it to you. This is something I definitely recommend you own, if you enjoyed the book. It's certainly a tale worth being heard."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First let me explain a few things: I teach high school English and 7th/8th grade Lang Arts in a small school. We read the book for both my language classes.It was coming down to the end of the school year and we had one more 'classic' to get through. I thought the audio book would bring the story to life more since the guy that reads it has a different voice for each character. I had a tough time getting the kids into the story. The reading-guy reads a tad slower than I expected and he sings every song. Some songs are rather drawn out and kind of cheesy so we would fast forward through those parts. It wasn't until the 4th chapter when I made the students read it themselves that they finally began to get into the story. By Ch 5 when Gollum comes into the picture they were more hooked. (Some, sadly, I was never able to convince that it was a good story.)All in all, the CD experience was okay. 1) I didn't have to read it myself, 2) at least the kids that didn't read it got pieces of the story in class, and 3) it kept us going because the kids liked not \\"doing work\\" per say in class those weeks.It was definitely an experience most had not had (hearing an audiobook). Bonus! I learned that a few of the students are better \\"readers\\" by listening to audiobooks! Perhaps I will try it again in the future for those with learning difficulties such as dyslexia, ADD, and dysgraphia. Audiobooks are the way to go with those and I had all 3 LDs in my classrooms this year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a favorite from childhood to now.

Although the two stories were written as to be stand alone stories, they need to be read by any reader of Hobbit Lore. The fantastic world of the Middle Earth is so like our own world, yet much is not the same, as in the animals and the people inhabiting Middle Earth. The spirit of being the best person is alive in both stories.

I read this book when I was 11 and still have not found a fantasy story to beat it. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, ( the other three books that go with this one) are just as good. Don't pick up another book untill you've checked this book out. Watch the movie of it too.

It tells the tale of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is taken away from his cozy hobbit-hole by a band of dwarves led by Thorin Oakinshield and Bilbo's friend the wizard Gandalf on an adventure to reclaim the dwarves' hord of treasure. The treasure had been stolen from the dwarves by the dragon Smaug. He guards the treasure ever so carefully in the dwarves' once glorious kingdom. Bilbo is appointed as the &quot;burglar&quot;. As the company travels towards the Lonely Mountain, they face the constant threat of orcs, trolls, giant spiders, and ultimately, the dragon they seek to slay, to name a few.I first got this book when I was nine years old for my birthday.Ever since I've read it, I have been enchanted.

You won't be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is well documented that J.R.R. Tolkien despised allegory. Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R. R. Tolkien is a great book. In the book a hobbit is joined by thirteen dwarves and a wizard. They go on many adventures and unfortunately they run into a few misfortunes, but someone always saves them from the trouble. On the way through their adventure they meet some mean characters. Goblins, wargs, spiders and huge stone giants are some of the mean creatures that they meet up with. There are many surprises in this book. At the end of the book there is a very cool thing that happens.I think that this is a good book. I enjoyed reading it very much some days I couldn't even put the book down. This book is probably my favorite book I've ever read. I would give this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read \\"The Hobbit\\" a number of years ago. When the first movie of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was about to be released as a movie, I decided to re-aquaint myself with Bilbo and Gandalf. It is a good book to introduce you to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" In it you learn how Bilbo comes in possession of the ringThe plot gives you a feel for the world and characters that will take you into the \\"Rings\\" trilogy. Hobbit is full of action and adventure. There are a few times when you experiance author's intrusion. It didn't bother me, and durning those times I pictured Tolkien sitting and smoking his pipe while he told the story. I think the author was a master story teller of enchanting tales."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A father with his middle school son asked me recently what I thought of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie. I gave my two thumbs up and asked if they have ever read Tolkein. They hadn't. Our local church library had copies of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I encouraged them to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; aloud before entering &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I have read most of Tolkein's fiction aloud to my sons, including our own hardback 50th Anniversary edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Simarillion&quot;, and several other works as well. Tolkein reads well. Several years ago, we unplugged our TV and started regularly reading to our kids. This has been one of the best parenting decisions we've ever made! Turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids. If you've taken them to see &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (I would advise children over the age of 10), then read Tolkein to them. Your children's imagination sparked by Tolkein's genius descriptive writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful Middle Earth than the blockbuster movie was able to create. Encourage their imagination to fill the big screen of their minds with Tolkein's epic tale, beginning with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. This marvelous tale has always been my favorite adventure story.For two books with many more creative ideas for parents, look into &quot;The Family Cloister&quot; and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot;, both by David Robinson and available on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you've never smelled cinnamon rolls on a frosty morning or have never lain in bed on the sleeping porch inhaling the perfume of night-blooming jasmine or if you've never read The Hobbit then you do not know the majesty of imagination.Do not be fooled! Though ostensibly a children's book there is a veil of darkness about it that only adults or precocious children can appreciate. Tolkien himself admitted adding the trappings of a child's fantasy to what was a basically dark and forboding story for fear of being laughed at for producing an adult fantasy. The Hobbit is a sweet, dark, and intoxicating work of fantasy that enrobes the reader in a parallel world of mythical events and beings that closely echo the themes of life necessary to adulthood. The Hobbit warns of power used for material gain and the horrors of greed and waste but also teaches the value of being true to one's self and friends. That The Hobbit succeeds so transcendently well that the reader barely realizes he or she has been reading a modern parable stands as a testament to the genius of Tolkien and his sheer love of the English language.When Tolkien began writing Lord of the Rings years later the early chapters were of a tone similar to The Hobbit yet, as he progressed, the tone changed to a more adult and complex use of language as the story began to progress. Tolkien fans say that The Hobbit is to be read as a child and Lord of the Rings to be read as an adolescent. I whole-heartedly agree. These books are life as we live it and The Hobbit is an outstanding introduction to the lessons, bitter, enobling, and ultimately wisening, that we must all learn or become but shadows of what we have the potential to be.I'm sure you know there is a wizard, a dragon, eagles, and furry-footed Hobbits, but there are also fearsome monsters, werebears, haughty elves, greedy humans, and even greedier dwarves. Evil in The Hobbit doesn't disappear when dear Mr. Baggins goes home to petty and avaracious relatives thinking him dead and auctioning off his home and household goods. And that is the greatest triumph of the book as I see it. For evil in Tolkien's world is never wholly put away but is instead resisted and overcome with the lessons of life gained in the struggle. All of us have our moments of dread, fear, and temptation. Listen carefully to Tolkien's quiet but enduring message and you will never be alone no matter what life gives you.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; isn't just a book you give your children to read, it's a lesson in the labors of life in the adult world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a tale of gold, dwarves, an evil dragon, hobbits and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, it is amazingly still enjoyable. The style that J.R.R. Tolkien uses to write this book is so lively that it makes the readers feel like they are part of the adventure walking along side Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the dwarves .Tolkien crafts an interesting world inhabited by Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits like peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and traveling to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they could.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit. He has lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with the company of a clan of dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair but he gradually becomes, in many ways, the leader of their troop.When a person starts this book, it will be very hard for them to put it down until they have finished it. This is because Tolkien presents his characters with such a charisma that it makes the readers want to delve deeper into the story to find out what happens next to the adventurers. He also presents such seemingly insurmountable obstacles that those that have been keeping up with the situations will have to read on to find out how the characters escape this one.The style is easy to follow and the story is straight forward with some twists. The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness.No matter how many times someone reads it, it will never be enough. There will always be things that were missed and caught the next time around, which is what makes THE HOBBIT such a great story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know J.R.R. Tolkien is mostly known for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but this book is a masterpiece in itself!! It is full of adventures, magical beings and knowledge. Professor Tolkein wrote it for his kids, and you can feel the love that went into creating this story as you read.I have read it twice, once when I was 13, and now as an adult, and I really do feel like this is a book for all ages! Both parents and kids will enjoy reading this, especially if it is together.The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a very unambitious, quiet and serious hobbit, who embarks on a very long, dangerous and unexpected adventure with a company of dwarves and a wizard. Along the way they encounter trolls, abandoned woods, elves, goblins, a dragon, a riddle loving monster called Gollum, giant spiders, underground passages, mountains and more!In the end, Bilbo Baggins discovers that he is capable of a lot more than what he thought he was, and discovers the gift of friendship, loyalty , laughter and song!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful story.You will love the characters and the adventures that they have.

Even years later, this book is delightful. It's such a pleasure to follow Bilbo and the dwarves to the Lonely Mountain, and it's a pleasure to read some of the other reviewers, kids who've read the story over and over like I did. This is a great edition, the Alan Lee drawings and paintings are gorgeous, and he appeals to the Tolkien-phile with incredible attention to the details of the story. Two quibbles: one map is in the beginning of the book and the other at the end - how odd, it keeps the reader flipping back and forth. Why not just put them both up front together. Second, some pages fell out of my new book even before I'd read them. That's a bit disappointing when you've paid a bit more for the fancy illustrated hardcover volume."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THE HOBBIT is a must-read for everyone who loves fantasy and adventure in a novel. In it, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit (a good natured creature about half the height of humans) sets out on an adventure with a band of 13 dwarves and a wizard. This is a journey to regain the treasure stolen from the dwarves by a dragon. In it, Bilbo comes across elves, evil goblins, angry wolves, and much more. In the end, when they finally reach the dragon, surprising events occur that put a twist in the well-thought-out plot. The book is described so well you feel as if you are part of the adventure. You also get to know Bilbo and his friends as if you really met them. As a delightful prelude to Tolkien's famous trilogy THE LORD OF THE RINGS, it can be enjoyed by both adults and older children.

My next purchase will be the Lord of the Rings collector's edition...then my library will be fully upgraded!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's hard to write a review about a classic like The Hobbit. You can't help but be awed by the history and literary significance of the books (and I include both The Hobbit and the trilogy that follows when I say this) upon which so much of epic fantasy literature is now based. Everything from the heroes quest to the world building, from the wizards and dragons to the goblins and elves scream fantasy to you and you can't help but realize that this was one of the first, and that definitely gives you pause and something to think about.Everyone knows the story of Bilbo Baggins. The poor Hobbit gets caught up in a quest that he embarks on with a little help from a wizard (Gandalf) and the adventures that unfold as this hired burglar journeys with thirteen dwarves to face a dragon that has conquered their home. Though initially reluctant and timid, Bilbo comes into his own as he journeys with the dwarves facing trolls, goblins, whargs, spiders, elves and more on the way to facing the evil dragon Smaug.With the help of his sword Sting and a ring that he picks up in Gollum's cave he soon becomes a formidable hobbit indeed, and also soon finds that the timid hobbit from under the hill will end up deciding the fate of an epic battle as five armies come to meet on the the slopes of the Lonely Mountain.I loved this book! The details, the storytelling, the narrators voice, the songs, all of it was just so readable and enjoyable and a very comforting read to snuggle up with on a cold January day.

He goes through caves, meets humans and has a close call with a dragon called Smaug.The book is a fun fantasy adventure story with a great deal of depth to the world it takes place in.

Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.\\"Growing up in the back country, I frequently slipped away in the afternoons to hold tadpoles in my hands at the pond or to run through the woods and crawl into the hollow beneath an ancient and dead tree, pretending I was hiding from giant birds, the wind from whose wings might have knocked over my parents' house. Or I would climb the hill and look out on the peaks of the Cascades, snowy and massive against the sky. What child has not dreamed of going somewhere far over the misty mountains cold?And what adult has not experienced brief moments of nostalgia and wonder -- of considering whether it might, after all, not be a good idea to dash from one's house or one's office without hat or handkerchief, to go slay some dragon or find a treasure? And what adult had not learned, as Bilbo does, the high cost of an adventure not taken and the high cost of an adventure pursued? Or come home at the end of a long journey or a fierce project to realize, as if for the first time, just how sweet a thing home can be?More than just a children's book, The Hobbit takes us \\"there and back again,\\" into the adventure we long for and back again to our own hearth only after we've been provoked to reconsider both the costs and the rewards of going across the Water, of stepping outside one's home onto roads whose end we can't see.It's a beautiful novel.Also, the dragon is quite good.Dragons in stories don't often live up to our expectations, except perhaps in Pern. But this one is quite satisfying.If you haven't read this before, you're in for a treat. If you have, drop a comment below and celebrate with me. This book has quite a venerable age now! Yet it still feels young, and you might feel young reading it, and then perhaps older and wiser at the end. Or so I think; I am going to go re-read it now and find out. It has been a while for me.Stant Litore"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was worried about the violent scenes prior to deciding to read this to my six year old, but read some reviewers with similar situations and decided to go for it since 1) good or bad my six year old is already exposed to alot of violence by just seeing/hearing the evening news in the background while he is playing, and playing video games, and 2) the movie is coming out in December 2012, and I really wanted my child to experience the book, maybe even twice, before seeing the movie (although I am going to consider this whole topic again in December since I imagine it will get a pg-13 rating).Anyway, it was a really good experience over the two weeks that it took to get through the book, although my child did have one spider nightmare. And there was a little boredom with the denoument, which is the quiet relaxed winding down of the book plot after the dramatic climax, which I think is one of the most satisfying parts of reading The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings but which my child did not yet appreciate.The only parts that I skipped were the many references to smoking pipe tobacco, which is portrayed as a positive pastime. I am not telling anyone what they should or should not do, it is just that in my family my spouse is trying, so far unsuccessfully to quit, I am an ex-smoker and my six year old is starting to pick up on the anti-smoking campaign, and saying such things as \\"smoking makes you sick.\\" I am beginning to open up a conversation about personal choice and trying to be a good person yourself and not judge other people but I just did not want to deal with the topic at the 9 pm reading time with a sleepy six year old.

This semester in my English 250 class, we read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy and watched the motion pictures, all to get a better understanding of the amazing imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien.After reading these books, i found that the Hobbit was truly my favorite. The Hobbit was written for the entertainment and pleasure of children, and it seemed to do just that. It is full of adventure, action, and imagination. It is easy to follow and very hard to put down once your expedition. With the introduction of the quiet and timid hobbit named Bilbo, and a very wise old wizard Called Gandalf, you can start your journey to a very distant land that contains glory and treasure.Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys a peaceful and pastoral life, finds his house invaded by thirteen dwarfs, all looking for their fourteenth member that will accompany them on their way to reclaim Lonely Mountain. Once they have reached their destination, they must take back their old home and treasures from the evil clutches of a mighty dragon, who goes by the name of Smaug.On the journey, Bilbo and the dwarves encounter all sorts of villains and obstacles. They do not traveled very far when they stumble upon a group of trolls. A combination of Gandalf's wizardry and Bilbo's burglary land the group out of harm's way, enabling them to continue on their way towards the treasure. This is not the only time you get to meet all the wonderful new creatures within the land of Middle Earth. On their way, Bilbo and his companions meet a kingdom of wood elves, a nest of giant spiders, a man who is also an ancient bear, and a strange, devious creature by the name of Gollum. Tolkien sure has a way with words in this book as he describes all of the new places and creatures that his characters encounter.Throughout the entire book, Bilbo and his accomplices find many different problems to over come and people to befriend. The soon-to-premiere film that is to be based on the Hobbit, should be very interesting. The animation that was made earlier to reenact the book lacked in profession, and by making the book into a movie, you will be able to better understand the novel and be closer to the adventure then you could have thought.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was very detailed and interesting, but not quite the reading material for children, or people with short attention spans. The movies help the reader visualize the new characters and lands that the books contains. The movies also, in my opinion, are much better then the books, because they keep you inthralled. The books are much too tedious and long for my liking, while the movies cover the main points and give you the adventure and action in a way that everyone can experience.In conclusion, the Hobbit is the only book worth reading, and if you are interested in learning about the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you should just watch the movies and save yourself a lot of time and headache."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son really enjoyed listening to this book on cd. He had listened to the trilogy the Lord of The Rings and I am glad he was able to listen to the story that helped bring roots and meanings to many of the charaters for the Lord of the Rings. I read this book in my 20s and found it a bit difficult to get through so I loved the idea of book on cd for him. My daughter had listened to this several years ago from the library. She had a bit more of a difficult time than my son did, I think because she had not heard or read Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What could I say that has not be said alredy about this beautiful book?The story is funny, the writing beautiful and this particular edition really nice.I enjoyed every single page, and so fantasy tales lovers will."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Mr Tolkien's first fantastic book in the hobbit saga [countinued in the lord of the rings] is so entertaining and great it should be a crime. The story follows one Bilbo Baggins in his wonderfull adventure. He is enterrupted from his normal life by some Dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf who want him to go with them to battle a dragon named Smaug. He eventually agrees and follows them on thier journey to the Dwarves to the moutain they once called home before the dragon lived there. On the way Bilbo encounters goblins, spiders, orcs, wolves, and even a former hobbit himself in Gollum. It's in this meeting Bilbo finds what would later become the most important thing in Middle Earth, THE RING.In a match of wits Bilbo out smarts Gollum and escapes from his clutches. Funny enough the thing that warned him of gollum was a sword he had found earlier that glows when things lurk about. Yet after his escape a reuniting with the others only leads to an attack from giant spiders, and being help captive by some elves. But after he manages to get out of those little binds he must now face Smaug.After entering threw a secret passage he usses the ring to hide from the dragon, which eventually leads to the dragon attacking the town down below untill he is hit with an arrow in a weak spot and killed. Things are over right, wrong now comes a war of giagantic proportions. Humans, dwarves, goblins, wolves, and birds all end up in the fight. and after it is all said and done Bilbo returnes home, RING included."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think that The Hobbit was a great book! JRR Tolkien does a great job at keeping the plot moving and keeping the reader's attention. I liked how he constantly threw in unexpected events. For instance, when I thought that the book had come to an end, he added an extra part which kept me reading. I also liked how he wrote in some of his own comments about what Bilbo Baggins (the main character) felt and how he took the time to describe each and every one of the many dwarves one by one.One of my favorite characters in the book was Gandalf the Wizard. JRR Tolkien does a great job of describing Gandalf as wise, trustworthy, and powerful. He was the \\"glue\\" that held the group together and was always giving them advice and helping them get out of tight spots.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and science fiction. It tells a lot about what happened before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'd read the Lord of the Rings books before this one and after I'd read The Hobbit, I thought that it was just as good as those books, if not better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitBy.Alex TaylorThe main characters are Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the Great dragon Samsung.

Tolkein, is a book for everyone. It has comedy, jokes and riddles along with suspense and adventure for those who seek a good page turner. Tolkein tells you how the hobbit, Bilbo, came of the ring and had thirteen other companions to help find what the ring could do. It tells of their adventures against the giant spiders, evil wolves, orcs and much, much more. Even though he first wishes that he was home by his warm fire and on his soft bed, this adventure changes his life and the lives of his companions. I myself have never read a book like THE HOBBIT, and hope to have the pleasure of talking to more of the fans of this book because in my opinion it is one of the worlds' finest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" takes place before the Lord of the Rings series. It is centered on a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is the Uncle of the Hero in the Lord of the Rings, Frodo. \\"The Hobbit\\" is about a group of traveling dwarves, the leader of which goes by the name of Thorin. Him and his band of 12 Dwarfs are on a quest to get back the treasure that belongs to them. Thorin's ansester by the name of Thror was known as the king of the mountains because him and his people discovered a great whealth in a mountain range that was thought unexplorable. One day an evil dragon by the name of Smaug came to Thror's kingdom and recklessly destroys all of Thror's people and steals the treasures that he worked so hard to obtain. Thorin and his men are looking for a Hobbit to join them on their quest to use him as a burglar since he has \\"Took\\" blood in him. (The Tooks were notoriously known for their spirit of adventure that most Hobbits lacked.) After some convincing from the Dwarves and his Wizzard friend Gandalf, he accepts the invitation. He must endure many hardships as he travles the monster infested land, fight off massive spiders, escape a 500 year old Hobbit that is deformed by the power of the \\"Ring\\", and slay an ancient Dragon that not a kingdom of men were powerless to stop!\\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R Tolkien is a national classic and a book that has inspired all of those who read it. It is a book that combines the excitment of a fantasy adventure with a massive amount of suspending events to keep one occupied. Add the touch of comedy and you get one of the finest books ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The style is very different from what I'm used to, but it worked! Tolkien writes somewhat light-hearted, almost like he's sitting down with you telling a story. And the story is excellent. He goes into more detail about hobbits and elves and their societies than you get in the LOTR movies. Bilbo Baggins is so hesitent to go on this adventure with Gandolf and the dwarves (Hobbits aren't supposed to have adventures), but the more situations he gets into, the more inner strength and creativity he finds. The adventures through the Mirkwood and the escape from the Wood Elves were thrilling. The description of the Mirkwood was done well and you get a good feel how dark and forboding the place is. Tolkien really brought the characters alive. The Battle of the Five Armies was more an overview than a detailed fight. Still it was really good and if they ever make a movie out of The Hobbit it will be one of the greatest movie battle scenes ever. Now I can't wait to check out the LOTR novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is absolutely incredible. Tolkien truly is a spectacular storyteller. Blibo Baggins is a lovable character that most people can feel for. When you read The Hobbit, you feel like you are going on an adventure right along with Blibo and his companions. It really takes you into a whole, new world. This book is a must read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins of The Shire is a hobbit. Hobbit are very small people that look very similar to us except they have large feet. Bilbo considers himself a treasure seeker and this is how he got hooked up with Gandalf the Gray and a group of 13 dwarves. The dwarves needed a fourteenth person for their journey and Gandalf recommended Bilbo. Gandalf the Gray is a very old traveling wizard that is known by many people. Gandalf was friends with several of Bilbo's ancestors and Bilbo was very familiar with him. The dwarves work endlessly underground looking for treasures in the Misty Mountains. The dwarves needed to get rid of a dragon and Bilbo and Gandalf were going to help. The book describes the events before The Fellowship of the Ring,so, the most exciting part to me was the capturing or the Ring from Gollum. The story concluds with Bilbo being rich in gold and being admired by other hobbits for his great adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not normally one to endorse 'dramatized' versions of books. An author's work deserves to be viewed as created by the author, not as condensed and interpreted by actors/directors, in the case of a movie dramatization or the audio presentation of a book.That being said, I am willing to endorse this dramatized version of J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The storyline is true to the book, as are the dialogs. This Four CD collection presents an opportunity to listen to several hours of a classical fantasy tale, complete with songs, pronunciations of elven and dwarven words and names, and limited, appropriate, sound effects.I played the CD's in the car on a long road trip; it helped to keep my mind occupied as the miles ticked away. I purchased the CD version over the Cassette version of this B.B.C. production so that I might use this collection to entertain, and very likely introduce to the genre of Fantasy, my future children. I wholeheartedly recommend this collection to parents, and future parents."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The 70th anniversary edition has some nice extras -- Tolkien's son Christopher wrote a new prologue for it, which is never quite as interesting as it should be. It also contains reedited text, foldouts, and it apparently has all of Tolkien's quirky, solid illustrations.That's more, this nicely-bound edition includes a duplicate of the original cover, from when the book was originally published -- a gorgeous scenic view of mountains, forests and sky, all done in black, green and blue, with runes all around the edges.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book can be a great purchase for two reasons. Those that love the Hobbit story and appreciate it as one of the greatest classic fanasty tales ever written, and would enjoy learning some 'behind the scences' history and info themselves (not exluding alternate covers and artwork from editions printed in other languages). It is a great purchase to add to your own library.Also, it works well as a gift. If you know a Tolkien lover who already seems to have all of his basic works and some hard to find ones to boot. They may not have thought about adding an annotated version to the stack. This is a great way to give them something inexpensive that they are sure to treasure for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved the illustration by Alan Lee in this version. He is so gifted. Just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After seeing the epic motion picture trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga can be difficult to picture individually for readers. This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a sixth grader.The Hobbit by J.R.R. TolkienOne thing interesting about this book the Hobbit is the Giant Spider Attack when they barely have any supplies. Do you think they make it alive safely? To answer the question you must read this exciting book of fantasy, adventures, and an impossible quest. If you read this book I know you'll love it, becasue I thought it was GREAT!! There are many main characters in this book but the real main character is the Hobbit himself. The other characters are Gandalf (Wizard), Smaug (the Dragon)and the rest are the dwarfs named Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin. The first time the Hobbit heard a ding-dong on the door Gandalf was not there. Only one to come for teatime was a dwarf named Dwalin and he wanted coffee. After that all of the other dwarfs kept coming in his hobbit hole all thirteen dwarfs from a far off land. It all started with Bilbo or Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit), and a wizard named Gandalf had teatime on Wednesday. Thorin asked Bilbo to accompany Gandalf and the dwarfs on a quest. Biblo was thinking real hard about it if he should go, but finally agreed. When the dwarfs told Bildo they were homeless and on their own, plus to help them retrieve their stolen riches from Smaug the merciless Dragon who burns towns and a terror of the entire countryside.

You'll have an incredible adventure and excitement of a lifetime. Your New Fantasy World is just beginning."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was easily one of the best books I have ever read in my lifetime. This book has inspired me to continue reading the trilogy of the Lord of the rings. The size of the books look intimidating, but if they are as good as The Hobbit, then it should be worth it.The Hobbit was everything i looked for in a book. It was packed full of action, packed fool of fantasy, and packed full of dialogue that never bored you. Every chapter set the stage for the one that was to follow. It always left you reading and never being able to find a spot to stop because you want to see what occurs next in the plotline.Gandalf definitely stood out as a peculiar character to follow. In this story, it is very hard to tell what his real agenda is. It APPEARS that he wants Bilbo to go on his adventure for danger and excitement, but maybe what he really wants is what's best for him (Bilbo).Bilbo never intended on leaving The Shire to begin with, and ever since he took that first step out of the door, he continuously wishes he was back home sitting in front of a fire reading a nice book smoking some pipe weed. He faces some very hard trials on his journey to the Lonely Mountain. From almost being eaten by trolls, to being captured by the woodland elves. Still, Bilbo and his gang of friendly dwarves manage to continue onward.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who has a fetish for fantasy books and action books. Take it from me; this book never leaves you bored at any point at all. Once you start reading and getting into the events of the story, you will find it very hard to find a place to leave off for another day."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I knew when I ordered the book that it was hard back, but when I opened the box and there was this beautiful green box with a very beautiful green book inside with a picture and the gold writing around the edge I was very pleased. It was much more than I was expecting. There are pictures inside that are illistrated by the author. This book has most definatly lived up to \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" legacy. It is truly a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Step back from the age of Aragorn, and indulge yourself in the prelude to the exciting Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit, another beautifully crafted work by J.R.R. Tolkien, is not only breathtaking but also full of surprises. Small and puny in size, the shy Mr. Bilbo Baggins follows a journey to help recover the long lost treasure of the grim dwarves that he eventually becomes comfortable with. From a mountain full of vicious goblins to killing eight-legged creatures to the cunning and ferocious dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, Mr. Bilbo trips upon adventure after adventure as he builds his respect and confidence as a tiny being in the vast world of Middle Earth.In this conglomeration of exhilarating events, I could not decide where it was most exciting for me. Yet what stood out the most was the hobbit&iexcl;s witty ways in challenging the large colony of spiders in the shadowy forest of Mirkwood, where a significant amount of the plot is set. The amusing part of this event was how the hobbit deviously distracts the spiders by throwing showers of pebbles and stones in his invisible self (he had already obtained the ring of lord Sauron at this stage), in order to save his fellow dwarves from captivity. In addition, his &iexcl;battle&iexcl; against these spiders also demonstrates courageous themes that had a touching effect amid the excitement: do not belittle little people, and expect from the unexpected. Indeed, this was so for hobbits were described as little Halflings that preferred comfortable settings, had no taste in bold and audacious adventures, and were nothing of worries. Yet Mr. Bilbo Baggins, with a taste of adventure in his ancestral blood, defied that by defeating a few of these spiders in the process of saving his warrior companions, which emotionally tied me in with these brave themes (mentioned above). It is no wonder this novel was so thrilling.I would highly recommend The Hobbit, not only to those fantasy-lovers out there, but to any other general reader. The Hobbit is well-fashioned to a degree where it is not too supernatural nor too dull and dry, since Tolkien&iexcl;s style is a tad dry. Nevertheless, The Hobbit is a novel worth reading and enjoying, for I assure you that it will definitely seize in the fantastic world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins and his companions through a journey into the perils of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wow! While I was reading this book I continually asked myself \\"why didn't I read this book any soon?\\". It's great. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but loving the Lord of the Rings movies, I wanted to read the books and began with this one. The story is jammed pack with action and really heroic moments. My favorite thing, however, is the writing. Tolkien just has a great way of writing and telling the story, and that is what really drew me into the book. I would highly recommend this book to anybody! especially those who are a fan of the movies and have not read the books!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The main distinguishing characteristic of this edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" is apparently that, while unabridged, it's small. Very small. About four by six inches.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didn't think that The Hobbit could get better in reading it again. I was wrong. This edition enhances everything. This has now become my preferred edition of this contemporary classic of English literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who wouldn't get the annotated version? The notes are so helpful in answering all those little questions that come up along the way."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***By now, Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" must nearly be a de rigeur rite of passage for almost any pre-teen or adolescent. Its wide, sprawling story of wizards, dwarves, goblins, eagles, elves, orcs, ordinary men and treasure is diverse enough, but also understandable enough, to attract and entertain almost anybody. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss \\"The Hobbit\\" as a mere episodic adventure fantasy, just as it would be a similar mistake to do so with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I believe the main secret to \\"The Hobbit's enduring appeal is its optimistic assurance that no matter how small, timid, and scared you are, you have the tools, the ability, and the courage to confront life in all its hostility and triumph over it, if you really want to. As I said in the title (which sounds like an Obama slogan), you can, and you always could.I'm not going to go into slavish detail about the plot in this review. Basically, a mysterious wizard named Gandalf yanks a bourgeois, complacent hobbit (who are even smaller than dwarves) named Bilbo Baggins from his comfortable middle-class life and compels him to accompany a motley assembly of 13 boisterous dwarves on a quest to recover their homeland from a fiery dragon. The group has many adventures along the way with various beings, most of them dishearteningly harsh and hostile. Understandably, for the majority of the trip, reluctant, accidental hero Bilbo grumbles, trembles, and complains about his wretched circumstances. However, two things keep us on Bilbo's side. One, we would do the same thing in his place. Two, Bilbo gradually reveals latent aspects of his character that help the dwarves progress in their mission, even after the wizard leaves them to pursue his own adventure. Bilbo finds he has skills (like stone throwing and subterfuge), resourcefulness, and even daring that actually save the dwarves' lives on more than one occasion. He has the wits and luck to snatch an invisibility ring from the loathesome amphibious creature Gollum. He manages to keep up the dwarves' morale, especially when they finally meet the dragon Smaug at the dwarves' mountain home. He find Smaug's Achilles Heel which enables the Lake Men (namely Bard) to slay Smaug. Despite Bilbo's almost-constant fear, he forges ahead and even becomes an inspiration to the dwarves, even to their stalwart leader Thorin Oakenshield.In a way, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a mythological life metaphor, since life throws so much adversity, pain, and suffering at us. Sometimes we think we don't have the stuff to keep going. But we do and always did. If a little hero like Bilbo can persevere, the story tells us, we certainly can. But surprisingly, \\"The Hobbit\\" demonstrates a little bit something more - the deadly, foolish futility of stubborn greed and the stupidity of war for material gain.With Bilbo's unassuming help, the dwarves regain their mountain stronghold and their vast treasure that the dragon had kept for eons. However, Smaug's attack and death decimates Laketown and its dispossessed people quite logically demand restitution (i.e. part of the treasure). Consumed by avarice, the normally-sensible dwarf band leader Thorin refuses. A siege and standoff ensues. It may remind you of many modern-day conflicts, like, I don't know, the Israeli/Palestine impasse.Peaceful Bilbo attempts to break the stalemate by sneaking off and giving the siege leader the Arkenstone, the dwarves' most prized possession. When Thorin finds out, he conveniently forgets how Bilbo helped his crew and threatens to dash him on the rocks. Sadly, Bilbo throws his lot with the siege men. However, a more noble reason to fight arises as the goblins and their wolf allies the Wargs attack the compound. Man and dwarf are forced to become allies and repel the threat. Thorin's Iron Dwarf relatives also arise as the brutal Battle of Five Armies commences. Bilbo turns invisible and wisely stays out of it. Man and dwarf (and elf, I think) prevail, but its a Pyrrhic victory. Young creatures in their prime needlessly perish. Thorin does too, but not before seeking Bilbo's forgiveness. One gradually realizes that if you must fight a war, do it for freedom and right, not for gold. Also, to paraphrase Thorin, if more people appreciated a good meal and ale, like Bilbo, instead of gold and fighting, the world would be a much better place. Amen, especially in this day and age.Bilbo found it within himself to be a guide, a leader, and even a bit of an non-materialistic peacemaker. \\"The Hobbit\\" reminds us that we can do, and would do, well to be the same.5 stars out of five."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I knew Tolkein when I was an undergradute at New College -He was a delightful - self effacing scholar - sense of humour like a hobbit- having had first read this masterpiece when about 9 yrs of age -enduring great book -infinitely more intelligent and enriching of a young mind than the Potter saga"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had not read The Hobbit in quite some time and was looking for a new edition when I found this version and was blown away by the different illustrations that it contains from all the versions of the book in all the languages that it has been published in since its initial release in 1937.The background information regarding some of the sources of inspiration for Tolkien while writing the story are most enlightening. If you read every footnote, you will find the difference between each edition which may be of interest if you have more than one edition and wondered why the text is not always the same. The history behind the writing of The Hobbit is as interesting as the story itself.I would recommend this edition to just about anyone interested in the story including those who may want to read it to young children to introduce them to Middle Earth.

I was excited to listen to the BBC Radio version of the Hobbit because not only do I love the story, I love listening to great stories while driving in my car, which is why I own several audio books. This version of The Hobbit was very poorly executed. The voices were sometimes whispers and sometimes too loud, the accents were unbearable, and the music was too loud during some points and just plain awful. I honestly could not force myself to listen to any more of it once I had gotten through the first two discs. I feel bad for anyone who listens to this and has not previously read The Hobbit.

Tolkien also uses vivid imagery to give us an idea of what this world is like. Also, Tolkien use of foil through Thorin and Bilbo helps readers further understand characters. The Hobbit is strengthened through the use of the indirect characterization, the vivid imagery, and the use of foil. The best example of the characterization is when we first meet Bilbo, and when Bilbo is described to us in the end of the book. In the beginning Bilbo is described as quiet and reticent. But by the end of the book, we see through Bilbo's actions what he is really like, which is courageous, brave, and does what always is right. Tolkien also helps readers further understand the characters by using foil through Bilbo and Thorin. The characteristics of the two are completely opposite, Thorin being brave, doing what he likes, and confrontational, while Bilbo is timid, reticent, and taciturn. Tolkien helps readers imagine what the world is like by telling us what each land is like when the dwarfs and Bilbo crossed the mountains. Tolkien basically paints out the entire scene for the readers making them feel like they were just a few feet away from the other characters. All three of this literary devices together help strengthen the story.

But Bilbo is a very special Hobbit who proves his worth to his Dwarf companions, by rescuing them several times over. A classic tales with wizards, goblins, dwarfs, elves, and dragons. This is the book that put fantasy on the map, against which all fantasy books are measured. And most of them don't measure up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do you like fuzzy footed people? Bilbo Baggins a hobbit with some fuzzy feet, has always wanted to go on a adventure, so when Gandalf the Grey with a group of 13 dwarves come to his hobbit hole door he does not know whether or not to go with them or to go with them. When he makes the decides to go with them and goes to defeat the evil dragon Smaug. In the tale they find many troubles with trolls, witchcraft and a creature nearly as old as his stolen ring himself. Gollum is the person that Bilbo found when the troop is lost in the Orc Kingdom when Bilbo found the one ring to rule them all. Along the way they meet many new and old enemies.I think readers should give this information to every one they know. I love this book because it gives the right word choice for the era like \\" That was a good pull my lads\\" or \\"The sun was shining brilliantly \\". It also gives a very good prologue to the new Lord Of The Rings series that can give the reader much satisfaction .It explains much of the new fables. It also shows to get out of you comfort zone because Bilbo did not want to leave his home but he did. he also saved the group many times with only himself.

Tolkien has a tendency to make everything evil or good, with the exception of gollum and the hobbits(the most interesting characters). Thus, the characters have no depth and the places are boring. He describes every bush too. It drives me crazy. It is like this:And then the party came to a knoll. A more wonderful knoll the hobbit had never known, and his heart was filled with joy. Then after the beautiful knoll, the small party came to a plateau. The plateau was very evil. Dark evil things fluttered about and bla bla bla.....It really is garbage, but the hobbit is saved because it is funny and ventures into the gray area. Tolkein never understood the fanatics of his books, and neither do I. They truly are crazy. It is not that Tolkein is so bad, it is just there are so many incredible books to be caught up in this series. The appendix is stupid too. I mean, hello, these are not real people.Also, the movies are very good. Watch the movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book when I was a child. It was my favorite J.R.R.

I don't know if people read these with a preconceived notion that for their time these books were ahead of their time and convince themselves that they are great, or if they genuinely like them. However, I don't really see any difference in the writing style or the storyline than many other fantasy books that are geared toward gradeschool, and they fall well short of modern Fantasy writers, so there's no comparison there. And after The Hobbit, I tried to start The Lord of the Rings series and couldn't get through the first book.The story dragged, the characters were great, but didn't do anything new and different from what I have already read, and for some reason I just don't have a soft spot for these to give them kudos for historical value. Frankly I felt that the whole purpose of the story lacked depth.I even tried to watch the movies and couldn't make it through a single one.I like Tolkien and have enjoyed learning about his life, but as far as his writing goes, I am not impressed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought this book was gonna be a great book, but i was wrong.

They play on his &quot;Took&quot; side which is his mothers side. The Tooks were adventure seekers, they liked going on journeys. Other Hobbits found the Tooks less respectable than the other side of Blibo's family. The ohter hobbits loathe going on adventures, in fact they hate going anywhere very far from home.(Adventures make Hobbits late for dinner). One thing you should know about Hobbits is that they really like to eat and sleep. They have about six meals a day. I only gave this two stars because it seemed like the author was in a hurry so he ended the book. Like he really had to go to the bathroom, so he ended the book as fast as possible. It also seemed like the author got really into the story and when he came to the end(Last four chapters) he didn't know how to end it. I am hopeful for the other books in the seires.

The story line keeps reader's in anticipation as to what is going to happen next. This book gave the before look at how the hobbits lived and more in depth about Frodo. It explains the living styles of the hobbits(like what they enjoyed doing to their work habits for a day's time.

My father has read the whole series. When I was young, he let me watch the cartoon of The Hobbit, and I loved it. I watched it all the time. So finally, the time came when I was old enough to want to read the book. I picked up the book and by the time I finished it, I wanted to read LOTR. The Hobbit is truly a masterpiece, for all ages, and is not corny or just for kids. I beleive that any adult would enjoy this book as much as I did. It's a great experience, and it makes me want to beleive that the whole thing is true and that I could round up some dwarves and go on an adventure to steal from a dragon!...for, that is what Bilbo Baggins did...Now I am reading LOTR, and am I big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I saw the first two movies now. I suggest you follow my path and read all of the books. Someday, I hope to read The Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit takes place in a fantasyland called Middle-Earth. The story is about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with a group of dwarves to steal their treasure back from a dragon who stole it from the dwarves a long time before this. The main character is Bilbo, a hobbit that lives in the Shire. Other main characters are Thorin, leader of the dwarves and heir to the gold that a dragon named Smug stole from his family, and Gandalf, a wizard that added Bilbo to the group and helped them as much as he could on their adventure. The story is about Bilbo, who gets stuck with an adventure being a thief. Which is funny because he has no clue how to be a thief or even to steal from someone. He and a group of 13 dwarves lead by Thorin go on an adventure and steal the dwarve's gold from a dragon. The whole trip across the mountains led them to many little adventures, with trolls and goblins and other creatures of Middle-Earth. My favorite character is Gandalf because he is very smart and knows everything about everything (well pretty much, anyway).At one time I was much like Bilbo. Not really afraid to have any adventures, just saw no reason for them. Then I got to High School and that all changed. Much like how Bilbo did, with a friend showing him the way. Gandalf started him on his adventure and a friend named Bobby started me on mine. Bobby taught me that taking a risk every once in a while wouldn't do much harm and that changed my whole life around. Much like how Bilbo met Gandalf, I met my friend. Bobby was a friend of one of my family members. Just like Gandalf was Took's friend, who is one of Biblo's family members. Right when I met him he began changing me. He showed me many adventures and changed my life much like Gandalf did for Bilbo.When I first opened the book I thought it might be a little strange, but the book was amazing. It is now my favorite book. It is very hard to pick a favorite part in this book because there is so many, but if I had to pick, the part where Bilbo starts killing all the spiders and names his sword Sting. Tolkien writes so well I could see this part taking place in my head. And if I had to change one thing I would change the lack of information. I want to know more about Beorn and the Necromancer.I think if someone likes to read; they will like this book. It is so much more then a fantasy, more like a life lesson. But you have to be willing to let your imagination go. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit that goes on a perilous adventure with Gandalf the wizard, and 12 Dwarves. At first Bilbo is pretty unsure of himself, but as time passes he becomes more and more helpful, Bilbo eventually is saving his companions from danger. This book is a classic example of great fantasy, with the elves, hobbits, dwarves, goblins, men, dragons, and much more. This story shows that a hero can come in any shape or form, and for this story it is the form of a short little hobbit. This book is a great read of all ages, no matter how big or small.

They were in search of the ring. Once they got the ring the job was to carry it to the Elf. Eldron and Beorn Baggins deliver the ring. They had some problems on Lonely Mountain trying their hardest to fight off goblins, maugs, giant spiders. My favorite adventures were when they were on Lonely Mountain where the dwarves are trying to get their treasure back from the dragon Smaug. I can relate to them all because me and my friends like to go on adventures and do fun stuff until I get tired. Once I am doing something fun I don't get tired.I think this book is a great book. This is the type of book that you can't put down.

The Elves don't seem much at all like those in the other two books, there are no references to the ancient world. Characters like Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf are of course recognizable but the tone is perky where the other books are dark and the reader is left with a feeling that this is more a bedtime story for a child than the prequel to the great trilogy.One is left with no inkling of the significance of the One Ring, the depravity of Gollum, only the dwarves are clearly recognizable as the same characters we see later."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, is a tale of Biblo Baggins who develops into a hero. He first tends to be alittle timid, comfortable, independant, and secure in his little hole, also called his home. He is not afraid to follow his own path, and he craves adventure in a most un-hobbit like manner. He is more of the role model type for others. Biblo is later visited by Gandalf the wizard, and not to long after, twelve dwarves show up in his hole, to tell him about a quest they have planned, and what part they would like him to take part in. His quest is to go and rob Smaug the dragon for the treasure of Lonely Mountain. They want him to be their burglar. He is very creative, and has a large imagination. Overall, i think this book is good, but not great. It is more written for the fantasy type people, and who like wizardry.

A hobbit is a small creature who walks around with hairy, bare feet. Bilbo lives a normal, everyday life in the village of hobbits called the Shire, until he is pushed out of his comfortable life by 13 dwarves to join them on a quest to reclaim stolen gold.In the beginning Bilbo has little confidence in himself but as the story goes on he discovers courage in himself that he never believed he had. Their adventure takes many twists and turns as they get closer to their destination, the lair of the dangerous and greedy dragon, Smaug.Bilbo and the dwarves encounter many obstacles along the way including their run-in with three hungry trolls, and their skirmish with a group of huge spiders. If you are curious to find out the fate of Bilbo and the rest of the unforgettable characters, you have to read this book.I thought it was very fun to read and understand more of JRR Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth\\" after being familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I recommend this book to children and adults, and especially to anyone who loves reading adventure tales filled with fantasy characters and suspense."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you enjoy fantasy, you will love this book! This is where the Lord of the Rings begins, and for anybody who is interested in Tolkien's classic trilogy, this is the place to start your enchanted journey. The reader will learn much history about Middle Earth and the creatures and beings that dwell there. And besides that, it is a fast moving tale of courage, loyalty, and perserverance.The language Tolkien uses will capture your imagination like few other authors are capable of doing. You will fly through this book, wondering what will happen to Bilbo, the dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. Excitement every step of the way! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937, but it was revised in 1966 to fit the plot of the later three books in the lord of the rings series. The revised edition was not printed until 1982. This fantasy is a prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is Bilbo's story of Thorin (son of Thrain son of Thror, king under the mountain)'s quest to recapture his grandfathers long lost treasures. Gandalf, a Wizard, received a map from Thorin's father on his death bead with instructions to give it to Thorin, the rightful heir of the map and helped him find a party to go on his quest. The group included Bilbo the hobbit-burglar, Killi, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bombur, Bilfur, Bofur, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, and Thorin, all dwarves. They faced many challenges on their journey. They had a conflict with the wolves, the elves, old fat spiders that would love to eat dwarves for supper, and most of all Smaug, the dragon of the mountain.Tolkien chose third person omniscient to write The Hobbit. It is almost exclusively told from Bilbo's point of view. He also chose to have the narrator talk to the audience, which seems unusual for a novel.&quot;Well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.&quot; Pg 2.Tolkien has a distinctive writing style:&quot;Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome-there was not a doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening the \\"doorstep\\" in fun remembering Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit hole, when he said they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit they did, or wandered aimlessly about and glummer and glummer they became.&quot; pg. 205-206.It is oblivious that he did a beautiful job incorporating description and the plot into the same paragraphs to create a story that is constantly moving, yet full of imagery.A less appealing aspect of his writing is the way the author gave oral storyteller foreshadowing such as the last sentence of this quote:&quot;\\"I am too fat for such fly-walks,\\" he said. \\"I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.\\" Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&quot; Pg. 207This seems to take your train of thought out of the book. Foreshadowing should be something that requires the reader to scrutinize the dialog and descriptions for clues that can be combines to deduce how the story will unfold.I recommend the Hobbit to anyone whether they have loved or despised fantasies in the past. The plot will keep anyone interested in the book until the end, and it takes less than a dozen pages to develop. His unusual writing style has its positives and negatives, but anyone will fall in love with his intertwined descriptions and action in the never slowing fantasy adventure of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a story of a calm hobbit named Bilbo Baggins that lives in his hobbit hole and likes peace and quiet. He likes to eat a lot and likes smoking his pipe. One day a wizard showed up and asked Bilbo to go on a quest with him and other companions. Because hobbits are kind by nature he invited Gandalf (the wizard) to tea for the next day after refusing to go on the journey. Bilbo got annoyed because Gandalf wouldn't leave so he closed his hobbit-hole door, at that moment Gandalf put a sign on his door without Bilbo noticing. The next day an unexpected party of dwarfs showed up for tea and Gandalf came after the last dwarf. That's where the Bilbo's quest began with Gandalf and the dwarfs."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien is the best book I have ever read. The story of Bilbo's journey is exciting, adventurous, and keeps you wanting to read. The Hobbit has many thrilling stories inside the long tale. This book was just fun to read! It is easy to follow and understand, while it still vastly describes the world of Middle Earth, created by Tolkien. It gives a better understanding of Tolkien's world and is a good intro to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit can be enjoyed by all ages and should be part of everybody's bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"~The Hobbit is a great introduction to Middle Earth. The Hobbit is a much easier novel to read than the Lord of the Rings, and is just as good. The novel is also more lighthearted and aimed at younger readers. Tolkein is a masterful story teller, and I could sense the enjoyment he must have felt from telling his stories. The way he writes, the words he uses, shows the fun he had writing this novel. However, I feel there is somewhat less excitement in this novel than in the Lord of the Rings.~~ Maybe it is because the Lord of the Rings is longer or has graver consequences. Anyway, it is still a enjoyable read, and much quicker to finish than the Lord of the Rings.What is it about. Bilbo Baggins has an adventure, which is quite unusual for Hobbits. He with a group of dwarves set out to slay the mighty dragon Smaug and recover their treasure. There are many obstacles in reaching the dragon, and then the must find a way to rid their treasure of its guardian. Now that I have~~ read the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, one of my favorite parts of reading the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is noting references by Tolkien to Gondolin or Beren or Turgon.If you have seen the movies, and are interested in Tolkien's novels, this is a great one to start with.

That is what happened to the hobbit Bilbo Baggines, in The Hobbit. Bilbo was one night quietly drinking tea at his home in the Shire when a group of dwarves came to his house. They were called Thorin and Company and were out to kill the dragon Smaug who had stole their gold. The next morning Bilbo hurries out his door to met with Thorin and Company. Their adventure starts when they met some trolls. Will they escape?! Well to find out read this brilliant fantasy.I enjoyed this book because it had action, suspense, and a good story line. I feel this book has eye-popping characters and settings. While I was reading this book some thoughts I had were are they going to make it to Smaug the dragon, if they are going to kill Smaug, and make it home safely.

They are also called halflings, and are very plump and like to eat about twelve meals a day. Our story begins with a hobbit named Bilbo and he gets a visit from a wizard by the name of Gandalf.

So he agrees and they go on a long an perilous journey. Along their way the meet a slew of different creatures; evil and good. For example they meet: orcs, worgs, trolls, goblins, and an evil creature named Gollum. They also meet good creatures like elves dwarves and eagles. So as they were going through the misty mountains, Bilbo meets this creature and his name is Gollum. Gollum wants to eat Bilbo so they play a riddle game and Bilbo gets the better of him and Gollum tries to find him but Bilbo found this ring and it gave him the power to be invisible.

Though actually originally written as a children's story, it almost immediately transcended such a classification, and through the years many adults have read the delightful story of a small, but tough Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.Most folks know the basic premise of the story. If not from reading it, then certainly they know part of it from the prologue to *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie, and likely went out to learn the rest of the tale. A wizard, Gandalf the Grey, goes and visits the son of an old Hobbit friend, and after spending time with him, surreptitiously marks Bilbo's door with a sign that is an advertisement of services for a professional burglar.The dwarves that Gandalf was helping look for a burglar promptly knock on poor Bilbo's door, and up he finds himself enlisted in an adventure to slay a dragon and find lost gold. Initially the dwarves belittle Bilbo, and this just makes him all the more determined to prove them wrong about him, which attitude he does, to put it mildly, regret more than once on their quest. Eventually he finds the Ring and the adventures are many, but that is too much of a spoiler for this review. Suffice it to say, it is one grand adventure after another.It is said that the Hobbit was published on the recommendation of the publisher's son, who heartily endorsed the tale. It also was published on the strong recommendation of Tolkien's friends, including C. S. Lewis. Tolkien was a man of a very exacting nature. The debt owed to Tolkien's close circle of family, friends, and a few close academic peers is incalculable. For their insistence that Tolkien merely \\"publish it already\\" ensured the book kept the whimsical tone it may otherwise have lost.*The Hobbit* is often criticized, to be sure, for not having the extremely \\"serious\\" tone and \\"complex\\" plot lines of its sequel, *The Lord of the Rings*. While this criticism is perfectly fair, it also greatly misses the point. Yes, Tolkien included fantasy elements in the story derived from the epic fictional history of Britain that he was writing. But that was all that these were, small derivatives. There was not a concerted effort when he wrote the *children's* story, to include all of these. Indeed, while Tolkien had to go back and rewrite the section \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" to make the story of the Ring and Gollum coincide with the overall story of *The Lord of the Rings*, that is as far that he was able to go. He realized that to make the tone and story of *The Hobbit* match that of it's sequel would effectively make it no longer the fun story that everyone loved.So the question is, what is *The Hobbit*? What kind of story is it? It is lighter, but with a sense of foreboding. It is the story of a fat, happy, contented age coming to a close in a devastating war that will change the face of the earth. It is the origin of a story that is an attempt to explain how a variety of myths can be true.To this, many may object that *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of the story, but this is untrue. *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of *all* stories, and only concerns the events of the later periods of Middle-Earth very faintly, and near the end of that epic narrative. It is the Creation myth, one that connects with the Christian faith of the author surprisingly well.In fact, the light-hearted tone of *The Hobbit* is the pefect bridge for the reader. It is the most \\"modern\\" in perspective, and introduces the reader to the peoples, geography, and events that they will find are connected from the First and Second Ages in *The Silmarillion* and the Third Age in *The Lord of the Rings*.J. R. R. Tolkien didn't like allegory, as he himself attested, but he did try to do \\"applicability\\", which is really just a way of saying that he didn't directly do \\"x = x\\" in the story, but allowed his Christian worldview to mesh with ancient epics in an effort to reconcile the two differing myths, or as he later convinced Lewis, to separate the \\"one, True Myth\\" to which the other myths copy and pay homage.Perhaps the most important link, however, to *The Lord of the Rings*, however, (besides the Ring itself, of course) is the importance of characters and the emphasis on certain truths and values. Among these are loyalty, the Providence of God, and the simultaneous righteousness and brutality of warfare.Before entering the military after the outbreak of World War I, Tolkien and his closest friends, who made up the core of a club that was likely the inspiration for the later Inklings and other clubs Tolkien loved to found at the various colleges at which he taught, had this notion of the glory of war, and how they would find renown for their deeds. This is shown in the perspective of Bilbo and the other heroes at the end of the story. While they were happy to have won the battle against evil, they also felt the horrors of war quite keenly.For the careful and patient reader, this book contains so many nuggets of truth for a \\"children's\\" book. It is most definitely *not* only a simple story. It is WELL worth your time.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading it. I loved all the characters.

As close as I could imagine Tolkien or Mr. Bilbo would have had it.As for the negative reviews, which almost seem intentionally too long-worded and heavy to want to read, comparing this edition to that edition, blah blah blah.... a review should be just that... otherwise it would be called a comparison, would it not? Sounds like a pissed off writer who never made it, sitting on their chair the wrong way (something up their south-facing orifice)THAT SAID :PI am a book collector. In particular I tend to gravitate towards classics which are bound and covered in such a way as to make them worthy not only of reading, but also for display and even to be handed down within the family. I have inherited and purchased a number of books over the years to this end, and not only is my library becoming and amazing collection to experience through reading, it is becoming a beautiful sight to behold, thanks to books like this particular edition of The Hobbit, which happens to be among my favorites, at the center of my collection.The book is initially pleasing to the eye. The slip-cover is of the same bound heavy card stock as the book cover, with beautiful drawings affixed to either side. The pages are heavy, the page edges have a nice rustic cut (though I wish they were gilded), the print is bold, and the font fitting. It won't be long and you won't be able to find books of this quality anymore.The Hobbit is perhaps my all time favorite story. The first copy I read was a ragged elementary school softcover book, missing pages and covers... I loved the story first long before I became a book collector. Tolkien wrote it primarily from the perspective of the one telling the tale, I.E. \\"There and Back Again\\" by Bilbo Baggins, and if old Bilbo were to have had a printing press, and produced his book en-masse, I imagine, of all the editions I have handled, that this particular one has the most authenticity and character, and is the closest to what Bilbo would have produced himself. This is very original. If like me you become absorbed into what you read, then you know how important the 'feel' of a book can be. You just don't get that same feel from a paper back book.For the money, you will not find a more beautiful, more collectable copy of this tale. I also recommend the matching red-\\"leather\\" bound LOTR with similar slip-cover. All that is said of The Hobbit in this review could also be said for the similar copy of LOTR.Thanks for reading!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit.

Either they did not really read it or read it very superficially.The author was a professor of Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, and he took many of the elements of the story--including, for example, the dwarves' names, the the theft of the dragon's cup, and trolls that cannot stand daylight--from the legends and myths of those cultures.Basically, the story is one of a well-to-do middle-aged bachelor (50--which isn't as old for a hobbit as it is for a human, as they live on the average about half again as long as we do) who lives a comfortable, snug, smug existance in the beautiful home his parents--he was an only child--had built. Then, along come thirteen dwarves and a wizard who take him out of that narrow existance and show him a great, big world out there; some of it is beautiful, some of it is horrible, but all of it is exciting; along the way he finds that he's a lot braver and a lot cleverer than he thought he was. He comes home, to his old life, but not the same.The book is all about growing up, maturing, pushing your limits. It is also about the futility of lust for material gain and the horror of war.You don't have to like it; nobody said that you HAVE TO like anyting.

I am forever indebted to this teacher for introducing me to one of the greatest fantasy novelists of all time. In this delightful tale, Tolkien introduces a new world called &quot;Middle Earth.&quot; &quot;Middle Earth&quot; is a place where dwarves, elves, wizards, dragons, and hobbits live.Of course, in this story, Bilbo Baggins is the consummate hobbit who runs off on a dangerous and exciting adventure (something hobbits do not normally do) with a clan of dwarfs. These adventures lead to dangerous encounters with giant spiders, goblins, etc. Moreover, Bilbo encounters an odd slimy creature named Gollum, who possess a ring that holds great magical power (an item which plays a vital role in the trilogy titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Gollum is so obsessed with this ring, which he calls &quot;precious,&quot; that he will do anything to get it back from Bilbo (who found it on the ground and later took it from Gollum after a contest of wits and wisdom). Gollum, of course, shows up again in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Another important character in this enthralling tale is a wizard by the name of Gandolf. Gandolf periodically appears to either help Bilbo and his befriended dwarf companions or he appears to give advice or simply converse with his hobbit friend.This story is very captivating from beginning to end. Actually, there are no dull points in the story line at all. The descriptions of this wonderful imaginary world are very florid and imaginative. Tolkien developed an entire world with maps, alphabets, languages, riddles, and very vivid characters who not only win your heart but wheedle your emotions and imagination.This story is not your typical run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. In fact, much of what is called 'fantasy' today owes a great deal of homage to Tolkien and his creative expertise. Since many fantasy novelists who followed Tolkien borrowed in one way or another from him and his works. Tolkien is a master story teller who has an eye for elaborate detail and sophistication. None of his stories are trite or typical. Tolkien stands in a class all his own."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The fantastic and terrific book by J.R.R. Tolkien, which is called THE HOBBIT, which tells a story of a brave Hobbit going to the rescue of a treasure being protected by a dragon. It is an adventure book which every one should read because of the authors way of writing it and also because of its setting, which is very creative. The book tells about a Hobbit, which is a small creature about one meter, more or less and lives in underground holes and are very smart and silent. One day a magician called Gandalf comes to his house and invites him to a journey to rescue a treasure which was stolen from their ancestors by a evil dragon called Smaug. He accepts and gets into a lot of adventure, danger and meets very different creatures, sometimes bad and sometimes good, until the the cave where the dragon sleeps... The first reason I liked the book is because of the authors way of writing. He describes exactly whats happening and makes us able to picture every plant, every character. I also like the setting, which is super well described, and is very creative too, with lots of characters, mountains, and different scenarios which are very well pictured while reading the book.

I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a &quot;carrock&quot;or what does &quot;confusticate and bebother&quot; mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is one of the best-beloved books out there, for either kids or adults -- it's cute, funny, charming and very well-written. (In general, stories that were originally created to entertain kids are the best) Author J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper, and later concocted a complex and colorful bedtime story for his kids...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot; That hobbit is the determinedly normal Bilbo Baggins, whose comfortably boring life is turned upside-down when the wise wizard Gandalf turns up with thirteen dwarves. But they're not there just to abuse Bilbo's hospitality -- they're there to recruit him as a burglar, so that they can sneak back to the old dwarf stronghold of Lonely Mountain and reclaim it from the dragon Smaug.Before Bilbo knows what's happening, he's being whisked off with the dwarves and Gandalf across Middle-Earth. His odd journey rapidly turns dangerous when they are captured by goblins, he is forced to riddle with a withered creature, finds a golden Ring that will turn its wearer invisible, and they are nearly devoured by monstrous spiders. And he hasn't even gotten to the Mountain yet -- where the dragon is still sleeping.I was seven years old when I first read &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which wasn't even the start of my appreciation for Tolkien. Now with the movie trilogy partly released, a new buzz of interest around anything and everything &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-related has brought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; back into bookstore displays. This is a less serious, dark book than the Rings trilogy, but the charming tone and delightful, unexpectedly brave unlikely hero Bilbo will delight both kids and adults. At a bookstore recently, I saw a teenage boy insisting that &quot;Hobbit&quot; was not a children's book, because he still read it. (The final chapters hint at the future epic battles of the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy, and several plot threads are picked up in those books as well, so note the details...)&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is a special treat for Tolkien fans, or just people who want to know more about this book and about Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Pictures (Tolkien's own) are included in the middle of it; Douglas Anderson includes plenty of careful footnoting, citing works of mythology, legend, and careful usage of other books by Tolkien to back up his commentary. (For example, one major question is answered: Do Elves have pointy ears? Answer: Yes, and check this book to see why) The binding is nice and tight, the cover is one of Tolkien's illustrations (Smaug on the dwarves' gold), the paper is smooth and very pale so that the words are always clearly visible.Needless to say, if you liked the movies or the books, you'll adore &quot;Hobbit.&quot; If you haven't read it, then do so. And then check out &quot;Annotated Hobbit,&quot; with its extras and bonuses. Great read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a middle-schooler I loved this book and The Lord of the Rings, and read them all multiple times. I remember that once I began reading the trilogy I no longer had that much desire to revisit The Hobbit, thinking of it as child's fare. That was a loooong time ago, and I have wanted to re-read the book that started me into the fantasy genre. I have now satisfied that desire with the kindle version, and have to say that the story reads almost like a summary of itself in too many places. It's also written in a voice entirely unlike the serious tone of the trilogy to which it is a prequel---it is truly a book written to appeal to children, not adults. So, the adult in me wants to give the book three stars, but the child I used to be remembers this book quite fondly and had it on a pedestal at the time, and would give it five stars. So I have settled in the middle---pardon the unintended pun reference to middle-earth---at four stars. If you have a child in elementary school or early middle school, or even better a child that you are reading stories too every night, that child would probably really enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's imagination.

In other words, cheap cardboard-sandwiched discs of which I personally guarantee that each one will come with more scratches than the behind of a dwarf in a sand-laden speedo. Again - not green as in soft green grass, but green as in the greenbacks the company makes from this type of cut in quality.If a company had pride in its product it would have at least foregone the post consumer content grade recycled paperboard and upgrade to paper sleeves. Or better yet, perhaps a $3 jewel case that holds all 5 discs? The exterior box is certainly large enough for a nice plastic jewel case. Instead it contains a cheap, thin, cardboard book of the discs that takes up all of 1/3 of the interior space. The rest of the box is loaded with a large cardboard insert as filler.These type of (goblin) antics are why people stop buying audio CDs and look for other means to acquire their audio (preferably without the aid of a burglar). I certainly won't buy any more products from AudioGO or BBC Audiobooks without holding the product first.

I read them first and was disappointed with the detail in this book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, this is one of my favorite books ever, and that is why I've read it over and over so many times. To say that it is &quot;just for kids&quot; is like saying that ice cream or watermelon is just for kids. Blasphemy! It is true that Tolkien intended his story for young readers to enjoy, as is evident in the fact that hardly a page goes by in which the narrator does not address children in the first person singular, but the story is never &quot;childish&quot; (in my opinion). Any child reading this story will feel elevated to being at one level with the (adult) narrator. I think it is significant that Tolkien makes the hobbits beardless and &quot;shy of the Big People&quot; and their stature to be &quot;about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves.&quot; They tend to &quot;disappear quietly and quickly when large and stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.&quot; The misgivings that Bilbo has as he is swept off on this adventure, are the misgivings that any child would have... and the fact that he overcomes those fears, learns to live with a determined initiative, becomes a true leader, and emerges a hero in the end is a great lesson for young and old alike.The Hobbit is self-contained, and essentially independent of the three-volume Lord Of The Rings, which, in my opinion is a far more graver sort of quest... perhaps less accessible to the younger reader. It is not necessary to read the Hobbit in order to understand The Lord of The Rings, but The Hobbit serves as a quarry of important themes for the larger work.The Hobbit reminds me of something C.S. Lewis (a friend of Tolkien's) once said of children's literature: &quot;No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty...&quot; The Hobbit surely fulfills this criteria, and so I believe you will be smiling at the end of this book regardless of whether, in doing so, you're displaying baby teeth or dentures at the time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First things first: If you have NEVER read the Hobbit before, I do not recommend this version. GetThe Hobbit: or, There and Back Again (Collector's Edition)instead. That is a wonderful hardcover collector's edition with a slipcover and beautiful illustrations.Having said that, I will now direct my review towards people who have already read the Hobbit at least once and now wish to lean more about both J.R.R. Tolkien's writing process and the world of Middle-Earth itself.But before I discuss this product I would like to explain why I bought this book in the first place. When Tolkien published the first edition of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins aquired the Ring from Gollum in a slightly different way than that with which we are familiar. Originally Gollum offered to give the ring away as a prize if Bilbo won the riddle contest. A few years later when Tolkien began work on the Lord of the Rings and finally realized what this Ring actually was, he knew that there was no way that Gollum would voluntarily give away the ring. So he went back and rewrote the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter, and to this day every later edition of the book has Bilbo taking the ring in a less-than-honest way. I wanted to read the original text from the first edition. What do you do when you want to read the first version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" but can't afford to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a first edition copy of the Hobbit? Get Douglas A. Anderson's annotated version!What is \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\"? Start with the final edition of the Hobbit that Tolkien published in his lifetime, and center the book around that. Add Anderson's detailed annotations in smaller print in the wide margins of most pages. Add a large collection of illustrations of all sizes, and include appendices in the back. What does Anderson discuss in his annotations? Most notably he quotes the original text from every time Tolkien changed anything from one edition to the next. At one extreme is the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter rewrite included in the margins next to the regular text. At the other extreme are numberous single-word changes. In between the two Anderson detailed every time Tolkien made sentence and paragraph rewrites. Anderson discusses Tolkien's writing process, drawing heavily on Tolkien's published letters and other sources. Anderson cross-references minute details in the Hobbit with LOTR, Silmarillion, Book of Lost Tales, etc, in order to further explain people, events, and places and to point out cases where Tolkien occasionally contradicts himself. Anderson also discusses the impact the Hobbit has had on different audiences throughout the world.The illustrations are splendid. We have all of Tolkien's original (published and unpublished) artwork for the Hobbit. We have the paintings of modern authorities like John Howe, and we have absolutely horrible artwork by illustrators who must not even have read the book - such as early Russian versions. Not only does that make this book a feast for the eyes, but it is interesting to see how different artists have had their own interpretations of Middle-Earth.For anyone who wants more information or more artwork or the original text of \\"Riddles\\", this is the book for you. Although some might think this book contains too much miscellaneous information, I think it is the perfect volume for anyone who loves Tolkien and his hobbits, wizards, dwarves, and elves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the 8th grade, at the age of 13.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R.

Who in their right mind would cut out parts of the Hobbit?Second off the writing is so teeny weeny and with the pictures running right into the center binding, I had to break the spine to get at the dialogue to read it. Tres annoying.Third, this is sorta a recap of number one, but with the parts left out and then the pictures teeming with activities and characters, well, sometimes it was just plain hard to know what was going on.Anyway, I think instead of this book, I'd rather buy the hardback version of The Hobbit which has pictures at the beginning of each chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story of , \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, has grown greatly in its telling. This pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s has morphed into the basis of the blockbuster LOTR films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, \\"The Hobbit\\", myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of, \\"The Hobbit\\", ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford!This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something.The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke.This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :).All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit(smaller, chubbier folk who have six meals a day, and have very hairy feet) who is living a very easy, relaxing life in his home at Bag End. One fine morning while Bilbo is puffing his smokepipe, the mysterious wizard Gandalf comes along with a band of 13 homeless dwarves asking Bilbo to be the fourteenth member of their adventure through dangerous forests, giant spiders, menacing trolls, savage wolves, and other unknown dangers! Bilbo is persuaded to go and finally it will be Bilbo alone to face the fear of an entire countryside, the great dragon Smaug! J.R.R. Tolkien brilliantly takes you through a marvelous fantasy world in Middle Earth as Bilbo and friends go on their epic adventure. There are plenty of amazing settings and wild creatures. He keeps you on the edge of your seat as Bilbo and company pull off one miracle after another. The copy of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien that I read was published in 1982 by Ballentine Books.

All the various illustrations will no doubt interest younger readers as well.Anderson does perpetuate a couple of myths (such as the notion that Tolkien's Elves had pointed ears) but his research is generally regarded as some of the best in the world and that is well-deserved praise. The book includes all the changes Tolkien ever made to The Hobbit in an appendix which is non-intrusive. There is also an extensive bibliography for further reading.But maybe the best reason to buy the book (if/when it is printed again) is its size.

It was so simple and fun, yet in its own way so magical and incredibly entertaining (seven for an eight year old). Tolkien seemed to be, as a front, writing a children's book.Coming back, though, I read it again and on a completely different level. Yes, it was still entertaining, fun. But not once, NOT ONCE, upon the reread did I think of it as a children's book. It was still light and cheerful, but now a stark parable was presented in every character; a viscious greed that made two enemies (Thorin and Smaug) more similiar than they ever would realize; Gollum, who condemned himself by his own idiocy and corruptness; and, most of all, Bilbo, who secretly longed for adventure, though he himself didn't know it.In the style of Hemingway and Steinbeck, Tolkien uses simple words to create an elegant writing style and a complicated tale. In his sequels, The Lord of the Rings, however, he loses his simple eloquence and falls into the same pit Dumas fell years before him. Don't read the Lord of the Rings, whatever you do.And here's to all of you who dislike this enchanting, warm-hearted tale: maybe you still can't realize its warmness and brightness that brings alive a piece of childhood in all of us, or maybe, you are to disgrateful to fully appreciate the beauty of the magical Middle Earth, and the charm of Bilbo, THE HOBBIT."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are my favorite books of all time.

I'm now soon to be in the 12th, and recently reread it for old times' sake. What a disapointment. Tolkien's story telling seriously lacks in dialogue. The plot is also incredibly boring, and unbelievable (i know, i know... it is fantasy), but we can't blame Tolkein for that, seeing as he was one of the first fantasy writers. For the more experienced fantasy/sci-fi reader out there i suggest Orson Scott Card, Samuel Delany, William Gibson, and Ursula Le Guin. The hobbit is an enjoyable fairy tale, but not nearly worthy of the praise it recieves. I only give it 3 stars because Tolkien paved the way for so many others."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the greatest, and a must have to introduce you into the world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book is great, but I really don't like the abridgement"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of my favorites of all time - if you haven't read it, you should - obviously not just a children's book, unless your children are educated readers. As an English teacher, I recommend The Hobbit to absolutely everyone - not only a great narrative, but a shining example of how a narrative should be. I'm so thankful to have it on my Kindle, because I read again it every year; it takes me away, and now I can take it with me! Looking forward to Peter Jackson's cinematic version - aren't you?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a true classic and a great introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth.

It's a little different as an ebook but just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read the paper version to the point that it fell apart.The electronic version will last longer and its still pure magic. Tolkien really created a classic that is timeless and so full of situations to create in your mind.I am looking forward to the film as The Lord of the Rings series was in some cases better than I could imagine.There is a quality feel about the Hobbit that I miss in the Harry Potter books. (They are great too)Read the Hobbit now, before the movie comes out as it will give you all the background to enjoy the visual version even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a feature and illustration packed edition of THE fantasy novel.

IT'S A MASTERPIECE. Great work of art."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What a wonderful story from a another era. J.R.R. Tolkien had the ability to weave a story and pull the reader (or listener) into his tale. It must be 25 years ago when I first read this story and what a story it was. The Hobbit opened my eyes to a whole other world of reading. Being the son of a librarian, I was accustomed to books, but when I received this book I did not want to put it down. As I have read this story yearly, I was very excited to see the BBC dramatization released on CD. I must tell you that the BBC did a wonderful job with this story, bringing out the highs and the lows with precision and believability. You will not be disappointed with this series. Now is the time to join Bilbo and the company of Dwarves. Your adventure awaits."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is absoulutley amazing. It enriches all of your wants in a story.

Everyone can relate to that!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Not until age 40 did I get around to read the wonderful story of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, an unlikely hero who was picked by the wizard Gandalf to join a band of bearded dwarves to reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug.The Hobbit is captivating without any dull points in the story line. The descriptions of the imaginary world reflect Tolkien's unrivaled creative genius.If you have not read The Hobbit I highly recommend this enjoyable work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As I wrote about its big brother, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I will also about &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: that everthing good about it has been said, suffice it to say, it is is amazing. This review refers specifically to the edition illustrated by Alan Lee. While it is more expensive than many other editions, no other captures the whimsy and adventure of the novel so eloquently. Like many of us, Alan Lee has clearly fallen in love with Middle Earth. Unlike many of us, he can capture our imagination and set it to canvas. This is an outstanding edition, worthy of one of the great tales of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am in 11th grade, and I just read this book maybe... September. Part of my grade in my English class was to come up with ten words out of our current books, write them down, and define them. We would then hand these words (with their definitions) into our teacher. There was a probelm, though. The Hobbit contained maybe one word that I wasn't exactly sure of in the whole book. This resulted in a bunch of failing marks in my English class.The Hobbit just &lt;i&gt;flows&lt;/i&gt;. That's really the best way to describe it. A third grader could read this, and yet an 11th grader is set to read it again. I read the Lord of the Rings trilosy, and while that was good, it was much harder to read. To get through them, you need to read all the appendixes and such. It was much deeper too. The Hobbit is light and free-flowing, and that's why I gave it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This magnificent book is a must for all fantasy-readers. It is the first truly succsesfull fantasy book, and it introduces you to the most famous fantasy world, Middle Earth with all its mystery and magic.In this book you follow the hobbit Bilbo Baggins who is accompanied by 13 dwarfes. They are going to capture their ancestors gold from the fierce dragon Smaug. On their way, they meet a lot strange creatures and dangers. It is all brilliantly told by J.R.R. Tolkien.I recommend this for everyone who likes to read FANTASY."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a reallly good book. I liked it because, Dumgeons and Dragons like material interests me, and if it does you, i think you'll like it just as well. It starts out in a Hilly landscape in a place called Bag End. Where Hobbits like Bilbo Baggins Live. He led a normal life until a unexpeced visit occurs from a Wizard named Gandalf and 12 dwarves all in need of a good thief like Bilbo to help them on a quest to ... Smawg and get his gold. So their quest starts and they meet and fight many people, spiders, elves, and goblins along the way. The ending is really spectacular but you need to read it to find out. Dont forget to readd all the other J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved the book the hobbit, which is by JRR Tolkien. It takes place in the underground world of Trolls, Elves. Goblins and Dragons. Its about a hobbit named Bilbo. Hobbits are fat fuzzy creatures with long toes and fingers. He meets a lot of elves and they have to go steal back gold from a cave guarded by a dragon. I recommend this book because it is funny and the dialogue is great. The humor of the book is fantastic. For example in a cave two creatures start telling riddles and people will laugh and love it. I loved this funny and incredible book. Other people might say this book is terrible and dialogue free but it thinks it's magical. The Hobbit is a dialogue filled book but people sometimes don't understand. S0 READ CAREFULLY AND ENJOY...

I decided to reread it before the movie adaptions came out to refresh my memory.The story was not as detailed as I remembered it being...I guess my imagination filled in a lot of blanks as a child.Overall, the story is a fast read and at a level that is quite suitable for young adults. The violence in the story is not graphic rather implied. It is not in the Drizzt vain of adventure stories (every sword stike described in key battles). The characters are interesting and well executed given the large number of characters in the story. The dwarves are a bit on the bumbling side which is counter to most of the ways dwarves are represented recently (short, stout highlanders).It is a great read especially on a cold or rainy day! This is a book/story that will last the test of time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who doesn't like it. Classis tale of magic and adventure. Loveable and despicable characters.

I think this is a good buy for anyone, but it will be especially good for kids."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, so I say that this is the best way to read The Hobbit. And I am dead serious.I know that annotated books can be difficult to navigate, filled with useless, pointless, or just plain boring information, and can be grossly oversized. That is not the case here.So - here's the scoop.The original story is very nicely presented, with all original illustrations in color when possible, and in black and white elsewhere. The type is nice and clear, very easy to read. (Many cheaper editions are also rather hard on the eyes. Check the print before you buy, folks!)The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are.And then the annotations - useful, engaging, and very well done. You will WANT to read these. We discover how the book was written, and what was changed between editions. (There were many changes made so that The Hobbit would conform more easily to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.) There are fascinating tidbits about Tolkien's life and the experiences that made their way into the story.The forward tells about the writing of the novel, and the appedices give additional details about the text.There are also many illustrations from other editions of the book. These are varied, from thought-provoking to not-provoking.And the book is not too big. Some editions are simply too big to be read, but this book is reasonably sized so that you can actually READ IT! In fact, I have not read any other edition of The Hobbit for years, since the original annotated version came out.The new edition is very much worthwhile. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This version of the Hobbit is a pleasure to long-time fans but will also serve new readers well. Anderson released the original &quot;Annotated Hobbit&quot; years ago but this new format with the annotations in the column most often directly next to the orginal book text is supurb.Included are Hobbit illustrations around the word, a rich addition, but the real joy of this book is learning background and details about The Hobbit, author J.R.R. Tolkien and The Lord Of The Rings. At times the footnotes are scholarly and at other times they are amusing gems.Anderson has compared all of Tolkien's revisions and has researched the 'whys' 'hows' and 'whens' that helps reveal to reader the meaning of the text and the personality of the author.My favorites are anecdotes about Tolkien's personal life that involve his family and personal history. They are facinating and at times touching.WIthout rambling on too much, I can confidently recommend this version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as the best available."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This newly published, annotated version of THE HOBBIT is excellent for fans of the book. It may be TMI (&quot;too much information&quot;) for the first-time reader. The text of THE HOBBIT settles in the center of the book while Doug Anderson's notations appear in the outer margins. At times it's a bit busy - but there's always fascinating reading! Tolkien fans are sure to get excited over this one.Doug Anderson includes lots of sources in his notes. He quotes Tolkien's own letters, other fairy tales and legends that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as previous versions of the section he's noting. The Gollum section (&quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;) is interesting. Tolkien did some tinkering with the original Gollum story as its follow-up (LORD OF THE RINGS) was taking shape. Seems that George Lucas is not the only person who's revised previously released work! Tolkien was his predecessor.Also interesting are the many black and white illustrations that Anderson includes, many from foreign editions of THE HOBBIT. Some of the art is hilarious, as it does not resemble Tolkien's characters at all! There is a nice color section of illustrations in the center of the book.THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT is a handsome, interesting book to own if you're a fan of Bilbo and his adventures with the dwarves (or dwarfs? That's covered in the book as well!)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's Hobbit takes the imagination on a wonderful flightof fantasy. I read this book on a yearly basis and eachyear I am delighted and captivated by the world of BilboBaggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that willforever change his life and the lives of those around him.He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the goldand mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon,Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on theirjourney to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle offive armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way whichleads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a newadventure for his friends in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skillis best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, &quot;TheLord of the Rings&quot; the story is continued, but the sheerdelight of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is never fully recaptured.This collector's edition is beautifully bound. Even moreenjoyable are the illustrations and paintings by the authorhimself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\`The Annotated Hobbit', annotated by bookseller Douglas A. Anderson is published by J.R.R. Tolkien's American publisher, Houghton Mifflin (important because it means the cover of this book uses the same art as the cover of the most popular hard-covered American edition of the Hobbit, published in the 1960's).Let me be perfectly clear that this is first and foremost a review of the Annotation, not of the novel, \`The Hobbit' itself. I have an almost reverential respect for the original novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike some cinematic versions of experiences like Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement in this annotation that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. And, while I can appreciate that there are adult readers, my Hemingway loving uncle being one of them, who simply \`don't get it', I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!But back to this Annotation'. Like similar annotations to works of fiction such as \`Alice in Wonderland' and the Arthur Conan Doyle stories of Sherlock Holmes, there are four different subjects for annotation. One is internal; where names and events are cross-referenced to other parts of the work to explain, elaborate, resolve, or point out inconsistencies. The second is external, where correspondences can be made to sources or, in the case of Conan Doyle or Carroll, events of the day that may have found their way into the fiction. The third is references to the author's unpublished notes and letters. Tolkien's works should be rich sources for all three types of annotation, as the world of \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is based on an enormous body of Norse, Celtic, and Teutonic mythology, fable, and epic literature. Also, standing behind \`The Hobbit' is the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings', \`The Silmarillion', and over twelve volumes of Tolkien writings compiled and annotated by Christopher Tolkien.So why are the annotations in this volume so sparse? The author certainly does not limit himself to only one kind of annotation. There are examples of all three references to other Tolkien works, notes and letters, and other sources. The author does give us lots of illustrations of scenes from \`The Hobbit' published in translations of the work from around the world. There are also a few illustrations from books that certainly influenced Tolkien, such as \`The Marvelous Land of Snergs'. The one thing that all these illustrations tell me is that, on average, they are not very good, oriented primarily towards a children's audience rather than some of the more heroic art familiar to us from modern fantasy illustrators. It seems to me a lost opportunity also to not include Tolkien's own color illustrations for \`The Hobbit', as they appeared on the very first \`Tolkien' calendar in, I believe 1966 or 1967.I will give just a few illustrations of where I think the author may have disappointed his readers. By far the most interesting character in \`The Hobbit' next to Bilbo and Gandalf is Smaug. And yet, the book has next to nothing to say about the fictional antecedents of that delightfully cagey old worm. One of my only fond memories of the rather insipid cartoon version of \`The Hobbit' done several decades ago is the gravely voice of Smaug done by Paladin himself, Richard Boone. If you couldn't get John Huston, then Boone was certainly the next best thing. To the whole conversation between Bilbo and Smaug, there are but two notes regarding Smaug and dragons. At least we get a reference about the source of Smaug's name, a primitive Germanic verb, \`smugan' meaning to squeeze through a hole. Tolkien confessed that this was \`a low philological jest'. In the wider story culminating in the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings' coming at the end of the Third Age, it is much more important to Gandalf to remove this great dragon from the field so Sauron could not use him as a weapon in the War of the Rings than it was to restore a small band of dwarves to their treasures. The book has practically nothing to say about this, or the fact that the character of the \`necromancer' who takes up residence at the southwestern tip of Mirkwood forest is actually either the leader of the Nazgul or Sauron himself.I keep thinking, as I turn each page of ample, empty white margins, all the things that could have been included.In balance, this is not a bad book or even a poor purchase, especially if, like me, you simply must have a copy of every different version of Tolkien's works imaginable. It has a very nice bibliography and an Appendix of all textual changes between the 1937 and 1966 editions. For those notes it does have, it is great as a version to read to children where you can record your own notes with answers to their questions."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I always thought this book was for children so I got it for my son for Christmas. He had read all the Harry Potter books and was waiting for the next one so I figured this classic fantasy would help fill the void.Well fill the void it did! My son absolutely loved it and has already read through it twice. Intrigued, I picked up the book myself and was immediately captivated by the story and stayed up until 2AM one morning to finish it! This is a book that any adult can appreciate and while it might be challenging for a child under 14, the effort will be rewarded.This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is very much like many of us. He would rather avoid &quot;adventure&quot; and sit by the fireplace with a mug of beer and a good meal in his stomach. He is suddenly dragged unwittingly into an adventure that ends up transforming him and teaching him things about himself that he never knew.As Bilbo and his dwarf companions encounter trolls, goblins, giant spiders and ultimately a giant dragon in their quest to recover lost treasure, you will find it increasingly difficult to put the book down.J.R.R. Tolkien is a master of prose and you find yourself reading paragraphs over again to absorb all the rich detail. They sure don't write them like that anymore!I highly recommend getting this book on tape (or CD) as well. My son and I &quot;re-read&quot; the book this way and we gained much more appreciation for this timeless classic (the medieval music added a whole new dimension to the tale)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review concerns the Kindle edition. I paid $9.99! I would think at that price the publisher could have somebody edit the e-manuscript! There are numerous paragraph breaks where there should not be as well as some typoes.

(the book itself is a fantasy classic and deserves better treatment than this slipshod editing)Edit 6/7/11 - looks like they reformatted the kindle version to deal with those errors. I don't know for sure if they caught them all because I haven't had a chance to look at it all - even if I had made bookmarks for the errors I wouldn't have been able to check because downloading the new version means the old bookmarks get deleted."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this book because I wanted a hardcover illustrated fancy version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.I'm just going to pretend that everyone who reads this review has already read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and knows what it's about. Like I suspect many others do, I have my own old sacred tattered and dog-eared paperback version on the Tolkien bookshelf.This book (the physical object, not just the story) is beautiful. It's clothbound in dark green and embossed in gold, and the bottom corner of the front cover has a gold embossed dragon, tastefully rendered. The paper dustjacket/cover features a dragon as well (I'm guessing Smaug). Eye-catching.There are many full-page color paintings, and many grayscale drawings (not full page) throughout. I'm not an art student, so I don't know what they're really called. Pencil-drawings or something. I call them grayscale because they're gray. Anyway, the Allen Lee illustrations are utterly charming, soft and colorful without being too bright. However, I wouldn't recommend this illustrated book for very young children; some of the goblins and trolls are frightening!I was a bit disappointed that Alan Lee didn't include more illustrations of Elves. Most of the pictures dealt with Bilbo and the dwarves, with a few of goblins and Gollum (scary). Also, I pictured Bilbo Baggins to be somewhat on the &quot;stout&quot; side...the text *does* refer to Hobbits as being &quot;inclined to be fat in the stomach&quot; and liking two dinners a day, &quot;when they can get it.&quot; The Bilbo Baggins in these illustrations is quite slender and looks as if he could use that second dinner right away! Maybe even a third and fourth! The balding, skinny Hobbit did surprise me. But then, I kind of expected the chubby halfling I saw on some old Tolkien calendars.This book makes a wonderful coffee table book and would make a great gift. It's printed on thick glossy paper, so the book is heavy. In these days of cheap hardcover bookbinding and paperbacks that have the consistency of the thick weekly manga, this book is truly a work of art in itself.Recommended for all but the very young, or the easily frightened."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a fun adaptation of Tolkien's classic work and I enjoy it as such, but it is *not* as described here by Amazon. First, buyers need to know that this is a graphic novel and an abridgment of Tolkien's work. Second, it is *not* illustrated by Alan Lee as stated in Amazon's description, the illustrations were done by David Wenzel. This is a glaring mistake that Amazon needs to correct quickly. There are plenty of Alan Lee fans out there, especially after the LOTR movies were made with his assistance, and those fans may be disappointed to find the work of a different illustrator show up in their mailbox. Amazon also gives the wrong ISBN-10 number, though I doubt many will notice or care.Having said all this, I have enjoyed this adaptation of Tolkien's work. I bought it primarily for my 5 year old daughter who is a bit too young for the unabridged and non-illustrated novel but is still very interested in the story. She loves for me to read it to her and she gets a fuller and more accurate depiction of the story than the 1977 cartoon video provides.I recommend this work, but Amazon needs a fuller, more honest description of what buyers will be receiving."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"[This is a review of the 70th Anniversary Edition, not so much of \\"The Hobbit\\" itself. I've reviewed the book proper elsewhere, and would rather focus on the actual edition itself.]\\"The Hobbit\\" is one of those few books that I have felt justified to buy multiple copies over the years. It is a book I have read and cherished, and a book I dearly love. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a novel that deserves to be bought multiple times over, and I always enjoy looking at new editions of this classic work. So imagine my excitement when I found out they would be publishing a 70th anniversary edition of one of my most cherished novels!This has been a big year for Tolkien fans. Christopher Tolkien published \\"The Children of Hurin\\", a newly completed version of Turin's legend, in April. We've gotten (at long last), \\"The History of the Hobbit\\", expertly handled by brilliant Tolkien scholar John D. Ratcliffe and published in two separate volumes. And of course, we have the 70th anniversary of Tolkien's first primary work, \\"The Hobbit\\", which this edition is published in celebration of that momentous occasion. And does it live up as a major new edition of this fantasy classic?That's a pretty easy answer. The answer is NO.First off, here are the positives. The 70th anniversary edition is pretty much how the first edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" was actually published back in 1937 with some notable improvements, and conforming to Tolkien's pretty exacting specifications, including how the dust jacket should appear, as well as the art and maps that accompany the text.These are the notable differences between the first edition and this edition. Due to cost, Tolkien was not able from a production standpoint to have the book appear exactly as he envisioned. The 1937 publication cut some of his artwork, the map was not how he so desired, and the dust jacket, due to printing cost, was limited to three primary colours (green, black, and white). Originally, Tolkien wanted the sun on the front cover and the dragon on the back cover to be totally in red, but this was not feasible.Obviously Tolkien's work is successful enough that these production costs are no longer an issue, and so this is a relatively accurate facsimile of what Tolkien would have wanted to publish in 1937 had money not been an object, as it too often is in the real world. For that, this edition has some worth.Now, there are some negatives. And these are big negatives.First off, paper quality and binding. It's bad.Then there's the actual art work. The colour artwork is quite nicely implemented into the main text, and overall I don't have a problem with the colour artwork from a production standpoint. The paintings are bright and colourful, and remain true to higher quality prints of Tolkien's phenomenal painting. But unfortunately the same cannot be said of the black and white illustrations. Like a reviewer said before me, it appears Tolkien's drawings were reproduced on a cheap scanner. Tolkien's artwork is highly valuable, but unfortunately the drawings here are rather badly reproduced in this edition.Then there's the advertisement for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at the end that's rather annoying. They reproduce the first chapter of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings\\" and place it at the end of the novel, acting like a cheap plug for Tolkien's masterpiece. I don't have any problem with plugging \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but to me this inclusion of the first chapter just cheapens the whole book, especially when it's supposed to be a major edition of a major work. We all know about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Do we really need the first chapter here? Rather tacky, to say the least.Then there's the problem of Christopher Tolkien's forward. This is what I was most looking forward too, actually. Having read E. A. Solinas's review, I was under the impression this was a new forward prepared specifically by Christopher for the 70th anniversary of his father's work. Not the case. It's simply a reprint of the forward he wrote for the 50th anniversary of \\"The Hobbit\\", twenty years previously.As far as textual authenticity, I must be honest in the fact that I've only browsed it at a Borders bookstore, but I'd be very surprised if they did not use the text fromThe Annotated Hobbit, as it is the most definitive and accurate text yet established for the book. Still, I can't verify that that is the case.Overall, this is a fair edition of \\"The Hobbit\\". It could have been a lot more. What sets this apart from the other copies is this is how Tolkien truly envisioned how he wanted the book to appear, and for that fact alone, this is a valuable edition to the Tolkien collector. Unfortunately the poor production quality of the black and while illustrations, the rather tacky inclusion of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"'s first chapter, and the disappointment of the publishers' just reprinting a twenty year old introduction to the 50th anniversary publication rather brings the whole affair down. I think I'll pass on this one.For those looking for the best edition of Tolkien's book, buy \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", first published in 1988 and republished in a new format in 2003. The second version of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", is the definitive edition of this phenomenal work as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ever since seeing the film version of the Lord of The Rings trilogy I've had a hankering to actually sit down and read the books. I haven't read The Hobbit in ages and remember more about the animated movie than the book. Still it was a better place to start being a short book, not to mention the fact that my wife owns an old hardcover edition.It was better than I remembered, a nice tight adventure story told in Tolkien's odd but unique style. Tolkien's works present an interesting dilemma as far as which novel to start with. In particular The Silmarillion, which takes place first chronologically first in the story, and was the first book Tolkien started, was actually released last, after his death. But was it really meant to be read first? Hard to say. Still, Hobbit is by far the most approachable and makes a good starting place.I suppose you either like Tolkien's wandering style or you don't. His loopy old English conventions and penchant for flat out inventing words and tenses might put some off. The structure of The Hobbit in particular is fairly repetitive as well. Once the intro is over the the adventurers are on their way the story falls into a kind of repetitive patter of increasingly more challenging but basically similar challenges for the group. And I'm not the first to mention Tolkiens arguably lazy use of certain recurring plot devices for use when he writes himself into a sticky situation. Gandalf appears and disappears just when needed. And The Eagles always seem to show up at just the right time to save our heroes from dangerous places here as well as in the later trilogy.There's been talk of a new live action The Hobbit film adaptation which is especially tantalizing with the faithful adaptation of the trilogy. Obviously it will be a much easier task considering the shorter length, but it still presents challenges. I see the biggest problem being too many persistent characters. There are thirteen fairly anonymous dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf to deal with. No easy task on film. Should the actor from the trilogy return to play Bilbo? Strictly according to the story it might work since The Ring kept him from aging since The Hobbit. Similar problem with Gandalf. These characters are now firmly planted in the audiences mind with these actors and it would be difficult to replace either.Then again there would be a couple things that make it easier. Much of the creative and production work is already done: the creation of Hobbiton and Bag End for instance, as well as Rivendale sets. Recreating is certainly easier than starting from scratch. It seems all of New Zealand has already been prescouted for locations. Plus all of the creative talent is already in place for costume and CGI work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was browsing in the bookstore when I enountered the Graphic Novel version of The Hobbit (IBSN 0-345-44560-0). It's illustrated by David Wenzel with the text adapted by Charles Dixon and Sean Deming.This version is simply amazing. I gave up trying to read The Hobbit to my seven year old. It was just too wordy for his short attention span. This version is perfect. It's illustrated like a high-end comic book (do the \\"look inside\\" thing to see an example). The text is marvelously adapted. Tonight I pulled out my deluxe leather-bound version to see what they left out -- yes, they do leave things out, but you wouldn't know unless you compare the two books side by side the way I did.It's great for kids and great for adults too.

The book starts out in Middle Earth, in a town called The Shire. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable hobbit is living in quiet comfort. Hobbits are not supposed to have adventures or do anything out of the ordinary. His normal routines are upset when a wizard, Gandalf the Grey, comes knocking on his door. Gandalf brings 13 dwarves, and an adventure. Their task is to reclaim treasures that the evil dragon, Smaug, had taken from their ancestors. At first Bilbo is reluctant to go, but soon the draw of the adventure pulls him in.Along the way, the group meets all sorts of evil creatures, orcs, goblins, and of course Gollum. Bilbo meets Gollum when he becomes separated from Gandalf and the dwarves underneath the mountain. Bilbo also finds the ring. He finds it near Gollum's lair, and unknowingly takes it. Soon he discovers what it does, and escapes out of the mountain and becomes reunited with the group. They continue into the mountain to encounter Smaug's lair and take back their treasure. Bilbo returns to the Shire with gold, and jewels, and a more \\"precious\\" treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A classic children's story, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" was first published in 1937. The hero of the book is a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins. A small and agile race, hobbits are generally between two and four feet in height. They rarely wear shoes, and - while not magical - can move both quickly and quietly. Fond of eating, drinking and skilled in the smoking of pipe-weed, hobbits live in holes in the ground and thoroughly disapprove of adventures. Bilbo, as the book begins, appears to be a very typical hobbit. He lives in a very comfortable and well-stocked hole, known as Bag End, in a town called Hobbiton. However, things change after a visit from Gandalf the Grey - a very famous wizard - and thirteen dwarves. Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves' leader, is leading a mission to the Lonely Mountain far to the east of Hobbiton. Thorin's people had lived there until being driven out by a dragon, known as Smaug the Magnificent, and he intends to reclaim their stolen home and treasure. Gandalf has persuaded Thorin to bring Bilbo along as the company's burglar. Unfortunately, Bilbo knew nothing of this until the night before they were all due to leave. Although Bilbo has no good reason to join the group of exiles on their adventure, he still decides to go along with them. As the book progresses, he meets many strange people and creatures - including giant spiders, trolls, goblins and elves. The strangest of them all, however, must surely have been a riddle-loving creature called Gollum who cares only for something he calls his \\"precious\\".Following the success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations of the Hobbit's slightly more famous sequel, the Hobbit may - for a short time at least - be seen as nothing more than a precursor to \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It does introduce certain things that play key parts in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" : the race of Hobbits, Gandalf, Gollum and, of course, the Ring itself. However, it is a complete story in itself with a start, middle and end ! \\"The Hobbit\\" will be greatly enjoyed by children - and will also be enjoyed by adults who choose to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Book Review ofThe Hobbit written by J. R. R. TolkienBy Scott KoorsThe Hobbit is a very interesting and exciting book. The main character, Bilbo, is a little dwarf person that doesn't wear any shoes that they call a hobbit. Bilbo and a great wizard, Gandalf, set out on a great adventure together. The two of them overcome some unbelievable hardships. They also make some new friends and at the same time some new enemies.This book allows you to let your imagination run wild. I found that I was putting myself into the different character's shoes during the story. I just imagined how scary, but at the same time, how exciting it must have been for them. Even though there is a lot of science-fiction things in the book, I could still picture all of the scenes and settings. The book wasn't too abstract. I also felt that the book was very detailed. I could almost paint a picture of what was happening in the book in my head.I have always enjoyed reading adventurous books and this one was no different. The book kept me entertained the whole time. I found it hard to put it down, I just couldn't stop reading it. I had to keep reading just to find out what happened next. This was pretty unusual for me, since I don't really enjoy reading that much. The Hobbit was just an all around good book that keeps your attention, while at the same time allows your imagination to run wild.

The next morning, thirteen dwarves were crowding his living-room and enrolling him to steal the gold guarded under the lonely Mountain by Smaug, the last of the great dragons.So off he went, through forests old and mountains cold, deceiving trolls, solving riddles in the dark, escaping from goblins and elves, and most of the time rescuing the dwarves from the many perils he himself inadvertenly put them in, thanks to a magical ring he found in Gollum's cave, a ring that has to power to render him invisible.This was the second time I read The Hobbit, and looking at it now with the critical eye of the (amateur) reviewer, I'm afraid to admit I was somewhat annoyed at the beginning by Tolkien's paternalistic tone, by how he sometimes addresses the reader and makes references to the real world, or hints at what's coming up later in the story. This makes the book seem clearly targeted to a young audience, and indeed, The Hobbit would be perfect for reading aloud to a child. However, this tone changes in the course of the story, and especially during the final Battle of the Five Armies, where it reaches a more epic scope, more suitable for young adults.

Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read.The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them.

After recently slogging through most of the pre-Hobbit works (e.g. the Silmarillion, Chidren of Hurin, etc.) it was refreshing to re-visit the easy-to-read Hobbit. The book runs through the story of how Bilbo Baggins ended up with the One Ring around which the events of The Lord of the Rings revolve - though it really is a small plot element when compared with the adventures the characters have in enchanted woods, dark caves, dragon hordes, elven dungeons, and battlefields that occur in the rest of the book. The book gives a wonderful introduction to Tolkien's universe and weaves a spellbinding tapestry of sorcery and adventure that provides a great prologue to Tolkien's greatest work. A short and easy read (especially compared to Tolkien's other works) that I've added to my short list of books that I read again and again.

Throughout the story we see that Bilbo Baggins transform as a hobbit who never takes a risk and never does anything different from his schedule(at least this is how I perceived him) to an adventurer. Even if he does use some help from the magical thing he finds. ;)Overall a good read and a classical story that Ive heard a lot about but never read myself until now.

Unlike other books that I put aside to read later, I couldn't wait to get home and read The Hobbit. I was looking forward to learning about Tolkien's world before I saw the LOTR films (which hadn't come out yet).The novels begins with Bilbo Baggins as the respectable (and quite boring) Hobbit living in The Shire. Quite against his will, Baggins is recruited in his middle aged years by the wizard Gandalf to accompany on band of dwarves as their resident burglar and lucky number 14 on their mission to retake the treasure that was stolen from them by the dragon Smaug. Setting out without his kerchief, Baggins is in for the journey of a lifetime as he crosses forests and mountains on his quest to reach Lonely Mountain. Along this way this pint sized hero must battle trolls, orcs, and giant spiders as well as his own fears.This book introduces so many of the important races that make up the world of Middle Earth including the Elves, The Eagles, Orcs, and of course, Hobbits. It also gives us the first glimpse of The Ring of Power. In a whimsical and prosy manner, Tolkien tells the story of how a Baggins had his first adventure.

They will make the movie make much more sense."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book was written many years ago and first published in 1938. unlike Lord of the Rings (which reading level is high school level) the book was written for children and is easy to read and flows well. i had seen this book before and went looking for it at amazon.it's a really nice hard back book and for anyone who has a book collection it fits nicely on the shelf next to the LORD OF THE RINGS and \\"THE SIMARILLION\\" and \\"THE UNFINISHED TALES\\". christopher tolkien did a 12 book edition on this fathers original writings as well.13 Dwarfs and a Wizard set out on an adventure to find Dragon's Gold!! which is actually stolen Dwarfs Gold and they want it back. Gandalf seeks help in the unlikely helpful Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (whom he calls a Burglar)... he's a Burglar but just doesn't know it yet!actually it's a good thing they brought the little fellow along because he pulls them out of fire many times over. the finding of the one ring, Smaug the dragon, spiders, Trolls, Goblins are part of many adventures they have getting to the Lonely Mountain to seek the Dragon's Gold!!i'd recommend this to anyone who likes hard back books and LORD OF THE RINGS. trade paper backs are nice as well, but nothing captures the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien better than this book. enjoy!!!\\"Theif, Theif... He's stolen our precious!! We hates it forever!!\\"cmh"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story, but I already knew that.

The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've loved this story since I was a kid, decided to re-read it on kindle. Wish the runes & maps were a little better formatted"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, who can criticize this Tolkien classic? The Hobbit is a fun read for kids or adults. The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, his trek across the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood and finally to the Lonely Mountain, where he and the Dwarves face Smaug the Dragon will certainly be entertaining for years to come. Now what did become of that magic ring of his?Plot Summary: Bilbo Baggins is overtaken by a party of Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. He is employed as their \\"burglar\\", as they head for the Misty Mountains to rescue the treasure from the Dragon Smaug. On the way they encounter 3 Trolls that try to eat them, but the Trolls end up getting turned into stone, and then they are abducted by Goblins in the Misty Mountains. There Bilbo gets momentarily lost, finds the creature Smeagol and the lost Ring of Power. Escaping Gollum with the Ring and reuniting with the Dwarves on the other side of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo and the Dwarves will then become lost in Mirkwood and captured by Elves (all except Bilbo that is). Bilbo helps the Dwarves escape their Elvish prison in barrels that are sent down the river towards Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug lives. Finally arriving at Lake Town, Bilbo and the Dwarves approach the lonely mountain, where they enter via a secret door. Bilbo discovers a key weakness in Smaug's armor. He also discovers the Arkenstone, a precious gem of Thorin's ancestors. Smaug's weakness is learned by Bard (a noble man), who slays the Dragon as the Dragon attacks Lake Town. This causes Elf, Dwarf, and Man all to want Smaug's unprotected treasure, which is (mostly) Thorin's by ancestral right. But Thorin proves too greedy and selfish in the final moments, and will not share his treasure, even when just claims are made to it by Bard. Unbeknownst to Thorin, Bilbo delivers the Arkenstone to Bard, as leverage to negotiate and end the siege and stalemate at the Lonely Mountain. Thorin is outraged. Matters come to a head when the three armies of Elf, Dwarf, and Man are assailed by evil Goblins (Orcs) and Wargs. The Goblins and Wargs are defeated, in part due to the warnings of Gandalf, but Thorin Oakenshield is mortally wounded. Thorin apologizes to Bilbo for his prior anger at him, and dies. Bilbo Baggins then returns to Hobbiton, with 2 chests of Smaug's treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a gift and the recepient was very pleased.

I highly recommend this particular narrator for this book. It's the best I've found and I tend to be pretty picky with my favorite authors, of which Tolkein is one. Rob Inglis has a wonderful reading voice, varies his tone and delivery for the different characters & creatures (especially Gollum!) very well, and he does a wonderful job of singing the songs that Tolkein wrote for the dwarves, elves, etc. I will never listen to another version of this again.

Which is amazing, really. Our notions of literature are usually reserved for those dusty old thick & smelly books our high school teachers tried to make us read. But this is it too. A story, but not just any story. Characters, but characters that are destined to become legendary. The Hobbit was indeed the first written. I think it is the most approachable and has the most crisp and concise language of all the JRRT books, and is a pleasure to read again and again. If you happen to come upon a biographical documentary of the author, it well worth viewing. The background of his service in WWI lends a greater nuance and a whole other level of depth to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. In fact, you can't think of Mr. Frodo at the end of L of the R the same way again, but as returning soldier from the war to end all wars. On the whole, read the paper back if you must, but then, later, you may want a nice hard-copy to keep for those times you sit by the fire as you read and travel back to the Shire."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read and been a fan of the fantasy genre for a relatively long time - about twenty years at this point.

I'm more familiar with the LoTR stuff than this book due to the movies, and so it was nice to read the \\"prequel\\" so-to-speak.

I began reading the Hobbitt and the Trilogy later, when i was around 14, and even today i get different things out of each reading. Although the book appeals to children, it is not simply a children's story and the information contained inside is essential to understanding the Trilogy, both the books and recent films.Beware: this is no frolic in the woods with friends. The subject matter is violent, frightening, and even sinister. I'm not just talking about the encounters with giant spiders and cruel goblins. Here are some of the themes:The greed of the Dwarfs. If you think they came to kill Smaug so that Lake Town could be free from tyranny, think again. They were there to get revenge and riches, pure and simple, and it led to much more violence.Bilbo's job title. He's called a what? THIEF. He is brought along because these dwarves need an experienced burglar to help them procure necessities on their journey. Bilbo is far from it when he leaves the Shire, but becomes much better at it along the way -- aided by the ring, of course. The shrieking cries of Gollum attest to that when Bilbo escapes the mountains (\\"Thief! Baggins! We hates it forever!\\"). Once endowed with the ring, which we later discover is pure evil, his thievery increases exponentially. Of course, he steals from the Elves to feed himself, but what *need* did he have of the Arkenstone?The twisted evil of Gollum. Here's a character whose full villainy can't even be extracted from \\"The Hobbitt.\\" Taken in context with his role in the Trilogy, he is a demented and pitiful being who is murderous, treacherous, and mono-maniacal. We've all met Gollum face to face in our lives.The arrogance of the Elves. Yes, they're beautiful people, and yes, they are \\"good,\\" but their high-mindedness and bigotry towards dwarves and men is rampant through all four books. They're holed-up in their forest hideout because they are so mistrustful of everyone else. They are isolationists without repentance, because they only see themselves as good, and all others as inferior.The spectre of life's Orcs, Trolls, and Spiders. The world is, and has always been, full of dangers. These are presented plainly in the \\"bad\\" characters, but also more subtly in those characters deemed \\"good.\\" Bilbo experiences the worst behaviour from nearly everyone he encounters, except Gandalf, who only abandons him to look after greater matters. Even Beorn, who houses the company and delivers victory in battle, is deadly and fearful. Bilbo is ridiculed for being a peacemaker, driven away in anger by his \\"friends\\" the dwarves, considered useless by men and elves, is seen merely as food for Gollum, the Trolls, and the Spiders, and faces death numerous times. His travels, like our own lives, are full of peril and rife with unpleasantness, even from those we love or admire.Bilbo's journey is not a happy one. Through it all, he remains mostly his cheery self, though he becomes tinged with cynicism from his experience (note his response to the thrush). In other words, he grows up. We can all relate to what he goes through.It's a much more sophisticated and complex book than most people will give credit for, yet is so well-written and timeless as to have the broadest appeal. There is no \\"type\\" to which this book would appeal, if read with discerning and open minds. One of the BEST pieces of fictional literature EVER. Pure Gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I didn't get it. But the second time, I loved it. It is the best beginning for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

That's the gist of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book deserves 5 stars for many reasons. The first reason is the plot. The second reason is the characters.The plot is good beacuse it has many parts, it has it's ups and downs but it's plot is special because some parts are sad someparts are exciting and some parts are just kind of regular.The characters are also very special. One he describes them so well that you can picture them in you're mind.

Taking place in a mystical land of the past, it feels as if the reader is along with the characters the whole way. Bilbo Baggins, the main character, along with 12 dwarves and Gandalf, a powerful wizard, as his companions must make the dangerous and peril filled journey to the lair of Smaug, the terror of an entire countryside!This book is a must read for anyone with a love for exceptionally written literature. Tolkiens descriptive language makes you feel that if you could meet the characters, you would be able to sit and talk as if you knew them. The book makes the reader feel as if he was with them every step of the way. There's never a dull moment, it grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go. You'll have more people telling you that your heads stuck in a book than ever before!J.R.R. Tolkien was an amazing author. Some may say he had an entire other world in his head. Born in 1892, he wrote many pieces during his life, which ended in 1973. Although his life has ended, his legacy has not. The Hobbit, along with the three-part novel, The Lord of the Rings, been made into award winning movies. Also, please note that his name is spelled Tolkien, there is no Tolkein.

A red light touched the points of standing rocks. The dragon came.\\"How would you like to face a dragon that could smash you with its foot? It wouldn't be very much fun! What if you didn't have a choice? Well that's what happened to Bilbo Baggins who faced one with courage and determination.In The Hobbit Bilbo Baggins goes on a magical journey through mountains and over plains. Accompanied by dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey he must help recover lost treasure from the dragon Smaug. On his journey he finds a magical ring with surprising powers. When they get to Smaug's lair Bilbo alone must defeat the evil terror of Smaug.I give this book a 4/5 stars because it's hard to get into. At first, there are lots of new characters you have to get to know. It starts out in Bilbo's Hobbit Hole where nothing but talking goes on. Than they start to journey and slowly the book gets better and better. The Hobbit does pack a lot of action though and the scenes with Smaug are exciting and captivating. I think Tolkien wrote this wrote this book in a great way. He used great descriptions and funny conversation to pull you in.Bilbo is the most in depth character in the book and as time passes you will learn all of his hopes and dreams. In the beginning, Bilbo is a stuffy, old, boring hobbit who doesn't think twice about going on adventures. As time goes on, he slowly crawls out of his shell and gets braver. At first, the dwarves don't like him because he's boring but when he gets braver and saves their lives, more than once, they start the respect him. Bilbo is a funny, clever, tricky, and witty character who is really fun to read about. In the end, he learns that even though he's small he can do great things to help shape the world.The best part in The Hobbit is the part where Bilbo confronts the dragon Smaug. Bilbo speaks in riddles and calls himself a \\"Barrel Rider\\" which greatly angers Smaug. He also learns of Smaugs weak point by using Smaugs arrogance against him. In the end, Bilbo makes Smaug so mad that Smaug goes on a rampage where he destroys caves and caverns. After, all of this Bilbo learns a valuable lesson, don't anger evil dragons.I wholly recommend this book for readers ten and over. It is written with powerful words and imagination. Tolkien truly put in heart and soul into writing this book. Readers who love fantasy or mythology would love this book, but so would anyone. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought the hobbit so I can read it again (for the third or forth time) and so I could read it to my 11 year old daughter.It is a great adventure story about a little guy who has adventures and find strength he didn't know he had.If you haven't read this book, you should."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was just about the most fun reading experience I have ever had. I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged during the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\").But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It's sillier and lighter, with less dignified Elves and Dwarves. But it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Much of the book involves Bilbo leading the stubborn dwarves through many dangers, and getting himself out of nasty situations such as spiders, trolls and a deadly riddling game. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty Tolkien was capable of -- and through it all is the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English than his later works, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime.Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. He's supported by Thorin Oakenshield, the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. Crotchety wizard wizard, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Inglis narrates this book, and has distinct voices for the characters.

It is a part of the series The Lord of The Rings and is typically recommended to be read prior to the other three books. I thoroughly enjoyed reading nearly the entire story; there was hardly ever a part that even remotely let my mind wander elsewhere. I think that J.R.R. Tolkien did a fantastic job of capturing the reader's imagination and holding it there consistently throughout the entire book. This book has become a great staple in modern day literature and I definitely regret having not read it earlier in my life.The book began when Gandalf came to recruit Bilbo to go on an adventure with a tribe of 13 dwarves who had lost their treasure to a dragon. Bilbo was a great thief and Gandalf wanted his help to steal the treasure back. Initially Bilbo had no desire to leave his comfortable home in the Shire and said that he wouldn't go; he was too afraid to get out of his comfort zone. I think that this is a part of the book that people from today's world would definitely benefit from listening to; so many adults and teenagers are too comfortable with where they are right now and refuse to pursue anything even relatively difficult--no matter how rewarding. Sometimes the greatest things in life come at the greatest price.Eventually Bilbo agreed to go and help the dwarves, they met many obstacles along the way including trolls, goblins, monsters, spiders, and wargs. Gandalf rescued the crew from the trolls but as the story progressed we began to see Bilbo's true potential. Especially after Gandalf left and he had found a ring (whilst he was in a cave that he had gotten left behind in) that had powers which could turn him invisible. This made for easy attacks on the monster, spiders, goblins, and wargs that he met along the way. Finally after many trials and tribulations they all made it to the dragon and they were able to retrieve their treasure from beneath it and protect their prize from the greedy goblins that were in hot pursuit. Gandalf came and rescued them all, flying on the same eagles that had saved them earlier on in the book.I liked the ending of the book because Gandalf returned and rescued them; it was not exactly something that you expected and I am glad that the author brought the conclusion together in that way. All in all the plot was fantastic and the build up was impressive from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I originally picked up this edition so I would have a copy for my library, but this is a great tale. Why has Tolkien stuck with us all these decades? I still recall the slogan in the streets of San Francisco that \\"Frodo Lives\\" but never understood that until I read Lord of the Rings. But I digress.Gandalf the Gray, a wizard that the Hobbits look forward to coming by and showing a few of his tricks, recruits Bilbo Baggins to come with a troupe of dwarves to help recover their stolen treasure, guarded by the dragon Smaug, who has possession of the dwarf kingdom deep within the Lonely Mountain.I really enjoyed Tolkein's characterizations and creation of new races and beings, and hints at the affairs of the world that our little Bilbo can only dimly imagine. The Ring is introduced, found almost accidentally, and plays a larger role in the later novels in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The banter of the dragon with Bilbo, its anger at being bated, its eventual fall and the dwarves return to power -- the battlefields come together against Men and dwarves thanks to old animosities coming to life. There's lots in this book. Battle, betrayal, love & honor, and poetry -- all written as if we were reading a translated chronicle of that which came before.What is our modern world but what we've built from the past? Tolkien shows the way, through fantasy, that we are larger than the sum of our parts.This particular edition is sadly free from illustrations except for a map or two at the end.Recommended:The Hobbit (Illustrated Edition)The Hobbit or There and Back Again. Illustrated by the AuthorMiddle Earth: The World of Tolkien Illustrated"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I picked this up on a Tolkien-high, interested in reading the graphic adaptation of the beloved novel it was based on. It had been a while since I read The Hobbit and had quite forgotten a few things, so I figured it was time to dive in.The biggest problem with this graphic novel is the amount of words per page. Comics almost never have multiple text boxes spread across a page, let alone a full novel's worth. Some pages were littered with these boxes, much to my annoyance. And some of these were ridiculously long. I don't think this would have bothered me as much if it were Tolkien's words, but Dixon lacks the charm Tolkien had.On the other hand, the illustrations are beautiful. Water-colored works of art grace the reader's eyes, always magnificent to look at. Indeed, David Wenzel did an amazing job of drawing the scenes and crafting the characters. Gandalf is perfect, as are the Dwarves and Bilbo. Smaug is awesome (when are dragons not?). The Elves weren't how I imagined them, but still fit the overall stylistic themes of the book.Taking these two together, the graphic novel of The Hobbit in no way compares with Tolkien's masterpiece, but it's definitely worth the read. I wound up skipping large blocks of \\"narration\\" text, letting the individual comic panes and character dialogue instead fill in the story. It was nice going back to the beginning of the journey that inspires The Lord of the Rings, and Charles Dixon's The Hobbit mostly met my expectations. Recommended for those interested in Tolkien, especially younger readers, but I would first recommend reading the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can't believe at my age I had never read this book. I would recommend this book to readers of any age and genres. My only reference to these amazing characters was through film. The films don't do justice to Tolkien's mastery. Due to this book I have now purchased The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Silmarillion. This book will be an added classic to your bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In the fantasy novel The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien, a small mythical creature called a \\"hobbit\\" leaves his home on an adventure to help dwarves reclaim their stolen treasure. This happens after the hobbit was chosen as a burglar. The story's setting is long ago in Wilderland, a fantasy place. The main conflict is that long before, a dragon had raided a dwarvish town and stolen all of the treasures. The company of dwarves were eager for revenge on the dragon, \\"Smaug the Magnificent\\". Smaug was, unfortunately, a fearless and dangerous \\"worm\\" who lived in the faraway ruins of the town under the Lonely Mountain on the heap of treasures. Eventually, a team of 13 dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit set off on a long journey. Along the way, there are many dangers. First, there are trolls who are hungry and would love to eat the dwarves. Luckily, they are all saved by the wizard. Next, over the goblin-infested Misty Mountains they were caught and taken into the heart of the goblin town, where they would have been slaves for the rest of their life. Then, in the dark, deep forest Mirkwood, they are captured by giant spiders who would eat them like flies. Only for Bilbo's quick thinking do they survive. And after surviving all of these ordeals, only to find a dragon at the end...Main Character:Bilbo Baggins the hobbit is the main character. He starts out with two sides of personality. One side is a respectable, jolly fellow who enjoys a comfortable life with two breakfasts a day if possible. The other side of him urges him to go on an adventure to faraway lands. The book tells of how his second side wins and he becomes a hero and burglar.Character Traits:The hobbit is jolly, excitable, and clever. Most of the time he is happy, and is not ever too grumpy. He sometimes has fits where he yells out strange things if he is scared. He is clever when the time comes. When the dwarves have all been captured by spiders, the hobbit came up with a plan on the spot! The hobbit is also stubborn and proud. He is looks down on the dwarves. Once, he sniffs, \\"all this dwarvish racket!\\" although \\" You or I wouldn't have noticed is the whole cavalcade passed within two feet of us!\\"Theme:The main theme of this book is the conflict between the good and the evil. The evil is always trying to thwart the good from doing what they have the right to do.Recommendation:I strongly recommend this book to children in 4th to 6th grade. The book is full of adventure and the outcome is often unexpected. Throughout the book, the language is engaging and playful which lessens the often scary scenes. I read it when I was 8, and now I am 9, I love it even more as I understand the story better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is amazing, I love it and it's worth the money. I had it on my wish list and recieved it as a gift for Christmas. The binding is great, the pages are thick, fairly tare resistant... just don't let a baby get a hold of it, a baby could probably rip it.The cover and back are sturdy, and, well, when I say great binding, it's probably life guaranteed. The front is really great, around the picture in the middle are symbols, which I belive to be ancient Middle Earth runes. As for the print inside, nice and big, with pictures included. This is a great offer all together.For me, this isn't even worth taking off a half star because I personally think it's just cool, though some would disagree. When I got the book and I looked inside to see the pictures (my mother has a copy with Alan Lee art), I was disappointed for a second and didn't know how it was a Collector's Edition. The pictures were simple, not the great art that I had seen in my mother's copy. They looked like basic sketches of Alan Lee's work. I checked the front of the book to see who the author was and that's when it was suddenly really amazing. The sketches and pictures inside were actually sketeches drawn by Tolkien himself! This edition was so amazing, I found myself pulling it out every time I saw it just to look thorugh the pictures and the neat symbols on the front. I've read The Hobbit a couple times, as well as the Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings, and parts of both the Book of Lost Tales and The Book of Unfinnished tales (I own more of his work than I've read). I'm quite a Tolkien fanatic. I began to learn Quenya and Sindarin and I know basic pronounciations for elven language in general, this was to improve my pronounciation of several places and things in Tolkien's works. I'm telling you what I know so that i can back up my belief that...When people say the Hobbit is more of a child's story. I have to disagree. My mother read it to me when I was somewhere between 6-8 years old and I was pretty bored. I didn't get most of it (I just liked the pictures and songs). She, however, seemed to be into it the whole time. I didn't find myself enjoying Tokien's work until I was 12. The Hobbit story itself is more fun and \\"bouncy\\" than his other works, but even if he had children in mind when he wrote it, it's not something childrn today can easily get into. Plus, the usage of words that are now used differently, only in England, or hardly seen altogether, would confuse many kids. For example, Tolkien uses the word \\"gay\\" several times. \\"gay\\", however, means happy. So when he describes something or someone as \\"gay\\" I can see too many 8-12 year olds, and even high schoolers, getting the wrong idea completely.My notes of warning:1. If you prefer detailed art over scetches, even if they are drawn by Tolkien himself, consider that before buying this edition2. Don't buy this for a kid thinking it's a simple childrens book. And if you believe them to have a large enough vocabulary to get into it, just double check to make sure they know the original meaning of \\"gay\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An absolute classic which HAD to be added to my Kindle!

Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who lives contentedly in a very comfortable hobbit hole, welcomes first a wizard named Gandalf and then a band of noisy, hungry, demanding dwarves into his home.

He'd prefer to stay in his clean hobbit-hole all day and night instead of going outside to the Hill. He dressed well, was fairly smart, and didn't mind company, but prefered his home to himself.Then, one day, an unexpected party forms in Bilbo's home. It included 13 dwarves and one wizard-Thorin Oakenshield, the leader, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, and Kili, and the wise wizard Gandalf. They had a merry feast, Bilbo still quite confused about the whole predicament, and began to sing in one of the many rooms of Bilbo's hobbit-hole. Bilbo was then given the shocking news that he would go on the dwarves' treacherous trek to the Desolation of Smaug as their burglar. Bilbo, being the respectable hobit he is, had never done any thieving, but Gandalf said he would satisfy them. They battled first the goblins going across the Misty Mountains, Gandalf saving all of them but Bilbo from the goblins' clubs and weapons. Bilbo had fallen, and in their rush, they had forgotten all about the little hobbit. When he regained conciousness, he stumbled around in the darkness until he tripped over something-a ring. He put the ring in his pocket and continued to stumble down the damp cave. His feet touched the edge of an underground lake later, and met a strange character by the name of Gollum. Gollum lost a riddle game to Bilbo, then realized that his \\"magic ring\\" had gone missing. Bilbo put on the ring in his pocket, and descovered that he became invisible when he wore the ring. Gollum began searching around the cave, leading Bilbo unknowingly to the exit of the cave. Bilbo escaped and met up with the dwarves and Gandalf, and they continued into the forest-until they met up with a wolf pack! They nearly didn't escape. After that little adventure, they quickly visited Beorn, a bear of a man, then traveled into Mirkwood-then taken captive by giant spiders! Again they escaped, and were taken captive again by the elvenking, and escaped there by floating down the river by barrels. After visiting Lake Town, they traveled onto the Lonely Mountain-the Desolation of Smaug. Later, Smaug is killed, and the treasure that was sought for so long was divided between the remaining-everyone but Thorin, Fili, and Kili-after the Battle of Five Armies. In the end, Bilbo returns to his little hobbit-hole, suddenly taking a liking to poetry.The main conflict is that Bilbo and Thorin and Co. are searching for Smaug's stolen treasure, and encounter many problems along the way. The resolution? They work together. They may fight along the way, but they get out alive.I guess the theme of the story could be that if you work together and think things through, you can get through anything.I reccomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, sci fi, and adventure!It really is an enchanting tale, and I can't wait to continue the Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about what happened befor Frodo then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about this world then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had the pleasure of listening to the Rob Inglis audiobook version of The Hobbit on a recent long car trip.

Bilbo is brought along on a quest as a burglar to help Thorin (the main dwarf) and his party re-gains his mountain and treasure from the dragon Smaug.I think this book deserves 5 stars because it was so hard to put down. Bilbo and his party encounter many foes such as giants, goblins, wolves, spiders, Golum, and Smaug himself. Chapter after chapter, Bilbo and the dwarves got into more and more danger and enemies. The Hobbit is a great adventure book and also a prelude to The Lord of The Rings Trilogy.In the chapter Riddles in The Dark, Bilbo discovers the Golum and the ring. Bilbo makes a deal with Goulm. They both will tell each other riddles. If Bilbo wins, Goulm must show him the way out of the mountain. If Golum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Golum loses but won't show him the way out, so Bilbo tries on the ring. He discovers it makes him invisible. Golum assumes he knows the way out and runs for the exit leading Bilbo to it.I liked this book because it has so much adventure in it and I didn't want to put it down until it was done.

What I do know is that The Hobbit is a great introduction for anyone interested in Tolkien's writing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After seeing the epic motion picture trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga can be difficult to picture individually for readers. This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know that over a thousand people have reviewed this wonderful book but I felt so strongly about The Hobbit that I just had to say sonething about it. The Hobbit was and still is a masterpiece, and will remain a masterpiece for centuries to come. One of the main reasons why is that its prose and style of writing is absolutely captivating. It has a simple and delightful charm to it that makes you want to keep on reading. Its plot is also a treat. It is not boring or stale, as I've heard others say, but lively. Also, with this book, there are many coicidences and connections among characters (so what if Bilbo didn't kill Smaug? Think about it. Could a little hobbit really kill a dragon twenty times his size, despite his cunning and discreetness? I don't think so). Best of all, though, it has a sweet message and theme that can actually leave you pondering about it for hours. I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I have to admit that, in my opinion, The Hobbit is better, despite the Trilogy's genius. What can I say? It's an excellent read, and definetly worth your time. The only thing you'll regret is that it will go by too fast.Also, I wanted to comment on the Houghton Mifflin trade paperback edition. It is absolutely beautiful; I believe Alan Lee illustrated the cover. It is very durable, and the paper (I believe) is acid free."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the hobbit. i read it in 7 grd. and it was great read it again in 9 grd. is was even better that time.

If you think of it as if you were being told all this by someone who was there, or if you think that you're reading the diary of the person who was there, then this book will be much more fun. ;)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit. Now, the reader of this might be questioning the validity of this statement, however, in every case a new \\"empire\\" rises to introduce something so revolutionary that it shakes the foundation of the Planet itself. Understandably, overthrowing tyranny, introducing governments for the people, and building understanding for all that is good in the face of evil mark monumental events in history. Unlike previously mentioned events, The Hobbit is the first book to use fantasy to capture interest in the struggle to overcome pure evil from an underdog. The Hobbit is the world's first view at a self-help book that uses a magical world created by J.R.R. Tolkein to illustrate overcoming adverse odds to learn about the power of the mind and breaking out of the ordinary: in short, a must read.When reading The Hobbit there are a few key things to remember. A Hobbit is a small person, only about three to four feet in height, with a taste for beer and food, a life without adventure, and normality. Bilbo Baggins represents the boring life of a Hobbit, constantly in uniform behavior with which he is expected to partake in. However, surrounding the land of the Shire, home to Hobbits, lies an immense world filled with goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, dragons, and other fantastic creatures eager to be explored. Bilbo Baggins is the book's main character and symbol for taking on the unordinary and challenges contemporary theology. Living in Hobbiton, there are key differences between men and Hobbits, all of which Bilbo represents. Hobbits are only about half the size of regular humans, have hairy feet because they do not wear shoes, and are foremost opposed to taking up adventures, much rather preferring to Garden or drink tea. Bilbo's quest into adventure begins with the introduction of Gandalf, the Grey Wizard, and 13 dwarves in search of a \`burglar' to accompany them on a mission to hunt out the marauding dragon Smaug, who took their gold and hordes it on Lonely Mountain. Surprised to find himself involved in such a quest, unbecoming of a Hobbit, Bilbo accepts the introduction to the \`unexpected party' and heads out of his comfort to the land of Middle Earth.While on his quest, Bilbo learns about relying on others, himself, and bravery. Bilbo partakes in fighting goblins, tricking trolls, riding upon eagles, and saving his entire band from killer, giant spiders. The themes of the novel and motifs are not very well exhibited, except through Bilbo's narration and the chapter titles, such as \\"out of the frying pan, into the fire\\". Through the chapter titles, and Bilbo's personal queries into fighting off creatures unknown in his homeland, the Shire, Bilbo learns the most about himself and displays the book's message: if faced with adversity and doubt, anyone can do anything if they just try and push through the comfort boundaries. Overall, The Hobbit is a wonderful book because it introduces things children and adults can come to enjoy in fantasy, with real world, mature lessons about life that connect to a broad range of readers. Like the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, and Roman Empire, The Hobbit teaches its followers to rise up against the tyranny of doubt and fight for anything previously linked to doubt, a true historical masterpiece of the human spirit and escape to a world of Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is written in a much simpler style than the Lord of the Rings books, and the story itself is a more straight forward adventure tale. Our protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, finds himself drafted most unwillingly into the role of burgler for a band of dwarves who seek to reclaim the treasure stolen from their ancestors by the dragon Smaug. But before they can accomplish this goal, they must survive the journey to the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug dwells. The trip is long and dangeous, and Bilbo proves his worth along the way.While this book doesn't have the deep and powerful themes of the subsequent trilogy, it still provides a cautionary story about the dangers of greed, and of unintended consequences. Bilbo's companions allow their greed to cloud their judgement (as it does many others along the way), and while they only intended to reclaim what they considered rightfully theirs, their actions provoke the dragon into attacking a nearby town, with potentially disasterous consequences. Only the arrival of a common foe prevents these natural allies from fighting among themselves.An enjoyable fantasy tale, with a simple message, this story is still a classic because it sets the stage for the powerful battle between good and evil in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book \\"you read before bed\\". I would recommend this for ages 10+. You could also say that there are three different climaxes, in the beginning, middle, and end, so this is a long, detailed book. The plot is detailed and is a classic example of fantasy literature. The book starts at the house of Bilbo Bagins, which is in a place where houses are built in hills and the people are very short or hobbits. His peaceful life is shattered by a party of dwarves and a wizard who takes Bilbo on a adventure through the Misty Mountains: with cold winters and hordes of evil goblins, Mirkwood: a forest where giant spiders and bloodthirsty elves live, and last, the Lonely Mountain, where a great treasure is guarded by the dangerous dragon, Smaug. Soon a series of events lead to the ultimate treasure hunt for an unsuspecting Bilbo Bagins. But as interesting as the settings are, it is the characters that bring the reader inside the story.One of the main characters is Bilbo Bagins. Bilbo is short so he is shy and wants to look big at times, yet he is shy in most other scenes. Gandalf is the wizard of the party and is the wisest. He saves the party many times and is a great negotiator. Thorin and the many other dwarves are the others in the party. They are seen as a bit short, fat, but strong warriors. Thorin and the other dwarves love the adventure and each one has unique traits that give the story a variety. Many of these characters bring the reader inside the story, and combined with the setting makes The Hobbit a classic fantasy.All in the fun, classic fantasy book \\"you read before bed\\" The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, that everyone should read.

A prequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (which I have already read), \\"The Hobbit\\" provides a much lighter tone than his more famous epic trilogy, but also provides the same wonder and excitement. \\"The Hobbit\\" may be more of a children's novel, but it sets the stage for his more ambitious Middle Earth trilogy, and is anything but childish in its storytelling.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a great introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth and the rich tapestry of legends and songs that imbue a sense of aura to his world. Tolkien knows how to pique the imagination, and his vivid descriptions of dragons, elves, goblins, and the like let the reader's imagination run wild. Yes, this may be geared toward children, but any adult will thoroughly enjoy this reading as well.Perhaps Tolkien's most important lesson is that it does not take a strong, valiant warrior to become a hero. Indeed, Bilbo is the antitheses of a typical hero, being small of stature, pudgy, and reluctant to explore the world. Yet, when all the chips are down, it is this brave little hobbit who turns the epic quest of ancient treasure from mere certain death to an opportunity for success. Sure, he didn't single-handedly deliver the goods or slay the dragon, but he provided an instrumental part to their success, a success that seemed nearly impossible at the onset.Tolkien also warns about the effect of money and greed. As the dwarves (with Bilbo's aforementioned help) are ready to claim the spoils of their victory, their intense longing for treasure turns into unabashed greed. Indeed, if not for an outside event, this greed would have caused them to war against their allies. Even Bilbo is tempted by the treasures and outright steals a priceless jewel. It seems that no one is immune to the allure of treasure and gold.Overall, this is a great introduction to Tolkien's work. And, unlike myself, I would recommend reading this novel first before delving into the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Ingliss does a GREAT job of reading here. I've only heard him on the audio productions of Tolken's 4 books, and wouldn't mind hearing his other stuff.The Royal Shakespearean actors are well represented by Ingliss. He has a different voice for each character, and the voices aren't too hard to distinguish from each other, which is no mean feat for a single person. (kind of reminds me of Mel Blanc (Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny & gang) in this regard).If you loved the Hobbit, you'll love this book on CD.Just don't make the mistake of setting your PC or CDPlayer to \\"Random\\", or you'll be just as confused as my new-to-Tolkien friend was when he first heard it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since about 1500 other people have written summaries of this book, I'll skip it.

I was there with Mr. Baggins and his group as they traveled into the unknown and he traveled back a new Hobbit. The images conjured up by the narration is so amazing, I actually felt the wind on my hair & the rain soaking me to the bone.I am a 39 year old woman, married with an adult son. I have given this as a gift before and just recently I was called and thanked once by the 14 year old boy and then by his mother for bringing this story into their lives.This is a story with many underlying themes as all of Tolkeins works are.

THEN see the movie(s)...This book is best read before the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book, I've read it a couple times now and it just keeps getting better!

I enjoyed the action and the battle with the dragon. I am looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With the advent of Peter Jackson's coming films, I recently reread The Hobbit to refamiliarize myself with it. Surprisingly, it was much simpler than I remember, or at least its prose has a simpler, much more folksy writing style than I recalled, and was certainly breezier than the denser pre-LOTR works (the Silmarillion, and so on). Nevertheless, the book is a lovely entryway to Tolkien and his Middle Earth, offering plenty of marvelous characters and lots of adventure.All the usual suspects are here as a precursor to Lord of the Rings: elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, wargs, enormous eagles, dragons (very interested to see what Mr. Cumberbatch does with Smaug in the film version), and of course the timeless Gollum. The book is a much smaller companion piece to each book of the later trilogy (it weighs in at around 250 pgs usually).

Not that those are bad things, but in later writings it becomes too much of a good thing! Character description 's are kept to what is needed, especially for a larger cast as in this book. In fact I would say in lots of ways you were kept wanting more! You are told partial stories, that won't be finished for several decades, weather it's about gollum or the elves.All in all a very good easy read, that while lacks tolkeins rich folklore, does give young readers especially a fun, and enjoyable adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Really enjoyed this!

He is the Hobbit who led the Dwarves to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their treasure from the dragon named Smaug. Bilbo is middle aged and resides in a clean, warm burrow dug into the side of a hill (the place is called \\"The Shire\\", home to many hobbits). In the beginning of the story Bilbo is a very weak character. He is easily frightened, and very shy (one of the conflicts, but I'll get to that later on in the review). Bilbo is also a Hobbit. Hobbits are known for their skills in thievery and spying. The Hobbits are very small creatures (they can only grow up to three feet... if they're lucky) with big feet, covered by tops of thick hair. They are very simple, and never wish to partake in very exciting activities. A very common profession found in their lives is gardening. Some of the other important characters are Gandalf; he is the wizard that accompanies Bilbo and the dwarves on their quest. Thorin Oakenshield is son of the king of the dwarves who were driven from the Lonely Mountain. Smaug is the dragon of the Lonely Mountain who hordes the treasure he stole. Gollum is a slimy creature that was born a Hobbit but had the ring too long; this is the character that Bilbo steals the ring from. Bard is the archer that kills Smaug.I'm not going to go into depths with the story, but I'll give a brief summary. Bilbo enjoys his simple and peaceful life, but all this changes by a simple knock on the door, a surprise visit by the wizard Gandalf. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf has arrived with a company of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. They are embarking on a journey to recover lost treasure (from the town of men \\"Dale\\") that is guarded by the dragon Smaug, at the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf has decided, much to Bilbo's chagrin, that he will make an excellent addition to the team and Bilbo is going to play the role of a burglar. As they start on their way, Bilbo has serious misgivings. During their journey, they encounter various obstacles and, and all sorts of villains. They also encounter various creatures such as giant spiders, goblins, wolves and many others. In the end, they endure all of them. They eventually kill Smaug and on their way to claim the treasure, they are forced to battle armies of goblins and wargs (of course, Bilbo's party aided by several allies, otherwise they would've been out-numbered and killed). In the end, the wargs and goblins are vanquished and Bilbo returns to The Shire with treasure, the ring of power and a heart full of adventure.The world of the Middle-Earth is a complicated one. Tolkien took great care in representing this world, from creating new languages to including very particular cultural details that add to the richness of the world's fabric. Tolkien states that Middle-Earth was the planet we live today in an imaginary time (supposedly 6,000 years ago), but of course, this is just fiction.As I said, in the beginning Bilbo is the shy, weakest, and most frightened character of the group, but in the end he amounts to be the strongest. And now is when the conflict comes in. The main conflict is man vs. himself, or should I say Bilbo vs. Bilbo? Bilbo has to overcome his fears of dragons and other creatures in order to carry out his part of the mission.Now, let us talk about the theme shall we? I have noticed the story has several themes and morals, but the main one is this: never let your fears get in the way of what you want to do or be in life. Bilbo is an excellent example of this. And then there comes greed. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters' simple desire for food, or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed comes fully to the fore in the story and provides the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone, a most ancient relic of the dwarves, and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure in order to help those in greater need (this theme can also be seen in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy with Frodo and the \\"One Ring\\").Normally people read this book after watching the LOTR movies, and I don't blame them, I did the same thing. But some people look at this book as a prequel to the trilogy, and I really think they shouldn't do that. This is a completely different story to LOTR, one that may not be as good as the trilogy, but it definitely has more color than it.My thoughts on the book? It was brilliant. I loved the way that Bilbo grows up from a shy humble tea-maker into this great, mature adventurer. It's fairly short, and easy to understand. The plot is fantastic, and the build-up is very well done. Anyone can easily read it, the story is written in a very lighter tone than the actual trilogy (even has its comical parts) and I do recommend it for those who have a thirst for adventure, interested in taking a journey to a new land, to Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the first gold-star book of J.R.R.

Tolkien is commonly referred as a classic. While this is an often over-used term, it definitely applies in this case. Of the four books Tolkien is known for primarily, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", \\"The Return of the King\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\", this is the most satisfying. I t introduces and sets up key characters for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy consisting of the three books previously named.In Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the principle races are men, elves and dwarves. There also goblins (orcs), giants dragons, wizards and assorted odd characters and fantastic beasts. Then there are hobbits who have as little to do with the rest of Middle-Earth as possible.They like it that way.Hobbits are interested in green growing things, eating and smoking pipe weed. When they aren't being industrious, they enjoy their comforts. They are very short in stature and move through the woods efficiently and silently. This isn't so they can sneak up on someone so much as it is to stay out of adventures.Of these conservative, predictable folk, there is one Bilbo Baggins. The Bagginses are prosperous and respectable as hobbits go. Which means Bilbo is perfectly happy leading his boring comfortable life. The only mild eccentricity noted in Bilbo's line is he's related to the Tooks through his mother. Tooks had been known to get into little adventures from time to time and as such were of questionable respectability.Central to this connection is Gandalf the Grey, a wizard. For some reason he has developed a curiosity and a fondness for these little people. Maybe it\`s because in his adventure-filled life, it's nice to have a little peace and quiet. Gandalf is also renowned for his fireworks of which everyone enjoys.One day the family friend shows up on Bilbo's doorstep. Shortly after this, Bilbo finds himself hosting not just Gandalf but also twelve dwarves lead by Thorin Oakenshield. Not long after this, Bilbo finds himself \`assigned' to this motley crew as a \\"Burglar\\". They are on a quest to recover Thorin's lost fortune.This is when the book really begins. This is a journey tale. That means Bilbo goes through transformation in the process of this quest. Relationships are developed and tested in a way none can predict.

Its a great way to get started with tolkein's way of writing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's been awhile since I've read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, but all in all, it was a fascinating read. J. R. R. Tolkien writes incredible fantasy, especially in his vision of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins is a lovable character, and Smaug, the worm, is a worthy adversary of Bilbo. The whole story is injected with humour and wry observations during Bilbo's journey. All the characters are carefully wraught through Tolkien's imagery and language. I hope to get through &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (I think that's the title), but unfortunately can't get into &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Oh well. Anyway, I truly recommend &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for anyone who enjoys rich fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"_The_Hobbit_ brings Middle Earth to life for the reader.

If you like fantasy, fiction, adventure, or action, I recomend this book to you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Even though I prefer The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion to The Hobbit, I find that this book is one of the great masterpieces in children's literature. It is written in a beautiful but simple prose and is a great read for all ages. I will give it an enthusiastic five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit (obviously) who reluctantly agrees to join a (group) of dwarfs who are travelling to the Lonely Mountain to re-claim their gold and jewels that were stolen by the dragon, Smaug. I have found this book most interesting and reccomend it to readers of medium to advanced reading levels, but I also believe that most other people can explore it, at least, to expand their horizons. I, personally, have read it at least four times and am now working on the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book when I was 10 years old. Later I read the entire series. I have since re-read them all. I must say that the entire series is beautifully written and that I belive that Tolkien's books should be cherished and sought as an example of good fiction."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien sets the stage for the Lord of the Rings with this tale of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure. A great tale from the master of fantasy. One will delight in the characters and history that Tolkien has created. From valiant characters like Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield to villains like Smaug the Dragon and Gollum.Don't read the Lord of the Rings without first reading this book. It sets the stage and gives you great information to read the trilogy. This is a great book to whet your Tolkien appetite with. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; helped break the mold and open up unknown doors. He presented many with text and style of writing that was very uncommon. Yet, it was accepted widely because of it's way it allows the reader to close their eyes and explore an adventurous fantasy. My favorite character described were the Hobbits. They were very clearly painted in her book as &quot;stout and stocky.&quot; Tolkien's experimented with an &quot;unknown&quot; type of literature and suceeded! This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is beyond me how anyone could not enjoy this book! It has it all! From dwarves to goblins, and dragons to elves. From cover to cover a truly enjoyable journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hi... I decided to write my own review after skimming over a few of the ones already here. First off, I just want to say that if you don't enjoy reading fantasy-adventure books, you most likely won't enjoy this book; that is just a straight out simple fact. But those of you who do enjoy fantasy-adventure books will probably find this a refreshing and entertaining book. So it isn't exactly full of deep philosophy, and doesn't explain the meaning of life, but it did allow me to escape the horrible world I'm in now and take part in a fantastic adventure that I normally couldn't.... and isn't that the point of fictional books??"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The style is very different from what I'm used to, but it worked! Tolkien writes somewhat light-hearted, almost like he's sitting down with you telling a story. And the story is excellent. He goes into more detail about hobbits and elves and their societies than you get in the LOTR movies. Bilbo Baggins is so hesitent to go on this adventure with Gandolf and the dwarves (Hobbits aren't supposed to have adventures), but the more situations he gets into, the more inner strength and creativity he finds. The adventures through the Mirkwood and the escape from the Wood Elves were thrilling. The description of the Mirkwood was done well and you get a good feel how dark and forboding the place is. Tolkien really brought the characters alive. The Battle of the Five Armies was more an overview than a detailed fight. Still it was really good and if they ever make a movie out of The Hobbit it will be one of the greatest movie battle scenes ever. Now I can't wait to check out the LOTR novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is absolutely incredible. Tolkien truly is a spectacular storyteller. Blibo Baggins is a lovable character that most people can feel for. When you read The Hobbit, you feel like you are going on an adventure right along with Blibo and his companions. It really takes you into a whole, new world. This book is a must read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins of The Shire is a hobbit. Hobbit are very small people that look very similar to us except they have large feet. Bilbo considers himself a treasure seeker and this is how he got hooked up with Gandalf the Gray and a group of 13 dwarves. The dwarves needed a fourteenth person for their journey and Gandalf recommended Bilbo. Gandalf the Gray is a very old traveling wizard that is known by many people. Gandalf was friends with several of Bilbo's ancestors and Bilbo was very familiar with him. The dwarves work endlessly underground looking for treasures in the Misty Mountains. The dwarves needed to get rid of a dragon and Bilbo and Gandalf were going to help. The book describes the events before The Fellowship of the Ring,so, the most exciting part to me was the capturing or the Ring from Gollum. The story concluds with Bilbo being rich in gold and being admired by other hobbits for his great adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There have been few collections that have been held in such high international regard than the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings novels. Even before the LotR movies, Tolkien was synonymous with THE original classic fantasy works and now they're absolutely huge. With this set, you'll get to see what the fuss is all about.The Hobbit is a prequel to the LotR. It is considered a children's tale and indeed Tolkien wrote it for his children. However, it's still very enjoyable for the adult and forms a great, easy introduction the the Middle-Earth universe. It tells the tale of how Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and a bunch of dwarves set out to &quot;rescue&quot; a treasure-trove of gold from Smaug the dragon. The journey takes, to my recollection, something in the space of a year. In the course they experience all the classic elements found in a fantasy world - giant monsters, weird and wonderful characters, fantastical battles, spirited and magical helpers and loathsome dungeons. And all this told in the most easygoing and kind-hearted prose imaginable.For more serious fans of the Middle-Earth universe, the linkups to LotR give the tale an extra twist of flavour. It is here that the Ring is first encountered, and it is here that we first feel the breath of the enemy...If you've seen the movies and want to read the books, The Hobbit is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book.

If you think that this book is for children only then you are very wrong. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a great fantasy book for both children and adults. There are many fantasy characters in \\"The Hobbit\\" book. And they are: trolls, orcs, wizards, elves, dwarves, a hobbit (which is a halfling), a dragon, and much more.

Tolkien is an excellent book for those readers who find it hard for themselves to enjoy reading. J.R.R.

Bilbo reluctantly joins Gandalf and a group of dwares in a search for a lost treasure. This is an exciting journey for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Here are a few words for those of you who have yet to read The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien:Best. Book. Ever.The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is (guess what?) a hobbit. Bilbo lives in his house (which is indeed, a hole) in the Shire alone, and loves the peaceful life. But one day he receives a visit from the wizard Gandalf, and everything changes. Before he knows it, Bilbo is swept up in an adventure he'll never forget.In his quest, Bilbo aids the dwarves from the Lonely Mountain. The home of the dwarves has been taken over by the dragon Smaug, and they cannot face him alone. And so, Bilbo sets off with this group of colorful characters, and their journey leads them through mountain ridges, elven cities, dangerous forests and more, the climax at the end being the great Battle of Five Armies.This book, like all of Tolkiens novels, is exquisite, unique, incredibly well-written...I could go on forever about its greatness. I have read a good many books despite my only fifteen years of age, and for me to pick this one as the best, well, you know it must be good.Even if you are not a fantasy reader, I believe that it's hard not to enjoy this story. It's more than just some old fantasy story, in my opinion. And for those of you who love fantasy, well, I must say, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know i am a little late reviewing or even reading this book. Im 22 years old, and i felt that the movies, while good, just didn't fill in the blanks. I love The Hobbit. It is great for kids as well as adults. I just couldn't put it down. From the moment Gandalf leaves a dent in Bilbo's door to the moment Bilbo hands him the jar, I was rivetted. I took me 6 hours tops to read this book and I knew I was a Tolkien fan for life.

PEACE!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story is about a young hobbit called Bilbo Baggins on a mission with thirteen dwarves and Gandalf the wizard to try and defeat the dragon smaug and try to regain control of thier treasure filled home in the lonely mountains. Firstly, Bilbo comes across some forocous, meat eating trolls and finds a beautiful, blue sword, calved by the elves and deicides to call it sting. He gets lost and comes across stone giants, and a mine crawling with goblins and in the mines he bumps into a creature called Golum, and steals his ring, and the ring has the power of invisibility and he used the ring to escape. Then Bilbo finds Gandalf again and they find a forest but then Gandalf said he had to leave so Bilbo contiued through the forest with the dwarves, but the dwarves get stolen by some wood elves and Bilbo tries to rescue them and he succedes and everyone escapes to Lake town and from there he goes to the lonely mountains and manages to get the lonely mountain back, but the devastating Smaug escapes and burns Lake town, but Bard who lives in lake town kills Smaug with his black arrow.Later war with the dwarves come and they try to kill the men and elves, but Gandalf stops them and tells them the goblin army are about to attack. Bilbo finds a shape shifter disguised as a bear and gets him to kill the goblin king and he kills the goblin king and thats the end of the tale. I liked every bit once the action took place. I recomend this book to age ten to adult and i hope everyone likes this book and finds it exiting. From Jaha"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read both the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit twice. And, like a scant few other people, I have seen the movies (note the sarcasm). In addition to this, I have read numerous Terry Brooks novels which, in my opinion, greatly rival Tolkien in originality and depth.With my esteemed credentials out of the way, here goes...I feel that of all the aforementioned books, the Hobbit is the best. It is an easier read and isn't nearly as deep as LotR, but this does not take away from it in any way. Trust me, I am a HUGE fan of LotR (movies and books), but the Hobbit is a much better read. It has a much more carefree feel to it, as the hero is a bit of a pansy and clutz. While it is obviously fictional due to the Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and Dragons involved, it has a ring of truth to it in that the hero, much like us, oftentimes will be afraid in situations that any normal person would be afraid in. He is no superman.LotR, while I greatly enjoyed it, seemed at times to drag on at times. This is due to the fact that there several tales going on at once, and while it leaves cliffhangers, the transition is often slow. With the Hobbit, I felt that everything was very fresh. There was just one main story and this story was told with enough, but not too much, detail.Many consider the Hobbit to be a great precurser/intro to the LotR. However, I feel that the Hobbit is great as simply a stand-alone novel. After I read the Hobbit, it was several years before I read LotR. I never felt like I was missing something, and as a matter of fact, I didn't even know a thing about LotR before I read it (this was years before the movie). In my mind, the ring was a trinket and Bilbo's tale was done.If your looking for a fun read that is just a little different than that lastest New York Time's Bestseller, then check out the Hobbit. I would give it 6 out of 5 stars, but that is not an option."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can still remember the first time I heard this book. My grandfather read it to me when I was 2 years old, and from hen on, I love all things Tolkien.I later read it myself when I was 4, and got even more into the word of Middle Earth.This is a novel all young children should read or even hear as it brings out just imagery and wonder. It would help children to become better writers and want to read other stories.The poems are at times beautiful, fun, creepy but all around magical. And the journey that Bilbo takes can be a example to children that stepping out of themselves can be a wonderful learning experience.Also, it's a story that parents can have enjoy reading with or to their children like my grandfather did to me. It gives great family time while helping your child find a new side to themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is good for beging to the end.This book is the best book of all of the lord of the rings books.

Buy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious.

I'd give \\"The Hobbit\\" 100 stars if possible. I've wished to go back home just like Bilbo many times. I could also relate to many fantasy books I've read.

I have read many, many books since then - some great - some good - some just ok... but I can easily say that none of them have I read more times - nor loved better than this one. Bilbo's story is the classic fantasy yarn. The quest, the surprising courage and wisdom that comes in most unexpected packages - the sheer magic of it all - makes it a pleasure to read every single time. As the movie(s) are getting ready to come - and a wider world and audience will see Bilbo and Company's great adventure - I hope there are still some 7th graders (or younger and older) out there who will pick up the book for the 1st time and watch Middle Earth unfold on the movie screen of the mind! For my money it's still the best one out there."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Picked this up on a whim at Wal-Mart. I'd never read any Tolkien before this. I'd seen the first Lord of the Rings movie and some of the second, and liked them, but I wasn't exactly wowed. I guess my main aversion to Tolkien has always been the same as my main aversion to almost all sci-fi and fantasy literature and film in existence: that, aside from humans, all races are either 100% good or 100% evil. Example, hobbits are 100% good whereas goblins are 100% evil. This just annoys me and turns me off from a lot of \\"high fantasy\\" and lots of sci-fi as well.Anyway, as for The Hobbit itself as a novel, I have to say, I was both underwhelmed and impressed at the same time. Having finished it, I was left with two distinct, seemingly incompatible impressions. Firstly, I didn't get how it had become regarded as such a great literary classic. It was good, I reasoned, but not great. Just a basic adventure story. And a little repetitive in its descriptions sometimes, and overall just chock with too many characters when, besides Bilbo, Gandalf and Thorin, they're all essentially just fodder, all basically the same guy with identical personalities (except for Bombur), with the only differences being their names.The adventure itself was also very episodic. Which is fine I guess, but it left me wondering whether Tolkien was just killing time to fill out the book before getting to Smaug. And the ending was somewhat anti-climactic after all of the buildup.There's also the distasteful revelation of what Beorn did with the goblin and warg he caught (killing prisoners makes him better than the evil goblins how?).Now, you might be wondering, why did I rate it so high if I have so complaints about it? Well, my friends, just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself while reading it. As I said, I don't get how or why this became such a literary classic, but, for what it is, a fun adventure story, it's pretty great. It's funny and has a lot of tongue-in-cheek moments. Tolkien does comical stuff quite well, in a very deadpan way. The character of Bilbo was also very endearing and easy to identify with, and I liked how clever he was in figuring out problems using cunning and intelligence instead of fighting skills or strength.And, randomly, I liked the explanation given for Gollum's name, \\"Gollum\\" being the closest verbal approximation to a particular compulsive swallowing noise he makes. Very gross and creepy.All in all, despite my complaints above, I did really like this book, so much so that I got a second copy as a \\"backup\\" in case something befalls my first. I even sought out and enjoyed the animated Rankin-Bass film (I actually liked its Gollum better than Andy Serkis') and am looking forward to the new movie version of it coming out soon too.So, good book, loved it, please don't hate me for finding faults with it 'cause I did honestly enjoy it. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Last year NPR published a list of books which were chosen by their listeners and a special committee that are considered the best 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books ever written. I am not sure if I agree with the selections made here but nevertheless one of my current reading projects is to read through the list. There are many old friends of this list; books that have become a part of my life over the years and have gone through multiple readings by myself indeed, but this reading project I am now on requires me to give them all a reread...I cannot wait!Anyway, the first on the list, as printed, is Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not on this list. It is my personal feelings that LOTR cannot be appreciated or fully understood without having first read The Hobbit - ergo I have taken it upon myself to start with The Hobbit and proceed from there. First though let me do some house keeping.Amazon, in all of its wisdom, had thrown the reviews of ever edition of The Hobbit all into one bag. There have been quite a number of editions of this book since the first which was in 1937 with the first American edition being in 1938. I note from reading the reviews here that there is mass confusion, and indeed a lot of disappointment over ordering this book. The only thing I can tell you is to do your research and MAKE SURE you order the edition you want. Many of the sellers here do not know one from the other. This review is on the book, not on the edition. I first read this work in 1961 from a very ragged old paperback I found in a junk shop in Istanbul, Turkey. I think it was the Puffin edition, but cannot be sure. Since that time I have collected quite a number of these books - all different, but with very minor \\"errors\\" all the same story. (We silly Americans changed \\"Dwarves\\" to Dwarfs\\" because we felt Tolkien had made an error in spelling...Tolkien was NOT happy!) If a person is interested in such things, I personally would suggest an edition which includes Tolkien's original illustrations. That is of course just my personal preference.Anyway.....Before Lord of the Rings there was the Hobbit. I am most certainly not going into a plot summary here as all that has been well covered in the 2,000 plus reviews already posted. There are some important points I feel that need to be pointed out.First is the fact that to consider The Hobbit as a simple children's story would be a big mistake. Yes, older children will, do and can enjoy it, but like LOTRs, The Hobbit is still and all an adult book despite what others might tell you. This book needs to be read very carefully and savored.Second, the reader should note that when Tolkien transitions to LOTRs his style does change somewhat and the overall tone of the story darkens. It is noted that the story of how the \\"Ring\\" came into the hands of the Hobbits (Bilbo), is told. It should also be noted that the caste of characters changes from The Hobbit to LOTRs. Gandalf the Grey is present as is Bilbo and Elrod along with a couple of the Dwarves. For the most part though, the old characters found in The Hobbit are left there as the story moves on with the next three volumes.Third, the reading level is lower in The Hobbit than in LOTRs. This is important. I have found, over the years, than many young people an handle The Hobbit quite well, but when they then go to LOTRs, they find themselves in a bit over their heads and loose interest quite quickly...not all kids, mind you, but enough to be significant.Forth, Tolkien has used more of a fairy-tale mode in writing The Hobbit than he did in LOTRs. This throws some folks off when they transition from the first to the later.I have thoroughly enjoyed this read over the years. I as sorry to find that NPR had not included it on their \\"official\\" list along with LOTRs...but then I suppose that everyone that will conceivably read the list will have some disagreement...that seems to be the nature of lists.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is magnificent.

I also forgot how much the Hobbits like to eat, a funny little quirk that makes these characters even more loveable. I got much more from it now and can not wait to see the movie. Reading the book gave me an idea on how Peter Jackson is going to present the story in two parts. I ordered the LOTR blu-ray's and an going to read the book again before I watch them. The book I got was not the book I ordered though. I ordered the green version where the pages looked molded but got a golden 50th anniversary edition. I believe the one I got costs a little more then the one I ordered and I paid the lower price but I would have rather have had what I ordered.Update: 07/31/12 at 03:35. I just read on Variety's web site that Peter Jackson will be releasing 3 films for the Hobbit. He is going to pull from the Silmarillion & other Tolkien works as well as embellish on the gaps in the book The Hobbit. He is going to address the rise of the Necromancer aka Sauron and go into more detail on Bilbo, Gandalf, Galadriel along with Legolas Greenleaf.

My imagination went on this ride of fantasy and wizardry full of delight and dread as well. This is the first novel of this type that I have read, usually I just love to watch the movie version of these types of stories. I can truly say, however, that I enjoyed the journey of the hobbit and hope that the movie will be as entertaining as the book itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait for the movie. I have watched the three Lord of the Ring movies, dozens of times, and if this movie follows the book as well as the the LOTR movies did I will be very very happy. If you are a fan of LOTR you will definetly enjoy The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What more can be said about this classic novel that hasn't already been said? I discovered this novel almost two decades ago and have still not tired of reading it over and over."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Still an amazing read after all these years. The Hobbit is truly a timeless classic. I'll read it again and again!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I haven't read this book in years, but I'm sure glad I decided too do so.

Very funny at times. Looking forward to seeing it on the big screen!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book a long time ago - 1974-ish - and thought it an interesting fictional tale of a land of orcs, dwarves, elves, hobbits, wizards and humans. It certainly whet my appetite for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I re-read this book (I could not find my original copy) and again enjoyed the tale. It refreshed the story in my mind as I look forward to seeing the movie by Peter Jackson, due to be released in a few days. This whole story is the pre-courser to the Lord of the Rings, and help that trilogy make more sense as you now know what adventures lead up to that follow-on masterpiece. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a very entertaining tale about a Hobbit (half-sized human, of sorts), who steps out of the usual mold of Hobbit behaviour to join a band of 13 dwarves who are off to recover their stolen treasure from a dragon. The story is light reading, and very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of my most treasured books of my childhood, and the BBC Radio Dramatization is a solid treatment of the subject.

It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages, leather cover with embossing, and a handful of illustrations. Definitely worth purchasing!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. It is told from the point of a rather immature hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins, and we see all his adventures from his childish point of view. Yet, there is always an underlying sense of dread, yet it never overwhelms the sense of wonder and enlightenment. The LOTR trilogy continues on the journey, and we suddenly realize how dark and dangerous Bilbo's journey actually was... words can't describe it, it's simply amazing.."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm glad to see that nearly every reviewer has given this story glowing praise. However, I feel truly sorry for the unfortunate children who were forced to read this book against their will; not because they were made to read garbage, but because their closed minds and lack of literary drive kept them from appreciating this work of art. I can only wonder if any book they have been assigned will ever bring them joy. Best not to ever make them read the works of Dickens, or Shakespeare, or Hemmingway. As one child pointed out, &quot;it had paragraphs with 20 or 30 sentences...&quot; Oh dear, I guess Oxford University was wrong to let Professor Tolkien be the dean of their English department for 50 years. It is a shame that children cannot appreciate such great literature! This book moved me as no other has before. It is a treasure, a joy, a work of art. It is in the same league as Beethoven's 9th symphony (I can only assume this too would be despised by our MTV non-reading &quot;yutes&quot;), the Sistine Chapel, a '29 LaTour, and a Shelby Cobra GT. It is, simply put, the best. I can only assume that the people who have made negative comments about this book are totally lacking imagination, passion, decency, and taste. Buy this book. Read it to your children. Enter Tolkien's world and be enthralled!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would just like to say that I feel sorry for the people that gave this book a rating of 1. This is one of the most incredible books ever written. The people who gave this book a 1 were mostly people who had to read the book for some assignment. My opinion is that no book should be forced upon a person. My own father was made to read the hobbit in college and he hated it, only because it was kind of child-like. I, on the other hand, was not forced to read it and I love it. Again I just want to say that I feel sorry for those who think this book is horrible."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I heartily endorse other exultant reviews of this masterpiece. As for the students who were forced to read this book for school and therefore did not like it, no wonder. Nobody should be forced to read a book this fine. This is the origin of an entire literary genre, fantasy fiction. What other book can lay claim to producing such enthusiasm among so many people? I love this book more than I can say! It has given me and my family much pleasure and enrichment over the past 20 years. Read it!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a nice piece of fantasy. The book is very good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's books have been with me ever since the second grade, when I was first introduced to his world of Middle-Earth through The Hobbit. The Lord of the Rings came next with me through junior high and high school (I've read the trilogy 3 times) and now I'm a few pages away from finishing The Silmarillion. Tolkien's imagination and attention to detail cannot be outdone, and those who slapped Tolkiens first literary triumph with a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; rating had really take another look. The Hobbit intruduced us to a world as real as our own, therefore it stands to me as a real masterpiece. It gives you a taste of Middle-Earth, an exiting and thrilling touch of what his other books have to offer. If you want to begin to lose yourself in enjoyment and/or want a whole new world to explore, start with this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I remember when I was in 4th grade and my English teacher began to read the Hobbit to the class. Immediately I was drawn into this incredible story; it was *certainly* like nothing else I'd ever read! Even when the teacher stopped reading it for class, I'd skip lunch and recess just to hear him read this story.Fast forward. I am 19 years old now, and I just finished this book for the 3rd time. I still find it surprising that this book is really that good. Of all the things I liked when I was in 4th grade, the Hobbit is the only thing that I still like - no, love - today. TRULY a great book. You discover new things in the story each time you read it. Even after the third time, it still is a *truly* enjoyable book to read.Children's literature? No, children's literature nowadays is along the lines of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; or &quot;Sweet Valley High.&quot; This isn't ANYTHING like today's &quot;children's literature.&quot; Steer your kids away from the Goosebumps tales and get this book for them!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit 10 times already, and believe me, one does not get bored! Escaping goblins, guessing riddles to save your life, and meeting the dragon Smaug, trust me, life can't get more exciting for a timid little hobbit, especially Bilbo! My social studies teacher read it, my cousin read it, my uncle read it, my friends read it, even my 6 year old sister read it! ( well, I read it to her) If you want a good book, THIS IS THE ONE TO READ! Bilbo also gets to do some fun stuff like meet Elrond the elf, ride down a river on a barrel, and fly in the sky on the back of an eagle. If you think this book is good, try reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy. IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I cannot number the times I have read this and the other Middle Earth books.

It's an adventure story that's great fun to read, but it also deals with friendship and loss. We truly feel what Bilbo goes through in the story. His sorrow is our sorrow, his heroism gets your own adrenaline pumping. The characters are wonderfully developed. If you want a fun book to read, I highly recommend The Hobbit.

From the beginning this book grabs you. You forget that you are on earth and you are transported to another world where evil is always on your heels but good always reins. The charactor development is unreal, you feel like you are right there with Bilbo and Frodo and all the other wonderful and dreadfully scary creatures that Tolkien has created. I must and I will insist that if you read this book, you have to read the Lord of the Rings.

I highly recomend this book to fantasy readers of all ages. A must read"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the first to a series of five books on Middle Earth. After I read The Hobbit, I just had to get hold of the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The language is clear, simple, yet passionate and definitely romantic. The road to Middle Earth is laid before the reader; all he has to do is take it. The journey, it would seem, ends with the boat to beyond the sea in the 3d volume but to fully claim a share in Tolkien's Middle Earth is to go back to the 'history' of this magical world. Tolkien provides such a history in a 5th book which is just as, or even more, magical than the first four books. And to think that this fantastic journey deep into Middle Earth (and into one's own magic) starts with the road just outside the steps of a small hobbit hole in The Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The novel, \\"The Hobbit\\", by J.R.R.

He encounters a creature called Gollum and finds a ring that makes the wearer invisible. He goes through caves, meets humans and has a close call with a dragon called Smaug.The book is a fun fantasy adventure story with a great deal of depth to the world it takes place in.

My New Year's resolution was to finally do just that - with the help of Rob Inglis. His unabridged reading of the story on CD engages the reader so much more with the use of inflection, characterization and personality. It was surprising to discover a few of the words being read were different in my book, and in three places whole sentences were missing. Still, I am currently in the middle of the book and can safely say that I will repeat this experience once a year for the rest of my life! I love the story, the narration, and it is time well spent. As logic would dictate I look forward to reading the Lord of the Rings along to Rob Inglis' unabridged narration on CD as well!

The Hobbit book that we read from contained no pictures, only story. This aided my students in seeing what the characters looked like and relating pictures to the actual story. I loved the illustrations and color."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book now i can read it whenever i want, fast speedy delivery, great shape."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is J.R.R Tolkien's first book, creating Middle Earth, LOTR, and 3 great movies.The story takes place about 61 years before Fellowship of the Ring.

The Dwarves need to reclaim their home, the Lonely Mountain, where the dragon Smaug has taken their treasure! Bilbo's burguling[sp?] skills could help them greatly. So the adventure begins.This is a great prequel. It also tells the full story on how Bilbo got the Ring from Gollum! If you love LOTR, you will enjoy The Hobbit! A very charming read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Michael H. I think it was an interresting book because it is magical, with wars, elves, dragons, goblins, hobbits and wizards. I think this book is very enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to any reader who likes to be taken away to another land which had creatures that have majical powers. The main charcter, Bilbo, is a hobbit that writes about his adventure, has fun, loves company and sometimes is couragous. His story is one of mystery over this magical ring. The power that that the ring contains helps Bilbo during his advendture in Middle Earth.

Eventually one thing leads to another, and he, seven dwarves, and Gandalf are on a wondrous adventure. They battle orcs and wargs, and many other exciting things.Well in conclusion I must say that this is not your typical adventure/fantasy book. Every boy and girl should read it. I hope you enjoyed my review."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic of children's fantasy for good reason - it is fun, light-hearted, full of adventure, episodic in nature (so no need to follow a complex plot), and simply BEGS to be read out loud. All this combines for a perfect adventure tale.Those coming in fresh from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" should be forewarned, the tone here is much lighter that the \`trilogy,' the writing very much meant for children (or to be read to children). It's a great read, but if you come in expecting more of what you got in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you will be disappointed. Be prepared to read a children's book, because that's what this is.For those willing to plunge into children's fantasy, however, \\"The Hobbit\\" is simply a delight. Bilbo Baggins, something of a homebody, is the hobbit in question. He is pulled into an adventure with a wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves. Their quest is to venture across dangerous mountains and dark forests to reclaim treasure stolen by a terrible dragon, Smaug.What follows is a series of adventures that have our heroes meeting trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, elves and more. Each encounter is an adventure unto itself, with a thrilling climax that leads us to the next. The adventure is nonstop. Each chapter brings a new discovery.Tolkien's writing is clear, straightforward and very \`English.' It is also written with an ear for reading aloud, breaking the \\"fourth wall\\" on occasion to speak directly to the reader. This book is meant to be read to children - and no wonder, since Tolkien wrote it specifically to read to his own kids.Fans of Middle Earth discovering the wonderful land through \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will find things to enjoy here (if they are willing to sink into the lighter tone). We see our first glimpses of Gollum and the One Ring. Elrond, too, appears in Rivendell. We hear about some of Middle Earth's ancient lore, like Gondolin, see the origins of famous swords like Sting, and meet dwarves who play a part in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The cross references, while not vital, will bring a smile to your face and will enhance your enjoyment of the famous trilogy.For those looking to explore Tolkien's world, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a no brainer. Along with the classic trilogy and \\"The Silmarillion\\" (a difficult read for some), it makes up the three essential Middle Earth works.For those simply looking for a good children's fantasy in the same realm as C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles or Lloyd Alexander's Prydain saga, you won't go wrong with \\"The Hobbit.\\" This is fun stuff that even adults will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like fantasy books, the Hobbit is a must read. This book inspired me to read all three Lord of the Rings books that are also amazing. It is one of my favorite books of all time. Despite what people say, the book is not boring at all. The begining can be a little slow, but once you get into it there is no putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien Published by Houghton Mifflin CoBilbo stooped down to pick up the shiny object. It was a ring. He slipped it on and... Want to hear more? This is one of my favorite books because it is fantasy and that is my favorite genre. There are wizards and battles and lots of cool things in it. It is a long book but it needs to be to have all of the right details which it does have.The main characters of the story are: Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, all of the dwarves, Smaug and so many more that I could go on and on. First of all the character that the story focused on is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit that lives in a hole in the side of a hill. Hobbits travel in bare feet and they are about 3 feet tall. He calls his home Bag End. Bilbo is a normal hobbit who doesn't like adventure and who eats 3 or 4 breakfasts. The only thing is that Bilbo finds a liking for adventure and that is how the book begins. Gandalf the Grey is a wizard who has taken a liking to Bilbo. Gandalf is a traveler who fights evil and befriends the good. Gandalf is the reason for the whole book because he starts the adventure. The dwarves are about the same size as the hobbits though they look nothing like them. Dwarves have beards and wear hats and are the greatest miners and blacksmiths. They are in the journey only to get something they own back from Smaug. Lastly as you know, there is Smaug. Smaug is a dragon that lives in a mountain. He is almost indestructible though he has one weakness that is revealed in the book. Smaug is also an important part of the book.I would recommend this book to anybody who likes fantasy, wizards, battles and old things like that. This is one of my favorite books because I like all of the old beliefs. I couldn't put this book down because it was so exciting. This book was put together so well that you were never lost and you could always find something good about any part of the book while you could almost never find something bad. I think that anybody with reading talents can easily read this book although some of the words are a little hard to pronounce so you might want a parent or an older person around to help you with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever thought of slaying a dragon? That is what Bilbo Baggins does in this book. Bilbo is an innocent hobbit who does not know anything about the wide world. Suddenly he finds himself in a great adventure to slay a dragon. Bilbo leaves the Shire and goes to the city of Dale. He goes though seven obstacles. On the way he finds a ring that makes him invisible. This story will lead into the series Lord of the Rings. J.R.R Tolkien makes a whole new world in your imagination. People ages 6 to 60 would love this book. This book is much like Brian Jacques. I think you should read this adventurous and magical book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book. I have never been able to read a book very easily because I could never pay attention long enough, but this book really caught my attention the whole time.To begin with, a wizard visits the hobbit, whose name is Bilbo Baggins. The wizard puts a mark on the hobbit's door and then leaves. Later twelve dwarves visit the hobbit. They hire him as a burglar to help in their quest.He finally decides to go along, but highly against his own will. They start on the journey and have all sorts of strange happenings that occur. They encounter goblins and are taken into the depths of a very large underground network of tunnels. Here, Bilbo finds a ring that is quite magical. He does not know it yet, but the ring will prove to be a very vital part of their quest.After the goblins, they meet a man who is both Man and Bear. They manage to ask him for food and lodging for a while, though he does not like strangers. At night, Bilbo hears sounds of scratching and thumping, but does not dare to get up for fear of being eaten by Beorn, who is the Man/Bear. In addition, Beorn's animals have the ability to communicate with him and can do most anything that a regular man can.The Mirkwood Forest is quite peculiar in itself. The group of twelve dwarves and Bilbo must travel through a forest that is extremely dark. Although it is daytime, the forest is very dimly lit because all the trees form a canopy, which blocks all the light. Near the end of the forest, they become lost. They are forced to battle huge spiders and are eventually captured Wood-elves.Bilbo slips on his ring in time and is able to follow the elves as they take the dwarves to the cavernous hideout. Each dwarf is questioned to try to find out why he is traveling through the Mirkwood Forest. None will give the answer that the Elf King is looking for, so he throws them all in prison.While the dwarves are in prison, being quite well fed, Bilbo figures out a means of escape for all of the dwarves and himself. He also has time to learn quite a lot about the inside of the elf cavern. Bilbo gets the chance when a guard and another man go and taste the new wine that has been brought. Both become drunk and fall asleep. Bilbo is able to get all the dwarves out and himself.After this, they are not far from the dragon's lair. Smaug has taken all of the dwarve's treasure in gold and jewels and is in a cave on the Lonely Mountain. The quest of the small company is to reclaim the treasure that is rightfully the dwarves'. Bilbo faces Smaug and...I cannot tell you what happens, that would ruin it. They also face a war, but you will have to read to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed and easy to remember. I usually lose track of who is who in a book, but this book was easy to keep track of the characters. The book is actually quite believable if the reader looks past the fact that the characters are dwarves and a hobbit. I was quite lost throughout the book wondering what the characters were actually feeling. I felt this was a very believable story.I have never been able to sit down and read a book as easily as I did this one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book. It keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat and has action in almost every page that is read. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter who he or she is. This book is deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, I think this is a good book for ages 11 and above. This is a great fantasy/adventure for girls and boys.

I am a big fan of Fellowship, and therefore this book left me wanting......more?LOTR trilogy is a darker story with a better view on the evils in our world. The Hobbit, to me, while a fun story, seemed more innocent and almost naive. After a friend explained to me that The Hobbit was written before the death of his son, while LOTR was written after, it seemed to make more sense. However, I prefer the harder journey, for I feel that there is much more earned at the end.The story is a fun story, one that I am sure we will read to our children. But as a 24 year old, I just felt that it wasn't what I was looking for in a novel. Yes, it is a classic and I believe it is for a reason, but I believe it is for a younger audience.

The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The actual audio for this audiobook is enjoyable (what I was able to listen to) but beware I've now purchased 2 sets of these only to find that the disks were damaged.

Tolkien book on the market. Being a huge fan of Tolkien's work, I have read just about every book there is to offer, and have not found one yet that is better than The Hobbit. The book starts by introducing you to a boring, normal hobbit that has no idea he will someday be one of the most famous hobbits ever. While sitting down to his usually noon tea he gets a knock on the door and opens it to find a pair of dwarves standing outside. Being his freindly self he invites them in for a cup of tea. Before long the door has been opened 6 times revealing a total of 12 dwarves that are all seeming to be of some relation. By the time Bilbo (the hobbit) knows what is going on, his tookish side gets the best of him, and he is swept out the door on an adventure of a lifetime. On the way Bilbo discovers their quest is to kill off a dragon that has taken their ancestors mountain along with all the treasures inside. Bilbo is quite pleased when he finds out his reward will be one fourteenth of treasure. Along the way, however, the group faces many hardships, dangerous encounters, and deadly battles. This book keeps you on your toes and guessing what is going to happen next. Unlike other Tolkien books I found it to be quite humouros. There are not as many battles as in the lord of the rings series, but there are just as many near death encounters. Overall this was probably the best book I have read in months, because of Tolkien's ability to make you believe that this could have actually happend. If you have read any other Tolkien book and enjoyed it, you will love this book! My advice to you is to purchase The Hobbit today and discover the mystical world of Middle Earth!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was never in to Lord of the Rings Or J.R.R. Tolkien until I saw the movie. I didn't like the movie very much until my friend brought it over and let me hold it. I instantly fell in love with it. And felt that I was almost forced to Buy Tolkien's Literary works. After much and much hesitition, I knew that I was bound to like the book so I said why not go all out and buy this GREEN LEATHERETTE HOBBIT, AND THE LORD LORD OF THE RINGS RED LEATHERETTE.editions of the book.I read the Hobbit in 6 days. The book starts off very entertaing but later on becomes rather dry. However not dry enough to make it unbearable.The Green Leatherette edition is 317 pages, and about 4 full color glossy drawings, and as well as about 10 or more other drawings. The Drawings are not bad, especailly since they were drawn by Tolkien himself who is known for his writing skills not his drawing skills. The book becomes dry when they leave the wood elf spot, and they have to go through mirkwood, where there are many spiders and other creatures. The book then picks up later when they arrive at Loneley mountain, the end of the book, where they have to steal the treasures from the Dragon Smaug who guards the treasures. Which is about 60 pages of the book, completely on the part with Smaug and before Smaug dies.The book I would reccommend to people between the ages of 5-?? the book is very good, and should be read by all readers of all ages.The book has illustrations but does not need them to help the story progress, I could litterally sit there and draw out the things described with out being bored, as other books do.The book has nearly no violence and is a very light hearted adventure of a \\"hobbit\\" Bilbo Baggins who never went on any adventures or unexpected events, but with his meeting up with the Wizard \\"Gandalf The Grey\\" he tells Bilbo about going on a quest that will make him rich. The next day, Gandalf comes back with the Dwarves who Bilbo will spend his adventure with and tells him everything(or not so much as everything).The quest starts simple enough and seems like a typical fantasy( which J.R.R. Tolkien is the author who spawned the genre as a whole) Bilbo is hired as a burglar to accompany a group of thirteen Dwarves to the Loneley mountain. Once at the Loneley mountain Bilbo will have to pilfer the Dragon Smaug of all his un needed treasures. The book starts simple but ends with many hardships and is very enjoyable, readers 5-12 highly reccomended,but other age groups don't expect much violence."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Geoff MMay 19, 2003I read the book called The Hobbit. I was very interested in reading this book after I watched The Lord of the Rings movies that came out in theatres. I feel that this book had an ideal audience ages 12 and up. The concept of the book is made for a younger audience but there are some things in the book that make it for an older audience. The book references drinking and smoking which to little kids is not a big deal but some may think that younger kids are not suited for that kind of stuff.This book was full of literary techniques; the first example is imagery. Imagery is found throughout the book and in fact is on the first page of the book. The author does a great job of describing the characters traits and it paints a picture in the readers mind. Imagery is also used when the main character Bilbo is walking through the forest, the author paints the pictures of the forest through the use of imagery. Even though imagery is good in a book sometimes the author put to much detail in little things such as spending two pages describing the pony. The other literary technique used by the author was the use of personification. The author seemed to make everything in the book come to life. The best example I can thing of was when Bilbo met the little creature named Gollum. Gollum lived in the cave and when he ran from Bilbo he jumped into the water and the author described the water as running away from the shore. As we all know, water can not run thus the author was using personification to give the water human traits.This book had me so caught up in the rich plot; I couldn't even put it down. My emotions were mixed when I was reading it. At first I thought it was an adventure and then the book took my emotions and changed them because the characters ran into so many different challenges. My reactions to the book were good, but I thought that the whole story line was too quick. What I mean is that the stories plot seemed a little to quick to seem real. My overall impressions of this book were good. I liked the story line and I loved how the book ties in close with The Lord of the Rings movies. Before reading this book I was a little worried because it was a classic book and I thought right away that the book would be boring. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasy world type of stories and people who liked The Lord of the Rings movies. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars and I feel that everyone needs to read this classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins, a small, unimpressive creature called a hobbit, embarks on an adventure that will change the world of Middle Earth forever. In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien begins to weave the greatest fantasy story in literary history. Blibo lives in his cozy little hobbit hole, far away from any danger, in a place called the Shire. Life is peaceful for the Hobbits, especially Bilbo, but his peace won't last. When Gandalf and Thorin and Co. pay the little hobbit a visit and offer him the adventure of a lifetime, Gandalf goads the little hobbit into joining the dwarves' adventure. The dwarves (Thorin and Co.) plan to march to the Lonely Mountain where they will smite the dragon Smaug and reclaim their ancient treasure under the mountain. Gandalf had told the dwarves that Bilbo would go as their burglar, when in fact Bilbo was far from a burglar. As the group of fourteen treks towards the Lonely Mountain, Tolkien uses the timid hobbit, in various adventures, to convey how even the smallest being can become a hero to all. Tolkien made a comprehensive history to his stories, which makes the story feel real, like it actually happened. By never switching characters and always concentrating his writing on the hobbit, Tolkien creates a story that flows exquisitely. It captivates the mind, and Tolkien's descriptive writing makes the reader feel like he or she is actually there with the hobbit on his marvelous adventure.By: Joseph Hill"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, or even gruesome may make a good tale, and take a great deal of telling anyway.\\"In The Hobbit, Tolkien has created his own world independent from our own. The fictitious Middle Earth is complete with its own history and family trees. Set in a time before Men are the reigning species, The Hobbit is unlike any other fantasy novel. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is employed by a wizard with a questionable reputation called Gandalf. He's hired as a thief to travel with a band of dwarfs to steal back their long-lost treasure. Throughout his treacherous journey through Middle Earth, Bilbo battles fantastic Middle Earth creatures as well as his own fear. This book is a masterpiece no one should miss."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, chronicles the travels of Bilbo Baggins and his troop of dwarves. The overall setting is in the fictitious world of Middle-Earth. The story begins in the Shire at Bilbo's home and journeys through opaque labyrinths and inscrutable wilderness. The wizard, Gandalf, directly foreshadows the role of Bilbo in this book, and why he was included on this perilous quest, with the statement, \\"Bilbo is stronger than you or he knows.\\" Bilbo, while skeptical of his abilities, proceeds to prove his worth and valor again and again. Throughout the book, the virtues of courage and intelligence are shown to greatly influence the outcome of any predicament. Bilbo, an unlikely representative of good, triumphs over evil. Hordes of mythical beasts, such as goblins, trolls, evil wolves, giant spiders, and mischievous elves all oppose Bilbo and company in their quest for the Lonely Mountain. The areas of the journey in which there is darkness are always associated with evil. In the end, it is Bilbo all alone, and he is forced to demonstrate a courage previously unknown to him as he faces the personification of evil, the great dragon Smaug, guardian of the Lonely Mountain. One of the few grievances I have with this novel is the lack of complexity in the characters. Understandably, Bilbo is the only dynamic character, however we know very little about the dwarves that accompany him throughout this adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the unabridge verison of the book very enjoyable to listen to particularly because the songs are all sung instead of just read.

The first time was after my freshman year in college in 1965, the next four times during the ensuing ten years, and the sixth time with my children in 1990. After so much time spent with this book, reading it was more like remembering than discovering.With all the hype surrounding the release of the movies, I decided to revisit Middle Earth. Since my dog-eared paperback copy disappeared long ago, I decided to purchase the \\"Leatherette Collector's Edition\\" published by Houghton Mifflin, and I am glad I did. This very nice edition contributed to my enjoyment of revisiting my old friends. The heavy paper, nice green line at the top of each page, and beautiful typography definitely enhance the overall experience.The only negative I found with the book was the illustrations, which are \\"by the author\\", who was a much better author than illustrator. The drawings and watercolors have historical interest, but do little to add to the experience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a story about a hobbit named Bilbo. He is invited to go on a journey with thirteen dwarves who are going to their homeland to reclaim the land and their gold. The main character is Bilbo, who is afraid to take risks and likes to keep to himself. The head of the dwarves is Thorin, who leads the others to the gold. A wizard named Gandalf helps Bilbo and the dwarves on their journey. Bilbo acts as a burglar for the dwarves and rescues the dwarves in a lot of situations. The dwarves lead the way to the mountain to get the gold. Gandalf acts as a protector and advice giver to Bilbo and the dwarves. The characters run into a lot of trouble and adventures in the story. Each trouble is an adventure in the story like when the dwarves get caught by bad guys like goblins and spiders. They also fight a big battle with five armies. In all of the adventures Bilbo rescues the dwarves. My favorite character in the story was Gandalf because he was very powerful, and he was very wise.I can't really relate to any of the characters, except Bilbo, because he likes to stay at home all by himself. I also like to stay by myself too, so I can do whatever I want without anyone telling me what to do. I really liked the book; I thought the book was very imaginative. My favorite part of the book was at the beginning when the author described Bilbo's house in detail as if I were really there looking at it. If I could change a part in the book, I would have the dwarves-instead of Bard-kill the dragon. I recommend this book because it is a really good book.

The characters are motivated by all the troubles that they undergo in the book but the keep going on &amp; on.

I especially enjoyed the plot of the book. It is expertly paced to with the chaotic moments separated by clever conversations and character development. I was hard pressed to find really any kind of weaknesses in this book, which is part of the reason that it is known as a classic. One of the negatives I found though was that of the 13 dwarves in the party, really only half of them are actually useful and have an important role in the story. I cannot even remember hearing Oin and Bifur's names being used in the story besides the beginning where they are introduced and the end. Another small issue I found with The Hobbit was that how Bilbo was able to expertly fight off many different beasts and creatures with his sword even though he had no past experience with one.

What did surprise me- and what did not translate into the movie- was the clever, convoluted and crafty writing style J. R. R.

Not bad but not what I was expecting.Of course, you still get the book text itself, which is a great read, and this is a good price for that alone (although I prefer the edition that has &#34;illustrations by the author&#34;, with more Tolkien, and obviously includes the entire book text too, and also at a good price). If you're a student of writing and/or of Tolkien, this annotated edition is probably a very good buy, but if just a person who enjoys The Hobbit and hopes to get great insights into it, okay but I don't think great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was the first book I ever read..

I got it for my Kindle just to reread it again. Love anything by Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First off, I absolutely love The Hobbit. It is one of my all time favorite books. The cover is pretty neat. I didn't have as many problems with binding and poor quality paper as a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviewers apparently had. However, as I finished the wonderful story I was needless to say, quite shocked. Where was the gold that was suppose to come spilling out of the last page? I thought this novel was full of magic and I assumed the 70th Anniversary Edition would really amp it up. I mean at this point in the digital revolution why the hell are there still paper books? Where are the goddamn holograms that illustrate the action on every page? And why didn't this magical 70th addition come with a long wizard pipe? How the hell am I suppose to enjoyed Tolkien's wonderful words without smoke rings in the shape of dragons flying around my head? Way to go whatever publishing house is responsible for the myriad let downs I experienced after reading this particular edition.J.RR Tolkien's corpse is subsequently cursing those philistines for ruining his wonderful work. I bet some jackass producer wants to make a live action movie version of the Hobbit with Bruce Willis as Gandalf and Danny Devito as Thorin. Note to movie executives LEAVE OUR GODDAMN BOOKS ALONE.

It got kind of boring at some parts. I did enjoy a few parts of it though. It was worth reading but not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didnt really enjoy this book because it was hard for me to understand. I understood the characters and i could picture what they looked liked because it has good discription, but other than that the rest of the book didn't grab my intrest. The biggest reason I didn't like this book was probably because it wasn't real, like how the hobbits lived under ground. After reading this book I relized that i'm just not into fantasy stories."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book a number of times over the years and have never grown tired of the tale. The story involves the sudden arrival of a wizard into the quiet village called the Shire. The wizard informs our hero, the hobbit - Bilbo Baggins, that he will be visited soon with a great task. Bilbo soon finds himself involved (not by his choice) in helping a band of dwarfs in an exciting tale of adventure and wonder.We follow Bilbo and the band of dwarfs as they make their way through many perilous areas. Fighting goblins, trolls, and wolves; captured by elves; and finding a dragon. All the makings of an endless tale. It is great to see how the chracter of Bilbo develops. Bilbo is reluctant at first to go on this adventure, but then realizes that one small hobbit can make a difference.This story introduces the reader to the world of Middle Earth. A world full of wonderful and amazing creatures and people. When I first read this story I was captivated by the intricate world that Tolkien had created. Little do we know that this story is the beginning of the end for the Third Age of Middle Earth.I know enjoy reading this story to my children and watching their eyes widen at various adventures encountered."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The lord of the rings trilogy was just straight and flat out boring. I hated those books so much that I couldn't describe. The hobbit, however, is ten times better and actually has some good stuff and action scenes to it. The whole thing is interesting, since the plot is very unique, and also the characters are richly and warmly developed. This is the stuff that good fantasy is made out of, and I don't know why Tolkien changed his writing skills when he wrote lord of the rings. Anyways, this book rocks. It's a great book to read next to the fireplace on a rainy night inside your home, and the paintings which are held inside this book, (In other words what Tolkien describes and how he describes it) Is simply and positively extraordinary and different from all other books that I have read, and I've read lots of books. Anyways, get this book. At first, it didn't really seem interesting. But a lot of great books don't immediatly start out interesting. But after the slow parts, it's like a rollar coaster. The lord of the rings, however, was slow all the way through. I'm surprised that people even manage to read all three installments.Anyways, this book is great. Many other authors have copied Tolkien and just came out with pale imitations. This is the original fantasy book which started the entire genre of good fantasy epic novels. Read this book. It's excellent."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must confess, I did not like the hobbit until I heard it dramatized, and then only somewhat.

Until *The Hobbit, Part I* becomes available on DVD, I'm posting the film review here.]WARNING: Spoilers ahead!While Gandalf the Wizard [Ian McKellan] remains timeless, it was obvious from the start that the Bilbo Baggins of three *The Lord of the Rings* films fame [Ian Holm, now pushing 80 years old] would have to bow out for the making of *The Hobbit*. Director Peter Jackson had surely asked himself, \\"Who could portray a young Ian Holm?\\", (but not necessarily a younger Bilbo Baggins since we now perceive Bilbo to look like the actor.) Answer: Martin Freeman. And he was right - Freeman effortlessly coalesced into the lead role.In the first of the two *The Hobbit* entries [sub-titled: *Into The Wilderness*], a more youthful Bilbo Baggins is craftily crow-barred by Gandalf into embarking upon a great adventure (Hobbits *despise* adventures!) and by serving as a burglar for a grumbly troupe of thirteen dwarves, all of whom are determined to reclaim their lost family treasure from the Evil dragon, Smaug; however, the actual battle with Smaug at the Lonely Mountain will have to wait until Part II [to be entitled: *Into the Fire*] is released.Part I largely focuses upon the history of the dwarves and the initial hazards that they encounter during their single-minded quest, chiefly battling orcs in the Misty Mountains and finishing with their tribulations with the giant spiders of the vast and ominous Mirkwood forest.It's worth noting right off that the screenwriters very shrewdly rehabilitated the puerile songs of the dwarves [found throughout the book], transforming them into a range of vivid action scenes. This strategy achieved a pair of worthy ends: 1. I've heard audio versions of this story and to include the dwarf renderings of these archaic and lengthy songs would have been in profound conflict with an effective film conveyance. 2. These newly-fashioned scenes provide additional fodder for the artful expansion of the general lack of book material, thereby reinforcing audience interest.Honestly, a movie version of Tolkien's *The Hobbit* could feasibly have been corralled within a single feature-length film [just think of all the ground that was covered inAvatar (Original Theatrical Edition)] -- but the financial anticipations of the producers [greed], which tended to tenon seamlessly with Peter Jackson's lust for detail, had dictated long ago that viewers would have to hang on for a \\"final\\" conclusion. Part I features an ending of a sort but perhaps it would be more forthright to regard it as a dramatic finale.One looming uncertainty which has kept Tolkien fans off-balance was whether the screenwriters would go dark with *The Hobbit* in an effort to effectively link it up withThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)series, particularly since Tolkien originally penned the earlier work as a sort of kids' fairy tale. In retrospect the answer to the question was probably evident to Peter Jackson from his earliest conception of a film version, noting additionally that his time-honored philosophy is that first-class films cannot simply mirror the books from which they are taken. A good screenplay massages a book for all it's worth but the visual and audio aspects must be fully accommodated too.Particular figures such as Gandalf, Elrond [Hugo Weaving], Galadriel [Cate Blanchett] and, Gollum [Andy Serkis] have already been firmly established in terms of image and it would be less than prudent at this juncture to radically manipulate the personalities of these prominent returning characters. And speaking of Galadriel, she was never a personage to be found in *The Hobbit* but Peter Jackson mined her from Tolkien's trilogy, casting her very strategically in his film version (along with Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom who also did not appear in *The Hobbit*) to further expand the script. Blanchett's presence additionally helped to overcome the gender gap of the book version. Still, these two actors are not in any way just add-ons -- their respective roles and performances have imparted considerable gravity to the story.It is impossible to separate this film's noir-ish ambiance from Howard Shore's magnificent soundtrack. He's done it again! Upbeat and even a bit frivolous at the outset, the filmscore soon slips furtively into darker realms as the story advances, a few heroic themes being reserved for the appropriate dramatic moments. One is acutely taken with the leitmotif which Shore appended to Beorn, a Prokofiev-ish ponderousness integrated with a more serious Beethoven-like dignity... the perfect musical emulsion for the venerated skin-changer.Once initial New Zealand and Australian actors' guild stumbling blocks were surmounted, the Kiwi locations again became a reality, a twin-island geography wholly adequate for the production when supplemented by studio settings, all of which have lead to the presentation of an astonishingly exceptional end-product. It would certainly have proven problematic to reproduce The Shire's Hobbiton in Eastern Europe, a location which was suggested during the early union-troubled days.Martin Freeman's dazzling performance has eclipsed even that of Elijah Wood's stellar lead role in *The Lord of the Rings* films. The former's ebullient energy ironically seems to have retrospectively amplified Ian Holm's earlier portrayal of Bilbo in the New Line Cinema trilogy of films. The remaining cast members have also set the viewers at complete ease as they creatively played out their respective roles. Peter Jackson undoubtedly learned early in his career that, given spot-on casting, at least half the battle is won. And it's hardly surprising that a particular limelight shines on Fili [Robert Kazinski] and Kili [Aidan Turner] since this caveat, for those of us who already know the story, will markedly impact most of us when we get to view the second film. The director is clearly looking ahead.In the larger view *The Hobbit* story lacks the bulwark of heroic figures which we encountered throughout *The Lord of the Rings* series, Aragorn, Boromir, Theoden, Faromir, and so on. Still, imposing characters such as Elrond, Beorn, and Bard the Bowman provide us with a subliminally more-than-adequate melodramatic security blanket. The bottom line is that this superb movie is not simply the detritus of *The Lord of the Rings* films. It's gratifying that Peter Jackson was shrewd enough to not endeavor upon such a futile follow-up attempt -- he created this film from scratch. Embracing that same notion, the screenwriters saw to it that the storyline endured sufficient jumbling so that the tale is not precisely as linear as the one we encounter in the book. This film stands on its own.With better than a baker's dozen of little folks in starring roles the temptation to over-incorporate moments of comic relief [vignettes of Gimli] must have rivaled the gnawing urge which only The One Ring could normally generate. While some tasteful levity fell well within the bounds of a palatable script, I did actually breathe a sigh of relief once I realized that few such incidents were forthcoming.The computer generated images aspect of the movie, while perfectly executed and integral to the overall work, are nicely supplemented by scale doubles, forced perspective images, miniatures, and other Jackson-ish tricks of the trade. No fear -- these facets of the film are all first-class and delightfully palatable. Gollum is better than ever. Additionally, due accolades can hardly be suitably imparted to all the folks who helped to polish this film to excellence by means of effective make-up, articulate stunt work, unequaled cinematography, precise production design, and all the other crew activities which only ever seem to rate a fleeting line of scrolled credit.One is pleased to observe that the new role of Warner Brothers and MGM [Hollywood-based companies which recently acquired New Line Cinema] did not perceptibly obstruct Peter Jackson's proclivity for artistic detail. The casual but essential impedimenta present at every place where the Dwarfish Crusaders land aids us all to subconsciously believe in the reality of Middle Earth along with its numerous and varied inhabitants. Probably much credit for the focused attention upon the near-infinite number of magical nuances should go largely to Alan Lee, a man with an unbounded imagination coupled with a vast artistic talent.I present only a singular critique of this film and it has nothing to do with the body of the movie itself: I feel compelled to comment that the decision to incorporate the endless scroll of Tolkien Fan Club members' names within the end credits is ill-advised and indirectly demeaning to the actual cast and crew. What do these people actually contribute to the film's production? Loyalty and moral support? The folks who have indeed delivered something more tangible are appropriately noted elsewhere within the credits. But most of the listed individuals have played no real part whatever, regardless of the syrupy patronization conducted by the film-makers toward this particular faction of Tolkien enthusiasts. Including these names in the film credits, which also takes in the so-called self-appointed \\"guardians\\" of Tolkien's work [a trivial minority of Tolkien Fan Club members], amounts to little more than a shallow ego-bribe. It's presumptuous as the devil to assert that Tolkien's books *need* guarding by anyone -- the affiliation here is more akin to pretentious posthumous tail-gating on the venerable Old Master.The credits perquisite imparted by the film producers, appears in my view to ostensibly head off any whining outrage raised on the internet by those Tolkien radicals who are wholly unyielding in regard to the slightest manipulation of Tolkien's texts. This posture is pure nonsense. In the end, if one's name is included in the film credits then how can s/he ever issue an untainted appraisal of the film? In truth, such an individual could never ethically issue a fruitful critical review, (nor would they likely be *inclined* to criticize, which leads me to question the motives and ethics of the producers on this front.) But here I ramble witlessly upon a topic which only faintly deserves to be dignified by my attentions to it. In truth, my mini-rant is not even a legitimate film criticism - it's really just a pet peeve.In summary, *The Hobbit* contains enough MacGuffins and other surprise moments to make it seem like a new story while still paying a more than adequate tribute to Tolkien's original manuscript. Martin Freeman was surely a brilliant choice to play Bilbo. I can hardly wait to see Part II!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have nothing to say about the story except I enjoy it.

You can get lost in the reality of it. Tolkien definitley used his imagination for this book but for some reason you can think of it as real. It does start off a little slow and the pages are dense but it is worth the long read because you are enjoying it virtually the whole time. It talks of dragons and mythical creatures such as elves, goblins, giant spiders, and dwarves. The main character is a short, hairy-footed creature called a hobbit named Bilbo. When he get's tangled up in a party of dwarves going on a quest to seek their long lost treasure, Bilbo finds that he has a adventerous fun loving side to him he never fully knew. He encounters many scary things, including a dragon, and works his way through and makes many new friends. I think this book is something you should read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien created the Lord of the Rings books and then they turned into movies that amazed the world. But, before Lord of the Rings came the Hobbit. The Hobbit introduces Bilbo and Gandalf and all the other people. It's basically the prologue in the Lord of the Rings story. The story starts off with the party Bilbo wasn't expecting. That's why they call it The Unexpected Party. This only introduces the dwarves, Bilbo and Gandalf.After that, it's trolls, dragons and other mystical beings. Unsurprisingly, Bilbo and the dwarves can slay or escape all of them. But actually, it is kind of a surprising storyline. You won't know what is gonna happen next. But, why is this book good? Well.........The storyline is awesome and unpredicatable.You'll learn to like most of the characters, unlike some other stories I've read.Very big detail lets you see what's happening in your mind.There's a fat dwarf in it.But, of course, no novel is PERFECT. Just because The Hobbit is good, doesn't mean it's the best. Why would this book be bad?Well.........The first chapter(Unexpected Party) can confuse you at times.So many characters, you won't know which is which.The book annoyingly makes you flip back to find stuff you've already read. Well, it did with me.Thorin constantly reminds us about his past, which is unacceptably boring.The horrible Barrels Out of Bond chapter goes too far. Barrels swimming across an ocean is NOT exciting.Despite the many things wrong with this novel, they aren't very horrible things. The cons won't take away one star, giving The Hobbit a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As you read along, the adventures faced by Bilbo Baggins and his merry men, it is as if you have been locked up in a cage with just you and this book and you are on the edge of your seat from the moment you pick it up. Reading along there were times when I couldn't put the book down. It was unreal. You may have experienced battles in other books, but compared to little people of 4ft in height fighting against 10ft people you just it is just unbelievable how they manage to overcome them with victory that is all in mind. You have to read the book to understand the detail that the JRR Tolkien puts into these scenes. I have to say that the reason why I gave this book a four out of five was firstly because of the detail. The expressive words used within the book such as \\"He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts h could not scramble on top.\\" The descriptiveness of Bilbo's inability to climb up the tree in the quote is just of the many found in the book. Secondly I am a sucker from adventure stories. If you are like me then this is a book for you. The story goes on and never ends. You are left hanging until the last line. This is a classic in all minds and should not be a book overlooked. It is one for the whole family and I think that everyone should read the series in their lives."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an intriguing tale of a far away land.

The enunciation is very clear and the noise level is very low (i.e., a high quality recording).Having short (e.g., three-minute) tracks is really helpful. The packaging is very good. All around a very professional package."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, is a masterful piece chock full of mysticism and fantasy. This could easily be considered the epitome of great folklore. While adopting concepts from Greek epics such as Beowulf and other Norse legends, Tolkien continually surprises even the skeptic in us all. It has a series of twists and turns of mischievous deeds and heroicism, unraveling ever so slightly as the reader delves further in.As the novel begins, Bilbo Baggings, the humble, intelligent and often out-spoken hobbit, leads a quiet undisturbed life down in his hobbit hole at Bag End. However, soon enough this character is rudely awakened. And all his surrounding are in upheaval. This is a book of self-discovery and adventure; action and \\"peaceful\\" resolutions. It is an excellent read at any age.Tolkien is an absolute genius in the art of writing a fantastic trilogy or anything for that matter. He even devised an alphabet specifically for these books, a history and map of the lands in which these stories take place. This is and excellent example of fantasy type literature. The reader responds to Tolkien's writings like it is some sort of true happening in the news. This is fantastical writing and should be reviewed as such. Brilliant in all aspects, praise worthy. However, some parts did appear to be lacking. Where often times I found myself flipping from page to page for the action to pick up again.

Thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit are on a quest to find a hidden treasure, but first they must get past a dragon named Smage.The dwarfs and Bilbbo got caught by giant spiders and were wrapped up in webbing, but Bilbbo cut himself lose with his sword and killed the spiders. Bilbbo cut his friends loose and named his sword STING. The hobbit told the dwarfs to go on ahead so he could head off the rest of the spiders. When Bilbbo came out he saw that wood elves were taking the dwarfs away so he slipped on the ring and followed them to their castle by stealing the key and unlocking his friends. Then he escaped in the barrels.The dwarfs and hobbit got to Smage's cave and Bilbbo was talking. He watched them get locked up. Bilbbo found a way to get out had been. He took a cup and then confronted the dragon with his ring on so he was invisible and he Bilbbo went couldn't be hurt. The dragon thought it was a lake man so he flew to go destroy the town, but when Bilbbo got out, he told a raven to go tell the soldiers that they needed to hit him where the armor had been penetrated. By the time the raven got there, there was only one soldier left. The raven told him and he took his lucky arrow to kill the dragon, Smage.The gold and silver is theirs or is it?

This book introduces the character Gollum and explains how the Ring came to be in The Shire. However, what is enjoyable about this book is its easy readability and there are many injections (in parenthesis) of Tolkien's humour in his narration of the story. Read about the invention of Golf (in a ridiculous way), the riddles between Gollum and Bilbo and the humorous portrayal of Gandalf as an almighty but occasionally vulnerable wizard. There is only one main storyline about Bilbo and the dwarves heading to defy Smaug, the dragon, in order to uncover their lost treasure, but despite this, their journey is interestingly full of ups and downs. Tolkien, once again, proves his immense creativity by placing his characters in absurb and hilarious positions. Even Gandalf, the supposedly dignified wizard, has been reduced to getting cornered high up on a tree or stuffing himself silly on bread, cream and honey. Needless to say, the title &quot;The Hobbit&quot; indicates that the story revolves around Bilbo Baggins and his misadventures.Simply said, this is one book that wants to make you read on and on.

I really could not find anything wrong with the book, it is consistent and it kept me turning the pages. It also does a good job setting the pace to the other Lord of the Rings books. If you are ever bored and with a few hours to kill, definately pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Obviously &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a great book, what impressed me was how well Rob Inglis read it. Wonderful voices for each of the main characters and actually singing all the poems/songs really made me apprieciate them more!Fifteen birds in five fir trees!....."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, Or There and Back Again, is the wonderful prequal to the Lord of the Rings but, standing alone it still remains one of the best tales ever told. The adventure of Bilbo Baggins is the classic treasure hunt, complete with elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls and fire breathing dragon. Also, for the first time the reader meets such characters as Gandalf the Gray, Elrond Half-Elven, Balin, Gloin, and of course Gollum all who play either larger or lesser roles in the Lord of the Rings. Perhaps most importantly, is the account of the finding of the Ring of Power. Therefore, while clearly written with a younger audiance in mind, The Hobbit appeals to readers of all ages, for in it, the master of fantasy can clearly be seen honing the storytelling skills that have won him the praise of millions readers around the world. I can not wait until my neice and nephew are old enough for me to share this incredable tale with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great tale of the change that just a little hobbit can make to the world, and to himself.Bilbo Baggins a small hobbit of hobbiton invited a guest over one day to share a cup of tea. That guest in turn turned into many guests who would pressure him to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.After a dance and a party, 12 dwarves and a wizard (Gandalf) would inform Bilbo that he was to be the burglar on their journey to take the treasure from the great dragon Smaug. After one night Bilbo and the others set out on their journey. They encountered many obstacles but in the end Bilbo could almost always be trusted with the rescue of his group.I like how J. R. Tolkien laid out this story as a great prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy. She explains many main characters as well as the plot very descriptively. She does not, however, explain the significance of the most important item in her series, the ring. She does though display the recent origin and some of its magic.But I think there is a subtle message in this story, the smallest being can make the biggest difference. The small little hobbit, that at one point was scared to leave his smug house, soon emerged to become the great warrior that he was. This Hobbit would still a ring from and out riddle a sea-demon. Break into an Elfish castle, free his friends, and guide them to safety. He would also deal with a dragon, and steal a plot of treasure that could last a million lifetimes. But his greatest accomplishment was maturing to realize that when in danger you have to step up.This is a great adventure and a fine read. I advise this to anyone, who like me wants a compelling book that keeps you into the story. If you do read this, however, look for the subtle messages, they are the most important."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One day in my darkest hour, I was at a bookstore and picked up \\"The Hobbit\\".

Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped. Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses, and it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero, a tiny fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (&quot;It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort&quot;) His life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do...Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful &quot;wee&quot; people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was a gift from a family friend who knew of my passion for reading (as a 9yr old kid). But my taste favored more romantic and classical novels and so this book sat neglected on my bookshelf for 10 yrs! Finally, one day I decided to give it a chance and to my surprise I couldn't put it down! I finished the book in a day and in the following 3 weeks devoured the entire Lord of the Rings series which had also been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I have never been a fantasy fan, and still don't consider myself one... which just goes to show how excellent an author J.R.R. Tolkien is to have captured my imagination. The Hobbit is altogether a most charming read, filled with endless moments of adventure, humour and suspense. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters and the fantasy. I recommend this book to any book-lover who would like to sample a master-piece of unsurpassed creativity and imagination. Take it from a convert! *grin*"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Back in the late 1970's, in an era when radio drama was disappearing from public radio, the American prodcution of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were created with a full cast of voice actors along with music and sound effects. Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first fell in love with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in 6th grade.

But if you're looking for a fantastic listening experience, this is more than worth that minimal effort."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While the pages of this book have gold leafed edges like a bible, the pages aren't quite as thin. The printer did a great job of making smaller print text without any smudges and is actually still easily visible to someone like me who is kind of blind. The inside front cover has a colored map of Thorin's map of the secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. The back inside cover has a colored map of the Wilderlands. I like that these maps are in color and not black and white, but I don't mind that the illustrations inside are black and white. This book is small, but I doubt it could fit in my pocket. But, it is most certainly small and light weight enough to fit comfortably into my rucksack back pack and go with me wherever I go, which was the whole point of getting this so I'm very pleased with it, especially for the price. This is far superior to any previous paperback print of this book. The imitation leather cover is awesome as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" stands as the definitive edition to Tolkien's classic work. Douglas Anderson works from a simple premise - start with the final intent of Tolkien as can be reasonably determined and issue that as the main text, and then provide textual commentary, noting changes from previously published editions of the book, discuss possible sources and allusions, and frame characters, settings, and plot events in the context of Middle-earth and Arda at large.The book itself is a large, coffee table type book, featuring Tolkine's painting of Smaug set against the \\"Mirkwood\\" painting. Tolkien originally modelled the painting after a previous work, a color drawing, illustrating the elf Belg meetign Flindor (later renamed Gwindor) in the forest of Taur-na-Fuin. This watercoloured was first published in \\"Artist\\", No 54, and also appeared in the Tolkien Calndear 1974 under the title 1973. The back of the cover includes Tolkien's original description of \\"The Hobbit\\" from the original 1937 British edition.This edition contains Douglas Anderson's acknowledgements and thanks, Tolkien's \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\" and Anderson's extensive introduction to the book, and then obvioulsy the main text. There are two appendices: \\"A: The Quest for Erebor\\", \\"B: The Runes\\", then the Bibliography, and the Map of Wildernland. The introduction is an extensive essay on Tolkien, featuring information biographically and frames \\"The Hobbit\\" and its development and its sources in terms of its effects on Tolkien's mythology and also his writings for his children, even alluding to \\"The Oragog\\", an unpublished, unfinished story written by Tolkien in the early 1920s about a strange creature going through remarkable landsacpes. The intro also goes into detail regarding the composition of \\"The Hobbit\\", includes a facsimile of a page from one of the original manuscripts, and goes through the processes that led to the publication of the book, and also gives us extensive information on the revision history of the book as well as various foreign editions.The format of the book goes like this: there is the main text aligned so that is a large amount of white space on the left side of the left page, and the right side of the right page. [, with different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences. Then, onnumerall ]Different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences, with the annotations appearing on the aforementioned white space made available. The format works wonderfully as you can read the text uninterrupted and only refer to the annotations if you so desire. Unlike the 1988 edition of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", the annotations are in very close proximitiy to the text under discussion, so you can easily just read the annotation by looking right next to the text and then continue, and (in most cases) not have to flip pages and then return to the spot where you left off. Due to the length of some of the annotations, some [of the textual annotations] flipping will be required, but that is the exception, not the norm.Removing the textual annotations from appendicies in the 1988 edition and incorporating them in the main body of the book greatly assists in the ease and study of \\"The Hobbit\\" that this version actively accomdates and encourages. That is the key change between the original and the revised versions of \\"The Annoated Hobbit\\" in terms of format. In terms of content, there is not a lot of change, with one very significant exception. The second edition [also] features \\"The Quest for Erebor\\".Originally slated for publication in appendices \\"The Return of the King\\", this text was removed for considerations of space from the final product. The first text published was in \\"Unfinished Tales\\". Christopher Tolkien then published an earlier version in the 1996 book \\"The Peoples of Middle-earth\\", which was unknown to Christopher at the time of the 1979 \\"Unfinished Tales\\". The \\"Unfinished Tales\\" version is Text A. Then Tolkien wrote a typescript, Text B. Tolkien then wrote short, compressed version (most likely in order to retain this material in the final book). This is the third version (Text C).The version found in \\"Unfinished Tales\\" is an amalgamation of Text C with long extracts of B appearing after it, with Christopher's extensive commentary. The text in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" is Text B, which has never been published in its entirety before now.Although some previous reviewers have found this strange (which too me is odd, given the nature of annotated books), Anderson represents every single revision, and the original reading the revision replaced, in the form of annotation. Although some of these revisions are trivial, there is some highly interesting content present in the revision history of \\"The Hobbit\\". Most notably is the publication of the first edition version of Chapter Six, \\"Riddles in the Dark\\", where Bilbo first encounters Gollum. The first version radically differs from the 1947 rewrite that first appeared in 1951 and has become the definitive version of the chapter ever since. In the first version Gollum freely wants to give the ring away, and apologises profusely for not having the Ring to give to Bilbo after Bilbo wins the riddle contest, and shows Bilbo the way out in recompense for not having the Ring to give to him.Other interesting textual annotations are revisions where Tolkien brings consistency between his two major Hobbit books. He brings the geography of \\"The Hobbit\\" more into line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (changing \\"One afternoon thney forded the river\\" to \\"a river\\"), and most interestingly changes the original 1937 reading \\"swords of the elves that are now called Gnomes\\" to \\"swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin\\". Tolkien used Gnomes as the name for the Elves tribe of the Noldor in the 1920s and 1930s, and associated iwth the Greek work \\"thought, intelligence\\". Tolkien stated he abandoned the name, because \\"it is quite impossible to dissociate the name from the popular associations of the Paracelsan gno-mus = pygmaeus\\" (Letters, No. 239). Both examples are from Chapter 3, \\"The Last Homely House\\". There are several more examples like this, including one where Tolkien changed \\"after the sack of the mines of Moria\\" to \\"after the battle of the Mines of Moria\\", due to Tolkien's changing conception of his mythology\\".Some more interesting annotations deal with the stone giants from \\"Over Hill and Under Hill\\", which never appear anywhere else in the legendarium, and likewise the older city upon whose foundations Lake-Town was built upon, likewise never elaborated on anywhere else. Also included is a previously unpublished poem from Chapter 3.In regards to artwork and various editions, \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" includes numerous illustrations from forien editions of the novel, sprinkled liberally through out all ninteen chapters of the book. Due to space I won't list them all, with the exception of Josef Madlener's \\"Der Berggeist\\", a painting of an old man in a long hat sitting feeding a goat. Tolkien wrote on his copy of the picture that this was the origin of Gandalf.However, here is the artwork by Tolkien present, with page and chapter listed.

Little does he know of what challenges with he run across...One thing I like about this book is the way the author describes something.&quot;Hobbits are little people, smaller than dwarfs. They love peace and quiet and good tilled earth. They dislike machines, but they are handy with tools. They are nimble but don't like to hurry. They have sharp ears and eyes. They are inclined to be fat. They wear bright colors but seldom wear shoes. They like to laugh and eat(six meals a day)and drink. They like parties and they like to give and recieve presents. They inhabit a land they call The Shire, a place between the River Brandywine and the Far Downs.&quot;This is an excellent quote that is discriptive and simple at the same time. It caught my attention and provided me with lots of background information that I would stumble and be confused without.One thing that I dislike about this book is the way it lengthens things that are boring or get boring. Most of these things are not important in the story and easily get forgotten.They can also confuse you.&quot;You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.&quot;This is an example of somethings I dislike. If you are not really concentrated, this could confuse you. I had to read over that paragraph a couple times before I acually understood much of it. Later on in the book this paragraph seems irrelevant. You should also only try to read this book if you have a lot of time to spare. It is pretty long and there are lots of parts in the book that will take some time to understand.My favortie part of the book is the beginning. It caught my attention with good descriptions. They were not too long and acually told you how something looked or felt. There was no junk about descriptions that you can't even visualize and remember enough to care. The beginning was solid and it didn't leave you confused and wondering what the author meant. My least favorite part was Chapter 18. It didn't lead to an ending well. There were a couple boring parts that I wish were taken out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I ate 70,000 bags of chips while reading this book it's very nerve racking you never know how there are going to get out of difficult situations."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book, Tolkien was very talented!!

It takes place in the underground world of Trolls, Elves. Goblins and Dragons. Its about a hobbit named Bilbo. Hobbits are fat fuzzy creatures with long toes and fingers. He meets a lot of elves and they have to go steal back gold from a cave guarded by a dragon. I recommend this book because it is funny and the dialogue is great. The humor of the book is fantastic. For example in a cave two creatures start telling riddles and people will laugh and love it. I loved this funny and incredible book. Other people might say this book is terrible and dialogue free but it thinks it's magical. The Hobbit is a dialogue filled book but people sometimes don't understand. S0 READ CAREFULLY AND ENJOY...

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"POSSIBLY THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME, AND IT'S ONLY IN 300 PAGES! The Hobbit is about Bilbo Baggins. One day, Gandalf, a wizard, fooled Bilbo into an adventure.

You'll have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book starts out slow and boring. After I stuck out a few chapters this book I knew would be awesome. This book has great characters and story -settings. This story is about Bilbo Baggins an old hobbit who doesn't like adventure. But after he hears what the dwarves have in mind he is ready to go. They go on wild adventures and fight goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. Once they reach Lonely Mountain they find Smaug the dragon guarding what they had wanted most, the treasure.

A book of adventure and friendship, of bravery and cruelty. Poor Bilbo Baggins just wants to live a nice, comfortable life in his warm, snug hobbit hole like any other hobbit, but comes Gandalf, the magician who makes lovely fireworks displays, bringing a horde of dwarves with him, and from there it only goes downhill. They need a quiet, sneaky hobbit to help them recover their lost gold from the evil, fire-breathing dragon Smaug. Many dangers lie along their path, but courage and heart win them through. In the end, Bilbo realizes that there are much more important things in life than being comfortable and a world full of beauty beyond the Shire. After reading the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales, re-reading the Hobbit reveals a whole new world and a much darker side to this simple quest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC.

This was my first fantasy sci-fi book I have read. It had the perfect amount of fantasy to where I didn't feel like I was being assaulted by the make believe. Tolkien's story focused on the plot and kept the fantasy on the background.Own the paperbacks but I thought I'd buy this ebook edition too.Audio doesn't work but it's worth it for the other special editions added to book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was intended for a young and innocent - but not naive - audience. The tone of the story is lighthearted, yet it holds treasures of imagination and character development well worth exploring.Though I am no Tolkien scholar, like any thoughtful reader who compares this story to his later work, the Lord of the Rings (of which The Hobbit is supposed to be a prequel) the differences in the Middle Earth of The Hobbit versus LOTR are several, but not irreconcilable. Hobbits are, for the most part, as hobbits should be and are expected to be; when tossed (or dragged as in Bilbo's case) into adventure they prove themselves quite worthy of the label \\"hero\\" in the most unexpected ways. But you'll not find orcs; here they are goblins. Elves are very lightly sketched, being either rather silly as they sit in trees and sing la-la ditties, or as in Mirkwood where they are more ominous, magical folk who toss unsuspecting travelers into dungeons without a by-your-leave.It's Middle Earth in its infancy, in my opinion, but nonetheless has special charm. I enjoyed the magical \\"talking\\" birds and the shape-shifting land of Beorn. The dragon is deliciously evil, though his part short-lived.There are powerful characterizations. Bilbo's growth into a true Heroic type is treated honestly, showing both his errors in judgment and self-serving tendencies, as well as his golden moments. We watch Thorin's descent into greed with a clenched heart of sympathy and horror as the fairytale devolves into all-out war among races. Death and destruction are dealt with head-on and realistically, and the reader feels the impact of it.The first time I read it, I barely noticed that there is a total lack of female characters in this story. As to why, who knows? I doubt Tolkien was being mysogynistic and more likely, the product of his own time - as I am of mine, when we do expect to see more heroic females in literature.Overall, it's a gem of a story, a modern classic for good reason, and time well-spent for the lover of Fantasy. And if you want to understand Bilbo's finding of the One Ring, you need to read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is indeed a great book and there's no need to write a review of the author's work. However, you may find useful short (subjective) list of information on the edition with ISBN: 978-0-618-96863-3.- The paper wrapping looks perfect to me, the wrapping designed by the author is definitely something a fan must have. The picture is printed in color and a short history of its previous appearances is included in the book. What makes me little anxious is relatively fragile paper - if you want it to stay so nice, you should handle it very carefully.- Book contains two maps printed in black+blue, their paper is semi-glossy and looks resistant.- The paper of the book is appropriate, neither too thick nor too thin, it has smooth surface so it is a pleasure to read and turn the pages. The color of the paper is yellowish.- The book contains all author's illustrations that ever belonged to the title (according to the book's preface). Some of them are printed in black and white on the regular paper, some of them are included in color on the glossy white paper.I find this book to exactly match the expectations of a Tolkien fan - all in all, The Hobbit was meant to be children's book and that is how it looks and feels like."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the prequel to J.R.R.

I devoured the rest of the book (and the trilogy afterwards) and have been re-reading them all ever since (I stopped counting after my 45th time through!).

Since Peter Jackson chose to stretch one small children's book into 3 long movies it turns out you can easily read the book chapters covered by the movie faster than you can watch the movie, and reading the whole book only takes a few hours.As a children's book I think it is pretty damn good. You can see Tolkien building up ideas for Lord of the Rings: the easily-killed but numerous spiders are the building blocks for the much more sinister and powerful Shelob, the swords taken from the trolls were very reminiscent of the swords acquired from the Barrow-wight and used to kill the Nazgul, and the Battle of Five Armies is a smaller scale template for the epic battle of Helm's Deep.On a less positive note, I found the foreshadowing fairly annoying, and I'm not sure why it is there. Maybe Tolkien thought kids needed to be reassured that everything was going to work out in the end, or needed all the dots explicitly connected?&#34;...which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end....And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.

It keeps you interested throughout the whole story of Bilbo Baggins travels and problems. Tolkien is very descriptive in his story telling and when you are reading it almost feels like you are right there with Bilbo and his companions.This is a great tale of how Bilbo Baggins is a little, fat hobbit from the little Shire village. Everything is green and bright in the Shire with houses carved into hills with round doors and gardens surrounding every house. Bilbo is minding his business when some unexpected people who are dwarves lead by a wizard named Gandalf.The dwarves convinced Bilbo to come along with them on their great quest to kill Smog the might dragon that has been terrorizing their home for quite some time. Soon on their journey Bilbo has to face the dragon by himself to save the whole country that the dwarves live in.In this tale of good and evil Bilbo comes into battle with many strange creatures from HUGE spiders, and angry demented wolves. If you are one for adventure and fighting, this book is cram packed with tales that will keep your nose in the book from the first page to the last adventure home."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a well-off, quiet little halfling (a Hobbit) who'd never wanted any adventures in his life, and of how he became the reluctant participant in a perilous treasure hunt.It all began one afternoon, when Gandalf the wizard came knocking at the round door of his cosy Hobbit Hole. The next morning, thirteen dwarves were crowding his living-room and enrolling him to steal the gold guarded under the lonely Mountain by Smaug, the last of the great dragons.So off he went, through forests old and mountains cold, deceiving trolls, solving riddles in the dark, escaping from goblins and elves, and most of the time rescuing the dwarves from the many perils he himself inadvertenly put them in, thanks to a magical ring he found in Gollum's cave, a ring that has to power to render him invisible.This was the second time I read The Hobbit, and looking at it now with the critical eye of the (amateur) reviewer, I'm afraid to admit I was somewhat annoyed at the beginning by Tolkien's paternalistic tone, by how he sometimes addresses the reader and makes references to the real world, or hints at what's coming up later in the story. This makes the book seem clearly targeted to a young audience, and indeed, The Hobbit would be perfect for reading aloud to a child. However, this tone changes in the course of the story, and especially during the final Battle of the Five Armies, where it reaches a more epic scope, more suitable for young adults. Mark you, I'm not saying I didn't like it, but was just slightliy disappointed not to enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Oh, the heresy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the best The Hobbit book I could find. I t contains a lot of great extra information and drawings, plus the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This item is both for collector and non collectors of JRR Tolkien's pieces. It's a valuable addition to all my JRR pieces"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a must have for Tolkien lovers (do I dare use the work Geek!). Beautiful pictures and drawing. Loads of info. Answers all your questions and adds tons to your trivia as well as concrete knowledge of the Hobbit and Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's been over twenty years since I last read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; I wonder why I've waited so long. Although written originally for children, J. R. R. Tolkien's epic tale of the quest undertaken by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, and thirteen dwarves is an enchanting saga which should interest adults too. It's a fascinating, often gripping, tale, recounting Bilbo's adventures as he and his companions confront trolls, goblins, giant spiders and unfriendly elves before battling the great dragon Smaug. Bilbo's discovery of the One Ring of Power and his fateful encounter with Gollum is merely a minor aspect of this tale. Fans of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as well as those interested in reading a great work of fantasy shall not be disappointed with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful book full of rich characters set in a time and place that never existed...or did it? The characters in it are so real with good and bad traits that we can all identify with. There's always an air of mystery, of something that is just beyond our sight and more than it appears.I don't rate this as highly as The Lord of the Rings trilogy because it's written to a younger audience. But it is still a wonderful tale told well that anyone can read. I just prefer the depth of the other set.All of the bad reviews I've read of this book have been from video game players who have the attention span of a memory chip. Wake up, o sleeper and partake of a real adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book when I was about 9 or 10. Up until that time, even though I was a good reader, I didn't particularly enjoy it. Tolkien showed me just how powerful literature could be, and I haven't stopped reading since.What I enjoyed the most about this book was the well developed, three dimensional characters. I could almost picture them in my mind. Tolkein had a gift for creating imagery that is beautiful and realistic. His use of language totally enraptured me and kept me engrossed in the story.What's really neat about this book, as well, is that I think it will have as much appeal to girls as it does to boys. That has not been the case in other fantasy-type books I've read. In fact, this novel is really the only one of it's genre that I've ever enjoyed. So, don't be put off if you think you don't like fantasy. I would also note that there is an abridged version with illustrations that younger children (I saw a grade one class sit totally still as their teacher read from it to them) will likely enjoy. Despite being pegged by some as a &quot;kid's book&quot;, however, this book is actually one that will appeal to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My 11-year-old daughter liked this performance. She and I listened to it together once a week over a month or so. The actor's performance is very good. The elements of the story are terrific--it's quite an adventure that Bilbo goes on. The prose itself is rather plodding, I thought, especially since we just finished the Harry Potter books. At times, Tolkien's narrative reads like a legal brief. But overall, it was mostly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a very good book, I've read it more than once, the first time was when I was 10 and although I found it quite hard to understand I still found it a very magical and interesting book.You have to buy this"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Through the use of voices the Hobbit comes to life.

It takes it's righteous place amongst the best books I have read. I am glad I decided to read it before the movie came out and now with I would have done the same for the Lord of the Rings.

It's filled with mystery, suspence, action and adventuer. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien was published on September 21st of 1937. It is the success of this book that paved the way for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Hobbit\\" is definitely geared towards younger readers, and it received favorable reviews from papers in the U.K. and the U.S., and it was nominated for the Carnegie Medal, as well as the New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Award in 1938.\\"The Hobbit\\" is often over-shadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and this is especially true when one treats \\"The Hobbit\\" as the prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". To consider it as such is both fair and unfair. It is fair, because clearly the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" took place prior to, and are key to the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and of course there are common characters in both stories. However, it is also not fair in that \\"The Hobbit\\" clearly was written for a younger audience, and even when reading one of the revised editions, where some passages were altered to better fit with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", the overall tone of the work is much lighter. There was a brief attempt by Tolkien to rewrite \\"The Hobbit\\" in the same style, but he soon gave it up because it destroyed what was so good about the original. As a result, it would be better to consider \\"The Hobbit\\" as the children's telling of the events which took place prior to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and not attempt to hold it to the same standard.Another thing that people have noted about the two stories is that at a high-level outline the two stories are very similar. The adventures both start in the Shire and are initiated by Gandolf, they travel to Rivendell, they go through caves and have to deal with the goblins/orcs therein, they meet elves on the other side, there is a huge war between numerous armies, and of course they return to the Shire to find things changed that they have to put right. Of course, that is an overly simple way to look at either of the two novels, especially \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", even though it is true on the surface, but it is an interesting observation.As beings that are roughly half the height of a man, Hobbits make an ideal hero for a children's story, as it gives them a hero with whom they can identify. The story has a fair amount of humor in it, and a light-hearted feel through most of it, though certainly as an adventure there is a fair amount of peril, whether from the trolls, worgs (wolves), goblins, spiders, and even the wood elves, not to mention the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Despite being accessible to younger readers, older readers can still enjoy \\"The Hobbit\\" as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are into hardcore, realistic, real-life stories perhaps you should check out the non-fiction section. However, if you enjoy letting your mind go on a mystical adventure, with no concern for reality this is the book for you. This tells the story of a peaceful, passive young hobbit who, by fate, embarks on a journey with some dwarves who wish to regain their stollen treasure. Tolkien's writing pulls the reader into the story, as he describes the mountains, you actually feel as though you are carefully making your way through the steep, violent mountains. Once again if you are looking to escape reality, and find pure enjoyment and adventure read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a must read for any book lover, especially anyone who also shows an interest in fantasy type worlds. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who loves to live on his own in his own home, goes on an adventure with 13 dwarves across the lands to the misty mountains to claim gold from a dragon named Smaug. Through the journey he and his group encounters things from goblins to trolls to giants, and eventually lives through the epic battle of the five armies. One of the best books ever written, and a great prequel to the extraordinary Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great!

It took me a year to finish each of them and I didn't like either of them. Then one day, I was doing some web surfing at Apple Computer's QuickTime web site and saw a banner for The Lord of the Rings movie preview. I clicked it and saw the preview. When it ended, the only word that came to my mind was awesome. I then thought, &quot;Well if they are spending all this time and money on bring J.R.R. Tolkien's story to life, then hell the least I can do is read the books!&quot; I then picked up my brother's copy of The Hobbit (he has been reading The Lord of the Rings and the works of Tolkien for a year and half).I read the whole book in just two weeks! I couldn't put it down. One night I was having a hard time sleeping, so I got up at three in morning just to read The Hobbit.

A mixture of fantasy and action, Tolkien wrote this book perfectly. For all of the people out there that thought this book was a failure because it was too hard to read, tellin you, It was my favorite in 4th grade. And if you think it was hard to keep up with the characters, you really need to reread it again. This book is about a Hobbit who goes off on an adventure with 13 dwarfs and a Wizard, and faces many challenges through the way, including wolves, goblins, spiders, elves, men, and a huge dragon. It is the best book in the world, and you should read it. Stop reading this review and READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a true classic book despite what people say. Anyone who could possibly hate this book even a tiny bit doesn't know how to enjoy classic and well written literature. I'm 13 and have read books by most of the classic authors including hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;; George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;; Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;;Kafka's &quot;Amerika&quot;; and Homer's &quot;Illiad&quot; and &quot;odessy&quot;. These classic books are the greatest of our time, but J.R.R Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy&quot; are defidently better than all of these. If a person could give anything worse than a 4 star they are ignorant, fools that don't know the difference between &quot;The Cat In The Hat&quot; and the great writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a 4 star rating is worse than what this book deserves. If I could, I would give this book 6 stars. I dedicate this review to the people who would dare to insult this piece of art by giving it a rating below 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In this book, J.R.R. Tolkien keeps the story flowing so thereis rarely a dull moment.Most book readers like the flow of actionthat this book provides. Teenagers can relate tothis book because Bilbo was just about forced to go on the adventure and he had no ideawhat he was getting into. The only flaws of this novel include a slow beginning and a lotof characters to remember, although it isn't too hard to remember all of them. The novelis well written overall. This book is adventurous, while allowing you know to it isfiction. In conclusion, I think The Hobbit is a good example of what J.R.R. Tolkien canwrite, but why stop there. There are similar books to this one, also written by J.R.R.Tolkien, that include The Two Towers and The Return of the King.

I read this to my eight year old daughter, and she loved it. Now we've moved on to the trilogy. I can't imagine starting there. It starts too slow, is too pensive and descriptive at times - these are features that a fan will forgive, but for an initiate, these can be motivation killers. I got my daughter hooked through the Hobbit, and her interest has endured. We're into Two Towers now. The Hobbit moves at a quick pace, and is light-hearted enough to entertain younger readers. It is utterly lacking in a romantic angle, but this is more than made up for by the themes of friendship and homely virtue.

In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is a great prequel to the lord of the rings.

I was ten years old and it took me an entire summer to read. This was a time when we (my family and I) didn't have a VCR, cable TV or home computer, and I spent a great deal of time reading. Now, I'm definitely not the type of person who curses any of those modern technological wonders (especially since I consider myself a tech-junkie), but it's taken me many years to realize how fortunate I was to discover them later in life.The Hobbit was a milestone in my life, something many avid readers will be able to appreciate. It became the standard by which all other books would be compared for years to come, and made all those Hardy Boys books I'd been reading forever obsolete. It's the first book I can remember reading where I was actually transported to another world, an alien world so full of magic and color that my own seemed drab in comparison. It was also the first time I can remember feeling true regret after I'd finished reading it, because I knew there would never be another \\"first time\\". Granted I was only ten, and there would be bigger fish to fry in the years to come, including bigger and better books, relatively speaking, but at the time I thought I had reached some sort of literary Nirvana.I remember watching the animated movie after we got our first VCR and how it became a household staple for years. It hasn't aged very well, but when I was a kid I must have watched it a thousand times (amazing how kids can do that). When we went on vacation I'd listen to the radio-dramatization over and over again on those long road trips. I kept those tapes all the way into my teenage years until that fateful day they had played themselves out completely. I remember a cheesy old Gandalf shirt my uncle gave me and how devastated I was when I burned a hole in playing with fireworks. Ok, you don't want to hear my life story, but I'm just trying to illustrate how this book became something completely inseparable from my childhood.Strangely enough, I didn't read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy until I was an adult, for obvious reasons. The Rings books are far darker and more complex than the Hobbit. I loved them when I finally did read them, of course. Now that the movies have arrived, interest in the books, and especially \\"The Hobbit\\" which provides needed back-story has risen, and all the books are selling like crazy. Good. These are some of the best books ever written and deserve to be appreciated in their true form as much as possible. It's one of those few books which have the perfect blend of story, language and theme. It's probably one of the most perfect books ever written and will always be a personal favorite to re-read no matter how old I get.Do yourself a favor, turn off the VCR, log off of the internet, and read this book. If you have kids, buy it for them, or read it to them; something every parent should do. Good stories never go out of style, and this is one of the greatest books ever written for anyone of any age. Read it once or read it a hundred times. There's never a \\"first time\\" again, but the trip to that magical world never fails to satisfy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My first memory of my father is him reading me the first page &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when I was a small boy.

Finally, I decided to buy this handsome collector's edition, bound in green leather, slip-cased and containing JRRT's full color and two tone illustrations.The high quality book -- the paper it's printed on is THICK -- and illustrations just add to the story, and make it easy to slip into the fantasy world he's created.Not cheap, but definitely worth it for lovers of hobbits and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As far as books on tape go, this is one of the best I've come across. My parents bought it for me fifteen years ago, and I still pull out this 6 hour set or the twelve hour Lord of the Rings series when I'm driving cross-country.The Mind's Eye dramatizes JRR Tolkein's books with a full cast (there are a few people who voice multiple characters), and the voices from The Hobbit appear again in The Lord of the Rings. And because The Hobbit includes six hours of tape, it gets pretty much the whole story.This is well worth your money"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; can only be called the necessary beginning to what many believe is the best fantasy tale ever written. Although it was written as primarily a children's book, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; provides people of all ages a wonderful chance to explore Tolkien's world. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is not considered to be a part of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series, but is a book that simply must be read before starting LOTR.In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; we learn of Bilbo Baggins and his adventures with a group of dwarves and a wise wizard. Each chapter builds on the last, and the book is nearly impossible to put down once began. Even after several reads, one can find new surprises and joys when least expected. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; also is more humorous than most might think. It is a pleasure to read and you will find yourself laughing out loud in every chapter.Indeed, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; remains even today at the top of the mountain when compared to other fantasy books. Although there are hundreds of books about the Lord of the Rings and middle earth, none should be read before this one. It is the beginning, if you let it, to hours and days of enjoyment with all the Tolkien works."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations. The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed. Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the &quot;adventure&quot; which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.But Tolkien rarely disappoints. Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic. As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied. At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: &quot;My dear Bilbo! Something is the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were.&quot; Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure. As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed. My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished. I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it. Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person. His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory. This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable. And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.What's more, you can go &quot;there and back again&quot; again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off. For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf. Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Through the use of similar language, this book combines the feel of the original with the fun of a graphic novel.

Moments of Great highs and of Great lows, great plot...just a great read for all"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Truly a book for the ages. A wizard with words, JRR. Tolkien weaves an enchanting story of the quest undertaken by 13 dwarves led by Gandalf the Grey and a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.When we first start this tale, we see a hobbit outside of his hobbit hole, smoking his pipe, and blowing smoke rings. Gandalf the Wizard comes by asking if Bilbo was interested in a quest filled with intrigue and treasure. Being the respectable Hobbit he is, he declines and instead invites Gandalf to tea the next day.This is how the greatest fantasy book of all time starts. Not just a book for children, I myself am 14 currently, and have read this book 5 times. It is a tale that leads you through an exciting quest filled with adventure and mystery with the reward of insurmountable wealth at the end, if they complete the quest at all.If you are looking for a book that will keep you entwined for the rest of your life, pick up a copy of the Hobbit, or any of Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was grappling! It made me feel like I was the main charecter. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit Who meets Gandalf the wizard, who takes Bilbo and a group of dwarfs on a adventure to reclaim the dwarfs' lost treasure and kill the beast that killed almost all the dwarfs in the castle that it took over. This book is for someone 7+ years old and likes magic, elves, goblins, etc., etc,. etc."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is must for any person that loves a good imaginative story. It is my favorite book and I'm only 10! When you first start to read it it might seem just like an ordinary fantasy novel, but it isn't. J. R. R. Tolkien spent a lifetime working on Middle-Earth. It is filled with songs and poems that help the flow of the story. Don't expect sing alongs some of them are in a different language that isn't used by humans on earth. As you read the story you realize how much meaning the little hobbit really has. You also realize that there are so many things that happened before that particular story. Even when some people tell their own name you can tell that they are the sonn or daughter of an important person long ago. No one should miss out on such an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I collect editions of Tolkien's work, and received this one from my wife for my birthday. A wonderfully interesting twist on a classic! It is done &quot;comic style&quot;, with balloon dialog through out, but the story editing was done very well, and the illustration is absolutely beautiful. It really is a must have for any Tolkien fan, and a nice departure from the many hardcover and paperback editions you probably already have. It would be an excellent introduction to Tolkien's world for younger readers as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i am 14 years old. When my mom bought this book for my little sister so that she could read it to her, i scoffed. I said, &quot;thats a dork book&quot;. I then went and did my best nerd voice saying &quot;yo d&amp;d is shhweet. (heh) But, a few days ago, I picked this book up. As I read it I found myself not being able to stop reading. It was an amazing book. To anyone who thinks that this book is for dorks or geeks like I did, &quot;you are sadly mistaken&quot;. It is fun to read unlike most books. To me, this is &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; of fantasy books. I am only too glad that I decided to humor my mom by reading this amazing book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As an adult, I went back reread this little guy. I was blown away! The language is incredible. Clearly, Tolkien is one of the most gifted writers of the century."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. So, for those who haven't had the pleasure yet, I recommend that you find a copy and sit down with this book, and lose yourself in Tolkien's world. The story is of a &quot;hobbit&quot; who is drawn into a quest by a great wizard, and all that happens along the way. Such a wonderful story, set in a dark and wonderful world. Required reading for any book lover or anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After years of my friends bugging me to read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings I finally took their advice. The Hobbit is one of the best books I have ever read. I liked it so much I read it twice. The second time was more enjoyable then the first. I currently own it in paperback but I plan on purchasing a hard copy and reading it again.I suggest reading it immediately. If I only would have listened to my friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings Trilogy are books that simply grab your imagination. I first picked them up my freshman year in highschool and I haven't been able to put them down since. I have read all of them 5 times at least, and each time they seem to get more magical. Tolkien, like no other writer, is able to take the reader and actually put them into his book. His writing is full of detail, and the vividness of the scenes he paints grabs the readers attention and doesn't let go. It is by far the greatest literary work of the 20th century, and in my opinion the greatest ever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is quite simply, wonderful. It can stand on its own as a self contained story, but when read in conjunction with the Lord of the Rings, it's deceptive simplicity suddenly falls away. Many people have said you don't need to read this in order to enjoy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and this is true. However, you are cheating yourself if you don't. Many major and key players from LOTR are introduced here, not to mention the extremely important moment when Bilbo Baggins finds a lost ring in the caves under the mountain. This story is less than 100 years old, yet it resonates and feels like Tolkien was basically rewriting old myths. The argument for this can indeed come from some of the source materials that Tolkien used, but as far as I can see, the story is wholly original. It's wonderful that in the age when everything was modern and sleek, Tolkien gifted the world with this age old story. This book may have been written for kids, but I have noticed that many more adults seem to enjoy it than children. It may be Tolkien's overly descriptive language can turn kids off, but this book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this book after seeing the movie because I didn't want to wait to see how the story ends, and I didn't feel like digging out my paperback copy. And to be honest, I haven't read many books recently so I was kind of worried it would be like the last two books I tried to read and id lose interest even though I know it's a good story ahead of time.I couldn't have been more wrong."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read the book before you see the movie. JRRT is a great story teller and you will love reading this one!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is certainly a classic. It should be required reading in school. A must read for every human on the face of the earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was brilliant and the only reason that it didn't get five stars from me was the use of too much music for my taste. It seemed that in every chapter there was someone singing something and the song was written out. I believe I could have done without most of that."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read it after seeing the movie, thinking I had already read the book as a youth. After seeing the movie, I realized that I hadn't read the book so I uploaded it on my kindle. My timing was perfect.

Loads of action and a great escape from reality"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"to reread the history more than 15 years lates was still as exciting as it was back then. recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I initially purchased the hobbit in paperback after watching the Fellowship of the Ring. The initial movie in The LOTR trilogy spurred me to read the entirety of the hobbit and LOTR from beginning to end before the cinematic release of The Two Towers. I've since reread the series multiple times and as a result wanted a book that better represented how much I enjoyed the books than the cheap Walmart paperbacks I initially picked up. This was well worth the price to pay homage to this important series that has influenced so much sci-fi/fantasy, as well as other venues of pop culture."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Couldn't have wished for a better read...this book never gets old and I would recommend it to anyone.

Tolkien, 1.The fellowship of the ring 2.The two towers and 3.The return of the king. hope you like it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book written for all ages to read. It is filled with a multitude of characters; from short, plum hobbits, to gigantic, black spiders. There are adventures at every turn, and encounters with unexpected, and un-invited visitors. I enjoyed every venture in the book; from the songs of the dwarves, to the battle of five armies.One especially strong part of the book was how easy it is to read. The chapters are so interesting; it's not hard to follow the story at all. An example of a remarkable event is one minute Bilbo is fighting off huge, hairy spiders, and the next, he is sneaking into an Elf village ( page 157-172). The exciting events flow so well to one another, it was hard for me to put the book down. Another reason The Hobbit is so easy to read is the fascinating storyline and characters. The whole story revolves around a collection of bizarre characters; hobbits, dwarves, wizards, elves, and their adventure to find and slay a dragon. Their party is faced with many other terrifying villains before the dragon too. Like when they stumble upon the goblins' caves unexpectedly; they are brought to the Goblin King, who is huge, ugly, cruel and shows no mercy. Sections like that are definitely page turners. The flowing plots, storyline and characters are just a few of the many reasons to read The Hobbit, but there are many more too good to give away!I would definitely recommend this book to others, for many more than the basis I've acknowledged before. One big reason I recommend this book is that it isn't written to just one age group. Any age can enjoy following a mere hobbit Bilbo, outwit Gollum (page 80), or sneak up on a treacherous dragon's lair (page 211). A seven year old or a twenty seven year old can find pleasure in reading of courageous tales like that. And although anyone can enjoy The Hobbit, one thing that can help a great deal in reading this book, is good imagination. Imagination is needed in certain places, like when a character like Gollum is described, or when reading what the Misty Mountains look like in the sunset. So if you cant imagine or don't believe in what you're reading, it spoils the book. There are lots of mysterious, unbelievable events that take place in this book, that any-aged person with a good imagination can take pleasure in.In my opinion, this book is a classic, and of its own time. From short, bearded dwarves, to gigantic, jewel-covered dragons, the book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure, and is a definite page turner. If anyone's looking for an enticing book that no on will want to put down, The Hobbit is the choice by far."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Unfortunately I never this book as a kid, or in school; but in a way I am glad that I didn't. I think that I can appreciate it more now that I am older. I'm 26 and this is the first time I've read this wonderful novel. I did get to see 'Lord of the Rings' before reading it, but it only helped to enhance my imagination and awe of the world that Tolkien has created. It's too bad that they didn't make this one into a full motion film; I would love to have seen the \\"Battle of Five Armies\\" on the big screen.I've also purchased the collectors edition of 'Lord of the Rings' and I plan to read that next!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story &quot; The Hobbit&quot; is written by John R. R. Tolkien. It is about a small hobbit who lives in a small hole.Oneday Gandalf, a magician, and 12 gnomes leave Hobbingen, the village where they live, to have a big adventure.You get information about orks and big spiders which are in a forest and fight against Bilbo and his friends. But Bilbo ownes a special ring. If he puts the ring on his finger, he becomes ...I don't want to say to much about this fantastic book.

I was wrong! It was better than the Harry Potter books I think. It is really interesting! I want to start reading the other books in the series soon. I think the hardest part about reading this book is keeping the names straight. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had a hard time coming up with all these names! There is a lot of fighting in this book. I would suggest this book to readers who like challenging books and for readers who like fantasy and wars. This book is long, but never boring!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was brought up to me just before the Lord of the Rings came out. I have heard about it before dating back to my childhood and I have never really been interested in it's sort. I hated fantasy to be frank, but I decided to pickup the book and give it a whirl, I was hooked, if you don't want to spend money buying 12 or 13 books about Middle earth, don't read this book because it sparks imagination even adults can relate to, and it is hard to put down because Mr. Tolkien leads you with a carrot, and keeps it in front of your face and only lets you nibble through the whole journey, and by the time you are done you have eaten the carrot, and fallen in love with the book. I recommend this book even if you have seen the movie because it gives some good background, but it is just one of the most intertaining books that I have read in a long time! I got hooked, and I am willing to bet that it just might hook you too!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting. When I started to read the book I learned that this was true. I also started reading this book because I heard the name Hobbit in a movie commercial for the lord of the rings. I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.The main character is Bilbo Baggins. This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Some of my favorite novels of all times are fantasy novels I love the rich imagination that comes with them. Amongst these wonderful fantasy tales is the novel The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.Unlike several of Tolkienfs other books The Hobbit is much easier to get through. It is the kind of book I would recommend to any age and every generation.I would also recommend this book because it is an opener to The Lord of the Rings. The movie to that particular novel has inspired many people to read the book and The Hobbit is a story related to that. I would recommend this book if you plan on read The Lord of the Rings or if you already have.I myself enjoyed The Hobbit and by writing this review I hope to get others to read it as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a fast pasted book. It was really exciting with many magical things that happen on the way. I thought it was the best book i have read so far. I liked it so much i bought the rest of the set. It was a very good book and i am looking foward to reading the rest of the series. The was by far the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a story written by J.J.R. Toliken and it is a fantasy and classical book. But please read even it is Classic because it is humorous and fun to watch the little hobbit named Bilbo going around and making funs. Also this story is very simple worded and i sure could tell you that by just reading the first twenty pages. This book will make you turn pages and pages. It's fascinating and it's a part of the British literature. You will also find that this book is not the same as the other book because J.J.R Toliken had made such careful and intensive on this book, he created one whole new world with language, culture, calenders, etc. I am sure that it will help you because it have given such great influence about different methaphors. (p.s. this story has many poems and there are few old british words that are not found today)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a masterpice in letters. The pictures are very well detailed and are amazing to look at. J.R.R. Tolkien has written many books but this one is by far the best."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think this was a very good book. If you like a fantasy book with lots of action and a good cast of characters you should get this book.RJ"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book simply excelent. Excelent Master Excelent Illustration Excelent Paper Excelent Book for Gift for children and adults :-)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was an amazing story start to finish. It is about a hobbit, a short hairy being, who goes on an adventure with a group of dwarves. It is a fairly long book and takes alot of time if you are not used to reading something this long."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book had a good story line and plot, but it was hard to undderstand because it was written mostly in Old English. The best part was the part with Gollum in it. Read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; after it to make it complete."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"fdagggfeehyer t utryj6rty5ru6t td dty hd y6ty gh t hth thd thd yh ytytj tyyh hfghf h gfxhn hgf ghf hgjf yj bn nb nb hn nb."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is neither a bad book nor a particularly great book. Everyone I have ever met who rabidly endorses the works of Tolkien invariably turns out to have read nothing else in the field of sword and sorcery literature. If you enjoy Tolkein's books, then well and good--but if, like me, you find his works tedious and actually rather trite, then I heartily recommend to you the novels of Michael Moorcock and Fritz Leiber."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I did not like it too much. It was a book I could handle. It was kind of hard to understand. I didn't find gnomes fighting a dragon too interesting, but it was written well. That is why I gave it 2 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With the new release of the film and because I revisit the Lord Of The Rings books each year I wanted to revisit The Hobbit. It's been a favourite of mine since I was a little girl. We actually read it at school as one of our \\"book list\\" books.The story of Bilbo Baggins is an exciting one. Hobbits don't usually leave the Shire but as Thorin and his dwarves along with Gandalf turn up on Bilbo's door he is encouraged to take an adventure with them. From the minute the book starts I was pulled into the story and found it hard to put the book down.The way Tolkein writes is pure genius. He paints a picture with his writing and Middle Earth, possibly thanks to the films, was so easy to picture. The characters are very easy to like or hate depending on how Tolkein intended them. Bilbo, the hero of the story, is someone that stays with you when you aren't reading and I found myself wanting to read more and find out what was happening.I think it is fair to say that since childhood the books have always been quoted as amongst my favourites. The Hobbit was one of the very first books that made me fall in love with fantasy and even now, 20...... years after my first reading I loved the story as much as I did when I first discovered it. It will stay in my heart probably until the end of my days.If you haven't read the book yet I would highly recommend it to you. If you don't fall in love with Middle Earth like I have I would be highly surprised.\\"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\"I give The Hobbit 5/5."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed listening to &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. It felt like I was listening to J.R.R. himself. The only objection I had was that the narrator sang the songs! I would have preferred him to read them as poetry rather than sing them. Unless Tolkien had provided the music to go with the words, I think it's better to let the reader/listener imagine the tune. Other than that, I recommend the book whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was all I was hoping for and one of the best books I ever read I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a fantastic fantasy story. Anyone on the fence about this book please allow me to give you a push in the right direction"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Good book. I enjoyed most of it. I thought it would be or should have been more epic in its telling."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With the movie just coming out I decided I better read the book before I see it in a theater. I was very glad I did. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easier reading than I expected, and it was really fun. I loved the adventure, I loved the imagery that was painted in my mind. I loved the themes found throughout the book. Definitely a must read for anyone whole like fantasy/fiction novels!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was fascinating and charming. I was surprised how easy (and more interesting) it was to read compared to Lord of the rings.
